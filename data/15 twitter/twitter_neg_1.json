      "text": "Twitter entertains offers to keep Vine video service alive By Monday, November 07, 2016, 06:21 pm PT (09:21 pm ET) Twitter's recently announced execution of video sharing service Vine might be stayed, as the microblogging giant is reportedly fielding bids from potential buyers interested in keeping the niche app alive. According to TechCrunch , Twitter is vetting multiple term sheets from parties who have shown an interest in buying Vine, and has whittled down the candidate pool from more than ten to around five serious contenders. Sources familiar with ongoing takeover talks claim some offers are coming in at below $10 million, much less than the $30 million Twitter initially paid for the video sharing startup. A New York Times report in October said Vine cost Twitter about $10 million a month in infrastructure and employee costs. TechCrunch speculates Twitter might still profit from a Vine sale through sponsored content deals arranged by Niche, a social marketing startup the firm purchased in 2015, as well as possible Vine-infused ad buys. Twitter announced intent to shutter Vine \"in the coming months\" during an investor conference call on Oct. 27 . The microblogging service is looking for ways to cut costs amid bleak growth forecasts, measures that include laying off some 350 people. Beyond Vine, Twitter itself was seeking a suitor over the past few months , with reports placing the likes of Disney and Salesforce at the center of acquisition discussions. More recently, however, those big-name corporations signaled Twitter is no longer a target of interest, effectively damping takeover buzz. Topics:",

      "text": "Hacking collective Anonymous took credit for a Twitter outage early Monday, just weeks after the same group claimed responsibility for a massive disruption that disabled a swath of sites across the Web.\nTwitter was rendered inoperable for approximately 30 minutes, during which it was impossible to use the messaging service both online and on mobile devices. New World Hackers, the Anonymous sect that claimed responsibility for an attack on New Hampshire-based Internet firm Dyn in October, also claimed responsibility for the latest outage, saying in a message to the Washington Examiner , \"Twitter outage was us.\"\nTwitter did not reply to a request for comment. In a public message on Twitter, the group claimed it created the outage by using a distributed denial-of-service attack. Such DDoS assaults, which work by surreptitiously infecting thousands of individual devices and using them to redirect online traffic, are commonly used to crash servers for major online services.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2605622 Stay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup. Please try again later. Processing... Thank you for signing up for Washington Examiner News Alerts. You should receive your first alert soon! New World Hackers, which describes itself as a group based in Russia and contends it is generally at odds with both the United States and Russian government, said it was motivated to engage in the attack by a separate DDoS attack that temporarily disabled secret-leaking website WikiLeaks.\n\"Someone attacked WikiLeaks supposedly and it must have been people again WikiLeaks, I won't state exactly who. We shot Twitter down and kind of got them to stop, but then they moved to WikiLeaks email servers and started DDoSing there,\" the group said. \"Our motive is just to warn as of today to stop messing with WikiLeaks just because they leak something that should be exposed.\"\nThe organization has been active in this year's political cycle. In earlier messages to the Examiner , the group contended the Russian government had obtained \"access to the U.S election\" by using platforms connected to Twitter. \"They hacked into multiple websites that allow people to sign into Twitter to login/register. If you sign in, your information will be instantly logged,\" the group said. That claim has not been independently verified.\nThe FBI and Department of Homeland Security said in October that they were investigating \"all potential causes\" for the attack on Dyn, which disabled not only Twitter but also services such as PayPal, Spotify and NetFlix.\nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper said after the announcement that \"non-state actors\" were likely behind the attack, but said he did not want to be \"conclusively definitive\" in the statement.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Man sporting face mask, gun near White House detained The arrest affidavit stated the suspect fought officers during the encounter.\nBy Anna Giaritelli • 11/07/16 9:31 PM Top  ",

      "text": "Twitter might sell Vine instead of killing it (TWTR) Published by Business Insider on Tue, 08 Nov 2016 Don't say goodbye to Vine just yet.The death sentence that parent company Twitter recently announced for Vine, a service for sharing short video clips online, may be liftedmuch to the relief of Vine's loyal base of dedicated users. Twitter is now in talks with several potential buyers for the service, according to a TechCrunch report.Twitter, which is undergoing its own challenges and recently announced plans to lay off 9% of its staff, said in October that it was pulling the plug on the three-year old Vine service. Twitter said that Vine would be shut down in the coming months.The news of the shutdown upset many of Vine's users, who criticized Twitter for eliminating a vital tool of self-expression that many youths and minorities relied on, and who fretted that the rich archive of Vine video clips would be lost forever.Twitter is currently looking over several offers from companies interested in acquiring Vine, TechCrunch said, citing anonymous sources. While TechCrunch said it could not obtain the names of any of the interested parties, it noted that Japanese messaging service Line has been \"rumored\" to be interested. Some of the offers are for under $10 million, TechCrunch reported.All of this begs the question of why Twitter didn't put Vine up for sale in the first place.It's possible that Twitter simply didn't think the price it could obtain was worth the effort (which seems reasonable if the reported sub-$10 million price is accurate). Now that users are upset and companies are knocking on the door, Twitter may simply be reconsidering.Twitter declined tocomment.SEE ALSO:Twitter is shutting down VineJoin the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: This Lego-style home can be built in a few weeks with just a screwdriver",

A number of the interested parties are reportedly from Asia, though the only name mentioned thus far has been Japanese messaging giant Line.\nMore: Giphy is letting you import your Vine accounts and convert your videos into GIFs\nConsidering Vine is lacking both influential creators (who have migrated to YouTube, Facebook , and Snapchat), the actual bids being put forward are less than remarkable for a platform that once boasted 100 million monthly users. One source close to the matter claims some of the offers are for less than $10 million.\nRumors regarding a Vine sale have been circulating for months, with The New York Times previously claiming that Twitter was looking to wash its hands of the costly platform, which was setting it back $10 million just to keep it running.\nLike Periscope, Vine boasts a number of integration features with Twitter’s flagship site, such as auto-playing videos on the Twitter timeline. Consequently, Twitter could potentially build additional revenue from a sale using monetization options, such as ad sales.\nDespite its demise, Twitter promised that Vine videos would be archived and available to view online — the app itself is due to shut down in the coming months. Members will also have the option to download their Vines courtesy of an exporting mechanism the company is currently building.\nIt seems it was the outpouring of love online for the platform that sparked the bidding process. Shortly after the news broke of its death, the internet (in particular Twitter) was flooded with odes to the service as users reminisced about its glory days by sharing their favorite Vines. This latest report gives fans some hope for the future of the platform.\nIt must be noted, however, that an acquisition could also end up radically altering the service and Twitter’s plans for its preservation. Ultimately, Vine may end up surviving, but not as we know it.\nGiphy is letting you import your Vine accounts and convert your videos into Gifs Twitter takeover roundup: Who’s interested in acquiring the social media giant? Google and Salesforce are reportedly interested in acquiring Twitter",

      "text": "Social media has been the ultimate water cooler over a long campaign season, and the destination for sharing, discussing and complaining about the latest headlines.\nToday, election day Facebook , Snapchat , and Twitter will play an even larger role as Americans watch the election results play out on their smartphones. This year more than ever, the leading three social apps are pulling out all the stops to show on this high-tension say that they're the place to find and share news. It's competition for mindshare, and valuable ad dollars now and down the line.\nNearly a quarter of American adults said they'd turned to social media posts of Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton for news and information about the election, according to a July study by the Pew Research Center. That number compares to 15 percent who said they got information from the candidates' websites or emails. And the number who learned about the candidates via social media has certainly grown in the past four months.\nGetty Images \"The conversation about the election is happening on Facebook — it's really become the new town hall,\" says Facebook's global politics and outreach director Katie Harbath. \"And the campaigns seeing the greatest success on the platform are those that are really taking advantage of that by reaching out and having an actual, two-way dialogue with voters.\"\nFacebook says it's seen political advertisers in competitive TV marketers shift their ad spending to Facebook due to a lack of remaining TV inventory and Facebook's targeting capability. And this campaign is unusual in that with the presidential race so competitive in the 11th hour, political advertisers have been running fundraising ads until the very last minute.\nAs an example of the social platform's advantage relative to traditional political TV ads, Facebook cites New Hampshire , where there's increased spending on the presidential battleground as well as a competitive Senate race. Most of the state is in the Boston TV market, but buying those TV spots is inefficient because those races targeting New Hampshire viewers are competing for ad time with Massachusetts political contests.\nIn addition to running targeted political ads, Facebook is offering a range of tools to help its users navigate election day. A landing page offers directions to users' polling places , suggests they invite friends to plan to head to the polls together, offering voting requirements and a preview of your ballot.\nSnapchat is similarly embracing the election, with a \"Go Vote\" bitmoji and a new geofilter to remind people to vote. Snapchat's particularly focused on incorporating election day news: Offering a dynamic election results filter through a feed supplied by The Associated Press, similar to dynamic results geofilters used during the primaries and caucuses that were seen by more than 100 million users. In Live Stories, Snapchat will feature election results, acceptance and concession speeches, and the like. And of course there will be election-related geofilters for users to use and share with friends.\nSnapchat is rolling a range of political ads, including its first sponsored lens for a U.S. political campaign. Priorities USA Action, which backs Clinton, is running a nation-wide lens Monday. The Clinton campaign is running a national geofilter with an \"I'm with her\" overlay. Sponsored geofilters typically reach 40 percent to 60 percent of Snapchatters, according to the company. The Trump campaign is also running a national geofilter on election day.\nA wide variety of other candidates are also turning to Snapchat to reach its typically younger users. Interestingly, Senators Grassley and McCain , the two oldest serving senators, are both running Snap Ads. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, did a statewide filter campaign, and just ahead of the election Republican Senator Peter Kinder ran filters in his state of Missouri.\nMeanwhile Twitter is featuring an election day reminder to vote, and offering the option to direct message users information about Senate, federal and local races. (Here's Twitter's look at the election on the platform so far.)\nTwitter reports a large uptick in PAC spending on its platform in the past week, focused on targeting in key swing stages. The company reports focused spending on get-out-the-vote efforts and issue-focused ads looking to persuade voters at the last minute. We'll see if a flood of money boosts Twitter's revenue — or if all this chatter draws more users — in this valuable political season and key fourth quarter for the social platform.",

Now, as election day is finally upon us, the lovable bespectacled mascot of the second presidential debate is being immortalized with his own Twitter emoji. Ken Bone / Twitter \nIn sponsored Twitter Trend #MyVote2016, a sweater-clad Ken Bone icon accompanies everyone's tweets automatically, much like Mr. Bone invaded all of our hearts whether we liked it or not. \nBut what's even more amazing about #MyVote2016 is that it's sponsored by none other than IZOD—the company that makes Bone's now iconic ribbed red sweater. Election Day! Vote and share your voice with #MyVote2016 Message paid for by @IZOD pic.twitter.com/8QhHVmJ7gN — Ken Bone (@kenbone18) November 8, 2016 In fact, Bone has become something of an IZOD poster boy, showing up all over the company's official Twitter account. Twitter But as adorable as all this is, the message is real: Election day is here, and it's time to exercise your civil duty and cast your vote for the future of the country, so get moving!

He’s his own man,\" senior adviser Boris Epshteyn told USA Today in response to a Sunday New York Times report . That report said that Trump's camp took away his access to his Twitter profile. The story was picked up by President Obama when he attended a campaign rally for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton \"Apparently his campaign has taken away his Twitter. In the last two days, they had so little confidence in his self-control they said: 'We’re just going to take away your Twitter,'\"Obama said at a Kissimee, Florida, rally Sunday. \"If somebody can’t handle a Twitter account, they can’t handle the nuclear codes.\" Epstein's remarks are similar to the sentiments of Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, \n\"It's not for me to take away a grown man's Twitter account,\" she told CNN in October. On the \"Today Show\" on Monday , Conway reiterated that the story is \"not true.\" \n",

      "text": "Mutant \"lefty\" snail named Jeremy finally finds a mate – thanks to a Twitter hashtag \nEven snails use online dating By Sarah Fecht  34pm \nAngus Davison/University of Nottingham \nJeremy (bottom) and Lefty getting to know each other. Each is a one-in-a-million mutant with a counter-clockwise shell. \nFinding a soul mate has never been easy, and it's even harder if you're a snail who's a “lefty”. Jeremy the brown garden snail is a rare mutant whose shell spirals counter-clockwise, which makes it basically impossible for him to mate with 99.9999 percent of his compatriots, whose shells spiral clockwise. But thanks to the help of scientists and a hashtag, Jeremy the snail may have just found true love. \nCounter-clockwise spirals only occur in just one snail in a million. Earlier this year, geneticist Angus Davison from the U.K.'s University of Nottingham discovered a gene that determines which way a snail's shell coils. The gene also influences asymmetry in the rest of the snail's body, as well as in other species—including humans. Davison hoped to breed Jeremy to learn more about conditions where major internal organs sometimes grow on the opposite side of the body . \nUnfortunately, since he's a lefty, Jeremy's internal organs and genitalia are reversed, making it impossible for him to mate with more common clockwise snails. Technically, as a hermaphrodite, Jeremy could mate with himself, but Davison decided to play wing man. Mating two counter-clockwise snails would give richer genetic data and make for more interesting science. \nTo find another of these one-in-a-million snails, Davison called on citizen scientists. #Snaillove spread the word on Twitter, and the story got picked on on BBC and several other news outlets. The media attention paid off: Jeremy has been taken to Ipswich to meet Lefty, another counter-clockwise snail. \nLefty's owner will watch over the tryst and see if the two hit it off, keeping an eye out for “love darts,” which a press release describes as “sharp spikes made of calcium which snails stab into each other’s bodies during the process of mating.” How romantic. \nPlus, if sparks don't fly between Jeremy and Lefty, a third potential mate has turned up in Spain. Dang, Jeremy, when did this turn into an episode of the Bachelor ? \nWhichever mate Jeremy ends up with, it's sure to be a one-in-a-trillion pair. And if there's hope for this guy, there's hope for all of us. Tags:",

He was on the active roster the entire season but did not appear in a game. He missed all of training camp and preseason with an injury to his ankle and leg after trying to get into his house after locking himself out.\nA fifth-round pick in 2015 out of Southern Illinois, Pruitt played in all 16 games, with start starts, as a rookie, recording 10 receptions for 89 yards.

His family challenged the decision, to no avail. \nRead more at Foxnews.com→",

      "text": "Published November 08, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) Fresh off their bye week, the New England Patriots returned to the practice field Tuesday and players said they took advantage of the time off to get their bodies ready for the second half of the season.\nThe Patriots, 7-1 after reeling off four wins with Tom Brady back following his ''Deflategate'' suspension, open their second half at home Sunday night against the Seattle Seahawks.\n''It was nice. Much-needed rest, mentally and physically, so hopefully everybody maximized that time, and time to get back to work,'' special teams captain Matthew Slater said before practice. ''Our focus just needs to be as high as it's been all season and worry about preparing for Seattle. It will be one of the best teams that we'll see at any point in the season, so we have to be ready for the challenge.''\nMore from FoxSports HS LB steals handoff, scores awesome game-winning TD 4 reasons why the Green Bay Packers need to keep coach Mike McCarthy | THE HERD FOX Fantasy Podcast: Dion Lewis scheduled to return Skip Bayless puts NFL officials on notice after botched ending to Seahawks/Bills | UNDISPUTED With some of their bumps and bruises healed. This is a healthy team that will have back running back Dion Lewis either this week or Nov. 20 at San Francisco.\nWide receiver Chris Hogan was excited about returning to work.\n''We've got a big game coming up,'' he said. ''Sunday night. It's easy to get excited for something like that, so we'll spend this week preparing ourselves for the game.''\nAdded linebacker Rob Ninkovich: ''It was nice to get a little time to watch some football and spend time with the family. Now it's back to work.''\nThe team traded Pro Bowl linebacker Jamie Collins to Cleveland at the start of the break.\nTo cap off their week, the Patriots got to watch their next opponent play Monday Night Football, giving them a look at two mobile quarterbacks, Tyrod Taylor, whom they just faced in Buffalo, and Seattle's Russell Wilson, who nearly beat them in the Super Bowl two years ago.\n''It's difficult any time you have a guy that's mobile that can make every throw on the field, is very accurate, is a very good quarterback in the pocket and yet when things aren't looking so good he can pull the ball down and try to run for a first down,'' Ninkovich said.\nAsked again about attacking the rest of the season refreshed, the 31-year-old Slater said: ''It's definitely needed. An NFL season is a grind on you physically - especially when they start to add up, when you get a little bit up there, so to speak. That rest is needed. I think we did a good job, from what I've seen, of taking advantage of it. Hopefully it will benefit us down the stretch.''\nNOTES: While the players didn't want to comment on who they were voting for, or on the letter of support Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he received from coach Bill Belichick, Slater made it clear he planned to vote. ''Tonight . after practice,'' he said. ''My mom, my wife . I'm getting a text today to make sure I vote. Too many people . especially as an African-American, in America, too many people have had to sacrifice . and die for me to have the right to vote, so I definitely need to exercise that.'' . Hogan also said he was going to vote and that there wasn't much chatter about it in the locker room. ''The locker room, I don't think, is really a huge place for guys to really talk politics,'' he said. ''There's always a couple of guys in here that will be in here butting heads or something like that.''\n---\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL",

      "title": "Cal Thomas: Call me an 'Ever Trumper' | News",
      "text": "By Cal Thomas \nPublished November 08, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures during a campaign rally at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire, Tuesday, Nov. 1, 2016, in Eau Claire, Wis.(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)  (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) \nAs a former “Never Trump-er,” I have been interested in others who have converted, however reluctantly, if not into Trump supporters, then pragmatic accepters of Trump against Hillary Clinton. Call us ever-Trump-ers.\nAnother such convert is Joel C. Rosenberg, the mystery writer who once worked for the late Rep. Jack Kemp (R-NY) and former Secretary of Education William Bennett, conducted research for Rush Limbaugh, and now writes biblically-themed novels.\nWriting on his blog, Rosenberg gives 10 reasons why he intends to vote for the Trump-Pence ticket. They are mostly about stopping Hillary Clinton and her secular-progressive agenda, which he believes would complete the moral, economic and political destruction of the country. In addition, he writes, “Hillary and her advisers may have committed federal crimes.” A Hillary victory, he believes, guarantees nonstop investigations, possibly leading to indictments, though President Obama could and probably would pardon her of any and all acts committed while she was secretary of state should she win.\nWhile Rosenberg writes he “continues to have deep reservations about Mr. Trump … Hillary Clinton is the poster child for politics as usual at a time when we need change.” Most of the rest of his arguments — from federal judges, to rebuilding the American military, to protecting our borders are familiar. He also thinks Trump’s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence, will soften some of Trump’s sharper edges.\nJerusalem Post columnist Caroline Glick is another person who has reluctantly come around, if not in open support of Trump, then in explaining why he has gained so much favor. She writes: “After eight years of Barack Obama’s White House, America is in a different place than it was in 2008, when Obama ran on a platform of hope and change. Americans today are angry, scared, divided and cynical.”\nGlick correctly notes that Trump represents “the voters’ rebellion against the American establishment — not just the political establishment, but the full spectrum of the American elite. From Washington to Wall Street, from college campuses to the media, tens of millions of Americans believe that their establishment is rotten to the core. And they support Trump because he is running against the establishment.”\nPredictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map → \nThe stakes in Tuesday’s election could not be higher. They are about life for the unborn and elderly, the Constitution, growing the economy and the private-sector jobs that accompany growth, advancement or retreat of the LGBTQ agenda, the strength of our military, terrorism, immigration, a government-run health care system that will inevitably follow the crumbling of Obamacare, restoring respect for the United States abroad and so much more.\nWe Trump converts are not unaware of his many flaws, but none of his flaws come close to the alleged crimes committed by Hillary Clinton and her husband, including “pay for play” activities at the Clinton Foundation, which FBI investigators have been looking into for at least a year.\nWith a President Trump and especially Vice President Mike Pence, America has an opportunity to go in a different direction. Trump has been specific about his promises and if the Congress remains in Republican hands, members can hold him to them.\nMaybe Trump is like the box of chocolates Forrest Gump referred to — we won’t know what we are getting until he becomes president. But we know what we would get with Hillary Clinton as president: more corruption, possible indictments, if not of her then of some of her closest aides, and a continuation of the Obama agenda, which, along with the Republican wing of the establishment, has been the cause of so much citizen angst and anger.\n\nCal Thomas is America's most widely syndicated op-ed columnist. He joined Fox News Channel in 1997 as a political contributor. His latest book is \" What Works: Common Sense Solutions for a Stronger America \" is available in bookstores now.

      "text": "Loading... \nTwitter has announced that it’s shutting down Vine, a popular social media video sharing app with millions of users. \nFor now, the apps and the website are still working, but since Twitter is planning on closing it all down, if you have Vine videos on their servers, you’ll need to download them if you want to keep them. Twitter says it will offer a way to download the videos before shutting down, but if you’d rather go ahead and get them now to make sure, here’s a quick way to do it. \nYou’ll need to open up Vine Video download. Click here to access the site. \nIn another tab on your browser, log in to your vine account. \nClick on a video to select. \nClick the little three-dot menu by your username and choose View Post Page. \nCopy the URL of the video from the address bar. \nPaste the address in the appropriate box on the Vine Video Download page and hit “Go.” \nScroll down and you can see your video. Either press the Download button or right-click the video and choose “Save As.” \nThe video will then appear either in your downloads folder or the folder you chose to save it in. \nSince some folks had built their whole careers around Vine videos, they were understandably crushed to find the service shutting down. But although popular, Vine was never profitable. It’s free to use and has suffered from stiff competition as other platforms like Instagram have added video features.~ c \n~ Cynthia \nTags: apps , saving videos , saving Vine videos , social media , twitter , Vine shutting down This entry was posted on Tuesday, November 8th, 2016 at 11:24 AM and is filed under Android , Digital Photography , iOS , Smartphones , Social Networking .

But it looks like Trump may be back at the wheel, just in time to send some very inaccurate tweets.\n\nTrump has generally tweeted from a Samsung device, while it's been postulated — and forensically tested — that his campaign sends tweets from an iPhone. The tweets from @realDonaldTrump have lately come from an iPhone, but this morning, it switched back over to Android.\n\nTrump apparently tweeted out one characteristically conspiratorial missive:\n\n\n\nJust out according to @CNN: \"Utah officials report voting machine problems across entire country\"\n\n— Donald J.

      "text": "If Lindsay Lohan's Twitter poll is accurate, Hillary Clinton will be president 5:33 p.m. ET \nAnxious Americans have been refreshing FiveThirtyEight , The Upshot , and other websites that analyze the polls, looking for insight into whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States. But what if the answer everyone has been looking for has really been hiding on Lindsay Lohan's Twitter? ❤️Heart for Hillary or retweet for Trump! \n— Lindsay Lohan (@lindsaylohan) November 8, 2016 \nOn Tuesday afternoon, the actress posted a simple tweet: \"Heart for Hillary or retweet for Trump!\" An hour or so later, the tweet was liked 4,617 times and retweeted 398 times, which probably won't make any Clinton fans breathe a sigh of relief, but could be a sign that Lohan is on the path to becoming a professional pollster. Catherine Garcia Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images \nDonald Trump has taken an early lead in the battleground state of Indiana. With less than 1 percent of precincts reporting, Trump is ahead of Hillary Clinton 71.9 percent to 24.4 percent. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson has 3.7 percent. Trump's running mate Mike Pence is the governor of Indiana. Though President Obama won there in 2008 , Indiana is a historically red state. There are 11 electoral votes up for grabs in the Hoosier State. Becca Stanek \nMike Huckabee makes voter fraud joke about 'I Voted' stickers on Susan B. Anthony's tombstone 6:21 p.m. ET \nFormer Arkansas governor and GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee is pointing to a new possible venue for electoral shenanigans: The grave site of the legendary suffragette Susan B. Anthony, to which crowds of people had lined up to pay homage today in anticipation of the possible election of Hillary Clinton as the first woman president. Dems put \"I Voted\" stickers on Susan B. Anthony's tombstone. Dems could put those stickers on LOTS of tombstones. https://t.co/UJNZcrrzSZ \n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) November 8, 2016 \nDonald Trump and his prominent supporters have been promoting rumors that the election would be \"rigged\" against him — including, in The Donald's own words, opinion polls that are \"purposefully wrong,\" and also voting machines that allegedly \"when people vote for Republicans, the entire ticket switches over to Democrats.\" He has also suggested in the past that dead people would vote in great numbers in this election. \nSuch rumors have not been substantiated, beyond stray reports of voting machines that may have malfunctioned and would be replaced promptly.

      "text": "Follow @rawstory \nAnother video being passed around on Twitter has lit the fuse under claims of a “rigged” election, as a voter repeatedly tries – and fails – to vote for Trump. No matter how hard Adonis Bravo (not his real name) pushes, the machine won’t change from a vote for Clinton. this is what I was talking about, they fixed it but it was on some nut shit at first. pic.twitter.com/GO5Y9FCnYN \n— ædonis | hotep (@lordaedonis) November 8, 2016 \nThe video has picked up almost 9,000 retweets after six hours online, and published by a number of blogs and websites as suspicious or as evidence of fraud. But the machine is working exactly as it should. \nPolling stations in Philadelphia, where Bravo filmed the clip, use a Danaher Shouptronic voting machine . An instructional video on YouTube shows users need to re-press any button to cancel their selection, before making their choice again. \nSo, if Bravo had pressed the button for Trump and then tried to change to Clinton, he would have to deselect Trump first. \nBravo said in an interview that he reported the issue to the supervising staff at his polling station, “who pressed a couple of buttons to reset the whole thing.” He then made his preferred choice for president without issue. \n“I don’t think it’s concrete evidence,” of electoral fraud or foul play, he said, but it “adds some insight into how people come to those conclusions.” \n–Alastair Reid, First Draft News About the Author ProPublica is an independent, non-profit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest.

At this point, you’ve heard the evidence. You’ve heard lots of arguments from all sides. You’ve seen commercials and watched speeches. Most of you have already made up your minds. Some of you have already voted. For the rest of you, here is a closing argument as to why you should select Donald Trump for president.Let’s start by dismissing the views of the sad cadre of pundits known as the “NeverTrumpers.” These people claim to be conservative, and insist that Hillary Clinton would be a terrible president. Yet they contend that since Donald Trump is also unfit to serve in the White House, the only principled option is either to not vote for president at all, or to vote for a third-party candidate who has no chance of winning. This argument need not delay us for long, as it simply ignores the realities of politics. ",

The only senator who has come back to win his old seat from the opponent who bested him was the late Sen. Peter Gerry, D-R.I., in 1934.\nFeingold was initially thought to have a good shot to turn the tables on Johnson, but the race tightened significantly as the election came down to the wire.\nA huge infusion of campaign committee and outside money poured into both sides of the race during the closing days. Johnson’s seat was thought to be vulnerable, and was one of several races Democrats targeted in an uphill battle to retake control of the Senate.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who was leading voting in the state late on Tuesday, put up far bigger margins than had been expected, perhaps helping to boost Johnson’s chances.\nFeingold’s pitch for redemption centered on the claim that Johnson hadn’t done a strong job for Wisconsin voters during his six years in the Senate; however, Johnson argued the voters shouldn’t give Feingold a second shot at a job he’d already been sacked from once before.\nPredictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections.

      "text": "Farah Harith | November 9, 2016 Celebrities, both local and American, take to Twitter to express their thoughts on the very real possibility that Republican Donald Trump will be the US' 45th President. \nPETALING JAYA: Malaysian singer Yuna, who is based in the US, says her “stuff are packed.” \nShe could very well be joking but what is apparent is that many celebrities have taken to Twitter to express their dismay over the high possibility that Republican Donald Trump will be the country’s 45th president. \nTwitter user @zikrizakri asked Yuna, famous for her duet ‘Crush’ with US singer Usher, “Dah pack barang belum?” (Have you packed your stuff?) \nYuna responded, “Dah. Flight next week. Jom nasi daun pisang. Apa punya election ni.. merepek!” (Yes, I have. Flight next week. Let’s have banana leaf rice. What kind of an election is this…ridiculous!) \nMalaysian television presenter Andrea Fonseka also shared her thoughts, saying: “God bless America. She’s gonna need it – feeling horrified.” \nActivist Marina Mahathir said “the world just got even uglier” in commenting on the election on her Twitter account @netraKL. \nThe daughter of former premier Dr Mahathir Mohamad also asked: “Is there another planet we can emigrate to?” \nMeanwhile, over in the United States, Arrested Development star Will Arnett asked: “How do we explain this to future generations of women? And minorities? #weshouldbeashamedofourselves.” \n“I am just absolutely beside myself right now. I can’t believe the way this thing has turned. Trying to remain hopeful but geeez louise,” tweeted singer Mandy Moore. \nActress Rashida Jones said: “I’m so scared. How did we get here?” \nFormer Blossom star Mayim Bialik, who is now famous for her role as Amy Farrah Fowler in sitcom The Big Bang Theory, expressed her dismay that some opted to vote for third party candidates. \n“Tried to tell you to vote for @HillaryClinton and not a third party. I’d be sweating a lot less right now if you had listened.” \nThe third party candidates this time around were Gary Johnson from the Libertarian party, Jill Stein from the Green Party and independent Evan McMullin. \nIn a news update, it was said that Johnson received the most votes by a third party candidate since 1996, already garnering over 3.7 million. \nComedian Seth MacFarlane also shared his thoughts on the third party candidates, saying: “How’s that Gary Johnson protest vote treating you right now?” \nMeanwhile comedian and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres sent a tweet to Clinton, saying: “However this ends tonight I am so proud of you and so honoured to be your friend.”",

      "text": "Emirates NBD partners with Twitter to offer customer support By   \nEmirates NBD, one of the leading banking groups in the region, has partnered with real time information network Twitter, to be the first bank in the region to offer customer support features through its account. \nTwitter’s customer support features will enable Emirates NBD enhance its existing suite of customer service channels and offer the bank’s customers easy access to support online, within shorter time-frames. \nEmirates NBD customers will be informed of the new support channel when people search online for the bank or mention @EmiratesNBD in a Tweet. The bank’s Twitter profile will also display a prominent button to inform customers on the option to start a Direct Message for private support. \nAdditionally, Emirates NBD’s Twitter profile will display hours of availability on its profile to help set customers’ expectations for when the bank is likely to reply. \nVikram Krishna, Head of Group Marketing and Customer Experience at Emirates NBD commented on the announcement: “In a growing trend, more and more customers find it easier to post their queries online, particularly via Twitter. As a customer-centric bank with a significant social media following, our investment in these new generation tools will further our customer experience proposition and allow us to engage with our customers through an easy and efficient channel.” \nEmirates NBD has nearly 80,000 followers on Twitter with numbers growing as the bank continues to enhance its customer engagement tools. \nThe partnership with Twitter is part of the bank’s ongoing efforts to offer a superior customer experience via all banking channels. \nEmirates NBD was recently ranked as the top financial services brand in the world for the second year in a row by the prestigious 2016 Global Effie Effectiveness Index. \nWith a brand value of over USD 2 billion, the bank was also ranked as the most effective brand in the Middle East & Africa region across all sectors. \nBenjamin Ampen, Head of Revenue for Twitter in MENA, Twitter commented, “We’re excited to have Emirates NBD as one of the first banks in the region to use Twitter’s new customer support features, which can be activated on a new Customer Support Settings page on the Twitter Dashboard website. Businesses can enable the setting to receive Direct Messages from anyone who may require longer descriptions of issues or who may need to share personal information. This falls in line with our commitment to make Twitter the best place for people to talk to businesses.” \nTwitter has recently launched new features in Direct Messages that help businesses resolve issues on Twitter faster and easier. \nThe first feature is the creation of quick replies, where businesses can prompt people with the best ways to reply to a Direct Message, whether by choosing from a list of options or guiding users to enter specific text values. \nThe company has also created welcome messages which allow businesses to greet people and set expectations as they enter a Direct Message conversation—without people needing to send the first message. \nWhen quick replies and welcome messages are used together, businesses can reduce wait times and educate people on the best ways to interact.

      "text": "Vine is up for grabs according to a new report that claims its parent company Twitter is considering multiple bids for the platform. A takeover could save the video-looping service from the scrap heap, but at what cost? More Vine is up for grabs according to a new report that claims its parent company Twitter is considering multiple bids for the platform.\nTwitter broke the hearts of many viral video enthusiasts last month by announcing it was shutting down the video-looping app. While the internet let out a collective sigh, Twitter itself was inundated with offers for the platform, despite the fact that its output was slowly grinding to a halt.\nTwitter is now figuring out who it should sell to, having narrowed down the pool of prospective suitors to just five companies, according to multiple sources who spoke to TechCrunch . A number of the interested parties are reportedly from Asia, though the only name mentioned thus far has been Japanese messaging giant Line.\nMore: Giphy is letting you import your Vine accounts and convert your videos into GIFs\nConsidering Vine is lacking both influential creators (who have migrated to YouTube, Facebook , and Snapchat), the actual bids being put forward are less than remarkable for a platform that once boasted 100 million monthly users. One source close to the matter claims some of the offers are for less than $10 million.\nRumors regarding a Vine sale have been circulating for months, with The New York Times previously claiming that Twitter was looking to wash its hands of the costly platform, which was setting it back $10 million just to keep it running.\nLike Periscope, Vine boasts a number of integration features with Twitter’s flagship site, such as auto-playing videos on the Twitter timeline. Consequently, Twitter could potentially build additional revenue from a sale using monetization options, such as ad sales.\nDespite its demise, Twitter promised that Vine videos would be archived and available to view online — the app itself is due to shut down in the coming months. Members will also have the option to download their Vines courtesy of an exporting mechanism the company is currently building.\nIt seems it was the outpouring of love online for the platform that sparked the bidding process. Shortly after the news broke of its death, the internet (in particular Twitter) was flooded with odes to the service as users reminisced about its glory days by sharing their favorite Vines. This latest report gives fans some hope for the future of the platform.\nIt must be noted, however, that an acquisition could also end up radically altering the service and Twitter’s plans for its preservation. Ultimately, Vine may end up surviving, but not as we know it.\nGiphy is letting you import your Vine accounts and convert your videos into Gifs Twitter takeover roundup: Who’s interested in acquiring the social media giant? Google and Salesforce are reportedly interested in acquiring Twitter",

(Reuters) \nTaran Killam got himself into trouble when he tweeted \"rural = stupid\" Tuesday night.\nThe former \"Saturday Night Live\" star took a lot of heat for his tweet which was seemingly in reference to election results from those living in rural areas.\n@TaranKillam I knew there was a reason you got fired from SNL\n— Pharmacist Guy (@Pharmacist_Guy) November 9, 2016 @TaranKillam Treat hate with hate, that'll work.\n— Will Fitzgerald (@WiIIFitzgerald) November 9, 2016 @TaranKillam This is part of the reason people are voting for Trump.\n— C. R. Copley (@crcopley) November 9, 2016 @TaranKillam You mean people with real jobs and normal lives?\n— Jas (@jashoog) November 9, 2016 @TaranKillam You are so ignorant... you wouldn't have much if it wasn't for rural America\n— Janessa (@BizNessie) November 9, 2016 The 34-year-old star did tweet out an apology...sort of.\nSorry, sorry, sorry. Certainly a flippant comment made in jest. Allow me to be sincerely clear. Vote 4 Trump = I think you're stupid.\n— Taran Killam (@TaranKillam) November 9, 2016 His apology didn't seem to please any of his fans who continued to slam the star for his remarks.\n@TaranKillam But it wasn't in jest - it's how you feel & defines the divide in America of \"Us v Them\" instead of constructive dialogue.\n— Jason Ely™ (@jasonely) November 9, 2016 @TaranKillam Wow, you think a lot of people are stupid.\n— Sherri Fowler 🐸 (@sherri4Milo) November 9, 2016 @TaranKillam - just because someone voted for Trump doesn't make them stupid. That's really sad you would say that about people u don't know\n— Tammy Booker (@TammyWBooker) November 9, 2016 Finally, Wednesday morning, the actor who is married to \"How I Met Your Mother\" star Cobie Smulders, tweeted he was embarrassed by his \"thoughtless and mean statements.\"\nIn the light of day, I'm embarrassed for making thoughtless and mean statements. I was wrong. I'm sorry.\n— Taran Killam (@TaranKillam) November 9, 2016",

      "text": "Published November 9, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \n \nBy Bill Whalen  \nPublished November 09, 2016  | FoxNews.com \n\nFor nearly seventeen months now, I presumed that Donald Trump was playing an elaborate game of chicken with the American people.\nSure, Trump was running for president. But there’s no way it would last until Election Day. The moment another Republican embraced the border wall, or Trump tired of the candidates’ debates, or voters tired of Trump, he’d quit the race and return to business as usual: developing real estate and fostering his cult of personality.\nBut Trump kept going – through the primaries, then the general election, to a stunning Election Night upset that earns him a four-year stay in a white, albeit less ornate mansion that’s a short stroll from the fancier hotel he recently opened in the nation’s capital.\nNow Donald Trump will be the nation’s 45th President.\nRepeat, exhale . . . then say it again.\nDonald Trump will be the nation’s 45th President.\nThe trick now: solving the Bill McKay question. That’s the fictional politician Robert Redford played in the 1972 movie “The Candidate,” which ends with the senator-elect asking: “What do we now?”.\nHere are 10 suggestions for President-Elect Trump.\n1. Seize the Moment. I was going to start this by suggesting Trump spend a week in Palm Beach seclusion for some much-needed R&R. That can wait until Thanksgiving and beyond, when it’s time for the big transition decisions that can be done behind the scenes. If I were Trump, I’d travel back to the unlikeliest states that delivered for him on Election Day and hold large rallies – both to thank the voters and explain the greater mission ahead to change Washington’s culture. I’d add in a couple of rallies in states that didn’t vote for him, just to underscore that he wants to be a president for the entire people.\nTrump should invite Hillary Clinton for a private lunch. He should also let it be known that he wants to sit down with President Obama and discuss an amicable transition.\n2. Read Up on Andrew Jackson. This was only the second time in the history of the nation that an election was held at the end of three consecutive two-term presidencies. In 1824, it was John Quincy Adams staving off a populist challenge from Andrew Jackson, the man who statue sits in Lafayette Park, across the street from the North Portico of the White House.\nThat race was bitter and ended with talk of a rigged system (a “corrupt bargain” between Adams and House Speaker Henry Clay). Four years later, Jackson rode the revolution into Washington, the tip of the spear of voter resentment against a political class that had dominated the first 50 years of the republic.\nThis could have been the scenario in 2020. Much to everyone’s surprise, the revolution came four years ahead of schedule, with the unlikeliest of generals leading the charge.\nI don’t know if Trump is one for history, but someone in his world should introduce the man to Jackson and the roots of American populism. After all, it’s now Trump who gets to write the next chapter.\n3. Time to Let Go. Assuming Trump is able to be a gracious winner (and his speech Wednesday night was a good start), it’s time to pivot out of campaign mode. He’s now tasked with acting as a statesman, not a showman treating presidential political like a reality TV show. It’s time to bid adieu to “Crooked Hillary” and “Lying Ted” and the “corrupt media”.\nFor Trump to have any semblance of dignified leadership, he has to let go of the petty insults and juvenile denigrations that are simply unbecoming of a president.\nThat includes the dead-of-the-night tweeting.  Yes, I’d let the incoming president hold on his Smartphone – so long as he limits it to crowd selfies.\n4. Meet With GOP Thought Leaders. Can Trump work with a Republican Congress? Some members will be on board right away; for others, it will take time (hint: handing out presidential goodies has a way of healing wounds). The more immediate concern for Trump would be getting Republican thought leaders on board – the commentary class whose support will come in handy when it’s time to rally the party behind a first-term agenda.\nThere’s nothing stopping Trump from holding a series of dinner salons with influential conservatives in New York (The Wall Street Journal editorial board, for example) and in the District of Columbia (Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol, George Will, to name just a few).\nPresidents tend to do this at the end of their presidency – courting historians in an attempt to spin their first draft of history. Trump needs the ideas merchants sooner than he may realize.\nRead the full story in the Opinion section on FoxNews.com→",

      "text": "By Howard Kurtz \nPublished November 09, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print   \nEarly this morning, after he had stunned the world by winning the presidency, Donald Trump took a call from a longtime confidant.\n\"Nobody believed in me,\" Trump said. Literally, only two or three people had thought he could pull this off -- and at times, not even Trump himself. Now he had a lengthening call list of world leaders who wanted to pay their respects to the new leader of the free world. \nIt was a starkly different scene last June, when the businessman was still seen as a hopeless underdog. Trump was on his blue-and-red Boeing 757, huddling with his top staffers, who were begging him not to talk about Gonzalo Curiel.\nTrump had a score to settle. He told his staff he wanted to denounce the judge handling the lawsuit against Trump University. His advisers pushed back hard, saying this would be a huge distraction, that Trump had to be seen as fighting for America, not for himself.\nThe unofficial Republican nominee took the plunge anyway, calling the Indiana-born judge, whose parents were from Mexico, a “hater” who had “an inherent conflict of interest.”\nThose attacks, denounced by some Republican leaders, created a political uproar that haunted the campaign for weeks. It was an early harbinger of a self-destructive tendency that would damage Trump’s candidacy again and again: his insistence on straying from scripted messages to indulge in attacks and counterattacks against those he felt had wronged him.\nIt was that compulsion to repeatedly blow past the stop signs erected by his strategists that one confidante described as a condition: “defiance disorder.”\nThe back story of this campaign is how some of Trump's advisers tried again and again to rein him in, failing time after time, and privately concluded that he could not be managed -- and therefore was unlikely to win. Only in the final weeks, when the race seemed all but lost, did Trump find a way to stop stepping on his message -- and paved the way for his stunning upset. \nTrump was a genuine phenomenon, an outsider who used gut instincts, media mastery and a blunt, often divisive message to beat better-funded rivals and outfox an often hostile press corps.  \nBut throughout the long campaign, Trump's greatest strength was his most glaring weakness, one that frustrated a rotating cadre of advisers until the very end. His tough street talk was both popular and polarizing; his stream-of-consciousness delivery both mesmerizing and undisciplined; his Twitter attacks both devastating and distracting. At times, even his fiercest loyalists wondered whether he really wanted the presidency, which once seemed far out of reach but came to be a tantalizing mirage, receding as he came closer.\nInternal rivalries on the tiny team didn’t help matters. Corey Lewandowski, his first campaign manager, harnessed Trump’s energy but drew flak for giving the candidate too much leeway (though he pushed back when necessary). The second, Paul Manafort, took heat for spending time in the Hamptons and lacking a personal rapport with Trump (though his mission was to mend fences with the Beltway establishment). The third, Kellyanne Conway, was chided for spending too much time on TV (a chief part of her job) and contradicting some of Trump’s statements (though she remained grounded in facts, such as the poor poll numbers he tried to dismiss as phony).\nMost campaign aides viewed Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, the 35-year-old publisher of a Manhattan weekly with no political experience, as the de facto campaign manager. There was a growing sense at the top that no one wanted to cross Ivanka’s husband or bring bad news to the candidate. Ivanka, Eric and Don Jr. would weigh in to counter what they saw as bad advice, but they and others would also send uncomfortable messages through Hope Hicks, Trump’s low-key press secretary. Hicks, 28, was constantly at his side, a former fashion model who became such a trusted counselor that Trump would openly worry, when he flouted the team’s directives, about disappointing her.\n“Can I win? Can I win?” Trump would ask his strategists in the closing weeks, though he often defied their advice, refusing to eliminate trips to Pennsylvania, Colorado and other states that he had virtually no chance of winning.\nOver and over, the real estate mogul displayed a fingertip feel for public sentiment and remarkable ability to bounce back, despite being written off by what he came to view as the corrupt media. He would criticize Mexican rapists, John McCain, Carly Fiorina’s face, call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants, and yet drive the news agenda and keep on winning. But that was with Republican primary voters.\nOn the broader stage, running against a Democrat whose unpopularity nearly matched his, Trump’s own words became the most potent weapons against him.\nThe pattern was remarkably consistent. Trump would hone a successful message, stick to the script — often reading from once-disparaged teleprompters — and wind up chafing at the rhetorical shackles. \nHis savvier advisers would realize that he wasn’t having fun. And then he would rebel. He would create a new narrative. It could be a phrase, a tweet, an extended riff in front of a rapturous crowd. Trump would mar the story line, blame the media for twisting his words, keep defending or tweaking his remarks, and suddenly he was no longer talking about taxes or terrorism.\n    **\nOver the summer, Trump retweeted an anti-Hillary graphic with a pile of cash and what looked like a Star of David. When the ensuing flap prompted his staff to delete the star, Trump was furious. He denied the image was anti-Semitic, attacked Clinton, kept talking about it and turned what might have been a half-day incident into a running story.\nWhen a gunman killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Trump didn’t issue the usual thoughts-and-prayers refrain. Instead, he tweeted: “Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance.”\nHe dug a deeper hole the next day on “Fox & Friends,” faulting President Obama for his approach to radical Islamic terrorism: “We're led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he's got something else in mind.” His strategists were stunned as critics assailed Trump for insinuating that an American president might be sympathetic to terrorism. \nBut Trump refused to budge, again dragging out the controversy. “I don’t think Orlando was a mistake at all,” he told me. “I’m saying what everyone else is saying and thinking. The problem is everyone wants to be politically correct, and you can’t be politically correct because these people are after our country.”\nDuring the Democratic convention, Trump held a news conference—his favorite venue for stealing attention—and said this about his rival: “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.” Though it seemed like a tongue-in-cheek comment, the press went haywire, the New York Times sternly accusing him of “essentially urging a foreign adversary to conduct cyberespionage against a former secretary of state.”\nThat was a ripple compared to the tidal wave of negativity unleashed after Khizr Khan and his wife, who had lost a son in Iraq, castigated Trump at the Philadelphia convention. Trump told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that “if you look at his wife, she was standing there, she had nothing to say, she probably — maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say.”\nThe staff pounced on him. One adviser told Trump that he was getting “killed” over the issue, that he had dropped 5 to 7 points in the polls, that he could not sustain this. Trump knew it was a losing issue, his strategists believed, but could not let go.\nTrump kept up his assault on the Gold Star family for days as his strategists frantically tried to change the subject. Once again, Trump’s insistence on punching back at his detractors—no matter how ill-advised—badly hurt him.\nBut even then, Trump believed he had said nothing wrong. “The media was not treating the statements fairly,” he told me. “I mean, they would chop them up and then shorten the statement, and it didn’t sound proper or didn’t sound as good when they did that. It was very unfair.”\n     **\nAll these factors — Trump’s unorthodox style, pugilistic instincts and a staff torn between professionals and family members — came together in the runup to the first debate at Hofstra University. Too many people were involved in debate prep, drifting in and out, including two generals with no political experience. Trump got too much conflicting advice. Advisers would send memos, but the candidate had little patience for anything longer than a paragraph and preferred verbal briefings. Supremely self-confident, he refused to follow the conventional practice of holding mock debates.\nTrump stumbled against Clinton but insisted he had won the debate, calling surrogates to complain that they weren’t sufficiently defending him on the air. Some advisers felt he was too smart not to know the truth but too proud to admit it.\nWorse, he had taken the bait on one of Clinton’s last answers, when she accused him of mocking the winner of his Miss Universe pageant two decades ago by calling her Miss Piggy. \nOn “Fox & Friends” the next morning, Trump raised Alicia Machado without even being asked, saying: “She was the worst we ever had—the worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible…She gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem.”\nFor nearly a week, the candidate who trailed badly among women was insisting that a onetime beauty queen no one had heard of was a terrible person and too fat. He even tweeted that people should check out her “sex tape” (actually an under-the-covers scene in a Latino reality show). His staff was unable to persuade him to move on.\nTrump sympathizers wondered why his staff didn’t boot him from Twitter. But Conway believed she couldn’t take his phone away, that he was a 70-year-old man who would ultimately say and do what he wanted. She managed him as best she could, sweet-talking rather than lecturing him, and when asked about Trump comments she couldn’t defend, she simply deflected the questions.\nWhile prepping the candidate for the final debate in Las Vegas, Trump’s team drove home one answer, literally dozens of times. With Trump having spent days talking about a “rigged” election, the inner circle drilled him to say that while the media were unfair, of course he would accept the outcome on Election Day. He was explicitly warned that any other answer would guarantee 48 hours of bad press, wiping out the rest of the debate.\nBut when Chris Wallace asked that very question, Trump went rogue. He said he didn’t know what he would do and would keep the country in suspense. As Steve Bannon, Conway and their team watched, their faces fell. They could not believe it. A modified statement was issued the following day, but Trump, before the last mass audience of the campaign, was defiant. He went with his gut. Those who knew him best knew the truth: He would not be managed.\nTrump attempted a reset by giving what was touted as a major policy speech in Gettysburg, where he would unveil a detailed Contract with the American Voter. \nBut Trump spent several minutes ripping the nine women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, calling them liars and vowing to sue them after the election.\nThe press, naturally, took the bait. A presidential candidate threatening litigation against women who accused him of unwanted groping and kissing was a hotter story than a laundry list of proposals, as Trump, after decades of dealing with the New York tabloids, undoubtedly knew.  \nTrump had again stepped on his own story, much to the chagrin of his advisers. Some believed he was so frustrated by the allegations, and having to deny them to his wife Melania, that he couldn’t resist fighting back in his signature style.\n                      **\nOn Friday, Oct. 28, Trump was in a lousy mood. He was supposed to fly to New Hampshire for a campaign event, but he was two hours late in leaving Trump Tower. Instead, trailing in the polls, he spent 45 minutes complaining about how he had been trashed on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” a show he frequented during the primaries but now regularly attacked.\nBy the time he landed in New Hampshire, the stunning story about James Comey launching a new FBI probe of Clinton’s emails had broken. Trump huddled with Bannon, the campaign chairman, policy aide Steve Miller and Lewandowski, now an informal adviser. Bannon, whose low-key demeanor tended to keep Trump calm, urged restraint. \nWhile retired Gen. Michael Flynn had to keep warming up the crowd beyond his usual one-minute spiel, Bannon helped add a few sentences to Trump’s speech on the teleprompter. \n“Perhaps finally justice will be served … Clinton’s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before,’’ Trump told the Manchester crowd.\nThe aides promptly canceled scheduled interviews with two New Hampshire stations and a taping for “Meet the Press.” Trump’s inclination was to do a TV blitz, but most of the advisers wanted him to go dark, and for several days he did. Every day he wasn’t on television, they believed, he was winning — especially while Clinton had become the story.\nIf Trump was doing interviews, they argued, he would be asked about every damaging story in the papers. Isn’t it true, an anchor would ask, that you avoided hundreds of millions of dollars in income taxes by using a dubious loophole? Isn’t it true that you claimed credit for major charitable donations that you didn’t make? And Trump would inevitably toss out the talking points and aggressively defend himself, drawing attention from the FBI probe that had cast a pall over Clinton’s campaign. \nInstead, an energized Trump, buoyed by the tightening polls, stuck to the prepared speeches, surrendering the TV weapon that had powered his rise to the nomination and beyond. “Stay on point, Donald,” his advisers would insist, and this time Trump complied, except for one swipe at NBC’s Katy Tur during a rally, which drew negative attention.\nHis strategists kept some of their internal polls from him — such as one showing him trailing by low double digits in New York — because they knew he would want to campaign there rather than in swing states he might actually win. After a year and a half, they finally had the candidate on track and on message.\nTrump’s team was a bit deflated when Comey cleared Clinton on the new batch of emails less than 48 hours before Election Day, figuring that lifted a cloud — and was worth a point to Hillary in such do-or-die states as Michigan, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. The important thing was that Trump was fired up, he saw a path to 270, months after many pundits predicted he would be the biggest loser since Barry Goldwater. And for Trump, as he raced to the final flurry of rallies, mindset was everything.\nHe couldn't resist calling into Fox twice on Election Day, breaking his media silence and drawing the question that had dogged him for weeks: What if he lost? \"I have to see, and under what circumstances,\" the candidate told Martha MacCallum, again invoking a \"rigged system\" less than four hours before the first polls closed.\nIn the end, that question was moot. Trump and his team knew from their internal reports, perhaps two hours before the AP and the networks called the race, that he had accomplished what everyone said was impossible.\nTrump's defiance enabled him to pull off a \"miracle,\" which is what Politico had said on Tuesday morning that he would need. The man who broke every rule in the political handbook had captured the White House. \n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

(Reuters) \nPatti LaBelle, the iconic singer-turned-Walmart baked goods entrepreneur, will be sharing her favorite recipes on a new Cooking Channel show this fall. \nThe six-episode series “Patti LaBelle’s Place” will feature the songstress whipping up some of her classic soul food with guests like rapper 50 Cent, Gayle King and fashion guru Joe Zee. \n\"The one-of-a-kind Patti LaBelle's talents in the kitchen are right up there with her talents on-stage,\" said Food Network and Cooking Channel’s SVP of programming Didi O'Hearn, said. \"The happiness Patti gets from sharing her favorite dishes with her guests is a joy to watch.\" \nWalmart’s Patti LaBelle Sweet Potato Pie has us singing too \nThat happiness is probably best immortalized in a 2015 viral video from Los Angeles-based singer James Wright Chanel. After picking up a handful of LaBelle’s Sweet Potato Pies from Walmart, Wright Chanel posted a video review where he belted his way to over five million views—while also chowing down on the sweet pie. \nTexas Walmart to open restaurant with deep-fried State Fair food \nThe video catapulted the seasonal selection into the national spotlight with many Walmarts selling out of the pies ahead of Thanksgiving last year. LaBelle has since released two new cakes with the discount retailer. \nOn her new show LaBelle will make Southern staples like fried chicken, braised brisket, greens and peach cobbler. She’ll also be whipping up some vegan dishes. \n“Patti LaBelle’s Place” debuts Dec. 3 with two back-to-back episodes. Advertisement",

      "text": "Listen \nLaurent Koscielny has revealed he prefers playing Scrabble to video games, and admits his France team-mates “must think I’m like a granddad”. The 31-year-old is one of the oldest members of the Bleu squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia™ qualifier at home to Sweden on Friday. It also includes Ousmane Dembele, Kingsley Coman, Adrien Rabiot and Samuel Umtiti, who are 19, 20, 21 and 22 respectively, as well 23-year-olds Raphael Varane, Lucas Digne, Paul Pogba and Nebil Fekir. \"My younger team-mates are more tech-savvy than me,” Koscielny told L'Equipe Magazine . “I don't tweet and they must think I'm like a granddad. \"But I love playing Scrabble. I began with my stepdad and brothers. I'm pretty good now, it relaxes me. I'm competitive and I like to win and try and improve. \"I like playing cards and board games, and I played Scrabble a lot during EURO 2016 with Olivier Giroud, Hugo Lloris and some of my other France team-mates. It gave us more laughs than playing video games.\" Varane and Antoine Griezmann both have over three million followers on Twitter, while Pogba has 10.4 million on Instagram. See the links to the right to follow @fifaworldcup on Twitter and Instagram. France top Group A in European qualifying, above Sweden on goal difference, with the Netherlands three points back in third. The French host the Swedes on 11 November, before facing Côte d'Ivoire in a friendly four days later. \nUSA 1994 was the last World Cup Les Bleus missed out on.  ",

(Reuters) \nLooking like a supermodel doesn't come easy.\nMartha Hunt says she's focused on getting into tip-top shape ahead of the 2016 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.\n\"I'm in serious training mode,\" Hunt told  E! . \"I've been training every day like crazy. My body is so sore.\"\nSo how does the model push her physical limits?\n\"I'm just amping up the workouts,\" she said. \"Lots of weight training, squats, a little bit of cardio, but mostly just adding more weights into my workouts. And working out with friends to make it fun. That's always so important.\"\nThe 27-year-old added the only way her diet has changed is by adding protein.\n\"If anything, I just try to add in more protein to keep up with all the working out.\"\nSee if Hunt's hard work paid off when the 2016 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show airs Dec. 5 on CBS.",

      "text": "Published November 09, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print   \nAmy Schumer said she was just joking when she said she’d leave the country if Donald Trump was elected president.  \nSchumer, a distant cousin of Senator Chuck Schumer, told BBC Newsnight in September she would move to Spain should Trump win. \n\"My act will change because I will need to learn to speak Spanish because I will move to Spain or somewhere,\" she said. \"It's beyond my comprehension if Trump won. It's too crazy.\"\nHowever, Tuesday morning she took to Instagram to inform fans she was staying in America. \nSchumer noted she had also said she would move to London. \n\"First of all the interview where I said I would move was in London and was said in jest. Not that anyone needs more than a headline to count something as official news,\" she wrote on Instagram. \nThe star added in her lengthy post that she was grieving. \"I am furious. I cry for her and for all the smart people I love...\"\n\nIn a turn of events that shocked many people across the country, Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton with 277 electoral votes to her 228. \nSchumer is just one of many celebs who said they would leave the country if Trump was to win. Stars like Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson, Jon Stewart, Lena Dunham, Barbra Streisand and Chelsea Handler have all made similar declarations.\nLike Schumer, Raven-Symone promised to leave the U.S. if a Trump victory is declared. Symone proclaimed on “The View” she had a plane ticket and was ready to leave.\n\"My confession for this election is... [should the Republican candidate win] I'm gonna move to Canada with my entire family. I already have my ticket.\"\nOn Election Night, Lifetime aired footage of Symone trying her hand at hockey in Canada. “The View” host did not return FOX411’s request for comment.\nBut some of Hollywood’s elite are speaking out against the stars who have promised to move. A handful of vocal stars say United States citizen planning to abandon the U.S. need to cool it. \nJon Cryer and Kal Penn told their followers moving was the wrong approach. Penn explained in a tweet, \"Stop it [with] the moving to Canada s--t. Double down on the country we love. If Trump becomes president, we have to get MORE involved not less.\"",

      "text": "\nRepublish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons licence. Twitter told it. Shawn Thew/EPA \nAs the world dissects the how and why of Donald Trump’s presidential victory , pollsters are already coming under severe criticism for getting it so wrong . But a tool we created that analysed emotions towards the two candidates on Twitter accurately predicted the result. Unlike other poll predictors that just take a snapshot in time, our tool used real-time data from Twitter which provides a more accurate picture of who people are likely to vote for. \nWe first developed the tool, called EMOTIVE , in 2013 to predict whether another riot could happen in London following those in 2011. It can analyse thousands of tweets a second to extract from each tweet a direct expression of one of eight basic emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, shame and confusion. \nWe decided to use our tool to track emotions on Twitter around the world about the US presidential election for the three weeks leading up to the vote. During that period, our data showed that Trump continued to lead the race to the White House. Going by this tool, there were very few periods of time when Clinton was leading – contrary to what was being predicted by the polls. \nThe EMOTIVE system worked by looking at how much fluctuation there was in the number of tweets relating specific emotions towards either Trump and Clinton. The more tweets with reference to an emotion fluctuate – reflecting greater uncertainty towards a candidate – the fewer votes the model predicts a candidate is going to get. Crucially, it’s not the volume of tweets that matter, but the “choppiness” that make the difference. This means that the model does not concern itself with the direction of the emotion or put value on one emotion over another – because an emotion such as anger can be positive or negative. Emotions towards Trump. EMOTIVE , Author provided \nThis first graph shows how emotive tweets towards Trump fluctuated in that final 24-hour period. The y axis here measures what we call an emotional score. The wider the band of colour, the greater the number of emotive tweets related to that particular emotion, which means a greater outpouring of emotion towards Trump. But there was not a large amount of fluctuation overall in how much each emotion was appearing in tweets – meaning more voters were feeling more certain about their support for Trump. \nNow look at the second graph, showing the same data in relation to Hillary Clinton over a slightly longer period. This shows greater fluctuation – more spikes and dips – and meant she was predicted to win fewer votes. Emotions towards Clinton. EMOTIVE , Author provided A good gauge of the public mood \nWhen we analysed the raw tweets we saw an unprecedented campaign with a race all about personalities, dominated by attacks on Trump and Clinton. \nThere was very little mention of policy in the tweets we analysed, nor the difference it could make to the US and the world. This campaign saw the working class find their voice via digital communication channels. \nThis is not the first time the EMOTIVE tool has been used to predict an election result that the pollsters got wrong. In 2015, the system correctly predicted the outcome of the UK general election. And it has been put to other uses too. Another study looked at reactions to the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks to potentially help survey those who would be at risk of post-traumatic stress. \nBeing able to monitor millions of digital sensors via Twitter and use them to map emotion provides a way to gauge the mood music of the average person on the street. And it is possible to get a real-life insight into what people really think about two candidates in an election. \nIn the case of the 2016 presidential elections, this is possibly why the polls were wrong throughout – often they were seen as the establishment trying to interfere in swaying opinion. While polls only provide a snapshot of that moment it time, systems such as EMOTIVE provide ongoing real-time analysis, which tends to provide a much more accurate picture of the landscape – and is proving good way at predicting which way elections may go.

Jason Verrett weighs in A third-round draft pick, Thompson earned a starting job in training camp despite missing two preseason games with a shoulder injury. He played in the season opener in Dallas and started the victory against New Orleans the following week, but hurt his foot and never played again.\nGettis, a five-year veteran, has spent the entire season on the Giants' practice squad. He played in one game for New York last season.\n---\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL",

      "text": "By Chris Stirewalt \nPublished November 09, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print **Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up  here .**\nSOMETIMES…\nSometimes, the hurricane goes back out to sea.\nSometimes, the bubble bursts.\n\nSometimes, the Cubs win.\nToday has been a day of deserved exaltation and no little amount of amazement for the supporters of President-elect  Donald Trump . \n\nAnd whether you agree with them or not, be of good cheer. Their success is proof that the game is not rigged. Millions of Americans, working together for a common purpose, pulled off the most remarkable victory in American political history. A frontal assault on the system validated the core principles of the system itself.\nBut Trump’s opponents probably aren’t ready to hear that right now. The shock of the thing is probably too great to fade in a single day. But they got a good push in the right direction from former Democratic nominee  Hillary Clinton  and  President Obama  who spoke lovingly of the country, the Constitution and the peaceful transition power.\n\nAlso shocked today are the data deacons whose models and maps are in tatters today. \n\nAmericans want algorithmic certainty when it comes to things big and small. We once asked “How’s the weather?” Now we want hourly probabilities for rainfall at 4 o’clock. We want to wrap ourselves in a blanket of decimal points and probabilities against the unavoidable uncertainties of life.\nAs we have discussed before, the polls are usually right in the large sense. And they were this time. But in narrowest space, they are always wrong. Public opinion polls are good at catching trends or large differences. Inside the small spaces of a very tight election, error is a thing.\nThe average of the five final credible national polls said Clinton led Trump by 3.4 points. She won the popular vote by a third of a point. That 3.1 point difference is smaller than the 3.3 points we saw in 2012 but larger than the 1.3 points we saw in 2004.\nSo, kind of normal.\nBut the expectations were different this time. \n\nFirst, self-promoting data providers sell the concept that no sparrow can fall in the electorate without their knowing. Good pollsters and statisticians don’t do this, but the arrogant and reckless ones tell you that their methods can deliver precision.\nIn the end, this is shooting skeet, not shooting targets at a rifle range. You are tracking a moving target and trying to catch it in your scattershot. Polls caught the clay pigeon but missed the bullseye.\nSecond, Trump’s opponents were desperately frightened of what his victory would mean and therefore put more faith in data than they might normally. The psychology of confidence is a remarkable thing. The more you need something to be true, the less willing you are to consider other possibilities. Confidence intervals for elevator cables and shark cages are probably higher than the data would support, too.\nThey call it “the unthinkable” for a reason. And for Democrats, this was certainly unthinkable.\nBoastful data providers and desperate consumers in media and the broader electorate combined to create some very unrealistic expectations for prognostication, especially on the state level. Infrequent, small-sample state polls, often of dubious methodology, have spotty records as predictors.\nAnd, as Democrats have been painfully reminded for a fourth time in American history – 1876, 1888, 2000 and now 2016 – we don’t select our presidents by the national popular vote. Trump broke through the Big Blue wall and won the states he needed.\nSo how did that happen?\nLike the financial sector that long succored her career, Clinton got caught in a big short of her own.\nPollsters, prognosticators and Democratic partisans assumed that electorate would look mostly like 2012 and that Trump’s deficiencies with ethnic minorities and college-educated suburbanites would ultimately block his path.\nIt was assumed that Obama’s coalition was somewhat durable and partially heritable and that the 2008 election had been a re-aligning event. What Clinton found was something closer to the experiences of  John Kerry  and  Al Gore .\nAfter eight years spent talking about the need to expand the Republican electorate, the GOP is taking back the presidency by shrinking the electorate. Trump will win with fewer votes than  Mitt Romney  lost. And he might even end up with fewer votes than  John McCain .\nThere was a dispute among Republicans about how to proceed out of the 2012 wilderness. The consensus formed around expanding outreach to suburbanites and ethnic minorities in a bid to breach the Obama coalitions in states like Virginia, Colorado and Nevada.\nBut the other proposal was to intensify the pursuit of blue-collar voters in the upper Midwest. And boy did they.\nTrump flipped some small-town Rust Belt counties by as much as 20 points while black turnout declined and became slightly less Democratic. Take Michigan. Obama got 44 percent of the white vote there in 2016 while Clinton reeled in just 36 percent this time. Obama got 95 percent of the black vote, Clinton got 92 percent.\nRepublicans turned up the volume with working-class white voters and enough black voters stayed away to tip states that had been narrowly but consistently Democratic the other way.\nWhat’s the result?\nThis is the fourth time since 1992 that one of the two parties has taken control of both houses of Congress and the White House.\nDepending on what Republicans decide to do about the “nuclear option” in the Senate, we could be in for a very consequential couple of years. Outgoing Senate Minority Leader  Harry Reid  unwisely threatened to peel-back the supermajority vote threshold in the Senate if his party was returned to power. We may see the Republican Senate decide the time has come to extend simple-majority thresholds to all votes, not just judicial appointments. We may see our system change dramatically yet again.\nBecause as much as we can usually predict what comes next in politics and life, even though history usually seems to take forever, sometimes…\nI’LL TELL YOU WHAT: AFTER-ACTION REPORT \nHow did Trump do it? What happened to the polls? What comes next for defeated Democrats? Who will Trump tap for his administration? What was said on set during the commercial breaks on Fox News’ election coverage?

      "text": "Share View photos Adam Bain, Twitter's president of global revenue, stands in a conference room at his company's San Francisco, California headquarters July 25, 2012. REUTERS/Noah Berger More (Reuters) - Microblogging platform Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) said on Wednesday Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain would leave the company to explore other opportunities. Twitter shares were down 4.3 percent in after-hours trading. Bain will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto, the company said, adding it would begin a search for a new CFO. Noto, who became the finance chief in 2014, will continue to manage the live content business, and will manage Twitter's global advertising sales, data and mobile ad exchange MoPub. Bain joined Twitter in 2010 and was named COO in October last year. The popular but money-losing microblogging service has spent aggressively on product development and marketing in recent years. Twitter had hired bankers to field acquisition offers, but it has seen a dearth of potential bidders. Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N), the last of a small cohort of companies including Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) believed to have been interested, said recently it would not pursue a deal. Twitter said last month it would cut 9 percent of its global workforce to keep costs down. (Reporting by Narottam Medhora in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva) Reblog",

      "text": "Chris Sacca: Twitter is 'a series of missed opportunities' Adam Bain, Twitter's Chief Operating Officer, is leaving the company. The executive announced his departure on Twitter Wednesday afternoon. Bain spent six years at Twitter ( TWTR , Tech30 ) , the first five as president of global revenue and partnerships before being promoted to COO last year during an executive shakeup. \n\"We took the company from $0 to Billions faster than almost anyone's ever done it. We diversified the business, took it global,\" Bain wrote in a series of tweets announcing his departure. \n\"I look at what we've built together and how far we've come, and I feel like I can leave the company now in a place of strength.\" \nIn truth, Bain leaves Twitter at a precarious time. The company has struggled to add more users and said it lost $103 million last quarter. Last month, it laid off 350 employees. Anthony Noto, Twitter's chief financial officer, will replace Bain, the company said . \nRelated: Twitter cuts 9% of staff and kills off Vine app \nTwitter stock took a hit last month after failed acquisition talks meant it would remain an independent company struggling to define itself. It continues to battle abuse and harassment that makes it unattractive to users and potential buyers, and the company recently shut down Vine , its six-second video platform. \nBain is a well-liked executive at Twitter and in the tech industry in general. He didn't mention what his future plans are, but ended his statement thanking Twitter executives -- both past and present -- for the opportunity to work alongside them. \n\"I'm excited to take w me everything I've experienced at Twitter & do something totally different and new outside the company. Stay tuned!\" Bain said. \nTwitter's stock was down 5% after hours, after small gains Wednesday on news that Donald Trump had won the presidential election. \nCNNMoney (San Francisco) First published November 9, 2016: 5:48 PM ET",

      "text": "Facebook PHOTO: Composite. ginnnach_/Twitter, Souleymane Ba/EyeEm/Getty Images \n2016 was a landmark year for hijab-wearing women. Covergirl named Nura Afia, a popular beauty blogger who wears a hijab, its latest beauty ambassador. Habiba Da Silva, a 22-year-old blogger, was lauded for designing a line of hijabs for all skin tones. Anniesa Hasibuan received a standing ovation at her New York Fashion Week show in September for being the first designer to send every single model down the runway wearing a hijab. And the 2016 Olympics marked the first time an American Olympian—fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad— represented her country sporting a hijab. \nAnd then, Donald Trump, a man who has supported Islamophobia and used hateful rhetoric against women, won the 2016 election. In the hours that followed, several Muslim women took to Twitter to express fear and sadness over their place in the country. Would their hijab now be unwelcome in Trump's America?",

More > Updated:     Wednesday,   \nNEW YORK (AP) - Twitter's chief operating officer is leaving the company, the latest high-profile departure from the troubled communication service. \nSan Francisco-based Twitter said Wednesday that Adam Bain is stepping down and will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto. It says it will now look for a new CFO. \nBain joined Twitter in 2010 and had been in charge of its business operations and worldwide moneymaking efforts. His departure appeared to rattle investors, many of whom have wanted - but failed - to see the company sold. Twitter's stock is down nearly 3 percent after hours. \nTwitter has failed to keep pace with rivals Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. Last month, it announced it was cutting 9 percent of its workforce and killing its popular, if money-losing, video-sharing app Vine. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "By Greg Gutfeld \nPublished November 09, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Pop stars are crying. Comedians clutch their Xanax.\nTrump has won.\nCher says she's moving to another planet -- as if she wasn't already living on one. Sarah Silverman mourns, making her even less funny than before -- if that's possible.\nIt's the end of the world as we know it, so why do I feel fine? Because this hysteria validates last night. The stars did everything to get Hillary elected and now they're freaking out because their entitled arrogance flopped.\n'SNL's Taran Killam tweeted \"rural = stupid\" about Trump's victory. To think, that's probably his best material. Lady Gaga looked sad in a Rolls-Royce Phantom after protesting at Trump Tower -- such a woman of the people.\nAnd though Republicans snared the presidency, kept the House and Senate, at least the Democrats still have Katy Perry. She just threatened revolution; she's Che in a thong.\nSo you can criticize trump for lots of things, but you've got to love him for the enemies he made, because they're ours too. I've said it before: You may not like Trump, but you know Hillary's fans hate you. And boy, did they make that clear.\nBut last night, the unpopular kids told the cool kids, up yours. For once, Republicans won a culture war. And it was against smug celebs, who felt you were inferior. But I guess the feeling's mutual. To us, you're just overpaid preachers.\nSo thank you, Mr. Trump, for making Lena Dunham move to Canada. She'll be the least popular Canadian export since acid rain.\n\nGreg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM/ET) .

It says it will now look for a new CFO. \nBain joined Twitter in 2010 and had been in charge of its business operations and worldwide moneymaking efforts. His departure appeared to rattle investors, many of whom have wanted — but failed — to see the company sold. Twitter's stock is down nearly 3 percent after hours. \nTwitter has failed to keep pace with rivals Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. Last month, it announced it was cutting 9 percent of its workforce and killing its popular, if money-losing, video-sharing app Vine. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.

But Donald Trump has Hollywood in such a froth that loads of celebrities are now talking about pulling up stakes. Here's a small collection of them, ranging from silly jokes to serious plans. Getty \nLena Dunham has been one of the most active celebrity Clinton supporters out there, but she says she'll move to Canada if Trump wins: \"I know a lovely place in Vancouver, and I can get my work done from there.\" Getty \nWhile promoting \"The Hateful Eight,\" Samuel L. Jackson told Jimmy Kimmel that in the wake of a Trump victory he would \"move my black ass to South Africa.\" Getty \nTrump's Super Tuesday victory in the primaries left Miley Cyrus distraught. She hasn't said where she'll go, but promised on Instagram that \"I am moving if this is my president! I don't say things I don't mean!\" Getty \nCher has a history of feuding with Trump even before he announced his candidacy and has been often asked about what she thinks about his attempts to become President. Cher tweeted that if he wins she will \"move to Jupiter.\" Getty \nIf Cher does get a SpaceX flight to another planet, she might have Jon Stewart as her window-seat buddy, as he joked to People Magazine that he “would consider getting in a rocket and going to another planet, because clearly this planet’s gone bonkers.” Getty \nEven before Trump officially got nominated, she promised on The View that she would leave for Canada if any Republican got elected: \"I literally bought my ticket, I swear.\" Getty \nNatasha Lyonne might not leave the country, but when asked by Starz where she might go, she said she might check herself into a mental hospital. Getty \nGeorge Lopez told TMZ that he would move south of the border if Trump won, and that other Latinos would come with him: \"If he wins, he won't have to worry about immigration; we'll all go back.\" Getty \nAl Sharpton said in February that he had \"reserved his ticket\" to leave if Trump won and that he would support anyone necessary to beat him. Getty \n\"House of Cards\" star Neve Campbell is a natural-born Canadian citizen, so for her moving to another country is easy, and she's said she's ready to do it. Getty \nChelsea Handler told Kelly Ripa on \"Live!\" that her plans to move aren't just words. She has already bought a house in Spain and is ready to go if necessary. \nGetty \nBarbra Streisand has been hitting the campaign trail hard for Hillary, but she too is ready to abandon ship if her campaign fails. She said she would decide between moving to Australia and Canada if Trump takes office. Getty \nIn the final days of the campaign, Bryan Cranston added his name to the exodus list: \"I would definitely move. ... It's not real to me that that would happen. I hope to God it won't.\" Getty \n\nBut some threats to leave America are a bit more tongue-in-cheek. Take Spike Lee, who vowed to respond to a Trump victory by \"moving back to the republic of Brooklyn.\" Getty Next Slide 1 of 15 \nBryan Cranston, Miley Cyrus and others may be headed overseas if they don’t get their way on Election Day \nIt's not uncommon for people to joke/threaten about leaving the U.S. if the \"wrong\" person becomes president.

In the wee hours of Wednesday morning, Trump -- the Republican nominee -- had clinched the White House, but the dramatic Brexit-style carnage expected in global markets in the wake of his win failed to hold as Trump called for the country to unite in the days ahead.

Adam Bain, the chief operating officer of Twitter, has left the company. Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto will assume his duties. Photo: BRYAN THOMAS, NYT Business News Roundup, Nov. 10 1 / 1 \nTwitter exec \nleaves firm \nTwitter Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain , who built the company’s business model, has left to explore new opportunities. \nChief Financial Officer Anthony Noto will shift to Bain’s job, and the social media company has started a search for a new finance chief, Twitter said Wednesday. Noto’s new responsibilities include global advertising sales, data and revenue products, as well as partnerships and business development, the San Francisco company said. \nBain assembled Twitter’s sales team and built its advertising from nothing into a business projected to generate $2.55 billion in revenue this year. Growth has slowed in recent quarters, hampered by the site’s stagnant user numbers. Last month, the company said it would cut 9 percent of its staff, concentrated in the sales and marketing areas that Bain had been running. \n“I’m excited to take with me everything I’ve experienced at Twitter & do something totally different and new outside the company,” Bain said in a tweet. \nNoto had been already doing more than the average chief financial officer. He is responsible for driving Twitter’s new strategy to prioritize live video, including creating partnerships with sports and news companies. \nAirlines \nAmerican adds \nfaster Wi-Fi \nAmerican Airlines plans to install faster Wi-Fi on 500 more aircraft in its domestic fleet, bolstering an earlier order with ViaSat while dealing a blow to current service provider Gogo. \nAmerican has more than 1,100 aircraft with Wi-Fi service, a number the airline said gives it one of the largest Wi-Fi-equipped fleets in the world. ViaSat’s largest North American customer to date is JetBlue Airways , which provides the service to passengers for free through a marketing partnership with Amazon.com. \nIn June, the world’s largest airline split an order between the two Wi-Fi providers, with ViaSat contracted for service on 100 new Boeing 737 Max planes and Gogo tapped to install its new 2Ku satellite service on more than 130 Airbus A319s and A320s. \nThe ViaSat installations begin next summer, while the Gogo additions will begin late next year, American Airlines spokeswoman Martha Thomas said Wednesday. \nViaSat operates its own satellites, while Gogo and Global Eagle Entertainment contract with other satellite companies. \n“Gogo remains a valued partner,” Thomas said. \nLeaving bloc \nto hurt Britain \nThe European Union says that economic growth in Britain is set to “almost halve” next year because of the impact of the June referendum vote to leave the bloc. \nIn Wednesday’s publication of the autumn forecasts, the EU said that gross domestic product growth in Britain is set to fall from a projected 1.9 percent for this year, to just 1 percent next year, before slightly picking up to 1.2 percent in 2018. \nThe biannual report says that it reflects the “impact of heightened uncertainty following the referendum and its impact on business confidence.” \nThe report also said that the 19-nation eurozone “seems to have shrugged off the result” of the vote known as Brexit, but that “the sharp increase in policy uncertainty associated with it is expected to persist.” \nIreland appeals \nApple ruling \nThe Irish government filed an appeal on Wednesday against efforts by European authorities to force Apple to pay the country $14.3 billion to cover what antitrust officials say are unpaid taxes. \nMargrethe Vestager , Europe’s competition chief, ordered Apple in August to pay the amount, alleging the company had received preferential tax rulings from the Irish government that gave Apple an unfair advantage over rivals. \nBoth Ireland and Apple deny any wrongdoing, and the appeal filed with the General Court, the top appellate court of the European Union, represents the beginning of a lengthy standoff between European authorities, and the Irish government and Apple. \n“The government fundamentally disagrees with the European Commission ’s analysis and the decision left no choice but to take an appeal,” Michael Noonan , the country’s finance minister, told European politicians on Tuesday. \nEarnings \nEpiPen maker \nposts a loss \nDrugmaker Mylan swung to a third-quarter loss, mainly due to a big settlement for overcharging the federal government for its EpiPen, the emergency allergy injector whose price Mylan has repeatedly jacked up. The results missed Wall Street expectations, and Mylan reduced its 2016 profit forecast. \nMylan said last month that it would pay $465 million to settle allegations that it overbilled Medicaid for years for its life-saving EpiPen. \nOn Wednesday, Mylan reported a third-quarter loss of $119.8 million (23 cents per share) after reporting a $428.6 million profit in the same period a year earlier. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring costs, came to $1.38 per share, well below the $1.50 per share that analysts had expected. \nChronicle News Services Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

      "text": "By Frank Schwab 2 hours ago   \nFootball players have hobbies like everyone else, and Seattle Seahawks outside linebacker Cassius Marsh’s hobby is collecting magic cards . \nSo he was rightfully upset when the cards were stolen from him. \nMarsh is trying to get his collection back by reaching out to the many Seahawks fans for help. He asked the “12s,” also known as Seahawks fans, for assistance in getting his cards back. Who ever stole my magic collection from my LR4 last night, if you are 12 plz return it and I will give you two tickets to next home game. \n— Cassius Marsh (@KingCash_7191) November 9, 2016 All you 12s do me a huge favor and retweet my last tweet. Other than god family and football, my magic card collection is everything \n— Cassius Marsh (@KingCash_7191) November 9, 2016 The backpack that they were in was stolen outside of Ashton manor while my girlfriend was inside with her friends. So Seattle area \n— Cassius Marsh (@KingCash_7191) November 9, 2016 \nIt seems like the cards were stolen out of his car (“LR4” = Land Rover 4). Seahawks teammate Frank Clark took up the fight on Twitter too. My boy @KingCash_7191 got some of his most prized possessions stolen from his Black LR4 in DT Seattle. If you got any info, let us know! \n— Frank Clark (@TheRealFrankC_) November 9, 2016 \nIf it seems unusual that a 24-year-old who is in his third NFL season would be so into Shivan Dragon and the other magic cards in the long-time game, Marsh had an answer for that too. @jvsmitty22 I'm grown enough not to be ashamed of loving a game. I get paid to play a game I love. A grown man is the same no matter what \n— Cassius Marsh (@KingCash_7191) November 9, 2016 \nHopefully for Marsh, his Twitter followers help him crack the case.

      "text": "Published November 9, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print \nBy Howard Kurtz | FoxNews.com \nEarly this morning, after he had stunned the world by winning the presidency, Donald Trump took a call from a longtime confidant.\n\"Nobody believed in me,\" Trump said. Literally, only two or three people, he said, had thought he could pull this off -- and at times, not even Trump himself. Now he had a lengthening call list of world leaders who wanted to pay their respects to the new leader of the free world.\nIt was a starkly different scene last June, when the businessman was still seen as a hopeless underdog. Trump was on his blue-and-red Boeing 757, huddling with his top staffers, who were begging him not to talk about Gonzalo Curiel.\nTrump had a score to settle. He told his staff he wanted to denounce the judge handling the lawsuit against Trump University. His advisers pushed back hard, saying this would be a huge distraction, that Trump had to be seen as fighting for America, not for himself.\nThe unofficial Republican nominee took the plunge anyway, calling the Indiana-born judge, whose parents were from Mexico, a “hater” who had “an inherent conflict of interest.”\nRead the full story at FoxNews.com→",

      "text": "Twitter says COO Adam Bain to leave, Noto to take his place Reuters Posted at Nov 10 2016 10:03 AM \nShare Facebook \nBENGALURU - Twitter Inc. said on Wednesday that Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain, widely credited with building a robust advertising business at the company even as it struggled with user growth, is leaving to explore other opportunities. \n\"Mr. Bain will remain at Twitter in the coming weeks to assist with the transition of the chief operating officer role,\" the company said. \nThe move is a blow for struggling Twitter, which has hired bankers to field acquisition offers but has seen a dearth of potential bidders. The company said last month it would cut 9 percent of its global workforce to keep costs down. \nTwitter shares were down 4.3 percent in after-hours trading. \nBain will be replaced by Chief Financial Officer Anthony Noto, the company said, adding it would begin a search for a new CFO. \nNoto, who became the finance chief in 2014, will continue to manage the live content business as well as Twitter's global advertising sales, data and mobile ad exchange MoPub. \nBain joined Twitter in 2010 when it had almost no revenue and built an advertising sales machine that generated some $2.2 billion last year. A popular executive who was once considered a possible chief executive for the company, Bain was named COO in October last year. \n\"I think Adam Bain is the most competent person at Twitter,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. \"The one part of the business that actually worked was the part he works on, which is advertising.\" \nIn announcing his departure on Twitter, Bain heaped praise on CEO Jack Dorsey and added: \"I'm excited to take w me everything I've experienced at Twitter & do something totally different and new outside the company. Stay tuned!\" \nTwitter has assumed a central role in public conversations around the world and U.S. President-elect Donald J. Trump made it a centerpiece of his controversial election campaign. \nBut the company has struggled to make the service appealing to a broad audience and has been unable to address problems with abuse and harassment on the platform, which unlike rival Facebook allows people to remain anonymous. \nWith user growth stagnant at a little over 300 million compared to 1.7 billion for Facebook, Twitter has seen its stock price plunge to below $18 from a peak of $69 in early 2014. The company went public at $26 in 2013. \nTwitter Inc said on Wednesday that Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain, widely credited with building a robust advertising business at the company even as it struggled with user growth, is leaving to explore other opportunities. \n\"Mr. Bain will remain at Twitter in the coming weeks to assist with the transition of the chief operating officer role,\" the company said. \nThe move is a blow for struggling Twitter, which has hired bankers to field acquisition offers but has seen a dearth of potential bidders.

It says it will now look for a new CFO. \nBain joined Twitter in 2010 and had been in charge of its business operations and worldwide moneymaking efforts. His departure appeared to rattle investors, many of whom have wanted \" but failed \" to see the company sold. Twitter's stock is down nearly 3 percent after hours. \nTwitter has failed to keep pace with rivals Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. Last month, it announced it was cutting 9 percent of its workforce and killing its popular, if money-losing, video-sharing app Vine. About Us",
