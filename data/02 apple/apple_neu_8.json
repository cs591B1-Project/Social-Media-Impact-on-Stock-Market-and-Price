      "text": "Comment The Razer Blade is perfect for those who prioritise gaming over other factors. Twitter \nApple's MacBook Pro is said to be the best-selling laptop as of late, but there are those who are not fans of the laptop. If you are one of those looking for an alternative to the Macbook Pro, then good news because there are plenty of other choices for you to choose from. It all depends on what you require from the laptop that you intend to buy. Forbes has given some other laptops for consumers to consider as their option over the Macbook Pro. \nRazer Blade This is perfect for those who consider gaming as their primary reason for buying a laptop. Gaming products have been a specialty of Razer for almost twenty years. They have three kinds of laptops, and the 14-inch Razer Blade is the one recommended in the article. If you are interested in screen quality, the Razer offers either a touch enabled resolution of 3200x1800 or a 1920x1010 IPS screen. It is slightly larger when compared to the Macbook, but its standout quality is that of its keyboard which uses Chroma backlighting, which will be helpful for gamers who want to utilize keys for different actions. It comes with a 2.6 GHz Inter Core i7 and 16 GB of RAM. Battery life can last for six hours. Microsoft Surface Book This laptop has a fulcrum hinge which lets the screen be detached as a tablet. There is Surface Pen included which is helpful when you just want to use it as a tablet. There are several choices for the consumers starting with the entry-level Surface Book which costs about $1499 and can have either an 8BG or 126 GB RAM, SSD from 128 GB up to 1TB and i5 or i7 Skylake processor. This product is good for productivity, and perfect for professionals wanting an alternative to MacBook Pro. HP Spectre x360 Like the Surface Book, the Spectre can also function both as a laptop and a tablet. It comes with a 1920x1080 touchscreen display which is good for Windows 10. It's one of the first to use Intel's Kabylake as its processor and it is backed by 8 GB of RAM. The Spectre is thin compared to its predecessors and has a battery of a little over nine hours when used for video streaming. ",

      "text": "Will Apple's iPhone 8 Have A Curved Display? Here's What We Know So Far 29 November 2016, 3:06 pm EST By Regina Festin Tech Times Apple - Here's What You May Not Know Now Playing Rumors for the upcoming iPhone 8 have started making rounds. Reports make that the Cupertino company has asked suppliers to increase production of OLED screens. People are anticipating the 2017 iPhones to also have wireless charging and curved screen edges. ( Apple ) Advertisement \nNext year could likely be a very big one for Apple and its iPhone lineup. It marks the 10 th year of the company that started the touch screen era for smartphones, so Apple could have exciting surprises up its sleeve. \nRumor has it that the Apple iPhone 8, which should hit the scene in 2017, would sport a curved physical design with better display resolution. \nApple has reportedly asked suppliers to boost the output for organic light emitting displays (OLEDs) and submit sample screens that have better resolutions than the ones from Samsung. This fueled anticipation for an OLED iPhone 8 in 2017. Better Screen Display Technology \nApple might use OLED screens for its iPhone 8 lineup instead of the LCD screens it traditionally equips their iPhones with. OLED screens typically provide better contrast and brightness than LCD screens. \nShould Apple push this technology for next year, it would be highly possible for the upcoming iPhone models to have curved screen edges with a borderless design . In addition, OLED screens offer deeper blacks with lower battery power consumptions unlike the LCD ones. \nThe company has already applied OLED screen technology for its Apple Watch series, while its competitors have already been using OLED in their smartphones for years. At this time, it still is unclear whether Apple would incorporate OLED technology in all its new iPhone 2017 models or reserve it for the higher-end variant. Three iPhone 8 Models Could Be Available \nIf Apple would introduce a curved iPhone 8 next year, it could be planning on releasing three different variants instead of the two kinds it has been releasing since 2014. Aside from the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone models with flat screen displays, a premium handset with screen curved on both edges sporting a 5.5-inch screen or larger could come in 2017. \nOne of the main reasons Apple could not introduce OLED technology to its entire iPhone lineup next year is because its suppliers are lagging behind Samsung in terms of OLED investments. LG Display, Sharp and Japan Display may have been producing OLED screens but they are expected to catch up with Samsung by 2018. Wireless Charging Added \nAgain, a feature that makes the iPhone lag behind the competition is the lack of wireless charging and quick charging capability. \nBut this could just change in next year's lineup as all three variants will reportedly be the first ones to sport wireless charging. Furthermore, Apple hasn't used glass rear cases since the iPhone 5, but the new iPhone 8 could return to a glass back design. \nIf all these rumors would become a reality, customers should start expecting the iPhone 8 or iPhone 7s or whatever Apple will call its 2017 iPhone models to be very expensive because OLED screens are costlier than their LCD counterparts.

      "text": "Apple will apparently release three new iPhones next year, including the OLED iPhone 8 as well as two LCD models sporting 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. While a report said the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 may become Apple’s cheapest iPhone next year, a source with an impeccable track record indicates the handset will still be an exciting upgrade.\nDON’T MISS: There’s a fix for your iPhone 6s’ serious battery drain, but you might not like it\nThe 4.7-inch iPhone 8 is expected to feature a glass body as well, and a battery that will support wireless charging. That’s exciting because Apple is reportedly working on a new type of wireless charging technology that’s not available on any other smartphone. The next iPhone might recharge from across the room. Comparatively, current smartphones that support wireless charging need to be placed on a wireless charging mat.\n“Positive prospects for 2H17F new iPhone models, with potentially unprecedented replacement demand,” KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a note seen by MacRumors .\n“Our rationale is as follows: (1) the OLED model may trigger replacement demand among high-end users given its completely all-new-design form factor and notably superior specs in comparison to the TFT-LCD models; and (2) the new 4.7” iPhone, featuring glass casing and wireless charging, looks well positioned to tap replacement demand at the entry level.”\nKuo has been very accurate with his past iPhone predictions, and this isn’t his first note on the iPhone 8. In recent weeks, Kuo also said next year’s iPhones will be available in three sizes , including two LCD and one OLED model. He also said Apple will replace aluminum with glass for the iPhone 8’s rear shell to enable wireless charging. Of note, it’s still unclear if Kuo’s recent reports refer to conventional wireless charging or the new long-range technology Apple is believed to be testing .\nTrending right now:\nLeak reveals another key Galaxy S8 feature that has never been seen before on an iPhone There’s a fix for your iPhone 6s’ serious battery drain, but you might not like it Samsung has started to turn the Galaxy Note 5 into the Note 7 See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "If you are thorough, honest and pay attention to testing, your app should be fine. \nApple App Store guidelines and review process are far from perfect. \nAnd that means that the App Store purge , where Apple is currently in the process of removing old and low quality apps , will be far from perfect as well. \nIt is thus inevitable that some well meaning apps will find themselves victims of the purge despite efforts to remain relevant in the apps economy. \nHere are the types of apps that Apple is looking to remove: Apps that have not been updated in several years. Apps that do not conform to current App Store guidelines. Apps that say they one thing but actually do something else entirely. Apps that crash upon launch of have other severe quality issues . \nIf an app is updated frequently, has current content, does not crash or have debilitating bugs , it will probably pass through Apple’s filters. If an app is of poor quality, it puts itself in danger of removal. Mobile App Testing Learn tips, techniques and trends for launching great mobile apps Get It Now \nThat being said, Apple looks for great apps that perform specific functions that provide value to actual people. If you know your app is of substandard quality, Apple encourages you to update it and to follow best practices for debugging . \nIf Apple does find issue with your app and lists it for removal from the App Store, it will contact the developer and request that the app be updated within 30 days. If the developer is unable to make the requisite changes in 30 days then the app will be removed from the App Store until an update is submitted and approved. \n“We also recommend that you address any functionality issues and update your app regularly to fix bugs , offer new content, provide additional services, or make other improvements. If you are no longer updating your app, consider removing it from the App Store,” Apple states. Common Reasons Apps Are Rejected Or Removed From The App Store \nHow do you keep your app from falling victim to Apple’s filters? The best way is to keep the app current and to pay close attention to Apple’s ever-changing App Store guidelines . \nApple takes a hard stance on a few issues. Apps that crash on launch will be rejected in the review process and put themselves in danger of being removed. Misappropriation of Apple’s brand or trademarks (such as when integrating an Apple Pay button) will lead to rejection. Inaccurate metadata for an app is a cause for rejection (Apple really wants an app to do what it says it will do). \nApple provides a periodic dashboard to developers to show common reasons an app has been rejected from the App Store. Since Apple bases its decisions for removal on the same App Store Guidelines it used to approve or reject apps, it is pertinent to know the issues that lead apps to be rejected from the App Store. \nHere are the most common reasons that an app is rejected from the App Store, as per Apple’s numbers of a seven-day trailing period on October 10, 2016: \nApp Store Guideline 2.1: App Completeness (21% of rejections) \nThis one is fairly simple: an app needs to be done when it is submitted to the App Store for approval. That means it has no placeholder text, empty websites or temporary content (scrub all of your Lorem Ipsum , for instance). Backend services should be turned on, in-app purchases should function as intended, advertising services should be working and so forth. \n“Make sure your app has been tested on-device for bugs and stability before you submit it,” Apple’s review guidelines state. “Please don’t treat App Review as a software testing service . We will reject incomplete app bundles and binaries that crash or exhibit obvious technical problems.” \nMore Information Needed (16%) \nSubmitting an app to the App Store is a lot like submitting a credit application. If you leave out information, your submission will be rejected. \nApple will reject an app if it does not list complete metadata, contact information, link to a demo account, link to backend services or provide an explanation detailed explanations of “non-obvious” features (geo-blocking, for instance) or explain features like in-app purchases. \nApp Store Guideline 2.3.7: Accurate Metadata (8%) \nMetadata gets mentioned a lot in Apple’s App Store guidelines. What is it and why is it important in the approval/rejection/removal process? \nBy definition, metadata is data that describes other data. For instance, if you take a picture, the image is the data. The metadata is the data that describes that picture, such as the timestamp, location, camera settings and so forth. If you think of an app like a picture, the metadata describes what it is, what it does (and how it does it) and where it came from. \nThe metadata section of the App Store Guidelines lists 10 items. Apple specifies that apps should not include any hidden or undocumented features and should be very clear to people what it does. \n“If you’re dishonest, we don’t want to do business with you,” Apple states. \nApple specifically rejects apps that do not conform to guideline 2.3.7 which specifies that an app should have a unique name and keywords that accurately describe the app. Apple will reject the type of search engine optimization-type of practices that have been around the Web forever like packing the metadata with trademarked terms , popular app names or irrelevant phrases. App names have a 50-character limit and should not include the description of the app. \nApp Store Guideline 2.5.4: Software Requirements (3%) \nThe software requirements guideline in the App Store is fairly reasonable. Apps need to conform to Apple’s guidelines in how they are packaged, use APIs and so forth. \nGuideline 2.5.4 is another one that basically states that an app should do what it says it is going to do … and nothing more. This guideline says that multitasking apps (which is nearly all apps) may only use background services as intended. For instance, if an app uses local services to provide notifications, it should not also be used to track that user outside of a certain area. \nSo far only a very small percentage of total app sin the App Store have been removed by Apple. But the purge is likely to be an ongoing process. Staying up to date with the App Store Guidelines will ensure … that your app actually stays in the App Store.",

      "text": "Apple recently unveiled its new generation of MacBook Pros. As the saying goes, \"for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\" — in this case it's the elimination of support for a number of Mac computers.\nAn internal memo obtained by MacRumors revealed the company's plans to add four devices to its vintage and obsolete products list on Dec. 31. They are as follows:\n— MacBook Pro (15-inch, early 2011)\n— MacBook Pro (17-inch, early 2011)\n— Mac mini (early 2009)\n— MacBook (13-inch, mid-2009)\nThis designation means Apple or any Apple Authorized Service Provider will no longer provide hardware service or repairs for these products unless owners obtain service in California or Turkey , where Apple will continue to provide support until Dec. 31, 2018.\nApple classifies vintage products as \"those that have not been manufactured for more than five and less than seven years ago.\" An Apple device then becomes obsolete when its discontinuation reaches the seven-year mark.",

      "title": "Apple Will Make Some Macs Obsolete By The End Of 2016: Is Your Computer Among Them?",
      "text": "Apple will be adding certain Mac models to its list of obsolete and vintage products by the end of the year. If you own such a device, how will you be affected? ( Ken Ishii | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nApple will be making certain Mac models obsolete by the end of the year, with some of the computers to also be added to the company's list of vintage products, according to a report by 9to5Mac. \nThere is a difference between the designation of an obsolete device and a vintage product by Apple. If your computer will be relegated to either status, it is best to know what the terms mean and how you will be affected. The Difference Between Obsolete And Vintage Apple Products \nIn the dedicated page of Apple's website, the company explained the difference between products that are tagged as obsolete and vintage. \nA vintage product is a device that has not been manufactured for more than five years ago and less than seven years ago. Apple has discontinued its hardware service for vintage products, save for a few exceptions such as in California, where such Mac computers are still receiving support. \nAn obsolete product, meanwhile, are those that have been discontinued since over seven years ago. All hardware service are discontinued for obsolete products, with no exceptions, with service providers not allowed to order parts to be used for such devices. New Obsolete And Vintage Apple Devices By The End Of 2016 \nAccording to the report by 9to5Mac, by Dec. 31, the 15-inch and 17-inch models of the MacBook Pro that were released in early 2011 will be added to the vintage list of products in the United States and Turkey and the obsolete list of products everywhere else. \nMeanwhile, the Mac mini released in early 2009 and the 13-inch MacBook released in the middle of 2009 will be added to the list of obsolete Apple products across all regions. \nOwners of these Apple products should expect support for their devices to end once 2016 rolls out, unless they live in the jurisdictions where there are exceptions for hardware services on the vintage products. Time To Upgrade Your Mac? \nFor Apple customers who own the devices that will be added to the list of obsolete and vintage products, it might be time to consider an upgrade to your MacBook Pro, MacBook or Mac mini. \nApple has recently launched the new MacBook Pro 2016 , with the models featuring the Touch Bar hitting shelves a couple of weeks ago. While there have been reports of glitches and issues concerning the notebooks, they are still very much capable machines and certainly an upgrade to the computers that will be added to the list of obsolete and vintage products.

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. How Apple’s Bozoma Saint John Learned to Have Confidence as a Teenager \nAfter spending years in Ghana, Apple global marketing executive Bozoma Saint John moved with her family to Colorado at the age of 13—a critical and often awkward time for any teenager. \nAnd Saint John was no exception. Even as a 13 year-old, she was already very tall, as she pointed out on Tuesday when speaking at Fortune ‘s Most Powerful Women Next Gen conference in Laguna Nigel, Calif. “I was like a tumbleweed,” she joked. \nAnd despite the common teenage desire to fit in and be just like everyone else, she knew it just wasn’t possible. “I couldn’t be blond, I couldn’t be white,” she said in an obvious nod to her dark skin and black hair. So her family’s move to the U.S. turned out to be an important experience and lesson in confidence for Saint John. Subscribe to The Broadsheet , Fortune’s newsletter on the world’s Most Powerful Women. \n“At 13, I learned what it meant to walk into a room and not care what everybody thinks of you,” said Saint John, whose career has already included high-profile jobs for Pepsi , Beats, and now Apple. In fact, if she could give her younger self advice, Saint John would tell a young Bozoma to be content with who she is instead of worrying about racking up achievements, she said on Tuesday.",

Sign up By Neal A. Lasta , CP Contributor Nov 29, 2016 | 9:29 AM x To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nSome consumers weren't impressed with Apple's latest smart phone: the Apple iPhone 7, and that probably explains why the anticipation for the Apple iPhone 8 is sky high. Photo: Reuters/Beck Diefenbach The Apple iPhone7 and AirPods are displayed during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, U.S. September 7, 2016. \nThe Apple iPhone 8 is the Cupertino-based company's 10 th anniversary iPhone. As such, it is hoping to boost sales during this special year by overhauling the smart phone design, features and specs; adding innovative and new capabilities. After all, the original iPhone is iconic in the sense that it introduced novel mobile internet and communication in a global scale. \nIn a more practical sense, Apple needs to boost sales next year, since it has reported its first decline in terms of annual sales since 2001 â 15 years ago. \nDesign \nThe Apple iPhone 8 is said to have a metal frame and glass back; replacing the metal casing that is in current iPhones. The premium version, 5.5-inch screen, will have a curved organic-LED screen, while the two other versions will have flat, low temperature poly-silicon displays. \nWireless Charging \nAccording to Amit Chowdhury of Forbes , wireless charging is one of the possible new features that Apple will introduce in its latest smart phone. \nChowdhury based this possibility on a Nikkei report which stated that Foxconn Technology Group is creating wireless charging modules for Apple's 10 th anniversary iPhone. A source from Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, said, \"But whether the feature can eventually make it into Apple's updated devices will depend on whether Foxconn can boost the yield rate to a satisfactory level later on.\" \nCamera \nApple is also rumored to have some state-of-the-art plans for the iPhone 8's camera . That includes dual optical image stabilization. \nIn particular, the next iPhone is said to have an LG Innotek dual-lens camera, which has 3D camera technology. Rumors regarding 3D technology in Apple iPhone 8 next year have been reinforced b7 the company's acquisition of a start-up called LinX last year. Tech Cruch reports that LinX's newest offerings include 3D picture capture. \nMing Chi-Kuo , a KGI Securities analyst well-known for his accurate Apple predictions, said that the 3 smart phones Apple will introduce in 2017 will have dual cameras that include dual optical image stabilization. \nKuo adds that there will be a 4 th model; one that has a 4.7-inch screen. This model will have an LCD screen and will just have a single-lens camera like current models, plus a single optical image stabilization feature. ",

      "text": "Apple is turning its attention and resources back to a decade-long partnership with the Product (RED) campaign today. The company has kicked off an effort meant to coincide with Thursday’s World AIDS Day and is introducing several new products, special limited-edition items for games in the App Store, and donations tied to certain Apple Pay purchases — all intended to nudge customers to join the fight against AIDS.\nAt a small press gathering in New York City on Tuesday, Apple VP Lisa Jackson said \"We’ve been part of (RED) from the beginning,\" adding that the partnership \"really aligns with who we are as a company.\" The campaign, which includes other partners such as Starbucks, Coca-Cola, and Bank of America, has raised over $360 million and directed that money to the Global Fund to fight AIDS. Apple points out that it (plus Beats) has raised nearly $120 million of that total, making it the largest corporate Global Fund contributor in the world.\nBut the company wants that number to grow much larger, with the goal being to reach the first \"AIDS-free generation\" by ending pediatric AIDS perhaps as soon as 2020. So, as Jackson said Tuesday, \"essentially, Apple is turning (RED)\" for the next two days in the following ways:\nApple retail: The company says 400 stores across five continents will either turn the Apple emblem red or display window signage related to World AIDS Day and (RED).\nApp Store: 20 popular games will release exclusive in-app purchases of (RED) content, and 100 percent of those proceeds will go to the Global Fund.\nNew products: Apple has unveiled a (RED) smart battery case for iPhone 7, a (RED) Beats Pill+, (RED) Beats Solo 3 headphones, and a (RED) leather case for the iPhone SE as the latest additions to its lineup of products linked to the campaign.\nDonations for Apple Pay purchases: Beginning today, Apple will donate $1 to (RED) \"for every purchase made with Apple Pay\" via the company’s website or at the Apple Store for a total of up to $1 million. Bank of America has also agreed to make a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, up to the same $1 million maximum. That one seems a little more likely to raise the $1 million a little faster, if you ask me.",

      "text": "Apple’s iPhone battery case finally comes in another option besides black or white: red. Today the company unveiled a Product (RED) edition of its $99 Smart Case for iPhone 7. Aside from the color, it’s the exact same case that launched alongside Apple’s latest smartphone — and as we noted in September , it also has a larger battery capacity than last year’s version for the iPhone 6S.\nBefore I switched over to the iPhone 7 Plus, I spent a couple weeks with the regular 7 and the smart battery case. And let me tell you, I became a big fan of the hump that some people consider so unsightly. The combined phone + case feels a little heavy; they weigh more together than the 7 Plus, after all. But the hump lets you keep a really good, confident grip on your phone. And the dedicated battery meter for the case that appears on your iPhone is also pretty nice. So is the passthrough Lightning connector.\nIf you choose the (RED) hump and battery case, Apple will donate a part of proceeds to The Global Fund to fight AIDS — an effort that the company (and its Beats subsidiary) have already contributed nearly $120 million towards. The Product (RED) smart battery case is available immediately at Apple’s online store and retail locations.",

      "text": "November 30 at 8:00 AM Follow @htsuka\nApple is going all out to support the RED campaign this year. (Courtesy of Apple) Apple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day.\nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono.\nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020.\nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year.\n“We’ve deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we’ve tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,” Cook said.\nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, “The Lazarus Effect,” free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes — a rendition of “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” — and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red.\nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7.\nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility.\n“That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,” he said. “This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.”\nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause — even under Cook, who has raised Apple’s philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues.\nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple — which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection — will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple’s decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens.\n“We think … corporations should have values like people do — and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,” Cook said. “I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.”\nThis year’s efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red — often stylized (RED) — after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing.\nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod — although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red.\nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million.\n“For us it’s been a game-changer, quite frankly,” Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. “We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV — which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,” Dugan said.",

      "text": "Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! \n“Apple wants us to be in an Apple world, signified by the unification of their technology and the integration of software services,” UBS analyst, Steven Milunovich, said today . I argue that connected machine learning is key to Apple’s future product and services plans. It wants to build smart everything. Think about it \nApple is working with emerging technologies as it seeks to explore future disruptive opportunities, and data analytics is part of this strategy. \nYou already use solutions powered by such analytics – if you watch video on your smartphone it is likely your carrier uses analytics to provide consistent quality of service. Apple is using data analytics across multiple products and services , including (but not limited to) Maps, iAds, Siri, iTunes and Internet services, including location-based solutions and News. \nData analytics mines the huge collections of data being created within our increasingly connected world in order to identify patterns and trends about devices, the people using them and more. The open source Hadoop solution is one of the most popular data analytics frameworks around. \nApple also uses analytics to figure out how to improve its products and how to improve the applications you use . There are other examples. Apple uses a technology called long short-term memory (LSTM) to make its Quicktype keyboard able to offer more intelligent options during conversations. \nCompany executives always say their interest in AI is because they are searching for ways in which such complex technologies can improve their customer’s lives. Big data? Big effort \nAll the same, the company effort behind these technologies is increasing in intensity. Apple CEO, Tim Cook, has also confirmed plans to open a new AI R&D research hub in Yokohama, Japan. A search for the term “Hadoop” on Apple’s recruitment website reveals positions for over 100 people with Hadoop experience, with vacancies for software engineers, analysts, researchers, application developers and data scientists, among other roles. \nApple is also expanding its Applied Machine Learning team (mostly based in Santa Clara), which seeks over a dozen new members to help it “push the envelope” of what these technologies can do. \nUnderlining the seriousness of its attempts Apple continues to invest in companies with good ideas relevant to this space, such as Turi Inc., Emotient, VocalIQ, TupleJump and more. In October the company hired its first ever director of AI, Ruslan Salakhutdinov. It’s alliance with IBM opens even more opportunities in the space. \nThis is a sustained pattern. In May last year Apple began recruiting for staff to help build its proactive machine intelligence solutions . What’s the point? \nApple understands the value of this data to the other markets in which it hopes to innovate as the next great technology transition emerges into view. \nMachine learning is seen as an essential component in a huge range of applications, from AI to AR, to robots and self-driving cars, and more. Network intelligence and proactive maintenance; app behavior; music and media recommendation systems, almost everything that can be digitized will be, and making sense of the information gathered by these systems absolutely fits with the company’s stated mission of “changing the world for the better”. \nApple clearly wants that world to be very smart. From connected devices to devices that complement each other, from wearables to ambient solutions as evidenced by its delayed AirPods , it seems clear that part of the long term ambition here is to create product platforms that weave machine intelligence intelligently (and privately ) within daily life. I imagine one of the first implications of this will be in health, where I predict analytics will improve disease control and public health . Transition time \nIn combination with Apple’s focus on services and its continued work to diversify its income base , all these moves also show a company attempting to transition away from being a purely product-based firm. \nWhile Apple denies it there are those who argue competitors have more experience in the sector, but most of them lack Apple’s experience in hardware and software product design, which I’m sure will count for something as the next tech inflection point comes into view. \nMy opinion? I think the future will become much clearer once Apple Watch Series Three (or perhaps Four) with a built-in SIM hits the streets. AirPods + connected Apple Watch + Siri 3.0 = proactive computing everywhere , and with sensors and data analytics in Health app these solutions will even warn you before you become unwell. \nGoogle+? If you use social media and happen to be a Google+ user, why not join AppleHolic's Kool Aid Corner community and join the conversation as we pursue the spirit of the New Model Apple? \nGot a story?

      "text": "AP \nApple officials have been in regular contact with the Food and Drug Administration over the past few years, discussing diagnostic apps and other unreleased health products.\nThe conversations suggest that Apple has significant ambitions in health technology far beyond the nascent services it has publicly released so far — ambitions that may lead to new products that require government regulation as health devices.\nThe meetings were not listed on FDA public calendars. They were discovered and reported by Mobi Health News , which obtained emails between Apple and FDA officials through a Freedom of Information Act request.\nWhat they talked about:  In the sometimes redacted emails seen by Mobi Health News , Apple officials discuss several unreleased products including:\nTwo \"possible (and related) products in the cardiac space\" A diagnostic app for Parkinson's disease. Fast Company previously reported Apple is working on a Parkinson's monitoring app.  The \"cardiac space\" products are interesting, although the emails seen by Mobi Health News doesn't have more details. The reporters speculate that it might have to do with an EKG attachment for Apple Watch. AliveCor, a startup, makes a similar product called Kardia Band.\nAP It's also possible that Apple is planning to integrate better heart rate tracking into future versions of the Apple Watch. \nPlus, there have been rumors from earlier this year that Apple is working on a health-focused hardware device. And Apple CEO Tim Cook has hinted that a regulated medical device is something the company would be interested in. \nThe Parkinson's app, if it were able to diagnose the disease, would most likely require federal regulation, which would make it a first for Apple. \nSince 2013 AP Apple famously met with the FDA in 2013, before the Apple Watch was released. Based on a previously FOIAed document, the two sides met to talk about what looks like later became ResearchKit and CareKit, software frameworks to make health apps on iPhones.\nBut at the time, some thought the meeting hinted at an Apple Watch that was decidedly health-focused. \nSince then, Apple has been in regular contact with FDA officials, including FDA Commissioner Robert Califf, Jeffrey Shuren, director for the agency’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, and Bakul Patel, the FDA associate center director for digital health, Mobi Health News reported . \nBoth Califf and Shuren have public calendars because they are public officials, but their Apple meetings are not listed. Some meetings appear to have been renamed because of public calendar concerns. \nApple officials involved in the talks include director of federal government affairs Tim Powderly, Bud Tribble, a VP of Software Technology, Mike O'Reilly, Apple's VP of Medical Technology, and Divya Nag, who lists her title on LinkedIn as Special Projects. \nMost of the talks centered around regulatory issues, such as how Apple's ResearchKit should be classified, how Apple approves health-focused apps in its App Store, and what working groups Apple scientists would join, according to the emails seen by Mobi Health News. \nApple health ambitions AP Cook has laid out Apple's obvious medical ambitions in public a few times, notably in May, during a public talk. \n\"We believe that health is something that is a huge problem in the world, and we think it is ripe for simplicity and a new view, and we'd like to contribute to that,\" Cook said .  \nApple has been building a large health team inside its Special Projects division that is working on a whole slew of projects, including new Apple Watch sensors, better fitness algorithms, medical record tracking and sharing, and now, apparently, cardiac devices.  \nBut if Apple were to truly attack the health space, in a way few other Silicon Valley tech giants have in the past, it would be very different from releasing new iPhones. Most medical technology is heavily regulated, and timelines for new devices can take years, which is much slower than Apple's typical pace. \nRegardless, Apple wants to be a player in digital health, and in order to get there, it has to go through and work with the FDA. \nAll of Mobi Health News ' coverage is worth a read if you're interested in the future of digital health. \nNOW WATCH: How to supercharge your iPhone in 5 minutes \n",

As with everything in Apple's Product Red line-up, a portion of the retail price will be donated to an organization that aims to fight AIDS around the world.In terms of hardware, the Product Red Smart Battery case for the iPhone 7 is the same accessory as the regular version, which is available in either black or white. This means that customers get a 2365mAh battery (which should suffice to fully charge the iPhone 7 once), the controversial back hump that almost no one likes, as well as the ability to view how much of the battery the case has left right on the iPhone 7's lock screen. The price of the new Product Red item is $99, same as what Apple asks for its regular smart battery case for the iPhone 7. At the moment, the Product Red variant of Apple's Smart Battery case for the iPhone 7 has yet to show up on Apple's website.

      "text": "  WITH Apple ’s iPhone 7 and Google’s new Pixel phones putting such an emphasis on powerful camera technology , smartphone photography is more robust than ever. And while phones typically have great built-in photography apps, many other options can be easier or expand your range. ProCamera is an excellent option for iOS devices. Using this app feels like raising a single-lens reflex camera to your eye: The first thing you see is a view through the camera lens, superimposed with many controls and information like the exposure and whether the flash is activated. With a few taps on the screen, you can display a grid to help compose a shot properly and a guide to warn if your composition is tilted (great for getting those tricky horizons straight). You can also control the white balance and the ISO setting and bring up a live histogram that shows how saturated the colors in the final photo will be. There are quick-access buttons to shoot in video, photo, high dynamic range or other modes and there’s even a bar code scanner option. Photo ProCamera includes an anti-shake feature, which waits for you to stop moving before it activates the shutter. Most impressive is ProCamera’s anti-shake feature, which waits for you to stop moving before it activates the shutter. In the settings menu, you can control most of the app’s features and select how much compression is applied to the final saved images. In other words, the app gives users professional-level control of an image. Because of its complexity, ProCamera takes a while to get used to, and the exact features depend on which iPhone you have. The app costs $5 and some features, like a low-light mode to help shoot better pictures at night, are upgrades that cost a few dollars each. It’s definitely worth it. \n  On Android, one equivalent to ProCamera is Camera FV-5 . This app also feels like using a single-lens reflex camera, with similar manual control. Camera FV-5 includes features like a live histogram, burst-mode shooting, exposure bracketing and time-lapse imagery. It also offers choices over the kind of files it saves to your device, and has a comprehensive settings page. Photo The Darkroom Photo Editor is a slightly simpler alternative to Photoshop for iOS. Unlike some other Android camera apps, Camera FV-5 has a professional-looking and easy-to-use interface. It costs $4. To edit that perfect portrait or landscape photo, Adobe’s software is the choice of professional photographers. There is a version for mobile devices too — Adobe Photoshop Fix — which lets you heal an image’s blemishes, adjust shadow intensity, fix the contrast or add effects like vignetting. There is also a powerful liquefy tool that can distort the image in a smooth way to pull off some shape-modifying effects.",

      "title": "How to Check if Your iPhone 6s is Eligible for Apple’s Free Battery Service Program",
      "text": "| Quick Tip \nApple earlier this month announced a free repair program for certain iPhone 6s models which suffer from battery issues, with the company asking users to visit their local Apple Store if their device was experiencing problems. But now, thanks to a little bit of inside information courtesy of 9to5Mac , users can check to see if their iPhone 6s is even eligible for the repair program before they leave home. The iPhone 6s “Unexpected Shutdown” Problem \nEarlier this year, some iPhone 6s owners began to see their devices automatically power off even though ample battery charge remained. Apple officially acknowledged the problem this month, stating that the issue affected only a “very small number” of iPhone 6s devices that were manufactured between September and October 2015. There’s no confirmation from Apple on what exactly constitutes a “very small number,” but many iPhone 6s users expressed their frustration on various forums and in social media. \nUsers who have experienced unexpected shutdowns with their iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are asked to take their device to an Apple Retail Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider for diagnosis and a free repair. However, Apple notes that users with damaged iPhones, such as cracked screens or water damage, may be ineligible for the free battery repair without first paying for the unrelated out-of-warranty damage. \nUnlike prior service repair programs, Apple is not offering an online tool for users to verify their device eligibility. Such tools typically involve users entering their device’s serial number for confirmation. However, information provided by Apple Retail employees to 9to5Mac allows users to perform the same serial number check at home, potentially saving you a trip to the Apple Store. Check Your iPhone 6s Serial Number for Eligibility \nTo check your iPhone 6s or 6s Plus, you’ll need to find your device’s serial number. The easiest place to find this number is in the Settings app. Just navigate to Settings > General > About and you’ll see the serial number listed near the bottom. \nAlternatively, you can also find the serial number on your iPhone 6s retail box, or by connecting the device to a computer running iTunes and checking on the device page . \nNext, you’ll need to compare the fourth and fifth characters of your serial number against the list below. If the fourth and fifth characters match one of the entries below, it means your device is potentially affected by the battery flaw, and you’ll want to schedule your visit to the Apple Store. Q3",

      "text": "Patrick O'Rourke \nNovember 30, 2016 11:15am \nTo commemorate the 10-year anniversary of Apple’s decade-long partnership with Red [(PRODUCT)RED], the tech giant has tasked popular iOS game developers with adding specific Red-branded features to their titles, in order to raise money and awareness surrounding the global initiative to fight HIV and AIDS. \n“When we thought about 10 years with Red, we thought okay, ‘Apple’s got to light up Red all the way across [our platforms],” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice-president of environment policy and social initiatives in an interview with MobileSyrup . \nRed, founded in 2006 by U2 frontman and activist Paul Hewson (Bono) and Bobby Shriver, has the overarching goal of fighting AIDS through partnerships with various high-profile brands and product manufacturers, including Apple. \nEach partner releases special, limited edition versions of its popular products that adopt the project’s bright red colour, with 50 percent of the profit earned from Red branded items being donated directly to the Global Fund. Dubbed ‘ethical consumerism,’ the initiative has been an interesting and arguably successful amalgamation of humanitarian aid and for-profit business for the past decade. \nMore than $360 million USD has been raised through Red since its inception, with Apple, including its Beats brand, contributing $120 million of that sum, making it the largest corporate partner in Red’s Global Fund, according to the organization. \n“To give you context, the medicine that we keep talking about costs 30 cents a day. The $120 million that Apple has raised over the past 10 years can provide nearly 400 million days of lifesaving medicine,” said Chrysi Philalithes, Product Red’s chief digital strategist. \nThis year Apple has tapped 20 popular video game developers spanning various genres in order to offer limited edition custom Red content via its App Store, with all proceeds stemming from in-app purchases contributing to Red’s Global Fund. In addition to Apple’s App Store offerings, the Cupertino, California-based company has also launched a Red iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case, iPhone SE case, Beats Solo 3 wireless on-ear headphones and a Pill+ portable speaker, with all these branded items now available in Apple Stores around the world. Strangely, and this has become a theme each year with Red, apart from its iPod line, no other Apple device, like the iPhone 7 or iPad for example, are included in the initiative. \nIn terms of specific game offerings, Outerminds’ ultra-popular PewDiePie’s Tuber Simulator developer Outerminds, a small team of just 13 based out of Montreal, was contacted by Apple to position their title as one of App Store’s marquee Red in-app titles. Tuber Simulator’s limited edition Red features consist of special in-game items — including a massive room-spanning red race car — and PewDiePie delivering thought-provoking facts about the deadly disease to players in an uncharacteristically thoughtful way. PewDiePie is known for his dry, self-deprecating humour, both on his YouTube channel, which now has 49 million subscribers (that’s more than the population of Canada ), as well as his various other multimedia offerings. \n“Our demographic is weird because PewDiePie’s audience is young and old, though we know that our demo is a bit younger,” said Outerminds co-founder Guiz de Pessemier, emphasizing that because his title’s audience skews to a mostly a younger audience, he hopes his studio will play a role in building AIDS awareness in a younger generation. \n“We’re targeting an audience that will hopefully grow up and contribute to the cause,” said de Pessemier. With millions of downloads since its launch a little over two months ago, Tuber Simulator is a ideal example of how Apple’s Product Red partnership is evolving to reach a younger audience. \nKabam, another Canadian developer, is also adding Product Red specific Power Packs to its iOS title Marvel Contest of Champions. Other specific in-game Red features include bonus roll packs in Scopely’s free-to-play version of Yahtzee With Buddies , a game that processes an astounding 40 million turns a day. Natural Motion’s CSR 2 , a racing title that features an attention to detail rarely seen in the mobile gaming Space, is adding a unique Red version of Bugatti’s Chiron supercar, as well as mystery crates, with all proceeds set to go directly to Red. \nBig name titles like Angry Birds 2 , the franchise that arguably helped bring mobile gaming to the level of popularity it currently sits at, particularly when it comes to Apple’s App Store, is also participating in this year’s Red initiative. In Angry Birds 2, for example, the game is branded with a special Red splash screen and ‘Red,’ which is coincidentally also the name of Angry Birds’ famous rouge-coloured disgruntled avian. Red now has a special ability that doles out extra damage. One of Rovio’s popular Angry Birds offshoots, Angry Birds Pop!, is set to include specific red features as well. \nOther games that are participating in Apple’s Red initiative this year include: Best Fiends , Best Fiends Forever , Boom Beach, Candy Crush Jelly Saga , Clash Royale , Clash of Clans , Farm Heroes Saga , FarmVille: Tropic Escape , FIFA Mobile , Hay Day, Plants vs. Zombies Heroes , SimCity BuildIt and War Dragons . \nAlong with its Red in-app Store offerings, Apple says it’s also donating $1 to Red’s cause for every purchase facilitated through Apple Pay, specifically via Apple.com, the Apple Store, and the App Store; transactions not included in these three platforms will not be part of Red. The total amount of money that can potentially be donated through this portion of Apple’s Red program is capped at $1 million. Apple’s iTune platform is also participating in the initiative by offering The Lazarus Effect for free in order to build AIDS awareness, as well as contributing all proceeds from the Killers’ new compilation holiday album, Don’t Waste Your Wishes, to the Global Fund. \nOver 35 million lives have been lost to AIDS since the discovery of the virus and 37 million people are living with HIV or AIDS still today. Every two and a half minutes an adolescent child is infected with the virus. In 2012 One acquired Red as division of One though both organizations are co-founded by Bono and Shriver.

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day   1:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day  00 PM Hayley Tsukayama   \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "text": "Apple is making its biggest push yet to help eliminate AIDS in what CEO Tim Cook says is part of a broader effort by the company to do what’s right.\nApple said it would increase its donations to (RED) campaign, which is focused on helping people with AIDS and has an ultimate goal of eradicating the disease by 2030. In an interview with USA Today published on Wednesday, Cook said that Apple’s mission is to improve the world, and that the (RED) initiative is an important part of that effort.\n“We put our weight behind lots of things in the civil rights area,” Cook said, referring to Apple’s work with (RED). “Similarly, I think it’s key that people think about what they stand for and help their communities. We always say that we want to leave the world better than we found it. So, we try to thoughtfully decide how we can do that.”\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nOver the next week, Apple will donate to the (RED)-supported Global Fund based on sales of certain specially tailored content in games available in its App Store. The games include Angry Birds, FarmVille: Tropic Escape, Hay Day. \nIn addition, Apple has expanded its lineup of products for which a portion of the proceeds will go to AIDS research. Those products, called (PRODUCT)RED, include an iPhone 7 smart battery case, the iPhone SE case, Beats Solo 3 wireless headphones, and a Pill+ portable speaker. All will be available in a red color and permanently part of the (PRODUCT)RED campaign. Apple hasn’t shared exactly what percentage of sales of those products will go to AIDS research.\nFinally, Apple says that between Dec. 1 and Dec. 6, it will make a $1 donation--up to $1 million--for every purchase made via its mobile-payment service Apple Pay at the Apple Store, on Apple.com, or through its Apple Store app.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nFor 10 years, Apple has participated in the (RED) campaign. Although the company’s participation is aimed at raising money, Cook told USA Today that he hopes it will also raise awareness for the cause.\n“Whether you want to donate or just learn about the issue, we wanted there to be something for everyone,” Cook said.\nIn a statement, Apple added that in the last 10 years since it’s been working with (RED), 70 million people have benefited from grants offered by the Global Fund. Apple added that 1,200 children were born with AIDS in 2007, and by 2020, that could reach zero.\nApple’s new PRODUCT(RED) products are available now. Apple’s expanded efforts are intended to mark World AIDS Day 2016, which will is Thursday.",

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day   1:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day  00 PM Hayley Tsukayama   \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

Atherton posted Nov 30th, 2016 at 1:29pm \nScreenshot by author, from YouTube \nApple Campus 2 As Seen By Drone \nThis donut-shaped campus is wider than the Pentagon. \nOn a vast lot in Cupertino, California, Apple is building an immaculate world. Campus 2, the massive expansion of the tech giant’s offices is a tremendous work of engineering, a planned facility dedicated to creating and sustaining the success of the most valuable company in the world. \nSo what does it look like when a company tries to build a bridge to the future, within the constraints of the present? It looks like a massive, 20,000-car garage, covered in solar panels, that’s what. \nThe drone-shot footage comes from Sexton Videography , whose latest campus tour shows the under-construction behemoth. \nThe glass panes, and there are hundreds in the main donut-shaped structure, were specially made in Germany and shipped through the Panama Canal. For more details on the campus, check out Popular Science ’s tour of the under-construction facility from earlier this year. \nOver three years ago, Peter Burrows for Bloomberg wrote that \"[Late co-founder Steve] Jobs wanted no seam, gap, or paintbrush stroke showing; every wall, floor, and even ceiling is to be polished to a supernatural smoothness.\" \nSee how progress is faring, below: Tags:",

      "title": "Tech Tip: Add Folders to the Mac’s Sidebar",
      "text": "  Q. My Mac does not show a Pictures folder in the sidebar window. Why? A. The Finder , Apple’s desktop system of icons, files and folders for its Mac computers, can be customized in many ways. If you do not see a Pictures folder in the sidebar (the left pane of an open folder window in the Finder), it most likely has not been enabled in the settings — but you can change it. To get started, click the Finder icon on the left side of the Mac’s desktop dock ; if you have not noticed it before, the Finder icon looks like a two-toned blue smiling face that some have speculated was influenced by the artist Pablo Picasso . Next, go to the Finder menu in the upper-left corner of the screen and select Preferences from the menu. Photo In the Mac’s Finder Preferences box, click the Sidebar tab to change what you see on the left side in an open Finder window. Credit The New York Times In the Finder Preferences box, click the Sidebar tab to see a list of all the items you can show or hide in the left pane of a Finder window. In the Favorites area, turn on the checkbox next to Pictures, Movies, Music and any other icons you wish to see in the sidebar. Along with your favorite icons, the sidebar can also display other places around the Mac that you can jump to with a mouse click, like iCloud folders . The Shared area can show the Back to My Mac feature, connected file servers or devices using Bonjour networking. In the Devices list, you can choose to show or hide your Mac’s main icon, its hard drive icon, connected external drives or connected media like DVDs or an iPod. In later versions of the Mac operating system, you can also show Finder tags in the sidebar. The other tabs in the main Finder Preferences box contain other settings. You can do things like choose tag colors, display connected device icons on the Mac’s desktop or show three-letter extensions on file names. \nPersonal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to .

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day   1:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "title": "If you’re buying a new Apple MacBook laptop, here’s what you should know about its processors",
      "text": "Pointing it out. (Reuters/Beck Diefenbach) Share Mike Murphy 11 mins ago \nApple’s newest MacBook Pro laptops have been met with mixed reviews . Some are concerned that the laptops are underpowered for the price Apple is charging, especially given that the company is using Intel processors that were released over a year ago. \nOne way that Apple attempts to make up for the slower, older chips it’s using in its newest MacBooks and MacBook Pros is to lean into a piece of marketing jargon invented by Intel. On every marketing and purchase page on Apple’s website, the company makes sure to mention something called Turbo Boost alongside a computer’s clock speed—the measurement of how fast a computer’s processor runs. Turbo Boost is a term invented by Intel to show that its processors can withstand being forced to run a little faster than they are listed as being able to do. \nIn the case of Apple’s newest, cheapest, MacBook Pro , that means the processor, which is listed as running at 2 GHz can withstand being run at up to 3.1 GHz for periods of time. You have no control over this—the computer will automatically over-clock the processor when it thinks it’s needed: “Whether the processor enters into Intel Turbo Boost Technology and the amount of time the processor spends in that state depends on the workload and operating environment,” Intel says on its marketing page about the technology. \nBut seeing as this technology is inherent to Intel’s chips, rather than something Apple has come up with, it’s obviously also available in every other companies’ computers that uses the same line of Intel chips. Popular laptops from Lenovo , HP , and Dell all have chips that have Turbo Boost, but none of these companies uses Intel’s term in its marketing. Dell says that its laptops have speeds “up to” their Turbo Boost speeds, as does HP, and Lenovo just doesn’t mention it. \nTo be fair, Apple is clearer than some PC makers about what the base processor speed is, by providing that separately from the boost speed. Dell, for example, says that its XPS 13 laptop has a seventh-generation Intel Core i5-7200U processor that runs “up to 3.1 GHz,” which on Intel’s site is listed as a 2.5 GHz processor that can Turbo Boost up to 3.1 GHz. \nIt’s not entirely clear when Apple began employing the “Turbo Boost” term—it started using Intel chips in its computers 11 years ago, and there are questions on Apple’s support page asking what the term means from 2012. \nThe speed of processors is most relevant for computing-intensive tasks, such as editing videos or playing videogames. It’s unlikely to be a major factor affecting the zippiness of your experience browsing the web or working on text documents. But for people shelling out thousands of dollars for Apple’s highest-end laptops, it’s worth knowing how the computing power compares to what’s available elsewhere, especially when some Windows competitors use newer Intel technology. \nApple has addressed why it’s using the older processors in its new MacBook Pros: Newer Intel chips were not available at the different sizes that Apple wanted for all of its new laptops. But, add the older processors to the concerns over the sheer number of adapters you’d need to buy to have the same types of ports available on last year’s laptops, the lack of the safe power cable Apple employed for a decade, and the questions over whether the new Touch Bar screen is worth the additional cost, and it’s easy to see why some longtime Mac users are considering switching to Windows machines.

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day  00 PM Hayley Tsukayama   \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "text": "Can Apple’s iPad Pro actually replace a laptop? \nZachary Gilbert \nNovember 30, 2016 11:00am \nMost modern tablet ads emphasize how the iPad or Surface can become your daily device, completely replacing the functions of a traditional Mac or PC. But can a tablet really replace your laptop or desktop? \nOver the last few weeks I set out to find the answer after switching over to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro for many of my daily tasks. \nBoth Apple and Microsoft are currently running various ads attempting to sell the idea that people can use their iPad, particularly the iPad Pro — or in Microsofts world, the Surface — as both a laptop and a tablet. Over the past month, I’ve been using a combination of my MacBook Pro and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and I’ve concluded that Apple really does makes a compelling argument that the Pro is capable of offering the same functionality as a standard Mac. \nOverall, I like the 12.9-inch iPad Pro’s large display and the ample screen real-estate it gives me for spread sheets, various applications and of media content like Netflix or YouTube. I’ve also found that the Apple Pencil (it’s unfortunately sold separately) adds functionality for both creative and business use cases. Lastly, the optional Smart Keyboard has made a significant difference as well in terms of the tasks I’m capable of completing with the iPad Pro. \nHere is a brief look at how the iPad Pro fit into my day as MobileSyrup’s social media manager: Friday 5:45am — My alarm goes off \nAt 5:45am my alarm goes off and my Phillips Hue lights flip on signalling the start of my day. If I was still using my Mac, I would have had the laptop sitting on on my night side table, but that’s no longer the case with the iPad Pro. I open my eyes, attempt to get adjusted to the brightness, and flip open the iPad Pro. \nNext, I open Facebook and Twitter side by side using the iPad’s multitasking feature in order to get caught up with any news I’ve missed while sleeping. Then I open MobileSyrup and look at what content was published throughout the night and to see the comments the community has written. At this point it’s about 6:15am, and my final task is a quick check of the site’s social media accounts before preparing to head into the office. 7:00am — My commute \nMobileSyrup’s office is located in downtown Toronto and I live within about an hour drive of the city. Unfortunately driving into the city at 7:30am is torture, so I typically take the Go Train. It’s now 7:39am and the train is pulling into the station. I grab a seat and pull out my iPad. My commute on the train is about an hour, so I have a decent amount of time to get some work done, or watch Netflix. \nThe particular iPad Pro I’m using right now features LTE connectivity, so I’m able to check my email or watch an episodes of the Walking Dead on the train (if I wasn’t using the LTE version I could always tether to my iPhone). I sometimes use this time to catch up on Sunday’s Walking Dead episode. Is Glen okay? That episode was a whirl wind. \nNext on my commute ritual is my daily email session. With the iPad Pro I have my email and iMessage app open side by side, multitasking for the win! Now we’re at Union station and it’s time to pack up the tablet, which is an easier process when compared to a traditional laptop. It requires less work than booting up my computer and trying to straddle is on my lap in a crapped train car. 8:45am — At the office \nWhen I started this experiment I spent a lot of time sitting at my desk thinking, “can I actually got through a day with just this iPad Pro?” though those thoughts slowly disappeared after a few days. \nNext, I open Sprout Social, our social media platform, an easy process. Now I get an email and hit command tab on the iPad keyboard in order to flip between sprout social and mail. This is when it clicked for me and I began thinking to myself “I can do this.” Now I need to edit an image in Photoshop; okay I’ll need to use my Mac for this one, but thats okay. The keyboard case made typing emails and replying to comments from the MobileSyrup community easy. Touchscreen keyboards are nice, but nothing beats full physical QWERTY input. 12:00pm — Lunch \nOn a typical day I’ll use Uber Eats or Ritual to order my lunch. This is where the iPad Pro once again comes in handy. It of course has access to the full iOS App Store, so I can use the native app for either food platform. \nIt looks like Nook has a deal on for double the points; I’ll go with that. 3:00pm – Newsletter time \nTime has surprisingly flown by and using the iPad for most of my daily tasks instead of the MacBook has been surprisingly easy. I’ve only had to use my Mac a few times, but to some extent, I expected that’s how things would pan out. Now it’s time for me to build our weekly newsletter (signup for MobileSyrup’s newsletter if you haven’t). \nTo completely this task I unfortunately can’t use the iPad Pro. I need to use advanced Photoshop features along with a few desktop specific applications. I really wish the iPad Pro supported mouse input because that would make completely tasks like this actually possible. Luckily I’m still able to do a quick transfer of the photos needed for the newsletter from the iPad to my Mac with iCloud. I was also able to use the Apple Pencil to mockup the newsletter in Adobe Comp CC or use it to Fill & Sign to fill out a PDF. 4:00pm – Days end \nAs the work day draws to a close I typically do one last check of my emails, an incredible easy task to complete with the iPad. Next, I use the Pro one last time to schedule content in order to fill out our weekend social presence. Thanks to the the iPad Pro’s multitasking feature this process is a breeze. And, I’m done! That was easier than I expected. 6:30pm – I’m home \nThe day is now over and I managed to use the iPad Pro for about 90 percent of what I need to accomplish on a daily base. Now, today wasn’t a day that I needed to update any spreadsheets, but I don’t think it would have been an issue if I needed to. The tablet supports Microsoft office, so there are no issues there. While today ran smoothly, I’m still hesitant when it comes to using the Pro as a full-time laptop replacement — I’ll have to sleep on that one. \nSo there you have it, this has been my day using almost only the iPad Pro. \nIn my role at MobileSyrup I could almost use an iPad Pro as a daily driver, but I feel it fits better into my daily workflow as a more accessible supplement to my laptop. There are many occasions where the iPad Pro is more convenient, for example, like during my train ride into the city. I think there is added benefit to using the iPad Pro around with the keyboard in situations where I don’t want to carry a heavier laptop in my bag, or if I’m headed to the cottage for the weekend. \nFor many people, depending on their job and expectations, the iPad Pro, whether it’s the 9.7-inch or 12.9-inch iteration, could actually be a laptop replacement. For me, however, I’ve found it to be a solid supplement to my Mac.",

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day   1:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day   1:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

Staff Writer, Macworld | Nov 30, 2016 12:15 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Apple Apple flirts with, but doesn't commit to touchscreen \nApple’s decade-long support of the (RED) campaign, which raises money for the Global Fund’s fight against AIDS, continues this week with proceeds from sales of games, devices, and even exclusive albums going toward prevention and treatment of the disease. \nSome of the most popular games in the App Store are offering (RED)-themed in-app purchases and donating all the proceeds to the Global Fund. Angry Birds, Farm Heroes Saga, Plants vs. Zombies Heroes, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and 16 other genre-spanning iOS games are participating this year. Apple is showcasing all (RED) game offerings in the Featured section of the App Store, so just open the app and go wild. \nApple sells (RED) products and accessories—which are literally red—all year long, but the company is offering four new additions this year, including an iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case, iPhone SE case, Beats Solo 3 wireless on-ear headphones and the Pill+ speaker. \nFrom Dec. 1 through Dec. 6, the company is donating $1 from every Apple Pay transaction made through Apple.com or the Apple Store app and at physical Apple store locations up to $1 million. Bank of America will match that $1 million with a donation for every Apple Pay transaction with a B of A card. \nYou can also donate to the (RED) campaign by downloading a new holiday album from The Killers called “Don’t Waste Your Wishes” on iTunes. You can download the 2010 Spike Jonze documentary about (RED) called “The Lazarus Effect” from iTunes for free to learn more about the campaign and its goal to end AIDS by 2030. \nApple is by far the largest corporate supporter of (RED), which was founded in 2006 by U2 frontman Bono and provides antiretroviral treatment to millions living with HIV and AIDS. Apple has contributed a third of the $360 million (RED) has raised in the last decade, and that money has helped reduce the number of babies born with HIV from 1,200 to 400 a day. \n“400 a day is obviously still 400 too many, but we are on target to have an AIDS-free generation in 2020,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told BuzzFeed . \nIf you walk into one of the 400 Apple stores decked out in red in the next week, now you’ll know what it—and the company as a whole—stands for.

In the service document, Apple admits that some 27-inch iMac models shipped between December 2012 and July 2014 may have been affected by an issue with the display hinge. It would not be able to support the weight of the screen, making it impossible to adjust because it just kept tilting forward.

      "text": "Cook talks Apple's social activism in interview promoting World AIDS Day plans By Wednesday, November 30, 2016, 09:26 am PT (12:26 pm ET) In an interview published on Wednesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook touted the company's World AIDS Day charity initiatives, while insisting that he and the company are acting beyond selfish interests. \"Of course corporations should have values, because people should have values,\" the executive told USA Today . \"And corporations are just a bunch of people.\" Cook noted that Apple throws its weight behind many civil rights issues, and he thinks it's \"key that people think about what they stand for and help their communities.\" The company wants to \"leave the world better than we found it,\" he continued. The executive deflected charges of hypocrisy, given that Apple's social and charity stances can serve as a form of marketing, and the company continues to do business in countries where homosexuality is illegal —despite Cook himself being gay and the company taking an active, sometimes political role in U.S. LGBT issues. For World AIDS Day, the company is mostly just donating proceeds from some media and accessory sales, along with a small portion of Apple Pay transaction fees. \"We'll always help the most people through our products, because they empower people to do great things themselves,\" Cook claimed. \"But this (RED) partnership allows us to touch a group of people we normally wouldn't. Sub-Saharan Africa is not a big marketplace for us. This is about trying to lift people up.\" Asked whether Apple plans to take on new social matters in 2017, the CEO said his company will stay the course. \"We haven't shied away from being visible on a number of topics, and if it's something in our wheelhouse, we'll always be visible and stand up to protect as well as advance people's rights,\" he commented. \"Every generation has a responsibility of expanding the definition of those rights, to move forward. So we'll very much continue to do that.\" Topics:",

World AIDS Day is observed on Dec. 1 every year to raise the awareness in the fight against HIV. (Niranjan Shrestha / Associated Press) WEDNESDAY, NOV. 30, 2016, 1:15 P.M. Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day By Hayley Tsukayama Washington Post Twitter \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n“We’ve deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we’ve tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,” Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, “The Lazarus Effect,” free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes – a rendition of “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” – and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple’s most important charitable responsibility. \n“That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,” he said. “This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.” \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause – even under Cook, who has raised Apple’s philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple – which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection – will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple’s decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n“We think … corporations should have values like people do – and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,” Cook said. “I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.” \nThis year’s efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red – often stylized (RED) – after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod – although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n“For us it’s been a game-changer, quite frankly,” Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it’s still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. “We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV – which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,” Dugan said.   1:15 p.m.",

      "text": "While Apple’s rumored TV streaming service has fallen by the wayside, AT&T has managed to swoop in with a compelling TV streaming service of its own. Dubbed DirecTV Now , the new streaming service from Ma Bell offers users the ability to enjoy 60+ channels (in 1080p resolution when available) for just $35/month. As far as cable packages are concerned, you’ll be hard pressed to find a deal that offers more bang for your buck than what AT&T is bringing to the table. Of course, users willing to pay more can receive as many as 120+ channels.\nDON’T MISS: This is why your iPhone 7’s battery might die in a year\nAT&T earlier this week said that its highly anticipated TV service would go live sometime today, and interested subscribers might be excited to know that the DirecTV Now app is now live on Apple’s App Store for iOS and tvOS.\nAs we highlighted earlier in the week, the 4 DirecTV Now subscription options are as follows:\nLive a Little – $35 / month (60+ channels) Just Right – $50 / month (80+ channels) Go Big – $60 / month (100+ channels) Gotta Have it – $70 / month (120+ channels) Some of the notable channels available as part of the wallet-friendly Live a Little package include: A&E, AMC, Animal Planet, BET, Bravo, CNBC, CNN, Comedy Central, CSPAN, Discovery Channel, Disney, E!, ESPN, Food Network, the History Channel, Lifetime, MTV, Nickelodeon, TBS, TLC, TNT, the USA Network and more.\nFor anyone on the fence about subscribing, you might be interested to know that AT&T is giving away free Apple TV devices to new subscribers who commit to a three month subscription. Users willing to commit to a one month subscription will receive a free Amazon Fire TV stick. All told, DirecTV Now is arguably the type of TV streaming service Apple should have launched.\nOther devices compatible with DirecTV Now include Android smartphones and tablets, iPhones, iPads, Chromecast and Google Cast. Compatible browsers for the PC and Mac crowd include Internet Explorer, Safari and Google Chrome.\nAs far as usability goes, each subscription allows up to two simultaneous streams, making it a less than ideal solution for large families with multiple TVs. It’s also worth noting that the service does not include any DVR functionality, though that may be coming as an additional feature later on down the line. Lastly, DirecTV Now users have the ability to sign up for HBO for just $5/month.\nTrending right now:\nThis is why your iPhone 7’s battery might die in a year All of the new features the Android 7.0 Nougat update will bring to the Galaxy S7 What it takes to get a NES Classic See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Technology   8:37pm GMT Cook ups Apple support for fight against AIDS Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook waves during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, U.S. September 7, 2016. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach By Julia Love \nApple Inc ( AAPL.O ) is expanding its support for the fight against AIDS through the (RED) charity founded by rock singer Bono, Chief Executive Tim Cook said in an interview ahead of World Aids Day. \nOver the next week, the company will expand its line of (RED) products and donate $1 for each transaction made using mobile payment Apple Pay in its physical and online stores, up to a total of $1 million. Bank of America ( BAC.N ) will contribute up to that sum for Apple Pay transactions using its cards. \n\"There's still way too many people dying of AIDS, still too many kids being born with HIV, and so we are continuing to press really hard,\" Cook said in the interview. \nUNAIDS predicts the number of babies born with HIV could drop to near zero by 2020 from around 400 per day now, Apple said. \nThe (RED) campaign is an example of \"cause-related marketing,\" a style of philanthropy that some critics say is self-serving because they promote corporate brands as much as the underlying cause. \nCook told Reuters that Apple can have a far greater impact by raising awareness among consumers than by simply writing a check. \"When we put ourselves into something, it's worth a lot more than just money,\" he said. \n(RED) was one of Apple's highest profile philanthropic efforts under former Chief Executive Steve Jobs, who largely avoided corporate giving. The company has been responsible for about $120 million of the $360 million (RED) has raised since it was founded in 2006. \n(Reporting by Julia Love, editing by Peter Henderson) Next In Technology News",

      "text": "| Editorial \nThere has been a lot of negative coverage about Apple lately. Is it because Apple is executing poorly? Is it because the company is losing touch with customers? Is executive management overwhelmed? Or is it simply due to the rise of tribalism in the Apple community, tarnishing Apple’s gloss? \nThere certainly seems to be more negative coverage of Apple than ever before. Part of it seems to be pent up frustration related to Apple’s long lapses between product updates and its newfound inability to ship products when announced. However, a significant contribution to what could be called Apple’s Loss of Gloss comes from tribal warfare. Tribal Warfare \nTechnical tribes in the Apple community (and elsewhere) are created and driven by social media. The bandwidth between individuals in the tribe is great and the decision cycle (to use a military term) is short. Bloggers can belong to tribes, and they have plentiful access to various media outlets to express their views. The result is that technical tribes have needs, they are very well informed, and the communication medium, by its nature, creates an echo chamber. \nIf new members present information contrary to the tribe’s interests and motivations, they are ostracized. Tribes self-enforce a focus of thought. Because internal dissent isn’t rampant, conflict tends to occur between tribes instead of individuals. That leads to poorly considered righteousness. Apple’s Tribes \nThere are some notable Apple Tribes. To name just a few: Audiophiles. iPhone audio ports , speaker quality, audio formats, AirPod delay fuss, Apple Music, podcast support. Applications. Aperture fuss, iTunes, Mail, Time Machine issues, Automation. Technical Professionals. Powerful headless Macs, displays, flexible, powerful storage & backup, graphics tools. \nThere are more one could name: Communications (Wi-Fi, routers). Operating Systems (PC wars, Linux alternative), etc. Why Apple Dismisses the Tribes \nFor Apple, there are five key factors that lead to executive dismissal of the tribe agenda by virtue of how they inform Apple’s decisions. The legacy of Steve Jobs and the conviction that they are following in his hallowed footsteps. Product and roadmap secrecy allows executives to cast tribes as ill-informed and maniacal. Apple’s feedback mechanism in its various OSes provides important information about how Apple’s customers are using its products. Apple retail stores provide a direct link to customers in which the relationship is both controlled and better understood. Sales figures, which are sometimes kept secret for strategic reasons (Apple Watch) or not broken out by model (Macs) provide a canary in the coal mine to guide product development. The Role of Tribes \nMany of Apple’s customers only have the time to interact with Apple directly. They tend to be pleased with Apple as a whole and aren’t deeply involved with technical or political issues surrounding Apple. Thanks to the five key factors listed above and Apple’s legacy of great design, great UI/UX, build quality and customer service, the company has much favor and loyalty amongst customers. \nHowever, for those customers who have a techical and/or professional legacy, interest and a tendency to embrace Apple at a deeper level, it’s natural to fall into many of the existing tribes. There is that pizzazz factor of being noticed and being heard. \nSometimes, tribes provide immediate and powerful feedback to Apple, and Apple deems it necessary to take action. However, in many cases, the vision and the will of the tribe falls on deaf ears. The more Apple ignores a tribe, the more infuriated it gets. It turns up the volume. The irritation can explode out into social media with a logic all its own that seems irrefutable. \nOn the other hand, tribes are also well connected to customers via social media. Apple can no longer control every aspect of its customer relationship, and so it cannot be dismissive, arrogant or appear out of touch with key tribes. Analyzing Apple \nIn my experience, it’s always our job to understand Apple at such a deep level that sense can be made of both Apple’s decisions and the public assertions of various tribes, many of which are at war with each other. Joining a particular tribe for the sake of rocking the boat and garnering attention is an easy way out. Alternatively, lamely suggesting that The Great Apple Can Do No Wrong serves no useful purpose other than to, perhaps, curry favor. Apple has made and will continue to make mistakes. It’s a natural part of this business. \nThe thing to remember is that most of us buy Apple products to achieve something in a positive way: to communicate, to compute, to build, to create, to design, to write, to educate, to analyze, and so on. Apple’s tech web and community, when operating as warring tribes can’t really achieve much. It’s far better to work together as a cohesive group, coaching each other, learning, and being productive for some good end. \nFinally, I recall the words of Steve Jobs in reference to iPhoto and family memories. Here we see a passion to create, build and to serve. \n“This why we do what what we do.”",

      "text": "Share View photos Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook waves during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, U.S. September 7, 2016. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach More By Julia Love (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is expanding its support for the fight against AIDS through the (RED) charity founded by rock singer Bono, Chief Executive Tim Cook said in an interview ahead of World Aids Day. Over the next week, the company will expand its line of (RED) products and donate $1 for each transaction made using mobile payment Apple Pay in its physical and online stores, up to a total of $1 million. Bank of America (BAC.N) will contribute up to that sum for Apple Pay transactions using its cards. \"There's still way too many people dying of AIDS, still too many kids being born with HIV, and so we are continuing to press really hard,\" Cook said in the interview. UNAIDS predicts the number of babies born with HIV could drop to near zero by 2020 from around 400 per day now, Apple said. The (RED) campaign is an example of \"cause-related marketing,\" a style of philanthropy that some critics say is self-serving because they promote corporate brands as much as the underlying cause. Cook told Reuters that Apple can have a far greater impact by raising awareness among consumers than by simply writing a check. \"When we put ourselves into something, it's worth a lot more than just money,\" he said. (RED) was one of Apple's highest profile philanthropic efforts under former Chief Executive Steve Jobs, who largely avoided corporate giving. The company has been responsible for about $120 million of the $360 million (RED) has raised since it was founded in 2006. (Reporting by Julia Love, editing by Peter Henderson) Reblog",

      "text": "Tim Cook Reportedly Tells Customer That AirPods Will Ship In Few Weeks  08 PST \nWhen Apple announced that the AirPods would be delayed , they unfortunately did not mention when they would be made available. This has led to all kinds of speculation, with some even predicting that it could be launched in 2017. However a recent rumor has suggested that it might be launched in December , and Apple’s CEO might have confirmed that. \nAccording to an email that was sent by a customer, it seems that Apple’s CEO Tim Cook actually bothered to respond and according to the reply, he told the customer that he expects that the AirPods will be shipping over the next few weeks, thus corroborating the earlier rumors of a December release. \nAccording to the email, “Thanks for your note. Sorry for the delay—we are finalizing them and I anticipate we will begin to ship over the next few weeks.” Now we have no way of knowing if the email was really from Cook, but Cook along with Apple’s executives have been known to reply the occasional email sent in by customers. \nIn fact Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs was also known to have practiced that habit of replying emails by customers, so it wouldn’t be a stretch to think that this is true. In any case we guess we’ll just have to wait and see if the report is true, so do check back with us in the coming weeks for the details. \nFiled in Apple > Audio > Gadgets .

      "text": "Apple will start blocking those iCloud Calendar spam invites Apple is actively working to address the Calendar spam invites. Here's a fix in the meantime. Staff Writer, Macworld | Nov 30, 2016 4:30 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this Why does the iOS 10 lock screen reveal so much? \nThose annoying Calendar spam invites won’t be around much longer. \nOn Wednesday, Apple indicated that it was actively working to identify and block any further spam invites from hitting your iCloud Calendar. Last week, people started receiving suspicious spam invites on iOS and macOS alerting them of special sales for Ugg boots or Ray-Ban sunglasses. \nThe spammers were able to exploit an iCloud feature that uses email data to pop-up as Calendar notifications. If the spam invites were set as recurring events, the notifications would surface every day. \nAddress the issue, Apple sent the following statement to iMore : \n“We are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent.” \nIn the meantime, Macworld’s Glenn Fleishman has discovered a temporary fix . Here’s how it works: iCloud automatically parses through your email looking for iCalendar files (.ics) that it can surface as Calendar invites even if the the email sender is a spammer, so the best way to resolve this issue is to disable this automatic invitation parsing. Because iCloud manages this feature, you’ll have to make changes on the iCloud website. Go to your iCloud Calendar page via a desktop browser. (Apple doesn’t allow you to use iCloud.com via mobile Safari.) Click the gear icon in the lower-left corner. Select Preferences. Click the Advanced icon. In the Invitations section, change the option from In-App Notifications to Email to iCloud Address. \nIf you have outstanding spam invitations that you can’t delete after disabling automatic iCloud parsing, follow these steps: Via iCloud, iOS Calendar, or any calendar app in macOS, create a “spam” calendar. Assign the invitation to the spam calendar without clicking Accept, Decline, or Maybe. Delete the spam calendar. Click the Delete and Don’t Notify buttons when prompted. \nThe impact on you: No more spam invitations popping up temping you to click on a suspicious link all for a new pair of Ugg boots. However, this fix can be really limiting if you used to rely on your iCloud Calendar to automatically surface event invitations from your email. That’s why an permanent fix from Apple is still most welcomed. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed. Related:",

Nov30,20164:56PMEST \nDoes Pixel beat iPhone? Sort of. \nWhile Alphabet's ( GOOGL ) Pixel phone may have seen very impressive activation numbers, the overall volume did not surpass Apple's ( AAPL ) iPhone 7 volume over the Black Friday to Cyber Monday stretch. \nThe Google Pixel saw activations climb a whopping 112% compared to the previous four weekends, according to Localytics. Meanwhile, the iPhone 7 saw activation growth of just 13%. \nThere's a lot at play here, though. One could argue the iPhone was introduced earlier this year (September) while the Pixel came out in October. Since the iPhone has been out longer, consumers have had more time to purchase and activate their device. \nBut that excuse seems somewhat thin given that the period between Black Friday and Cyber Monday saw such record spending amounts. We don't really know what caused the different activation rates. What we do know is that last year the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus saw activation rates of 36% and 29%, respectively, far more than what we're seeing this year. \nDoes this bode poorly for Apple? Perhaps. Maybe the quarter will still be decent, but will consumers pass on the iPhone 7 in anticipation of the 10-year anniversary iPhone 8 next September?

I am on my MacBook Air, but I don't think Amazon's ( AMZN ) solution is for me. \nMeet Amazon's AWS Snowmobile , a semi truck that pulls a container storing up to 100 petabytes of data. Whoa! I'm not sure which is more impressive, the truck-data concept or the overwhelmingly large amount of data it can hold. \nIn any regard, Amazon is offering the service for companies that have an immense amount of data they want uploaded to the cloud. In a nutshell, here's how it works: The truck pulls up to the location, where it attaches directly to the data center as it transfers information at speeds of 1 terabyte per second. After about 10 days, the truck will be full and it will head back to Amazon where it will upload that content for the cloud. Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "Tim Cook waves during an Apple media event in San Francisco Thomson Reuters \nBy Julia Love \n(Reuters) - Apple Inc is expanding its support for the fight against AIDS through the (RED) charity founded by rock singer Bono, Chief Executive Tim Cook said in an interview ahead of World Aids Day. \nOver the next week, the company will expand its line of (RED) products and donate $1 for each transaction made using mobile payment Apple Pay in its physical and online stores, up to a total of $1 million. Bank of America will contribute up to that sum for Apple Pay transactions using its cards. \n\"There's still way too many people dying of AIDS, still too many kids being born with HIV, and so we are continuing to press really hard,\" Cook said in the interview. \nUNAIDS predicts the number of babies born with HIV could drop to near zero by 2020 from around 400 per day now, Apple said. \nThe (RED) campaign is an example of \"cause-related marketing,\" a style of philanthropy that some critics say is self-serving because they promote corporate brands as much as the underlying cause. \nCook told Reuters that Apple can have a far greater impact by raising awareness among consumers than by simply writing a check. \"When we put ourselves into something, it's worth a lot more than just money,\" he said. \n(RED) was one of Apple's highest profile philanthropic efforts under former Chief Executive Steve Jobs, who largely avoided corporate giving. The company has been responsible for about $120 million of the $360 million (RED) has raised since it was founded in 2006. \n(Reporting by Julia Love, editing by Peter Henderson) Read the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "Apple's Allegedly Abandoned AirPort Routers Top J.D. Power Wireless Router Satisfaction Report [Chart] LIKE Posted 6 minutes ago by iClarified · 199 views · Translate Apple's allegedly abandoned AirPort routers have just topped J.D. Power's 2016 Wireless Router Satisfaction Report.Apple hasn't refreshed its routers since 2013 and according to a recent report it has disbanded the division that develops them . The news is even more disappointing when looking at the results of J.D. Power's new study. Apple easily beat its competition to be the only wireless router awarded a five star rating with a score of 876 out of 1000. The report finds that overall satisfaction with wireless routers has increased by a full 24 points from 2015, and is now 847 (on a 1,000-point scale). While satisfaction has improved in all 10 factors, the largest increase is 30 points in ease of use (which includes the installation process). Another area related to ease of use with the product is restoration of service with minimal effort, in which overall satisfaction has increased 27 points from last year (to 854 from 827). Product features related to the performance of wireless routers also have significantly improved. Reliability of service connection, range of Wi-Fi signal and download/upload speeds have generated increases in satisfaction of 24, 26 and 25 points, respectively. Key Findings ● Overall satisfaction among customers who say they “definitely will” or “probably will” purchase the same wireless router brand they currently own is 241 points higher than among those who say they “definitely will not” or “probably will not” repurchase the same brand in the future (615 vs. 856, respectively).● Fewer than two in 10 (16%) customers experience problems with their wireless router. The most frequently experienced problems reported include frequency of resetting the router (42%); slow internet speeds (38%); initially connecting to the internet (31%); limited Wi-Fi range (26%); installation process (31%); and slow upload/download speeds (21%).● The percentage of customers who access the internet via a wireless router in their home varies by type of device. Most customers use a wireless router to connect their laptop (82%), followed by smartphone (80%); tablet (71%); desktop (55%); gaming console (53%); printer (50%); smart TV (47%); and streaming device/media player such as Chromecast or Roku (42%). ● Price is the primary reason for choosing a wireless router brand (45%), followed by range of signal strength (41%), brand reputation (37%) and ease of use (34%).● The average price paid for a wireless router is $124—an increase of $16 from 2015.Check out the chart below for more details. Apple's AirPort Extreme , AirPort Express , and Time Capsule are still available for purchase and Apple has not officially announced that it will stop making any of those devices.

REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach More By Julia Love\n(Reuters) - Apple Inc is expanding its support for the fight against AIDS through the (RED) charity founded by rock singer Bono, Chief Executive Tim Cook said in an interview ahead of World Aids Day.\nOver the next week, the company will expand its line of (RED) products and donate $1 for each transaction made using mobile payment Apple Pay in its physical and online stores, up to a total of $1 million. Bank of America will contribute up to that sum for Apple Pay transactions using its cards.\n\"There's still way too many people dying of AIDS, still too many kids being born with HIV, and so we are continuing to press really hard,\" Cook said in the interview.\nUNAIDS predicts the number of babies born with HIV could drop to near zero by 2020 from around 400 per day now, Apple said.\nThe (RED) campaign is an example of \"cause-related marketing,\" a style of philanthropy that some critics say is self-serving because they promote corporate brands as much as the underlying cause.\nCook told Reuters that Apple can have a far greater impact by raising awareness among consumers than by simply writing a check. \"When we put ourselves into something, it's worth a lot more than just money,\" he said.\n(RED) was one of Apple's highest profile philanthropic efforts under former Chief Executive Steve Jobs, who largely avoided corporate giving.

      "text": "AirPods Will Be Shipped in 'Next Few Weeks', Alleged Email From Tim Cook Reads AirPods were expected to be shipped in October Tim Cook now says that AirPods to be shipped in coming weeks A rumour claims that AirPods won't be shipped before January 2017 \nApple had promised to begin shipping the wireless AirPods in October, however, the company has since delayed shipments with no clear timeline as to when customers can expect them. Now, in an allegedl customer response email, CEO Tim Cook himself has said that the shipment should roll out in the next few weeks. \nMacRumors got hold of this email response; however it refrains from vouching for its credibility. Cook's response to the grievance mail clearly mentions that Apple will begin shipping the AirPods in the coming weeks. The grief email from the customer and Cook's response can be read below: \nCustomer's comment: \"Give us a release date. I really bought in to the wireless vision you painted. Now I'm stuck waiting with my EarPods but can't charge my 7 at the same time which I need to do at work. Let us know if it's a month or 6 months, because then I'll just buy some other wireless headphones.\" Tim Cook's response: \"Thanks for your note. Sorry for the delay---we are finalizing them and I anticipate we will begin to ship over the next few weeks.\"\nAt its iPhone event in September, Apple got rid of the headphone jack on its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets, and compensated for it by bundling Lightning-powered EarPods and launching the new wireless AirPods. The AirPods, whenever they arrive, can be bought for $159 (Rs. 15,400 in India). \nThey are powered by the company's new W1 wireless chip, the company's first wireless chip, which enables quick pairing and connectivity with the iPhone. The earphones feature dual optical sensors and accelerometers in each ear bud which work with the W1 chip to detect when the headphones are in your ears and only play when you're ready to listen. Double-tapping the AirPods enables Siri, and the microphone is designed to focus on voice and filter out external sound. \nThe AirPods were expected to be announced in October, but Apple announced a delay reasoning that 'it wasn't ready to ship' . It was then tipped that the AirPods would be shipped starting November 30 but that didn't happen either. There's another rumour that the AirPods won't be shipped before January 2017 .",

      "text": "In the wondrous world of tech, nothing lasts forever. This even happens to include Apple products, despite the warm glow of the logo and its shiny interface. Yes, every once in a while, the Cupertino giant waves farewell to its one-time flagships and focuses on newer generations. In this case, saying goodbye means that they'll no longer service or repair the device if it happens to sustain an injury. And according to a fresh MacRumors report, four Mac products are set to hit the graveyard. Related: 6 MacBook Pro 2016 features that will make you want to upgrade Thanks to an internal memo obtained by the site, it appears as though the MacBook Pro (15-inch, Early 2011), MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011), Mac mini (Early 2009) and MacBook (13-inch, Mid 2009) are all being forgotten. Apple classes products that have been out of production for around five years as 'vintage', with those discontinued for seven years considered obsolete. The new label will be applied on December 31, 2016, so if you own one of the affected products and live in the United States, Canada, Japan, Europe, Latin America or the Asia-Pacific region, there's still some time to patch things up. Or, if you happen to have recently won the lottery, you can perhaps consider the new MacBook Pro and that fancy Touch Bar. ",

Yeah, they're still not in the music-deprived ears of iPhone 7 users, and many are beginning to wonder if that January release rumour will come true, after all. If, like many concerned fans, you happen to regularly email Apple CEO Tim Cook about the ups and downs of life, there's a chance he gave an update on the wireless alternatives this week. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Cook reportedly replied to a potential customer and apologised for the delay before stating that the devices should be ready to ship in a few weeks. © Digital Spy The exchange, passed on by MacRumors , says: \"Thanks for your note. Sorry for the delay---we are finalizing them and I anticipate we will begin to ship over the next few weeks.\" OK, so that kind of gives us some more information to work with, but it's still not an official release date. Of course, when it initially announced the delay back in October, Apple stated that it only needed 'a little more time' to get things together. This hint, like that update, is open to interpretation. Does \"over the next few weeks\" mean in the late run-up to Christmas, or just as the New Year rolls in? It's all up in the air currently, but the signs don't appear too encouraging. Probably sensible to start looking at the best alternatives to throw in the stocking. Want up- to -the-minute entertainment and tech news?

Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + Wearables - Wearables + Digging the squarish looks of the Apple Watch? Good, enjoy that while you can, as a recent patent application filed in by Apple with the USPTO hints that Cupertino could be entertaining the idea of coming up with a circular Apple Watch in the future. The patent description shows us a smartwatch that boasts a pretty traditional circular shape, similar to what most of Apple Watch's rivals have been rocking for a while. It makes sense that Apple could be looking forward to covering this niche as well, and a circular variant of its most personable wearable yet would fit quite nicely into its product lineup, though we find this unlikely at this point. Probably in a few years from now, eh, Apple? In order to avoid Moto 360-like flat tire looks, Apple wants to employ pixel rows and columns of varying lengths so that no space remains unused. Additionally, such a pixel arrangement of the wearable's display would save space and reduce crowding. As usual, applying for a patent does not necessarily mean that the described product will necessarily see the light of day. That's especially true for Apple in particular, as it applies for a surplus of patents on a regular basis, the wide majority of which have so far failed to come to fruition. There's always a chance that some of these will be implemented in the company's portfolio, but we hardly ever hold our breath for those. Until (and if at all) such an Apple-made wearable becomes official, you can pick among a bunch of Android Wear and Tizen-powered smartwatches – the Gear S3 Frontier , for example, is totally a badass one.

      "text": "iPhone SE 2 scrapped? 3 new iPhones to come in 2017, Apple promoting iPad more? By Harsh Soni Dec 01, 2016 07:51 AM EST Advertisement \nLast week, news says that the iPhone SE 2 was being scrapped to preserve the market for the flagship iPhone in 2017. These details have emerged of three presumptively titled iPhone 8 handsets. As well as updates to the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus, the idea of a third 'premium' device has returned. \nSome details revealed by renowned tech analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo says, \"We look for new 2017 iPhones to come in three models, first with OLED model, then with TFT-LCD models with 4.7-inch and third is 5.5-inch display. Advertisement \nKuo believes that the OLED and 5.5-inch TFT-LCD iPhones will feature dual-camera. The Barclays analysts said this OLED model will be massive 5.8-inches and, if correct, Kuo's revelation of three distinct models brings both good and bad news to the tech world. \nApple has now released the Touch Bar enabled MacBook Pro into stores. This is at the same time as the embargo lifted on those reviewers who had early access to the hardware. \nFor the newly launched, as expected the similar design to the cheaper thirteen-inch model was welcomed, as were the additional USB-C ports, but in terms of the Touch Bar the jury is still out. \nAlthough the MacBook has been welcomed by many users, it sitll feels like Apple's focus is in a different area, while the laptop is a comfortable piece of tech. \nAccording to Forbes , Last year at the launch of the iPad Pro, Tim Cook asked \"Why would you buy a PC any more?\" Why indeed? It's possible to carry out many of the day-to-day task that would normally be done on a laptop on a tablet \nThe challenge in the part is to convince consumers that think 'laptop first' to think 'tablet first'. This continues to be the role of the iPad Pro in Apple's portfolio. With the smart keyboard covers, long battery life, and Cupertino's focused marketing the iOS tablets continue to perform strongly. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved.

      "text": "  07 11 PM IST Apple to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google Apple is also developing new features for maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, person familiar with the matter said   Mark Gurman Alan Levin A file photo of a drone. Apple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Air division to help run the drone team. Photo: Reuters \nSan Francisco/Washington: Apple Inc. plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch long-time leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple’s mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \nALSO READ: Google says delivery-by-drone possible within a few years \n“There’s a huge data-quality issue there, and I don’t think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,” Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies’ mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple’s latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nFAA exemption \nApple filed for an exemption on 21 September, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News . At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated 22 March 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to “operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,” according to one of the documents. \nApple’s application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix GmbH to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple’s initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the US within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon’s initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon’s headquarters, the person said. \nIndoor.io acquisition \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired start-up Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. Bloomberg",

      "text": "Apple is putting a lot of effort to improve its Apple Maps data and design. According to a new report from Bloomberg , the company plans to use drones to track changes and improve mapping data over time. It would apparently be faster to use a fleet of drones rather than vans with sensors.\nApple already admitted that mapping data is a harder problem than the company first anticipated. You need to update maps all the time and fix mistakes as quickly as possible. Roads change and new buildings keep popping up. That’s why the company now works with thousands of employees in India and elsewhere to work on mapping data.\nBut that’s just one part of the equation. Having a big moderation staff is useless if you don’t have fresh data coming from all over the world. Companies like Google and Apple rely on user reports and vehicles driving around multiple countries.\nBloomberg found a 2015 document from the Federal Aviation Administration. The administration granted Apple a license to “operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography.” It also says that the company plans to buy drones from DJI and Aibotix for this operation.\nNow, it’s unclear if Apple already started using these drones in the U.S. and in other countries. As it’s not a user-facing feature, nothing stops Apple from using drones without telling its users.\nIn other news, Apple also acquired Indoor.io for indoor mapping. Bloomberg got an official confirmation from Apple. Apple has already made another acquisition of an indoor mapping company and is playing catch up on this front.\nIn Google Maps, you can already find maps of popular malls, museums and public buildings. Apple wants to provide indoor maps as well as an indoor positioning system that would take advantage of your iPhone’s sensors to locate you within a building. It would go beyond a simple GPS dot.\nAll of this is great, but I still miss an equivalent of Street View in Apple Maps. This feature is quite useful when you want to see what a building looks like. I’ve been using Apple Maps every day for a couple of years now, and it’s the only thing that makes me open Google Maps every now and then.\nFeatured Image: concept w / Shutterstock ",

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo While it has improved drastically over the past couple of years, Apple Maps still lags behind Google Maps in accuracy and its feature set. Apple hopes to change that by using drones to update information faster than Google can with its Google Maps cars, a report from Bloomberg said on Thursday.\nThe initiative, which Apple is reportedly working on in quiet, will reportedly set drones buzzing around the air trying to gather information on the landscape and roads below. Drones could theoretically gather information faster than a car that’s forced to drive up and down individual roads, and they could be used to quickly take snapshots of areas that might be affected by construction, road sign changes, damage from natural disasters and more. One can imagine, for example, an Apple drone flying around after a hurricane, perhaps allowing users to better understand the roads that are in working condition and the roads that are not. The drones are not built by Apple.\nBloomberg explained that Apple poached an Amazon employee to lead the effort out of a satellite office in Seattle. The employee had previously headed up Amazon’s Prime Air department, an initiative wherein Amazon hopes to one day deliver packages by drone. The news outlet explained that Apple has some headwinds to face, particularly with the FAA’s current drone guidelines that may make it difficult to perform commercial activities, like capturing images and video for mapping, near buildings and people. Amazon is facing similar roadblocks with its delivery service.\nFinally, Apple is also reportedly working to develop indoor maps. Bloomberg used an airport as one example of the sort of area where Apple could provide consumers with more information while inside. Google has done a pretty solid job of this with indoor maps of malls and other large facilities, though Apple’s technology could potentially make it easier to see exactly where one is inside the building. Indoor mapping may launch as soon as next year, Bloomberg said.\nAre Apple drones a privacy concern? Apple very clearly wants (perhaps needs) to distinguish its Apple Maps product from Google Maps. Both of these plans sound really compelling, though one has to wonder what the public will think if drones are buzzing up and down neighborhood streets with cameras recording. While it may be great for mapping technology, it’s also going to be a privacy concern.\n\n\nSource : Bloomberg ",

Governments, non-governmental organizations, and individuals around the world mark this day, often by organizing educations on AIDS prevention and fundraising. \nIn honor of World AIDS Day, Apple is offering ways for customers to join (RED) in its mission to create an AIDS-free generation . Apple is the world's largest corporate contributor to the Global Fund, founded by, among others, Melinda and Bill Gates and Kofi Annan. This year marks Apple's 10th anniversary supporting (RED) in the fight to end AIDS. \nTim Cook, Apple's CEO, said in an official statement: The gift of life is the most important gift that anyone can give. Thanks to the vision and dedication of (RED), an AIDS-free generation is within our reach. We want to leave the world better than we found it, and that's why our longtime partnership with (RED) remains so important to us. \nThis year, Apple introduced a line of RED products such as iPhone 7 battery case, iPhone SE case, and Pill+ Portable Speaker, in addition to the regular lineup of RED products that are available year-round. \nFor the next week, a range of the most popular games on the App Store are offering limited-edition RED content, and all proceeds from the associated in-app purchases go to the Global Fund . Starting tomorrow (December 1st) through December 6th, Apple is donating $1 to (RED)'s mission for every purchase made with Apple Pay at an Apple Store, on Apple.com or through the Apple Store app, up to $1 million. Bank of America will also make a donation for every Apple Pay transaction using its cards, also up to $1 million. Recommended for You",

We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent,\" Apple told iMore . \nMost of the calendar invitations originate from sketchy Chinese email accounts and promise to offer discounts on brand name products such as Uggs or Ray-Bans.\nFor your own safety, don't accept the invites and do not click on any links that may be included. It's most likely a phishing attempt to steal your personal information.\nThough Apple says it's in the process of blocking suspicious email addresses and a fix is on the way, there are a few ways to prevent the annoying notifications.\nAs Mashable apps reporter Karissa Bell advises :\nDon't decline the invitations, as that will just alert the sender your email is linked to an active account.\nChange your calendar settings so that invitations are sent as emails and not device iPhone notifications\nCreate a \"junk\" calendar just for these spammy invites \nThese tips won't make the iCloud calendar spam stop entirely, but do help reduce the amount of unwanted notifications until Apple releases its fix.\nBONUS: The 3 best things about the MacBook Pro's Touch Bar",

      "text": "Enlarge (credit: Lee Hutchinson)\nThe Apple Maps experience today is dramatically better than it was when the product first launched with iOS 6 in 2012, but Apple is still looking for ways to improve its data collection and compete with Google Maps. According to a report from Bloomberg , the next stage in this effort is to use a fleet of drones from DJI, Aibotix, and others to look at street signs, track road construction, and examine other changes. It's not clear if these drones will replace or merely augment the data already being collected by Apple Maps minivans.\nApple was granted an exemption by the Federal Aviation Administration in March of 2016, allowing the company to commercially fly drones to gather data. Current rules for unmanned aircraft systems ( PDF ) restrict drone flights to daylight hours and insist that pilots maintain line-of-sight with the drones at all times, among many other rules. The company is said to have hired someone from Amazon's \"Prime Air\" drone delivery project to head up its drone team, which is currently being assembled in Seattle rather than at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters.\nThe initial versions of Apple Maps hadn't been vetted thoroughly enough, and the initial backlash to the product led to changes across the company. CEO Tim Cook publicly apologized for Apple Maps in 2012, and longtime iOS software lead Scott Forstall's refusal to sign that apology was one of the reasons he left the company . In an interview earlier this year , Cook, Software Engineering SVP Craig Federighi, and Internet Software and Services SVP Eddy Cue said that the Maps problems had led directly to Apple's public beta programs for macOS and iOS.\nRead 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "SHARE It has a secret weapon \nApple is hoping drones can help the company compete more effectively against Google Maps, according to a new report. \nThe tech giant is building a team that will use drones to fly overhead and capture critical street information, including signs and traffic changes, Bloomberg is reporting , citing sources who claim to have knowledge of its plans. Apple has secured approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to use drones to capture photos, videos, and other traffic data, the report says. \nDrone capture could prove important to Apple as it works to improve its Maps application running on iOS and macOS devices. After capturing the data from streets both in the U.S. and abroad, it can then be transmitted back to Apple’s team and its information uploaded to the Apple Maps servers, according to Bloomberg . Users, then, would get far more useful and recent data. The drones would replace the minivans it currently uses to collect similar data. \nApple Maps was released in 2012 as a replacement to Google Maps on iOS. Soon after its release, however, the app, which comes bundled with Apple’s operating systems, was criticized for having inaccurate information and poor driving directions. Apple CEO Tim Cook ultimately apologized for Apple Maps and suggested users try out other options, like the Google Maps that had previously been bundled with Apple’s mobile operating system. \nSince then, Apple has made strides towards improving the app’s accuracy and data and has added more information, including traffic and transit data. Still, Apple Maps is generally believed to be inferior to Google Maps, which comes with accurate data and other key features, like a Street View option that lets users see images of addresses. \nIn addition to getting better data more quickly to Apple Maps with drones, the company is also trying to improve its mapping service’s navigation and is eyeing ways to take images of the inside of buildings, according to Bloomberg . That feature would let users explore airports, museums, and other public places without actually visiting them. Google already offers a similar feature with Google Maps. \nLooking ahead, Apple could be hoping to get its indoor mapping service to Apple Maps sometime next year, along with a tool that would tell users when and where to change lanes during navigation. Apple is still assembling the team that will help it take advantage of drones, the report says. \nApple did not immediately respond to a Fortune request for comment.",

      "text": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google   Mark Gurman, Alan Levin - Bloomberg \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n---",

      "text": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google   Mark Gurman, Alan Levin - Bloomberg \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n---",

      "text": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google   Mark Gurman, Alan Levin - Bloomberg \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n---",

      "text": "Trump’s tax holiday actually may not go to plan. How will Apple, Microsoft, and others spend their offshore money?\nA corporate share buyback and dividend binge could be on the horizon.\nChasing stocks is for chumps.\n\nThe stock market has significantly risen since President-elect Donald Trump won the Oval Office. The Dow, the Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) had another record close on Black Friday. Markets are reacting positively to pre-election promises and policies that Trump touted in almost every rally speech.\nThere's expectations that Trump will overhaul financial regulations like Dodd-Frank (clear positive for large banks), increase infrastructure spending, cut corporate taxes, and boost the nation's manufacturing sector. So what we're seeing is a number of \"Trump trades\" or bets on companies in industries projected to perform well under a Trump presidency.\nTrump wants to cut the business tax rate from 35% to 15% in an effort to keep U.S. companies from leaving for countries with lower tax rates. This should be generally positive for U.S. equity markets and capital investment. The one piece of proposed legislation that interests me is the one-off repatriation tax holiday at a 10% tax rate. This will give U.S. multinationals like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) the chance to repatriate trillions of dollars in cash stockpiled overseas.\nAccording to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, there's about $2.6 trillion in profits parked overseas in tax haven subsidiaries (source: Bloomberg ).\nApple will be a real beneficiary of any tax holiday, as would Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and many other U.S. tech companies. The top 10 largest tech companies have more than half a trillion dollars overseas. Today, Apple and Microsoft's offshore cash represents 36.3% and 23.4% of their respective market values. Pharmaceuticals like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ), and Merck (NYSE: MRK ) have plenty of cash overseas as well.\nThe chart below shows the top 5 U.S. companies with the most offshore cash (source: Bloomberg). Moody's Investor Service estimates that the top 5 will accumulate $505 billion overseas by year-end, up from $441 billion in 2015.\n(in US$ billions) \nOffshore cash as of Sept. 30 \nEst. Offshore cash by year-end \nApple\n$216\n$230\nMicrosoft\n$111\n$113\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO )\n$60\n$62\nOracle Corp (NASDAQ: ORCL )\n$51\n$52\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL )\n$48\n$49\nClick to enlarge (Source: Bloomberg and Investor's Business Daily )\nThe reason they keep money offshore in tax haven subsidiaries is because to bring that cash back you must pay a 35% tax. Apple's CEO Tim Cook in December last year said that he would \"love\" to repatriate some of Apple's cash, but not at a 40% tax rate (combining federal and state taxes). It just doesn't make sense for any business to repatriate cash when you got to pay a substantial tax on it.\nSo will U.S. companies take advantage of the one-time 10% tax rate? Maybe. Some U.S. multinationals have many reinvestment opportunities outside of the U.S., so they may not consider repatriating their cash. Instead, they rather invest in markets where they produce most of their sales and profits.\nCorporate buyback and dividend binge? \nTrump says the repatriated cash guarantees bigger tax revenues that would partly fund his $1 trillion infrastructure program over the next 10 years (clear benefit for E&C's, equipment rental firms, and material producers). This spending would lead to increased economic productivity and growth. On top of that, Trump expects U.S. companies will use the repatriated cash on \"growth capital\" investments like building new manufacturing plants and factories at home to fuel job growth.\nOn paper, this is all very promising. But I don't think it will all go accordingly to Trump's plan. I expect the repatriated cash will benefit investors rather than job creation. Instead, the cash will be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This is how U.S. companies reacted in the past, why not expect more of the same again?\nThe U.S. last introduced a one-time tax holiday under the Homeland Investment Act in 2004. About 843 U.S. corporations returned more than $300 billion at a reduced rate of 5.25% (nearly half of what Trump's proposing). The legislation didn't allow companies to use the cash to buy back shares, but they still did anyway. Over 90% of the repatriated cash was used for buybacks, dividends, and executive compensation. It didn't serve to create U.S. jobs or build new factories as planned. \nCisco's CEO Chuck Robbins was asked how he would spend the repatriated cash in an interview with Bloomberg. He said: \"We do have various scenarios in terms of what we'd do but you can assume we'll focus on the obvious ones - buybacks , dividends , and M&A activities.\"\nIt seems like wishful thinking to believe U.S. companies won't spend majority of their foreign cash on buybacks and dividends. Trump's Black Friday-like tax holiday for American corporations sounds like a good idea, but it's really a big gamble on infrastructure and job growth.\nIt's also a big gamble if you're merely buying specific stocks that could benefit from Trump's future policy changes. In this case, you're not investing, but dangerously speculating, and ignoring the underlying fundamentals of a business which drive stock performance. You don't know if his plans will come to fruition (e.g. repeal of Dodd-Frank). Chasing what's hot in the market without doing your own homework is risky investment behavior and you're setting yourself up to lose money.\nIf U.S. multinationals do repatriate cash, the U.S. will see an influx of capital flows, and that should benefit the U.S. dollar (clear negative for consumer staples like Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG )). The U.S. is seeing economic growth return, with Q3 GDP expanding to 3.2% (versus 1.4% in Q2), and this is fueling the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Growth is favoring the U.S. Fed futures market, now pricing a 100% probability of a rate hike on December 14.\nThe U.S. Fed has held the fed funds rate target range at 0.25% to 0.50% since December 2015. The financial sector, which was the worst performing sector at the start of the year, has rallied hard the past few weeks becoming the best performing sector over the last 12 months. Higher interest rates increase net interest margins and profits for banks, like JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ).\nIf you're buying these banks solely because of the expectation of the Fed bumping up interest rates or the repeal of Dodd-Frank, you're not investing, but speculating. There's substantial downside risk for many of the stocks that have moved higher because of possible Trump policies, and even the Fed's expected rate hike in two weeks. Instead, focus your energy on due diligence. Investigate your investments before making an informed investment decision.\nAvoid the herd mentality. Chasing stocks is for chumps.\nReading recommendations: \nSell Everything Now?

How will Apple, Microsoft, and others spend their offshore money?\nA corporate share buyback and dividend binge could be on the horizon.\nChasing stocks is for chumps.\n\nThe stock market has significantly risen since President-elect Donald Trump won the Oval Office. The Dow, the Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) had another record close on Black Friday. Markets are reacting positively to pre-election promises and policies that Trump touted in almost every rally speech.\nThere's expectations that Trump will overhaul financial regulations like Dodd-Frank (clear positive for large banks), increase infrastructure spending, cut corporate taxes, and boost the nation's manufacturing sector. So what we're seeing is a number of \"Trump trades\" or bets on companies in industries projected to perform well under a Trump presidency.\nTrump wants to cut the business tax rate from 35% to 15% in an effort to keep U.S. companies from leaving for countries with lower tax rates.

      "text": "Apple said to fly drones to improve maps data and catch Google [video] Thursday Dec 1, 2016 at 1:30 PM Mark Gurman, Alan Levin - Bloomberg \nApple plans to use drones and new indoor navigation features to improve its Maps service and catch longtime leader Google, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe Cupertino, California-based company is assembling a team of robotics and data-collection experts that will use drones to capture and update map information faster than its existing fleet of camera-and-sensor ladened minivans, one of the people said. \nApple wants to fly drones around to do things like examine street signs, track changes to roads and monitor if areas are under construction, the person said. The data collected would be sent to Apple teams that rapidly update the Maps app to provide fresh information to users, the person added. \nApple is also developing new features for Maps, including views inside buildings and improvements to car navigation, another person familiar with the efforts said. The people asked not to be identified talking about private projects. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nFive years after Google Maps launched on the iPhone, Apple's mapping app was introduced in 2012 with glaring errors like a grocery store marked as a hospital and an incorrect airport address. Apple lacked the technology needed to quickly suck in data from many different sources to evaluate and change the digital maps. \n\"There's a huge data-quality issue there, and I don't think we initially appreciated all the kinds of technology we would need to do that on an ongoing basis,\" Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, told Fast Company earlier this year. \nDigital maps are crucial tools for Apple and Google to attract developers that build popular travel, ride-sharing, and retail apps and services that integrate with the companies' mobile operating systems. Collecting accurate data is the most important part of digital map building and Apple's latest moves could help it match the prodigious capabilities of Google in this field. \nSince Apple Maps launched, the company has improved the app by more quickly updating data, adding a mode for navigating public transit systems, improving search results, and opening the platform to outside services such as Uber ride-hailing and OpenTable restaurant reservations. The drone initiative is a continuation of this effort and is unlikely to be related to a commercial Apple drone product. \nApple filed for an exemption on Sept. 21, 2015, from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones for commercial purposes, according to documents obtained by Bloomberg News. At that time, exemptions were required to commercially operate drones. In a response dated March 22, 2016, the FAA granted Apple approval to \"operate an unmanned aircraft system to conduct data collection, photography, and videography,\" according to one of the documents. \nApple's application told the FAA that it would use a range of drones sold by companies such as SZ DJI Technology Co. and Aibotix to collect the data. \nOfficial guidelines for commercial drone operation were instated in August, restricting flying to mostly daytime hours and requiring licensed pilots to operate the equipment while keeping the drones in their line of sight. Apple committed to these guidelines, according to the FAA documents. \nThe current rules restrict commercial drones from flying over people and buildings, potentially limiting Apple's initiative for the time being. Apple could meanwhile fly the drones in the U.S. within FAA guidelines and fly without restriction in countries without commercial drone regulations. \nApple has hired at least one person from Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime Air division to help run the drone team, one of the people said. Prime Air is Amazon's initiative to quickly deliver packages via drones. The Apple team is being assembled in Seattle, the same city as Amazon's headquarters, the person said. \nBeyond better data collection, Apple is developing an indoor mapping view that would allow users to navigate airports, and other high-traffic buildings like museums using iPhones, according to another person. \nApple acquired startup Indoor.io last year to help bring its indoor mapping project to market, according to another person familiar with the matter. Apple confirmed the purchase, but declined to say why it did the deal. The company also bought WiFiSlam in 2013, another startup with indoor navigation expertise. \nIndoor location tracking is achieved via a combination of technologies inside the latest iPhones, including pressure sensors, GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Apple is also working on a feature that provides better guidance for changing lanes while driving, one of the people said. Both features are planned for release next year but could be held back, the person said. \n---",

      "text": "Trump’s tax holiday actually may not go to plan. How will Apple, Microsoft, and others spend their offshore money?\nA corporate share buyback and dividend binge could be on the horizon.\nChasing stocks is for chumps.\n\nThe stock market has significantly risen since President-elect Donald Trump won the Oval Office. The Dow, the Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) had another record close on Black Friday. Markets are reacting positively to pre-election promises and policies that Trump touted in almost every rally speech.\nThere's expectations that Trump will overhaul financial regulations like Dodd-Frank (clear positive for large banks), increase infrastructure spending, cut corporate taxes, and boost the nation's manufacturing sector. So what we're seeing is a number of \"Trump trades\" or bets on companies in industries projected to perform well under a Trump presidency.\nTrump wants to cut the business tax rate from 35% to 15% in an effort to keep U.S. companies from leaving for countries with lower tax rates. This should be generally positive for U.S. equity markets and capital investment. The one piece of proposed legislation that interests me is the one-off repatriation tax holiday at a 10% tax rate. This will give U.S. multinationals like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) the chance to repatriate trillions of dollars in cash stockpiled overseas.\nAccording to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, there's about $2.6 trillion in profits parked overseas in tax haven subsidiaries (source: Bloomberg ).\nApple will be a real beneficiary of any tax holiday, as would Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and many other U.S. tech companies. The top 10 largest tech companies have more than half a trillion dollars overseas. Today, Apple and Microsoft's offshore cash represents 36.3% and 23.4% of their respective market values. Pharmaceuticals like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ), and Merck (NYSE: MRK ) have plenty of cash overseas as well.\nThe chart below shows the top 5 U.S. companies with the most offshore cash (source: Bloomberg). Moody's Investor Service estimates that the top 5 will accumulate $505 billion overseas by year-end, up from $441 billion in 2015.\n(in US$ billions) \nOffshore cash as of Sept. 30 \nEst. Offshore cash by year-end \nApple\n$216\n$230\nMicrosoft\n$111\n$113\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO )\n$60\n$62\nOracle Corp (NASDAQ: ORCL )\n$51\n$52\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL )\n$48\n$49\nClick to enlarge (Source: Bloomberg and Investor's Business Daily )\nThe reason they keep money offshore in tax haven subsidiaries is because to bring that cash back you must pay a 35% tax. Apple's CEO Tim Cook in December last year said that he would \"love\" to repatriate some of Apple's cash, but not at a 40% tax rate (combining federal and state taxes). It just doesn't make sense for any business to repatriate cash when you got to pay a substantial tax on it.\nSo will U.S. companies take advantage of the one-time 10% tax rate? Maybe. Some U.S. multinationals have many reinvestment opportunities outside of the U.S., so they may not consider repatriating their cash. Instead, they rather invest in markets where they produce most of their sales and profits.\nCorporate buyback and dividend binge? \nTrump says the repatriated cash guarantees bigger tax revenues that would partly fund his $1 trillion infrastructure program over the next 10 years (clear benefit for E&C's, equipment rental firms, and material producers). This spending would lead to increased economic productivity and growth. On top of that, Trump expects U.S. companies will use the repatriated cash on \"growth capital\" investments like building new manufacturing plants and factories at home to fuel job growth.\nOn paper, this is all very promising. But I don't think it will all go accordingly to Trump's plan. I expect the repatriated cash will benefit investors rather than job creation. Instead, the cash will be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This is how U.S. companies reacted in the past, why not expect more of the same again?\nThe U.S. last introduced a one-time tax holiday under the Homeland Investment Act in 2004. About 843 U.S. corporations returned more than $300 billion at a reduced rate of 5.25% (nearly half of what Trump's proposing). The legislation didn't allow companies to use the cash to buy back shares, but they still did anyway. Over 90% of the repatriated cash was used for buybacks, dividends, and executive compensation. It didn't serve to create U.S. jobs or build new factories as planned. \nCisco's CEO Chuck Robbins was asked how he would spend the repatriated cash in an interview with Bloomberg. He said: \"We do have various scenarios in terms of what we'd do but you can assume we'll focus on the obvious ones - buybacks , dividends , and M&A activities.\"\nIt seems like wishful thinking to believe U.S. companies won't spend majority of their foreign cash on buybacks and dividends. Trump's Black Friday-like tax holiday for American corporations sounds like a good idea, but it's really a big gamble on infrastructure and job growth.\nIt's also a big gamble if you're merely buying specific stocks that could benefit from Trump's future policy changes. In this case, you're not investing, but dangerously speculating, and ignoring the underlying fundamentals of a business which drive stock performance. You don't know if his plans will come to fruition (e.g. repeal of Dodd-Frank). Chasing what's hot in the market without doing your own homework is risky investment behavior and you're setting yourself up to lose money.\nIf U.S. multinationals do repatriate cash, the U.S. will see an influx of capital flows, and that should benefit the U.S. dollar (clear negative for consumer staples like Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG )). The U.S. is seeing economic growth return, with Q3 GDP expanding to 3.2% (versus 1.4% in Q2), and this is fueling the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Growth is favoring the U.S. Fed futures market, now pricing a 100% probability of a rate hike on December 14.\nThe U.S. Fed has held the fed funds rate target range at 0.25% to 0.50% since December 2015. The financial sector, which was the worst performing sector at the start of the year, has rallied hard the past few weeks becoming the best performing sector over the last 12 months. Higher   net interest margins and profits for banks, like JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ).\nIf you're buying these banks solely because of the expectation of the Fed bumping up interest rates or the repeal of Dodd-Frank, you're not investing, but speculating. There's substantial downside risk for many of the stocks that have moved higher because of possible Trump policies, and even the Fed's expected rate hike in two weeks. Instead, focus your energy on due diligence. Investigate your investments before making an informed investment decision.\nAvoid the herd mentality.

      "text": "A way Apple could grow without abandoning its unique corporate structure Spin off a joint venture or two. share Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images Apple’s internal corporate structure is unusual for a large company because it’s built almost entirely around functional groups defined by expertise (design, software engineering, hardware engineering, hardware technology) rather than divisions structured by products (iPhone and iPads, Macs, peripherals). This strongly functional structure is the main reason Apple has started struggling with the seemingly banal task of keeping its pro-level personal computers, and especially its Mac Pro desktop, up to date with the latest and most powerful computer chips. Functional organization means Apple can put enormous resources behind top priorities. In recent years, that’s meant regular updates to the iPhone (which drives the bulk of the company’s revenue) plus exciting new projects like the Apple Watch and exploring the car business. But at the same time, the entire Mac universe took a back seat, and in particular desktop Macs took a back seat to laptops. More broadly, boring stuff like upgrading graphics cards took a back seat to envelope-pushing new technology. At the same time, as Apple’s closest observers know this functional organization is one of Apple’s core strengths. As Jonathan Gruber writes , “if Apple had a standalone Macintosh division, there might never have been an iPhone or especially iPad, because the Mac division chief would have been motivated to protect the Mac.” Gruber is almost certainly correct. Restructuring Apple into conventional divisions with independent profit and loss lines would resolve one current set of salient problems, but also set Apple up for exactly what it most fears — becoming a company that loses its agility and unique strengths. That said, Gruber’s faith that Apple will recover from current problems simply because “Apple ran into ‘ can’t walk and chew gum’ problems even when they were a much smaller company” and recovered strikes me as excessively complacent. Things really do get harder when you reach a bigger scale, and Apple ought to do something structural to address problems while retaining its functional core. My suggestion: a joint venture or two. The Mac Pro is essential, but a poor fit Apple’s functional organization causes the greatest and clearest pain when it comes to the Mac Pro, which is supposed to be Apple’s high-end workstation. One basic problem here is that high-end workstations are a small share of the personal computer market, and Macs are also a small share of the personal computer market. Put the two together, and there just aren’t very many customers for high-end workstation Macs. So it never makes sense for Apple’s key decision-makers to spend a lot of time thinking about this corner of the market. Yet it’s also not a market Apple can afford to totally ignore. Having a high-end workstation also keeps some of Apple’s most loyal and lucrative customers happy — especially in graphics, video, and scientific research. That, in turn, helps to ensure there’s a healthy market for Mac software, which in turn benefits everyone who uses the Mac. Customers for high-end workstations also include an even more crucial constituency: professional computer programmers — the people who write the software that other Mac and iPhone and iPad users use. Having those people use a Mac instead of a Windows or Linux workstation is a huge strategic asset for Apple. The other problem, however, is that the priorities of workstation customers are simply a poor fit for Apple’s corporate values. A person who genuinely needs raw computing power for his or her professional work needs to care a lot about a computer’s value proposition in terms of pure specs. He also needs to care a lot about upgradeability. A huge amount of Apple’s success in the marketplace has come precisely from ignoring those values. Computers started as professional gear, but the pocket computers we call smartphones are very much personal devices. They are affordable luxury items, whose buyers are willing to pay a premium over what the internal components really cost for the sake of obtaining something that’s really nice and user-friendly. The nexus of these two things means that Apple is never really focused on what workstation customers really want, which is basically a big box full of super-powerful chips that have all been configured properly to run Mac OS. The last time Apple really made a computer like that was the 2010 Mac Pro, that then went years without an update. Then in late 2013 they went in a new direction and updated Mac Pro hardware in the context of a radical new innovative design. It was a cool product but had very limited upgradeability, and since its release Apple has allowed its internals to become obsolete. Because it’s a small market, none of that hurts the company on a day-to-day basis. Reorganizing the whole company to serve this niche market would be a mistake. But neglecting its needs is dangerous. Mac Desktops, Inc. could solve the problem One natural solution would be to try to form a joint venture with a company like Dell or Lenovo that currently makes tower-style PCs. You’d have a new, separately incorporated entity called Mac Desktops, Inc. with its own CEO and its own headquarters — ideally someplace far away from Cupertino (Dell’s home outside of Austin or Lenovo’s US base of operations in Morristown, North Carolina, would work fine). The company would be jointly owned by Apple and the partner company, with the partner probably supplying most of the executives and Apple supplying a license to use Mac OS in a standalone, high-end desktop computer that replaces the Mac Pro. Jonny Ive’s design group could bequeath to them a sketch of a distinctive-looking desktop computer tower if they felt like it, but could also not bother if they don’t care. As a standalone company, Mac Desktops would be fully incentivized to keep its eye on the ball and maintain laser-like focus on working out cost-effective configurations of high-end hardware that are compatible with Mac OS. This is already done in a rough-and-ready way by “hackintosh” enthusiasts who regularly assemble buyers’ guides of usable hardware that hobbyists can build themselves before using a kludgy workaround to install Mac OS on unauthorized equipment . It would require very little work on Apple’s part to allow an authorized joint venture to do this seamlessly and market the resulting prepackaged machines to pro power users. The computers could also be sold in Apple retail stores and on Apple’s website, or if Ive finds them too aesthetically offensive to be placed alongside his beautiful objects they could be sold elsewhere instead. The pro users who need these machines will know where to find them. The basic conflict inherent in a divisional setup would still exist here, but the problems would flow in the right direction. Apple, as the part-parent company, would prevent Mac Desktops from reaching its full potential by vetoing any effort to compete with the all-in-one iMac or various laptop and tablet markets. Mac Desktops would be hobbled from the start, limited to a niche market and unlikely to ever grow very big. Still, the cash flow to the partner company would be welcome — especially since non-Apple PC makers are already used to dealing with slim margins and limited growth prospects. And for Apple itself, the real advantage would be strategic — the knowledge that developers and other power users would never face pressure to abandon the Mac ecosystem in the pursuit of horsepower. The joint venture concept could expand Of course, a manufacturer of standalone desktop computers might want to expand into natural complements like monitors, mice, keyboards, and trackpads. Apple used to make monitors but recently announced an end to that. And while they still make a keyboard, it’s a bit of an odd product that seems derived from the company’s ongoing efforts to engineer ever-thinner laptop keyboards. That’s an important part of the company’s overall design goals for portable products, but obviously a keyboard that sits on your desk doesn’t have any particular need to be thin. Many people (I’m one) find keyboards with longer travel distances or even old-school mechanical switches to be more comfortable. Others have special ergonomic needs or like wide keyboards with numerical pads. Apple has good reason for not bothering too much with this kind of thing that would be a distraction from more pressing matters. But there is a market for these products, and making ones that are deliberately designed for maximum Mac compatibility would be a reasonable approach for a joint venture. Alternatively, Apple might prefer to try separate joint ventures. They informally partnered with LG on LG’s new SuperFine 4k display (and on a forthcoming 5k version) and you could imagine that partnership expanding into a more formal and larger effort to make a complete line of peripherals. Partnerships of various kinds are already a big part of Apple’s strategy for making watch bands, and it’s reasonable to think that will expand with Apple focusing on the core technology product while others work on endlessly iterating the more fashion-focused band aspect. This approach has some downsides, of course, compared with Apple’s traditional approach of trying to directly control as much of the relevant computing stack as possible. But that focus on control, paired with a functional organizational structure and an obvious financial need to keep expanding into new product categories poses a dilemma: A single executive team simply can’t do everything at once. Apple needs to keep iterating the iPhone. It needs to keep trying to develop new hardware products. And it needs to play catchup on the online services front. That’s going to make it really difficult to do anything other than neglect lower priorities. But simply ignoring niche products is dangerous, since in the end casual Mac users rely on the work of high-end professionals to drive the entire ecosystem forward. A network of joint ventures might strike the right balance between maintaining focus in Cupertino and keeping a hand in the small-but-important markets that are currently flagging.
