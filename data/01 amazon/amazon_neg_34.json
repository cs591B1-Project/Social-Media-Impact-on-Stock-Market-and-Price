      "text": "Enlarge Image Here are a handful of phony Amazon listings using stolen designs from baby clothing seller Fayebeline. The California company got Amazon to remove the listings.\nPhoto by Courtesy of Fayebeline Hugh Milstein wishes Amazon had rolled out its Brand Central fraud-fighting tools last month.\nBack then, DigitalFusion , his 25-employee digital photography business in Culver City, California, was selling high-quality space art on the e-retailer's site. The posters got great reviews, including a shout-out from Star Trek 's George Takei .\nThen, a rash on knockoffs showed up on Amazon, undercutting Milstein's prices and dragging down his reputation.\n\"This is unfair competition,\" Milstein said of the fakes. \"Our sales have gone to virtually nothing.\"\nMilstein's complaints haven't fallen on deaf ears. Amazon, plagued by everything from phony Birkenstock sandals to knockoff iPhone chargers , is going on the offensive. One step it's considering is Brand Central, a suite of digital tools under development to help sellers protect their brands from fakes and knockoffs, according to two people with knowledge of the project.\nThat effort comes as the company filed its first-ever lawsuits against alleged counterfeit sellers last week. More suits are expect.\nDetails about Brand Central remain vague, but the people describing the project say Brand Central will help smaller sellers protect their trademarks and other intellectual property. Ensuring the source of products is also part of the project.\nIt's unclear when, or if, Brand Central will roll out publicly or whether that name will be used.\nWith more than 300 million listings, it's hard to know how significant Amazon's counterfeit problem is. In its lawsuits, Amazon attributed the activity to a \"a small number of bad actors.\" Still, Amazon's latest actions demonstrate it wants to get rid of fakes before those products erode consumer trust. Without that confidence, Amazon might struggle to maintain its customer-focused reputation and ensure shoppers keep coming back.\nAn Amazon spokesperson on Monday declined to confirm the existence of Brand Central but said in a statement the company \"has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site\" and it's working aggressively to remove fakes.\n13 Amazon Prime Now: A peek inside the Manhattan warehouse (pictures) Amazon isn't the only online seller to face a counterfeiting problem. Chinese e-retail juggernaut Alibaba and handmade goods marketplace Etsy have also struggled with the issue. And the problem isn't limited to the online world; nearly half a trillion dollars in phony goods were imported worldwide in 2013.\nAmazon already has a Seller Central site that helps its third-party vendors list and maintain their inventories. Seller Central, however, doesn't offer many tools to assist companies that own a brand name. Instead, the site is more useful for resellers of commodity products like paper towels or phone cases.\nOne of the people familiar with Brand Central said Amazon has made the project a priority because sellers with their own brands are among its fastest-growing segments and the company wants to support those new merchants.\n\"I do feel very good about the efforts they are bringing forward,\" said Randy Hetrick, founder and CEO of exercise equipment maker TRX , who said he will be part of a test group for Brand Central. \"Conceptually, it's long overdue.\"\nAfter working closely with the company on the issue, he said Amazon's approach to killing off fakes has undergone \"a sea change.\" Hetrick, a co-plaintiff with Amazon in one of the new lawsuits, said he expects the online seller to significantly attack the counterfeit problem over the next year as it adds staff and digital tools.\nAmazon already has a handful of anti-counterfeiting measures, including reporting tools for sellers and a registry to help merchants manage their brands on Amazon. The company recently made it harder for unauthorized sellers to list items by requiring third-party merchants to pay a fee for listing top brands like Nike or Hasbro. They also have to prove they got the inventory from the manufacturer or an authorized distributor.\nShowing support for these third-party sellers is particularly important, since half of what Amazon sells comes from them.\nMORE ON AMAZON Amazon sues alleged counterfeit sellers Amazon launches Exclusives to surface 'up-and-coming brands' Amazon continues crackdown on alleged fake reviews Some smaller brands, however, feel Amazon isn't doing enough to protect them from fakes and leaves them to fend for themselves.\nFayebeline , a mom-and-pop seller of baby clothes based in Walnut, California, said it's found repeated instances of other Amazon sellers stealing its designs and slapping them on T-shirts, shoes and even women's underwear.\n\"It's a big problem once your stuff gets popular,\" said co-owner Emily Wilcox, who's had to hire a contract worker to find and try removing fakes every week. \"They're popping up all the time.\"\nDon Chernoff, president and founder of luggage-maker SkyRoll , said Amazon has ignored his repeated requests to remove unauthorized listings of his company's products from its site. He doesn't sell on Amazon and has no interest in selling there unless the listings are removed.\n\"The attitude is they're gigantic and they don't give a shit,\" said Chernoff, who runs his one-man business in Reston, Virginia. \"It was really frustrating.\"\nTo cut down on fraudsters stealing sales, DigitalFusion included the following request from buyers in its listings: \"Check your buy box and make sure DigitalFusion CTI is your seller.\"\nStill, other sellers have squatted on the company's listings .\nBut Milstein says he's hopeful Brand Central could give smaller sellers more control.\n\"That's absolutely the right concept,\" he said.\n ",

      "text": "Glacier customers will see a 43 percent decrease in storage prices. Image: iStock \nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is cutting the price of its S3 cloud storage service and Glacier cloud archive service, as well as adding new options for companies wanting to retrieve data from Glacier. \nAWS said it is cutting the per-gigabyte price of its S3 Standard Storage in most AWS regions as of 1 December, and reducing it down to three pricing tiers. It is also cutting the price of Glacier storage in most AWS regions. \nThe S3 price cuts vary by region and by the amount stored, ranging from 16 to 28 percent. Storage per gigabyte across all regions is now around two cents per gigabyte per month -- in 2006, when S3 first launched, prices stood at around 15 cents per gigabyte per month, reflecting the downward pressure on prices. AWS has cut its S3 storage prices Image: Amazon Web Services \nAs far as Glacier is concerned, customers can store 1GB for one month in the US East (Northern Virginia), US West (Oregon), or EU (Ireland) Regions for just $0.004 -- a 43 percent decrease. \nWhen Glacier debuted in 2012, a gigabyte for a month would have cost $0.010: the last Glacier price reduction, in September last year, dropped that by 30 percent to $0.007. \n\"The lower pricing is a direct result of the scale\" of Amazon's cloud storage service, said Jeff Barr, chief evangelist for AWS. \nGlacier is used by customers as the archive element of their tiered storage architecture, and AWS is offering two new retrieval options for archived data: customers can either pay more to get faster data retrieval, or pay less if speed is not a priority. \n'Standard retrieval' is the new name for what Glacier already provides, and is the default for all API-driven retrieval requests. \nCustomers will \"typically\" get their data back in three to five hours using the standard retrieval service, and pay $0.01 per GB and $0.05 for every 1,000 requests, the company said.",

      "title": "IBM boosts number of data centers as it steps up cloud push against Amazon",
      "text": "SHARES show chapters <p>Cloud moving from cost-saving to a platform for innovation: IBM</p> <p>Sebastian Krause, GM Cloud of Europe at IBM, says he believes there are plenty of opportunities in the U.K., specifically in the space of digital transformation. </p> 8 Hours Ago | 03:51 \nIBM is planning to triple its data center capacity in the U.K., the technology firm said on Tuesday, following the likes of Facebook and Google to commit investment to the country following the Brexit vote, as it looks to boost its challenge to rivals Amazon and Microsoft . \nIt marks IBM Cloud's largest commitment to one country at a single point in time though the company did not disclose the size of the investment. IBM is set to open four new data centers in Britain, which will bring its total to six. The first facility will open at the end of December with the other three going live in 2017. \nSebastian Krause, general manager for IBM Cloud in Europe, said that the U.K. is an \"attractive market\" to invest despite the country's decision to leave the European Union (EU). \n\"The growth rates for cloud in the U.K. should be around 25 percent … up to 2020, so it is a significant opportunity, specifically if you consider the European cloud market is about $100 billion in size … and the U.K. is approximately a third of that,\" Krause told CNBC in a TV interview on Tuesday. Sean Gallup | Getty Images A woman walks past the IBM logo \nAfter the results of the EU referendum in Britain on June 24, the pound has fallen around 17 percent against the dollar. But Krause said the devaluation of sterling was not a factor in IBM's decision to expand its data centers in Britain. \n\"We are evaluating areas where to invest in, we are observing the market quite intensely over time, so this decision has been evaluated for quite some time prior to the Brexit,\" Krause said. Changing legal requirements \nEven though Krause did not say the pound's weakness was a factor for investment, analysts said that it was likely to have played a part. But another major reason towards the investment is the \"huge demand\" for cloud services, according to Neil Campling, head of global technology, media, and telecoms research at Northern Trust Capital Markets. \n\"Data growth shows no sign of slowing,\" Campling told CNBC. \nThere is also a broader trend globally to have data stored locally or closer to businesses to comply with privacy and security laws, Campling added. \nKrause said that IBM's data center expansion will help it deal with any regulatory changes that requires localized data. \n\"Our policy and our strategy with regards to deploying data centers has always been to bring the data centers into the countries. So therefore, with six data centers in the future in the U.K. as well as 10 data centers in the rest of Europe… as well as more than 50 data centers around the world, I think we are very well prepared for those security discussions,\" Krause told CNBC. IBM focused on cloud \nIBM's investment follows notable other commitments by U.S. technology firms to the U.K. Last week, Google confirmed its plans to build a new London headquarters and generate 3,000 jobs. And on Monday, Facebook announced it would be boosting its U.K. headcount by 500. \nUnder chief executive Ginni Rometty, IBM has migrated toward cloud-based services offering users big data analytics tools and artificial intelligence (AI) through its machine learning platform known as Watson. IBM said cloud revenue jumped 44 percent in the third quarter of 2016. \nAmazon Web Services (AWS) – the e-commerce giant's cloud business – accounts for 45 percent of the worldwide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) market, eclipsing the combined share of Microsoft, IBM and Google, according to Synergy Research . IaaS is a form of cloud computing, which Amazon helped to create, that provides virtual computing resources online for the public. Amazon also leads in the Platform as a Service (PaaS) market which refers to cloud platforms that developers can build applications on top of. \nHowever, IBM is ahead in the managed private cloud market, according to Synergy Research, which is cloud services dedicated to a single organization rather than public. \nBut IBM is facing stiff competition from the likes of Microsoft, Google and even Alibaba. The latter announced on Monday that it is planning to launch four new data centers across the world. IBM UK clients \nOrganizations such as British retailer Boots as well as sporting tournament Wimbledon are already using IBM's cloud services and AI capabilities. \nAs part of the investment announcement, IBM also said that Thomson, part of the U.K.'s largest tour operator TUI, is using its AI platform Watson to trail a new virtual travel assistant in the form of a chatbot. Users can send messages to the bot and receive replies. \nIBM now has 16 data centers across Europe that form part of the firm's more than 50 facilities globally.",

      "text": "Share \nAmazon has something to cheer about this holiday season: a lot of Prime subscribers. \nThat’s according to Cowen Analyst John Blackledge, who estimated on Monday (Nov. 21) that Amazon’s Prime subscribers in the U.S. have climbed to 49.5 million, reaching an all-time high. \nThe analyst, who conducted a survey of 2,500 consumers, found Amazon Prime had 47 million customers in the third quarter, up 20 percent compared to the 40 million it had last year at this time. \nWhat’s more, the analyst found Prime is accounting for a larger portion of Amazon’s total purchases, coming in at 57 percent in October of this year, which is up from 49 percent in the year-ago October. According to the analyst, 83 percent of Prime subscribers purchased items in October compared to 49 percent of Amazon shoppers who are not Prime members. Prime members also tended to shop across more categories, with the analysis finding they shopped on 3.8 verticals, on average, which is compared to 3.7 for non-Prime members. \nAmazon may already be onto the fact that Prime members shop more. At the end of September, Amazon was accused of favoring big spenders and its Prime members. \nA report from nonprofit investigative news organization ProPublica revealed that the online retailer’s price comparison pages actually rank products in favor of items either sold by Amazon or by merchants who pay the company to ship products for them, Recode reported. Amazon sorts products by price, including the shipping fees, for some products but not for others. The products sold by third-party merchants that do not participate in Amazon’s shipping service were ranked based on the price and shipping price together. Those products sold directly by Amazon or the third-party merchants that participate in its shipping service were ranked without the shipping price, which made them show up on the price comparison page as much cheaper. \n“We found that the practice earned Amazon-linked products higher rankings in more than 80 percent of cases. Amazon’s offer of the Loctite glue, a respectable number five on the comparison list, dropped to the 39th best deal when shipping was included. (The prices Amazon shows are ranked correctly for those who pay $99 per year for Amazon’s Prime shipping service and for those who are buying $49 or more in eligible items.),” ProPublica explained.

      "text": "Business View Caption Hide Caption About 250 ABX pilots are going on strike, according to a release. The cargo carrier operates 45 flights a day for DHL and 35 for Amazon. WILMINGTON \nA cargo airline whose pilots are striking will seek a court order today in a bid to get the pilots flying again in the crucial weeks before Christmas, the airline said. \nAir Transport Services Group, Inc. (ATSG) Tuesday said one of its two airline subsidiaries, ABX Air, Inc., is taking “multiple steps” to end what it calls an “illegal work stoppage” started early Tuesday by its pilots represented by the Airline Professionals Association of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 1224. \n“We will seek a court order later today to restore the status quo operating environment, even as we continue discussions with union representatives about specific issues of concern,” the company said in a statement. \nJoe Hete, president and chief executive of ATSG Inc., said he hoped the strike would not last long. \n“Hopefully not very long,” Hete said. “Hopefully, sane minds will prevail, and we’ll get this resolved shortly.” \n“We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,” ABX Air President John Starkovich said in the statement. \nHete told this news outlet that an order will be sought in Cincinnati’s U.S. District Court. He said at about 8:45 a.m. that the company’s attorneys were working on a request, but nothing had yet been filed. \nAbout 250 pilots who fly for the cargo carrier ABX Air, which operates flights for Amazon and DHL, went on strike Tuesday morning in Wilmington. According to a public relations firm for the union, the move cancelled about 75 flights. \nThe cargo carrier operates 45 flights a day for DHL and 35 for Amazon. \nA message seeking comment was sent to Amazon. \nEarlier this month, a federal court judge rejected a request by all-cargo aircraft operator ABX Air for a temporary restraining order against its pilots and their union, the teamsters noted in a release from Berlin Rosen, the union’s public relations firm. \nJudge Timothy S. Black of the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Ohio wrote that he denied the restraining order because the “court lacks jurisdiction over plaintiff’s claims because this matter represents a ‘minor dispute’ under the RLA (Railway Labor Act) that must be addressed through dispute resolution procedures before the System Board of Arbitration, as provided for by statute and contract,” according to a Nov. 8 story by American Shipper. \nPilots will picket outside ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington and outside DHL’s North American hub at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport. \nRELATED: AMAZON GROWTH HELPS AREA AIR PARK GROW BUSINESES \nThe strike has holiday shoppers worried, and we’re working to learn how this could impact shipping from Amazon and DHL. \nPilots said they are picketing because they are being forced to work for emergency assignments on their off time. \nATSG’s subsidiaries include ABX Air, Inc.; Airborne Global Solutions, Inc.; Air Transport International, Inc.; Cargo Aircraft Management, Inc. and other companies. \nFor updates and more news click here to download our free apps.

      "text": "Amazon's Delivery Drones May Face New Regulatory Roadblocks   09:30   \nConsumer drones have become a pervasive part of our technological society. From endangering the lives of air travellers to actually saving lives in disasters , drones are everywhere—but how long until drones can deliver my damn Amazon order? \nStill ages, unfortunately. As much of a hoo-ha Amazon has made out of its Prime Air delivery service over the past two years, the idea of using drones to deliver orders (aside from PR stunts like this pizza delivery ) just keeps hitting hurdles. \nAmazon’s Prime Air efforts are centered in the United Kingdom, where the company can avoid strict US Federal Aviation Authority rules on flying drones out of a pilot’s line of sight. But this week, according to The Times , Britain’s new transport secretary Chris Gayling warned that delivery drones do indeed pose a safety risk, and that they need to be “handled with great care” before flights are allowed. \n“I think perhaps I have got a little less enthusiasm for a completely liberal market on unmanned aircraft and drones around the country than one or two of my predecessors,” The Times cited Gayling as telling an audience at the Airport Operators Association annual conference in London yesterday. Read more: Israel Gave Russia a Farming Drone and Now Everyone’s Pissed \nThe comments mark a disjuncture from the Department for Transport’s original cooperation with Amazon on its drone testing. Grayling was appointed to his position by Britain’s new Prime Minister Theresa May in July, and contended he is not against drones but doesn’t want to see them “become a real ongoing problem.” Motherboard has requested further comment from both Amazon and the Department for Transport. \nGreat Britain is at the heart of Amazon’s Prime Air ambitions , where company has been testing its Prime Air service since July 2016 . But setbacks in working with a government that views delivery drones as more dangerous than beneficial, and a government that may add more regulatory hoops to the delivery drone process, won’t help Amazon at all, and will only add to lengthy research and development phases. \nFOIA documents hosted on the CAA’s website appear to show that Amazon test flights have been in fact been happening in the UK since summer 2015, longer than many were originally aware of. The revelation increases the time span it is thought Amazon was testing drones in the country, and only goes to show what a drawn out process Amazon’s testing phase will be. \n“The CAA visited an Amazon UK test flying site in June 2015 in order to witness a test flight of the current aircraft and to discuss in outline the next stages based on the application that the company had recently submitted,” said the CAA. \nEmails between CAA and Amazon also show that Amazon executives held a meeting with CAA officials as far back as November 2014, where Amazon’s initial drone delivery plans were outlined to the CAA. \nThe very fact that Amazon has actually been testing its drones in the UK for more than two years, yet still has yet to make a public show or display of the technology, highlights the long wait ahead before delivery drones become a feasible reality. If Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos wants to hit is target of delivery drones debuting in the four to five years he estimated back in 2013 , Amazon had better get a move on.

      "text": "'A French Village,' Streaming on Amazon, Examines Life After Evil Triumphs Tuesday, November 22, 2016 at 10 a.m. - - A French Village starts off on June 12, 1940, with a premiere that includes a German fighter plane shooting at children on a school trip. The scene is suspenseful but also staged with deliberate restraint, like a dream slowly turning into a nightmare before anybody quite realizes it. The series that follows sticks to that matter-of-fact, almost detached tone. Life in the fictional Villeneuve, a village in occupied France about sixty miles from Switzerland, is irreversibly upended by German rule but still retains a routine element. \nThe pitch for A French Village could fit on half a napkin: Each season covers roughly one year of the occupation of Villeneuve in World War II. The import series born from that idea is stellar, though, and its first four seasons are now available to purchase for streaming on Amazon. (The seventh and by all accounts final one, an epilogue dealing with the aftermath of Liberation, just finished airing in France.) And while the show's subject may feel remote to Americans in 2016, it's hard not to be struck by the stakes: How do you go on when your way of life is under attack by an uncontrollable force? \nThe weirdest thing about period dramas is that few of the people who make them actually care about the period. On Poldark, Rome , or Boardwalk Empire , over-plotting and nonstop adventure take precedence over the historical setting itself. Once more into the breeches, but to what end? Not so with A French Village , where the forces of history largely control the plot, creating a feeling of powerlessness that will be familiar to many on the heels of Trump's victory. It's not a very American perspective (here we prefer to believe in the power of individuals to forge their destinies), but it might be a more realistic one. \nWhen the show debuted in France, back in 2009, producer Emmanuel Daucé said its subject was \"the 95 percent of French people who were neither Resistance nor collaborators.\" As a result, A French Village isn't so much about saints and sinners, heroes and villains. Rather, it's about the fabric of community. \nThe creators' concern with realism (historical consultant Jean-Pierre Azéma is one of France's foremost experts on life during the Occupation) translates into a steady scrutiny of the muddy, compromised silent majority, an examination of how living under enemy rule affects character as much as characters. \nThe series' building blocks are the citizens of Villeneuve — the people who make up any ordinary city: a teacher and her principal; the town doctor, who also happens to be the mayor; a wily businessman; the police chief; a farmer's wife. Co-creator, showrunner, and main writer Frédéric Krivine asks us to consider how they live together and how they reach decisions. The key questions are never spelled out explicitly, yet they weigh on every plot development. Never mind dramatic events like being tortured for information — what are these people going to do when, say, a Nazi oh-so-nicely asks for a bottle of wine? What would you have done? It's easy to preach resistance in hindsight, but during the war, going along with the Germans could mean saving lives, at least in the short term. \nNobody knows this better than the doctor/mayor, Daniel Larcher (Robin Renucci). He clearly means well and shows signs of bravery, as when he offers himself in exchange for French hostages held by the Germans. But he also placates the occupiers in an attempt to make things easier for the townspeople, and — to use a currently familiar expression — tries to normalize the situation. \nOr take Raymond Schwartz (Thierry Godard, also on the terrific French cop show Spiral ), who does business with the Wehrmacht. A pure collaborator, right? But he also helps out his lover, Marie (Nade Dieu), an early member of the Resistance, and stands up to his scheming, anti-Semitic wife, Jeannine (Emmanuelle Bach) — one of the most unambiguously villainous characters in a show concerned with nuance. \nAs for resistance, it's not glorified. When a communist group tries to kill a German officer in season two, its members bicker self-destructively (again: so familiar!) and spend almost an entire episode trying to steal a gun. But why would it be otherwise? These people aren't trained operatives, have no experience in mission planning, and several are process-obsessed ideologues who will later argue with competing resistance groups. Plus ça change... \n(Speaking of season two, be warned that Amazon's numbering of episodes is an epic mess. To assemble that season's correct order on Amazon, you need to look up the French season three online.) \nThe tight focus on Villeneuve means that the war is both distant and close. There are no major battle scenes, and the Germans are quickly integrated into the village, resented by some and embraced by others. A few citizens go beyond the call of duty. Neglected by her husband, Dr. Larcher's wife, Hortense (Audrey Fleurot, another Spiral alum), has an affair with a ruthless SS man (Richard Sammel). Jeannine Schwartz writes anonymous letters. For them, this is the new normal. \nCases like these do show that people are not entirely puppets controlled by destiny. The two women act of their own free will, after all, just like mail carrier Suzanne (Constance Dollé) opts to join the Resistance. The series succeeds as television and as history because it always shows the forces and moral conflicts shaping these individual choices. Without catering to cynicism, it also underlines the discrepancy between intentions and outcomes. It's not the most feel-good lesson, but right now, it sure hits close to home.",

      "text": "Amazon apparently never stops thinking about possible perks it could add to its annual $99 Prime membership, and the next feature could be live sports. A report from The Wall Street Journal suggests Amazon is in talks with professional sport organizations including Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, and the National Football League to negotiate the rights to stream live games and events.\nAccording to the report, Amazon is looking at creating a premium sports package that it could include in Amazon Prime memberships. If it comes to fruition, a sports package could draw a lot of new customers to Prime, which already offers free two-day shipping, Amazon Video streaming of TV shows and movies, music streaming with Prime Music, the Prime Reading library of free e-books, and more. It would also be a big way for Prime to stand out among other streaming services, particularly Netflix, which has steered clear of sports since most people don't want to watch a football game after it's over.\nNot only does Amazon want to continue to beef up Prime, but it's also trying to compete with other companies making deals for sports content. Twitter signed a deal with the NFL to stream 10 Thursday Night Football games during the 2016 season, and Facebook live-streamed the National Women's Soccer League opener back in August. In a time where streaming services are incredibly popular, live sports is a major reason why people still pay for pricey cable packages. A good example is DirecTV, which saw a big subscriber bump when it began offering the premium NFL Sunday Ticket package.\nIt will likely be a while before Amazon starts streaming premium live sports since TV companies currently hold most of those rights. ESPN and TNT have the rights to NBA games until 2025; CBS, ESPN, FOX, and NBC share NFL rights for many more years; and rights to college conferences are spread across various networks (and in some cases, are tied up until 2030). However, the report suggests Amazon has also considered purchasing the rights to other sports like the Liga MX soccer league in Mexico and the KHL, a professional hockey league based in Russia, as well as some college-level sporting events.\nThe details of a Prime possible sports package have yet to be determined. According to The Wall Street Journal report, Amazon still doesn't know if the package would be bundled into the $99 Prime price, or if it would require an extra fee. Amazon could also license channels rather than acquiring the rights to the sporting events themselves.",

      "text": "Amazon ( AMZN ) has been in talks to broadcast live sporting events, including talking with the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League, reports the Wall Street Journal.\nWith at least some leagues, including the NBA, Amazon has floated creating a premium, exclusive sports package that would accompany a Prime membership, though the details are unclear, according to the WSJ report . Amazon executives have even talks with traditional TV networks for game rights they aren't using.\nThe WSJ said Amazon also is seeking sports packages like NFL Game Pass, which shows game replays, to sell to Prime members as add-on channels. A premium sports channel could entice more subscribers to Prime, which provides free shipping, music, videos and more for a membership fee of $99.99.",

      "text": "Andrew Myrick Nov 22nd, 2016 \nAmazon has been looking to create a better streaming experience for its Prime subscribers for some time. The company has added a number of streaming showsÂ and is setting its sites on streaming live sports. \nThe company has reportedly reached out to all of the major sports leagues in the US including the NBA, MLB, MLS, and NFL. The company has also reached out to the World Surf League, Indian Premier League, Kontinental Hockey League, and Liga MX. \nHowever, the problem with Amazon’s plans to bring live-streaming options to its customers is the fact that the 4 biggest sports leagues in the US are all under contract. Amazon did try to work out an agreement with the NBA for its League Pass streaming service, but the NBA decided against the agreement. This was due to the league not wanting to limit its choices for potential subscribers. \nDue to many of these leagues being in long-term contracts with other providers, it’s possible that Amazon will continue to hold out. There is another possibility that Amazon works something out with the NFL due to the fact that the leagues deal with Twitter will be over after the season is over. \nWould you look to Amazon for your sports streaming services in the future? Let us know in the comments below.",

      "text": "You Can Now Exchange Bitcoin to USD on Amazon with Just One Click at iPayYou You Can Now Exchange Bitcoin to USD on Amazon with Just One Click at iPayYou Amazon Direct allows users to seamlessly transfer any dollar amount from their existing bitcoin wallet on iPayYou to Amazon. 0 Photo: Bloomberg iPayYou, a Seattle-based Bitcoin wallet , just revealed ‘Amazon Direct’, a new way for consumers to spend bitcoin on the online retail giant’s site. The feature has been under development for months by iPayYou, whose CEO is Gene Kavner, a former worldwide director at Amazon. The developers explains that Amazon Direct allows users to seamlessly transfer any dollar amount of bitcoin from their existing bitcoin wallet on iPayYou to Amazon. iPayYou has added a new Amazon Direct tab to the platform, where users can determine an amount of bitcoin to transfer. After specifying the destination account at Amazon.com, Amazon Direct becomes a one-click feature where users can exchange their funds from Bitcoin on iPayYou to USD on Amazon in seconds. Upon completion of the transfer, users will be able to purchase items as they please. Gene Kavner,founder and CEO, iPayYou.io “Amazon Direct is the best way to spend bitcoin: after determining what you want on Amazon, you can ‘automagically’ transfer bitcoin from iPayYou to Amazon. Amazon Direct is revolutionizing the way consumers are able to spend their bitcoin by granting them access to buy more than 100 million products at the world’s largest store,” said Kavner. “During my time as an executive at Amazon, we closely studied the friction points and obstacles faced by shoppers, including and especially with payments. Bitcoin is a solution to so many of those problems,” added Kavner. “That’s why today – in time for the holiday season –we’re launching the most direct way to spend bitcoin anywhere, starting with the world’s largest retailer.” This latest feature follows iPayYou’s recent gift card integration , which allows users to instantly purchase original gift cards with bitcoin from retailers including Starbucks, Amazon, Best Buy and iTunes. “We want bitcoin to be the everyday default currency. The only way for that to become a reality is to provide consumers with practical ways to spend their bitcoin — that is our grand mission, something the team at iPayYou is working tirelessly to achieve,” concluded Kavner.

      "text": "While Walmart  and Amazon stand to profit big-time from the upcoming Black Friday shopping weekend, there are two alternatives that could offer even better returns. \nPriceline ( PCLN ) and Dick's Sporting Goods ( DKS ) operate in industries that receive a giant boost come holiday season: travel, leisure and sports equipment. Both stocks rose more than 1% in Monday trading. \n1. Priceline \nPriceline is a fast-growth opportunity with years of potential. Not only does the company operate the perennial Priceline.com, but it also owns popular travel sites such as Booking.com and Kayak.\nIts stock is already moving upward; experts believe Priceline will only keep pushing ahead from the end of November into the beginning of December. This online travel specialist, with a market value of more than $74 billion , promises double-digit earnings growth this year.\nAlthough airline ticket sales have remained weak this year, agency and merchant revenues have held steady for Priceline. And the company's multiple hotel booking platforms are edging forward as the most important contributors to the company's results.\nPriceline is also intent on pushing ahead with OpenTable.\nRight now is a great time to get in.",

      "title": "Amazon Wants To Include Live Sports as Part of Prime Membership",
      "text": "on Tuesday November 22, 2016 @10:20AM from the dilemma dept. An anonymous reader writes: Amazon's next Prime membership benefit could be the ability to stream live sports. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Amazon is in talks with leagues like the NFL, NBA, MLB, and a handful of others about live game rights . The fact that Amazon wants to stream live sports isn't a new development. But the Journal did have a noteworthy tidbit: Amazon could offer a \"premium, exclusive sports package\" to those who pay for a $99 per year, or $8.99 per month, Prime membership. Amazon is exploring streaming rights to multiple sports at a variety of levels. The Journal reported that Amazon wanted to exclusively license NBA's League Pass streaming product; it is also reaching out to traditional broadcasters like Univision and ESPN about the content they own but don't end up airing on TV. Amazon was also recently exploring deals with Indian Premier League, a cricket match league. In a recent interview with David Remnick of The New Yorker, Reed Hastings said that one of the most difficult decisions for him has been to not do live sports. He said Netflix doesn't want to move away from movies and TV shows , and only focus on improving the quality of the shows and user experience.",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. J.K. Rowling’s Digital Publishing Company Says It Will Be Profitable This Year \nPottermore, J.K. Rowling’s digital publishing company, expects to turn a profit in its current fiscal year, buoyed by rising sales of audio books and new ebooks that build on the nearly 20-year-old Harry Potter franchise, the company said on Tuesday. \nLaunched as a fan community site in 2012, Pottermore has evolved from a self-publishing site for one of the world’s most popular authors into a firm that sells increasing volumes of ebooks and audio books via partnerships with online retailers. \nRecognizing the pitfalls of a purely go-it-alone, direct-to-fans approach, Pottermore revamped its strategy in 2015 to also sell through Amazon.com amzn , Apple aapl , Amazon’s audio book unit Audible, Barnes & Noble bks , Google googl and Rakuten-owned ebook publisher Kobo. \n“If ebooks can work for anyone, they are going to work for Harry Potter,” said Joseph Evans, a technology analyst for media market research firm Enders Analysis. But he noted how a push by News Corp-owned publisher HarperCollins to create ebook destination sites for other top authors has failed to take off. \n\nFor the fiscal year ended in March 2016, Pottermore’s revenue more than doubled year on year to 15.1 million pounds ($19 million). It narrowed its pretax loss to 4.9 million pounds from 6.0 million in fiscal 2015. \nThe company has been investing in revamping the site, publishing new digital editions of the original seven Harry Potter titles and ebook shorts by Rowling that delve into the stories, characters and settings imagined in the Potter realm. \n“The new strategic plan is not only driving increased revenue but is also putting us on the path to profitability for our financial year ending in March 2017,” Pottermore Chief Executive Susan Jurevics said. \nPottermore is dwarfed by the broader Potter franchise of books, video games, films and related products, which is estimated to have generated as much as $15 billion in sales over nearly two decades. \nLast week, Pottermore.com published Rowling’s screenplay for the feature film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , the weekend’s top box office draw, which took in $75 million for film studio Warner Bros. Pictures in its first three days . \nFantastic Beasts depicts a struggle between North American wizards and non-magical humans in New York in 1926, 70 years before the adventures of Harry Potter, and is the first in a planned five-part film series set to be released into the next decade. \n“There is huge interest in the Wizarding world,” Jurevics said in an interview. “This is a phenomenally evergreen publishing property with a long future roadmap.” \nThe original Harry Potter series of seven books, published between 1997 and 2007, has sold more than 450 million copies worldwide. \nIn addition to her royalties from books and films, Rowling has retained ebook and audio book publishing rights to the Harry Potter books, which she sells through Pottermore.com. \nBeyond the ecommerce offerings, much of the interactive content on the Pottermore site remains free to users, including new works and previously unpublished writing by Rowling, not to mention spells to charm and stupefy your friends. \nPottermore said results for the current 2017 fiscal year will also be boosted by the publication in July of an ebook version of the two-part play Harry Potter and the Cursed Child .",

      "text": "Gigamon Inc. is bringing on-premise-like network visibility to the Amazon Web Services cloud with a data-in-motion visibility platform that enables IT organizations to conduct deep packet analysis on cloud workloads.\nThe company says its Visibility Platform for AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) combines seamless views of both local and cloud infrastructure with the ability to parcel out traffic to various monitoring and security tools running on their own virtual appliances.\n“One has many ways to get visibility on premise, but in the public cloud the options are limited to tools such as such as Amazon CloudWatch VPC Flow Logs,” said Ananda Rajagopal, vice president of products at Gigamon. “This can translate into reluctance by enterprises to move tier-one loads to the cloud.”\nPublic infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) vendors typically shut off virtual switches for security reasons, which limits the ability of their customers to pinpoint performance problems. Gigamon doesn’t have special access to Amazon network data but manipulates output from published application program interfaces (APIs) to provide additional insight. “Our value isn’t access to the traffic but what we do with that traffic,” Rajagopal said.\nThe publicly traded Gigamon sells proprietary hardware and software products that manipulate and route traffic to various external tools for performance management, network management, analysis, compliance and security. The company’s stock has more than doubled this year and closed at an all-time high yesterday. Gigamon claims 79 of the Fortune 100 companies are customers.\nThe Visibility Platform for AWS EC2 enables centralized monitoring of hundreds of virtual private clouds (VPCs) from a single console. This consistent management view enables network and security administrators to better understand what’s going on in their networks, identify anomalies and locate choke points, Rajagopal said.\nFeatures include:\nOne consistent view of network traffic in a VPC without the need for custom agents; Intelligent routing functions to deliver only relevant traffic to security tools; A drag-and-drop interface for configuring traffic policies; and The flexibility to run security tools on-premise, in the same AWS VPC or in a centralized AWS VPC. Gigamon has integrated its GigaVUE-FM fabric manager with AWS’s EC2 APIs and CloudWatch cloud and network monitoring services to automatically discover new EC2 instances or ongoing changes in a VPC. Customers can automatically select and deliver traffic that matches a configured policy as new instances spin up. Open REST APIs allow for third-party orchestration and automation.\nGigamon has more than 70 ecosystem partners and works with more than a dozen open-source tools, including Security Onion, ntop, Wireshark and Bro. Among the partners that have confirmed compatibility with the new AWS platform are Acuity Solutions Corp., Cyphort Inc., ExtraHop Networks Inc., FireEye Inc., Jask Inc., LightCyber Ltd., LogRhythm Inc., Niara Inc., ProtectWise Inc. and RSA Security LLC.\nList pricing is based on the number of monitored EC2 instances and ranges from 1.4 cents to 2.7 cents per hour.",

      "text": "About this Deal **FREE** to download until November 24th, on Amazon Kindle! In the short course of less than one year, a small-town newspaper which was run on a shoe-string was featured on the front page of two major newspapers and on network news, all due to covering the news with loud flashy headlines that ‘shouted’ the news rather than boring its readers to tears. In short, the news made news. That was just the beginning, before long the newspaper would be the target of an organized effort by a county sheriff and his deputies and a candidate for states attorney to clean the paper off newsstands the night before an election and result in a landmark First Amendment case which is now the law of the land.",

      "text": "Amazon's Delivery Drones May Face New Regulatory Roadblocks   09:30   \nConsumer drones have become a pervasive part of our technological society. From endangering the lives of air travellers to actually saving lives in disasters , drones are everywhere—but how long until drones can deliver my damn Amazon order? \nStill ages, unfortunately. As much of a hoo-ha Amazon has made out of its Prime Air delivery service over the past two years, the idea of using drones to deliver orders (aside from PR stunts like this pizza delivery ) just keeps hitting hurdles. \nAmazon’s Prime Air efforts are centered in the United Kingdom, where the company can avoid strict US Federal Aviation Authority rules on flying drones out of a pilot’s line of sight. But this week, according to The Times , Britain’s new transport secretary Chris Gayling warned that delivery drones do indeed pose a safety risk, and that they need to be “handled with great care” before flights are allowed. \n“I think perhaps I have got a little less enthusiasm for a completely liberal market on unmanned aircraft and drones around the country than one or two of my predecessors,” The Times cited Gayling as telling an audience at the Airport Operators Association annual conference in London yesterday. Read more: Israel Gave Russia a Farming Drone and Now Everyone’s Pissed \nThe comments mark a disjuncture from the Department for Transport’s original cooperation with Amazon on its drone testing. Grayling was appointed to his position by Britain’s new Prime Minister Theresa May in July, and contended he is not against drones but doesn’t want to see them “become a real ongoing problem.” Motherboard has requested further comment from both Amazon and the Department for Transport. \nGreat Britain is at the heart of Amazon’s Prime Air ambitions , where company has been testing its Prime Air service since July 2016 . But setbacks in working with a government that views delivery drones as more dangerous than beneficial, and a government that may add more regulatory hoops to the delivery drone process, won’t help Amazon at all, and will only add to lengthy research and development phases. \nFOIA documents hosted on the CAA’s website appear to show that Amazon test flights have been in fact been happening in the UK since summer 2015, longer than many were originally aware of. The revelation increases the time span it is thought Amazon was testing drones in the country, and only goes to show what a drawn out process Amazon’s testing phase will be. \n“The CAA visited an Amazon UK test flying site in June 2015 in order to witness a test flight of the current aircraft and to discuss in outline the next stages based on the application that the company had recently submitted,” said the CAA. \nEmails between CAA and Amazon also show that Amazon executives held a meeting with CAA officials as far back as November 2014, where Amazon’s initial drone delivery plans were outlined to the CAA. \nThe very fact that Amazon has actually been testing its drones in the UK for more than two years, yet still has yet to make a public show or display of the technology, highlights the long wait ahead before delivery drones become a feasible reality. If Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos wants to hit is target of delivery drones debuting in the four to five years he estimated back in 2013 , Amazon had better get a move on.

      "title": "Pilot strike may hurt Amazon’s air operation during holidays",
      "text": "About 250 pilots employed by a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc. went on strike to protest alleged staffing shortages at the cargo carrier, threatening to ground flights for Amazon.com and DHL Worldwide Express during the busy holiday shopping season. ATSG’s ABX Air operates 35 flights a day for Amazon and 45 daily flights for DHL, which will be affected by the strike, according to the Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224, which represents the pilots. The pilots are picketing outside ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, Ohio, and DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport.\nThe action comes as the retail industry’s busiest period gets into full swing and spending continues to shift from physical stores to computers and smartphones. Online spending in November and December will increase 11 percent this year to $91.6 billion, according to an October forecast from Adobe Systems Inc.\nThe union says ABX Air is violating its contract by forcing pilots to work an excessive number of emergency assignments — preventing them from taking time off — because it doesn’t have enough pilots to meet the growing demands of companies like Amazon. The world’s biggest online retailer in March announced plans to lease 20 Boeing 767 freighters from ATSG to help it move inventory around the country. Amazon, DHL and ATSG weren’t immediately available for comment outside of normal business hours.\nPilot strikes in the U.S. are rare due to the Railway Labor Act, a 90-year-old federal law intended to prevent labor disputes from disrupting commerce. And when strikes do occur they often don’t last very long because the company can ask a judge to intervene with a temporary restraining order until the court decides if the strike is legal. On rare occasions, if a dispute substantially threatens essential transportation in the country, the U.S. president could get involved.\nATSG said it will seek a court order Tuesday to “restore the status quo operating environment,” while it continues discussions with union representatives. Amazon didn’t immediately respond to email and phone requests for comment. The company’s shares advanced less than 1 percent in early trading after closing at $780 on Monday.\nThe pilots say their strike is allowed because of the contract violations, and voted to authorize a walkout in May.\n“For the past two years, we’ve been warning them that they are dangerously short on pilots,” said Rick Ziebarth, 59, who’s been with ABX for 39 years. “The lifestyle of our crews have really taken a nose-dive. I can’t tell you how many birthdays, anniversaries and even funerals pilots can’t attend as a result of these emergency assignments.”\nPilots on Amazon runs fly night and day from Wilmington to Dallas, Texas, to Stockton, California, to Rockford, Illinois, and back to Wilmington — sometimes with nowhere to rest but the cockpit, Ziebarth said. Such routes can increase fatigue because of rotations between night and day, he said. Pilots are willing to make accommodations for customers but want the company to abide by its contract by honoring vacation time and regulating emergency assignments, he said.\nAmazon’s air cargo operation is part of efforts to reduce its dependence on United Parcel Service and FedEx, as it expands a $99-a-year Prime membership service that can deliver orders in as little as a day. In addition to ATSG, Amazon in May entered into an agreement with Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings to acquire and operate 20 Boeing 767-300 freighters for the online retailer.\nA dedicated fleet helps Amazon shuffle inventory around the country more efficiently to meet demand spikes, while reducing the inventory it has to carry nationally.\nThe ABX strike underscores how a national pilot shortage could hinder Amazon’s air cargo aspirations. Its logistics partners have to compete for pilots with UPS, FedEx and passenger carriers that pay better wages and offer better benefits. That’s a different game than filling warehouses with temporary workers because pilots require years of training, especially for big aircraft, said Matt Barton, an aviation industry economist with FlightPath Economics in Golden, Colorado.\n“I don’t think Amazon has encountered a problem like the pilot shortage before and it doesn’t have a quick and easy solution,” Barton said. “A lot of these carriers are going to have a hard time finding the pilots they need.”\namazon-pilots",

And in 9 hours you do very little work.\nFor anyone who wants to get seriously into OS SDC development, I recommend to invest in at least a mid-range deep learning machine, this will help also the community as we are trying to build a shared infrastructure with our own GPUs.\nI’ll write more about all of these in the next parts of this series.",

      "text": "If you live in the UK, you've had access to Amazon Tickets since 2015. The service is similar to Ticketmaster in that you can purchase tickets to UK-based shows including \"The Lion King\" and \"Wicked\" and concerts of artists like Blink-182 and Drake. Now Amazon appears to be looking into expanding the program: the company has a number of job listings for Amazon Tickets positions based in Seattle, Washington on its employment website.\n\"Following our debut in London’s West End with every ticket to every show, we are rapidly expanding our selection across the UK,\" one of the job listings states. \"As with any growing Amazon business, we are always looking for opportunities to expand into more categories and geographies.\"\nAnother Tickets job posting states that Amazon isn't just looking to offer a wide variety of tickets to shows and concerts but also to \"disrupt the entire live entertainment experience, including what happens before, during and after the show.\" Most of the job postings harp on the idea that ticket-buying can be a frustrating experience when the prices are too high or if you miss your favorite artist because you didn't know they were performing in your town. While there are no details on how Amazon wants to fix those problems, it's clear that the company wants to set itself apart from the Ticketmasters—and possibly the StubHubs and SeatGeeks—of the world by creating a better ticket-buying experience.\nA Recode report also suggests that Amazon is looking into a service called \"Prime Tickets,\" but details of that are not known. It's possible that Prime Tickets could offer discounted tickets to Prime members if the service is indeed tied to the annual $99 membership. While a US expansion for Tickets would be tough for Amazon, the idea of offering discounted tickets could be even more of a struggle. There are only so many tickets for a concert or show to go around, and Live Nation (Ticketmaster's parent company) is already dominant in the US. There are also special deals that artists and venues strike up with ticket companies, and even some credit card companies that offer priority seating or special pricing for cardholders. Most of the Tickets job postings were updated within the past week, but there's no word on when a US-based Amazon Tickets could debut.",

      "text": "Amazon announces new Dash-powered devices that can auto-reorder your coffee, air filters, and more Posted Facebook downsizes SMB sales in Europe, reportedly cuts 30 jobs in Germany \nAmazon is expanding the lineup of devices that will automatically reorder their supplies for you through the retailer’s Dash Replenishment service. The program, which brings instant reordering to connected devices – like washing machines that order your detergent, or printers that order your ink – now includes a new handful of Dash-enabled products from companies like Nestle, Honeywell, WePlenish, and GeniCan. \nPlus, other new products like the Whirlpool Smart Dishwasher and PUR Ultimate Faucet Filtration System, are also now coming online with Dash, says Amazon. \nAmong the newly announced Dash devices, connected thermostat maker Honeywell’s involvement may be the most interesting. The company says that its devices will now be able to calculate when a new air filter is needed, then automatically reorder one from Amazon. Homeowners often forget to replace air filters, so having one sent out to you on a scheduled basis like this makes sense and is a good example of how this service can be more practical. After all, simply having an Amazon box show up at your door is a good reminder to go and swap out your old filter. \nThe other companies joining Dash are GeniCan, a device place in your garbage can that lets you reorder household items via barcode scanning and voice recognition; Nestle, whose BabyNes nutrition system will reorder formula capsules; and WePlenish, whose WePlenish Java will reorder coffee when supplies are low. \nMeanwhile, PUR’s new Ultimate Bluetooth-enabled faucet filtration system is available today, and will reorder your replacement filters automatically, as needed. \nMore notably, Whirlpool’s Smart Dishwasher will be available starting next month, and will use Dash Replenishment to automatically reorder dishwasher detergent when supplies are low. \nWhirlpool isn’t the only connected dishwasher hitting the market – GE has also Dash-enabled its dishwashers and washing machines. \nOther manufacturers participating in Dash include Brita, Behmor, Brother, Cleverpet, Petcube, Samsung, Beko, Bosch, Siemens, Grundig, Kyocera, and more. (Some brands are live in Europe, as Dash recently expanded to the region.) \nAmazon hasn’t yet offered any insight into how well Dash-powered products are selling, but the program is still new. Device makers can enable their products to use Dash by integrating with open APIs that connect with the internet to place the orders. Already, dozens of manufacturers have joined in since the service went live at the beginning of the year.",

      "text": "Enlarge (credit: Amazon)\nIf you live in the UK, you've had access to Amazon Tickets since 2015. The service is similar to Ticketmaster in that you can purchase tickets to UK-based shows including \"The Lion King\" and \"Wicked\" and concerts of artists like Blink-182 and Drake. Now Amazon appears to be looking into expanding the program: the company has a number of job listings for Amazon Tickets positions based in Seattle, Washington on its employment website.\n\"Following our debut in London’s West End with every ticket to every show, we are rapidly expanding our selection across the UK,\" one of the job listings states. \"As with any growing Amazon business, we are always looking for opportunities to expand into more categories and geographies.\"\nAnother Tickets job posting states that Amazon isn't just looking to offer a wide variety of tickets to shows and concerts but also to \"disrupt the entire live entertainment experience, including what happens before, during and after the show.\" Most of the job postings harp on the idea that ticket-buying can be a frustrating experience when the prices are too high or if you miss your favorite artist because you didn't know they were performing in your town. While there are no details on how Amazon wants to fix those problems, it's clear that the company wants to set itself apart from the Ticketmasters—and possibly the StubHubs and SeatGeeks—of the world by creating a better ticket-buying experience.\nRead 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "WILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) — About 250 pilots for a cargo airline have gone on strike in Ohio, grounding dozens of flights and potentially delaying shipping as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear.\nThe strike began Tuesday by pilots for ABX Air, which operates flights for Amazon and DHL. They announced picketing at ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington and DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.\nThe carrier’s parent company, Air Transport Services Group, Inc., tells the Dayton Daily News it will seek a court order to try to get operations back to normal while it discusses the pilots’ concerns with their union.\nThe pilots allege the carrier has been understaffed and they’ve been forced to work on off days and denied compensatory time that’s due under their contract.\n  The Associated Press  ",

      "text": "Cindy Reston (Erin Darke) on Good Girls Revolt . Amazon ID: 10028808 Amazon’s Good Girls Revolt centers on the female researchers at the fictional News of the Week magazine who sue the publication in 1970 in order to become reporters. But for one character in particular, Cindy Reston (Erin Darke), the lawsuit sparks more than a social and political awakening; it inspires her to embark on her own sexual revolution.\nIn the second episode of the show’s first season, which debuted on Oct. 28, Cindy attends a consciousness-raising meeting alongside some of her colleagues and other women outside of their office. In the middle of a conversation, the host of the meeting announces to everyone in the room, “Ladies, circle back up for our final exercise. Please bring your compacts; we’re going to be celebrating our beautiful bodies by looking at our vulvas.”\nLater that night when Cindy goes home, she takes a compact with her into the bathroom, pulls down her underwear, and examines herself privately; it’s clear from her face that she’s looking at her vagina for the very first time. Two episodes later, after some conversations with trusted friends and a romantic interaction with a co-worker, she masturbates alone in bed while her husband is in the next room watching I Dream of Jeannie. \n“I was so happy when we got to that episode and I got to film the masturbation scene because I feel like that is something that is so rarely seen [on television],” Darke told BuzzFeed News at a press event in October.\nFor Darke, depicting women seeking their own pleasure is one of the most empowering things about Good Girls Revolt . “It was this woman coming into herself and realizing, ‘I deserve pleasure for me,’” she said.\nView this image › \nCindy masturbating for the first time. Amazon \nID: 10028796 There’s a deep history of women not being encouraged or empowered to understand their own bodies, in part because they’ve historically belonged to other people. During Cindy’s young life, sex was presumably geared toward male pleasure or for the purpose of reproduction; rarely, if ever, was sex discussed in terms of women’s pleasure.\nIn Darke’s opinion, portraying Cindy’s sexual awakening is crucial because it’s also something “women still struggle with today.” Darke, for example, said she didn’t masturbate until she was in her twenties. “I didn’t know, I’d never been introduced to it. Nobody ever talked to me about it,” she said. “My mother certainly never told me about it. I never saw it in pop culture.”\nThe actor cites Sex and the City , which premiered on HBO in 1998, as a “huge moment” for her and the reason she started exploring her own body as a means of achieving sexual pleasure.\n“Starting to watch these women take control over their own pleasure was a huge thing for me. I went out [and] bought my first vibrator,” she said. “In some ways, I feel like we had this landmark thing and then we still just don’t see [masturbation] that much.”\nView this image › \nCarrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) on Sex and the City in 1998. HBO \nID: 10028920 Not only does Darke think that masturbation and sexual empowerment are absent in pop culture, but she also sees a lack of that kind of discussion among friends.\n“We don’t talk about it, we never talk about it. I was probably 25 before I had a conversation with another female friend of mine, of like, ‘Do you masturbate?’” she said. “There’s literally nothing wrong with it. Why is it this taboo thing? I’m so happy that the show owned that.”\nWhile observing her own vagina in a compact mirror may seem like a minor moment for Cindy on Good Girls Revolt , it’s indicative of her growth as a character and it speaks to her desire to challenge what she’s long been told.\n“ What I love and relate to most about Cindy is the fear that you don’t deserve what it is that you want, or you don’t deserve to be happy,” Darke said. “I know I struggle with that sometimes, and she’s suffering from that to an extreme degree. I think there’s just this person in Cindy trying to fight its way out against everything she’s been taught her whole life.”",

      "text": "Amazon’s first “Prime Air” cargo jet soars over Seafair. (Credit: Scott Eklund / Red Box Pictures) Amazon.com is gearing up for its big holiday shopping season, but a pilot strike could bring some misery to the giant online retailer as it looks to ship goods across the globe. About 250 pilots for ABX Air on Tuesday walked off the job, citing ongoing staffing shortages.\nABX, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group, operates about 35 flights per day on behalf of Amazon, according to Business Insider .\nABX Air President John Starkovich said today that the company will seek a court order to “restore the status quo operating environment.”\nEarlier this month, UPS aircraft maintenance workers authorized a strike over healthcare benefits.\nAmazon has been expanding its air fleet, in partnership with companies like Air Transport Services Group and New York-based Atlas Air. At Seafair in Seattle in August, Amazon debuted a Boeing 767-300 painted with the company’s Prime Air branding, the first jet to be leased from and operated by Atlas Air . Amazon also holds options to buy stakes in both ATSG and Atlas Air, both of which plan to operate a fleet of 20 jets on behalf of Amazon over the next few years.\nHere’s the full press release issued this morning by Air Transport Services Group:\nAir Transport Services Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATSG) today said one of its two airline subsidiaries, ABX Air, Inc., is taking multiple steps to resolve and end an illegal work stoppage that began today by its pilots represented by the Airline Professionals Association of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 1224.\n“We will seek a court order later today to restore the status quo operating environment, even as we continue discussions with union representatives about specific issues of concern,” ABX Air President John Starkovich said today. “We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements.”\nAt the same time, Starkovich said, “ABX Air is notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume. We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period.”\n",

      "title": "Amazon Allows Your Appliances To Order Supplies Automatically With Dash Replenishment",
      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Amazon Allows Your Appliances To Order Supplies Automatically With Dash Replenishment Amazon has really made it easy for customers to order all of their needed home consumables with Dash buttons . With a simple press, you can instantly reorder items from Slim Jims to detergent to pet food to Red Bull. However, through its new Amazon Dash Replenishment Service, you won’t even have to lift a finger to reorder supplies for supported internet-connected devices.\nManufacturers whose smart appliances interface with the new Dash Replenishment APIs can automatically place a supplies order through Amazon. So, imagine if your washing machine with its own built-in detergent tank is near empty; it would automatically reorder for you. Or what if the PUR filter in your refrigerator is close to the end of its useful life? Dash Replenishment has you covered there as well. \n“More and more customers are experiencing the magic of automatic reordering with Dash Replenishment. They avoid the hassle of tracking their household stock of essentials like dishwasher detergent, printer ink, and water filters—when they’re about to run out, Amazon automatically delivers a package to their doorstep,” said Daniel Rausch, Director of Amazon Dash . \n“We’re delighted by the momentum of the program and the feedback we’re hearing from device makers and developers—Dash Replenishment is simple to integrate and brings an innovative new customer benefit and business model to their connected devices.” \nTwo new products that have been announced that are Dash Replenishment-enabled include the Whirlpool Smart Dishwasher (available next month) and PUR Ultimate Faucet Filtration System (available today). Other partners include GeniCan, Honeywell , WePlenish and Nestle. \nTo help build some excitement around the Dash Replenishment Service and its supporting APIs, Amazon is encouraging developers to “create something that helps advance the vision of automatic or low-friction replenishment.” Developers can enter the challenge by visiting this site , and the grand prize will be a 27-inch Apple iMac 5K .",

      "text": "Cargo pilot strike in Ohio may delay Amazon, DHL shipping Posted: Updated: Tuesday,   \nWILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) - About 250 pilots for a cargo airline have gone on strike in Ohio, grounding dozens of flights and potentially delaying shipping as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. \nThe strike began Tuesday by pilots for ABX Air, which operates flights for Amazon and DHL. They announced picketing at ABX Air's headquarters in Wilmington and DHL's North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nThe carrier's parent company, Air Transport Services Group, Inc., tells the Dayton Daily News it will seek a court order to try to get operations back to normal while it discusses the pilots' concerns with their union. \nThe pilots allege the carrier has been understaffed and they've been forced to work on off days and denied compensatory time that's due under their contract.

They announced picketing at ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington and DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nThe carrier’s parent company, Air Transport Services Group, Inc., tells the Dayton Daily News it will seek a court order to try to get operations back to normal while it discusses the pilots’ concerns with their union. \nThe pilots allege the carrier has been understaffed and they’ve been forced to work on off days and denied compensatory time that’s due under their contract. \nCopyright © 2016 The Washington Times, LLC.",

      "text": "Share \nBitcoin wallet iPayYou continues to work toward a future with bitcoin as the default currency. It was just announced that iPayYou has made a way for consumers to pay for items on Amazon with bitcoin, called Amazon Direct. \nNow iPayYou users can transfer any amount of bitcoin from their bitcoin wallet to Amazon. Customers can use the Amazon Direct tab to the iPayYou platform to determine an amount of bitcoin to transfer and the destination account. After that, bitcoin holders are one click and a couple of seconds away from exchanging bitcoins to U.S. dollars to use anywhere on Amazon. \nGene Kavner, former worldwide director at Amazon and current CEO of iPayYou, said in a press release, “During my time as an executive at Amazon, we closely studied the friction points and obstacles faced by shoppers, including and especially with payments. Bitcoin is a solution to so many of those problems. That’s why today, in time for the holiday season, we’re launching the most direct way to spend bitcoin anywhere, starting with the world’s largest retailer.” \nPreviously, bitcoin carriers could only use bitcoins to purchase an Amazon digital gift card. iPayYou, which launched in May of this year, also comes with the option for users to purchase gift cards with Starbucks, Best Buy and iTunes. \niPayYou boasts low transaction fees allows users to cancel transactions if something goes wrong during the payment process. In July of this year, iPayYou launched Pay-by-Twitter , enabling Twitter’s 310 million monthly active users to make peer-to-peer payments over the social media platform. \nUsers can send a payment by simply entering the recipient’s Twitter handle, meaning bitcoin exchanges can happen without either party involved needing to exchange any private information.",

      "text": "Print Image via Ikpro /Shutterstock.com \nThe most surprising thing about Amazon’s latest ad for its Prime service is that it appears to be the first time a Muslim cleric has been featured in a television ad shown in the United States. \n“I can’t think of one. There are plenty of religious figures in televisions, especially sitcoms and police procedurals. But no ads with imams,” said Tobe Berkovitz, a professor of advertising at Boston University. \nAmazon has done several wordless ads for Prime, featuring people buying what it terms charming solutions for everyday problems. They include a father buying a lion’s mane for the family dog, so the new baby isn’t scared of it; a dog with a broken leg getting a lift in a baby carrier; and a grandfather using a leaf blower to power his granddaughter’s swing. The new ad, which begins airing in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany on Nov. 16, would be no different were the subject matter not so rare. \nSet in England, the commercial begins with an Episcopal priest opening the door for his good friend, a Muslim imam. The two older men talk, laugh, and share a cup of tea, both wincing at their creaky knees as they sit and stand. \nAfter they part, both pull out their phones, tap the Prime app, and order something. \nNext we see them getting a delivery at their respective homes, and it’s clear they’ve each bought the other identical knee pads. \nThe end of the 120-second ad features both men in their respective houses of worship, kneeling in prayer. Amazon didn’t set out to make any kind of political statement, and the subject had nothing to do with the recently concluded U.S. presidential election, the company was quick to say. Work on the ad had already begun in June, said Simon Morris, Amazon’s European Union director of advertising. \nHowever, it’s clear that the topic is of concern, as Amazon does not generally reach out to the press in advance about its television ads, but did with this one. Groups that track hate crimes say there has been a rise in anti-immigrant, and anti-Muslim incidents, since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump, who called for a halt to all immigrants who were Muslim during his campaign. Respectful \nThe Amazon producers worked with several religious groups, including the Interfaith Alliance, the National Council of Churches, and the Islamic Circle of North America, to ensure the ad was respectful, said Morris. \nThe lead characters in the commercial are played by actual religious leaders. They are Gary Bradley, vicar at St Mary’s and Paddington Green in London, and Zubier Mohammad, principal of the Muslim School Oadby in Leicester, Morris said. The advertisement was filmed at two churches, St. Dunstan and All Saints Stepney Church in London, and at the East London Mosque. \nWhile Muslims are a small minority in the United States, making up just under 1 percent of the U.S. population, there are 3.3 million of them, and there have been Muslim communities in the country for decades. Despite that, advertising professors and historians had to think hard about whether an Islamic religious leader had ever been depicted in an ad. \n“We certainly have used priests, nuns, ministers, rabbis, and many other clerical types, but I have no memory of a Muslim Cleric ever being used,” said John Verret, who worked in advertising for 40 years, and now faculty advisor to the Boston University AdLab, a student-run advertising agency. \nThat could be because advertisers have faced backlash in the past. \nIn 2011 Lowe’s pulled ads from a TLC reality series, All-American Muslim, because of pressure from a Florida conservative group that objected to the fact that the show depicted Muslims as “ ordinary folks while excluding many Islamic believers whose agenda poses a clear and present danger to liberties and traditional values that the majority of Americans cherish.” The show was later cancelled. \nIn England, where Muslims make up 5 percent of the population, the ad follows the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union. The so-called Brexit referendum stemmed, in part, with dissatisfaction with a surge in immigration , and set off a wave of attacks on Poles and Muslims in late June. While holiday ads are just ads in the United States, they have a whole different cultural connotation in the United Kingdom. There, the annual arrival of “Christmas adverts” is awaited with the same anticipation that is reserved for Super Bowl ads in the United States.",

      "text": "Cargo pilot strike in Ohio may delay Amazon, DHL shipping Updated 16 min ago ( … ) \nWILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) — About 250 pilots for a cargo airline have gone on strike in Ohio, grounding dozens of flights and potentially delaying shipping as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. \nThe strike began Tuesday by pilots for ABX Air, which operates flights for Amazon and DHL. They announced picketing at ABX Air's headquarters in Wilmington and DHL's North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nThe carrier's parent company, Air Transport Services Group, Inc., tells the Dayton Daily News it will seek a court order to try to get operations back to normal while it discusses the pilots' concerns with their union. \nThe pilots allege the carrier has been understaffed and they've been forced to work on off days and denied compensatory time that's due under their contract.

Subscribe today! By &   11:32 AM \nPilots for Wilmington-based cargo airline ABX Air went on strike early today, on the eve of the busiest season of the year for retail shippers. The airline, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group, operates a combined 80 flights per day around the country on behalf of both Amazon and DHL. \nIn addition to its base in Wilmington, ABX also operates at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, where DHL has a hub. \nIn a statement issued this morning, ABX said it will quickly go to court to compel its 250 pilots to return to work. \n“We will seek a court order later today to restore the status quo operating environment, even as we continue discussions with union representatives about specific issues of concern,” said ABX Air President John Starkovich. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements.” \nThe pilots, represented by the Airline Professionals Association of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Local 1224, contend that ABX has been requiring pilots to fly “emergency” assignments on their off time in violation of their contract. They say the company has done this for nearly two years, rather than recalling pilots who have been furloughed. \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, the pilots union said. \n“Our airline is facing a staffing crisis because ABX and ATSG executives knew they needed more pilots but chose to put our customers, our fellow employees and our shareholders at risk in a vain attempt to save a buck,\" said one of the striking pilots, ABX Air Captain Tim Jewell said in a statement. \"ABX Air needs to restore the status quo and hire enough pilots so we can get the job done.”",

They announced picketing at ABX Air's headquarters in Wilmington and DHL's North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nThe carrier's parent company, Air Transport Services Group, Inc., tells the Dayton Daily News it will seek a court order to try to get operations back to normal while it discusses the pilots' concerns with their union. \nThe pilots allege the carrier has been understaffed and they've been forced to work on off days and denied compensatory time that's due under their contract.

The company has been in talks for live sports broadcasting rights with top leagues including the National Basketball Association (NBA), Major League Baseball (MLB), and the National Football League (NFL). It has also talked with soccer, lacrosse, and surfing leagues, as per reliable sources. (Source: “ Amazon Explores Possible Premium Sports Package With Prime Membership ,” The Wall Street Journal , November 21, 2014.) \nIf the company succeeds in taking on the live sports segment, which has been a stronghold of pay television, it would be a huge win for the Internet retailer, which is betting big on video st, and the company plans to create an exclusive sports package for its Amazon Prime program. \nSuch a premium sports package would mean more additions to the Prime program, which currently is priced at an attractive $99.00 per year. This would mean more gains for AMZN stock. \nSponsored Advertising Content: Big Tech Stocks Poised for More Growth \nThere might be delays because many premium rights are tied up, but Amazon is unlikely to give up. In the meantime, its current offerings for Prime members are doing great. \nIn a press release on Monday, Amazon said its original show, “The Grand Tour,” has broken viewership records on “Prime Video.” Millions of Prime members streamed the first episode of “The Grand Tour” over the opening weekend in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Austria, and Japan. The debut episode broke all previous records, including the one for the debut of Amazon’s highly acclaimed “The Man in the High Castle.” This bodes well for AMZN stock. \nFurther, on the day of the “The Grand Tour” debut, total new Prime membership sign-ups exceeded all previous days, with the exception of Amazon’s renowned Prime day. (Source: “ Amazon Original The Grand Tour Breaks Viewership Records on Prime Video ,” Amazon.com, Inc., November 21, 2016.) \nIn addition to the brilliant customer reviews, “The Grand Tour” has received outstanding critical acclaim from media around the world. \nThis proves the point that customers love Amazon.com, Inc. that and its Prime juggernaut is not showing any signs of slowing down. Amazon’s business is right on track, and Amazon stock has huge potential ahead.",

      "text": "Cargo pilot strike in Ohio may delay Amazon, DHL shipping Posted: Updated: \nWILMINGTON, Ohio (AP) - About 250 pilots for a cargo airline have gone on strike in Ohio, grounding dozens of flights and potentially delaying shipping as the holiday shopping season swings into high gear. \nThe strike began Tuesday by pilots for ABX Air, which operates flights for Amazon and DHL. They announced picketing at ABX Air's headquarters in Wilmington and DHL's North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nThe carrier's parent company, Air Transport Services Group, Inc., tells the Dayton Daily News it will seek a court order to try to get operations back to normal while it discusses the pilots' concerns with their union. \nThe pilots allege the carrier has been understaffed and they've been forced to work on off days and denied compensatory time that's due under their contract.

      "title": "Pilot Strike Could Delay Amazon’s Holiday Shipments",
      "text": "Amazon’s holiday season has become far more complicated.\nApproximately 250 pilots who fly cargo carriers for ABX Air went on strike Tuesday morning and have declined to fly any of their scheduled routes until they can come to an agreement with their employer. ABX, which is owned by the Air Transport Services Group (ATSG), has several cargo customers, but its two biggest are Amazon and DHL. And now the pilots and the Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224 union supporting them are saying Amazon’s shipments could be impacted, leading to delivery delays for the e-retail giant’s customers.\nAccording to the pilots, the cargo carrier is flying 14 aircraft and 35 flights per day for Amazon AMZN , carrying the company’s goods from one spot to another to facilitate shipments to customers. In a statement, the pilots say “Amazon customers will also see delays and disruptions.” DHL relies on Air Transport Services Group for 45 flights per day.\nThe row between the pilots and ABX is due in part to what the pilots say is a company that is “significantly understaffed.” They claim ABX Air and ATSG are violating their employment contract by forcing them to work “emergency assignments” when they’re not scheduled to fly, and not allowing them to take extra time off for their additional work.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \n\"I take my job as a pilot seriously, and I'm committed to serving ABX Air and our customers, but I'm also a father of a little girl and help care for my aging mother,\" Randy Riesbeck, an ABX pilot, said in a statement. \"On numerous occasions I have had to miss my daughter's school events and previously scheduled medical appointments for my mother, all because ABX Air emergency assigned me to work on a day I had scheduled off. How am I supposed to explain to my daughter why I wasn't there to see her grow up? How do I explain to my mother that I can't take her to the doctor?\"\nThe pilots add that their work schedule is “causing stress and strain” and say their employers might be violating a U.S. law governing work and compensation.\n“To date in 2016, pilots have been scheduled to cover over 8000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off,” a statement reads. “As the airline moves into peak holiday flying season, ABX Air and ATSG are refusing to honor contractual provisions regarding compensatory time and vacation time in order to cover the pilot deficit. This change violates the terms of the company's agreement with the pilots, which is a violation of the status quo under the Railway Labor Act.”\nABX Air said in a statement on Tuesday that it believes the strike is “illegal” and says it will use the court system to put an end to the stoppage.\nFor more about Amazon , watch: \n\"We will seek a court order later today to restore the status quo operating environment, even as we continue discussions with union representatives about specific issues of concern,\" ABX Air President John Starkovich said in a statement. \"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements.\"\nThe chief executive added that its customers might face “temporary interruptions” to their service, but didn’t say how far-reaching the delays might be.\nAn Amazon spokesperson didn’t say how the work stoppage might affect the company’s shipments and customer service.\n“We work with a variety of carriers and are confident in our ability to serve customers,” the spokesperson said in a statement. It’s unclear how much of Amazon’s logistics network relies upon the 35 affected flights.\nIn a statement to Fortune , an ABX Air spokesperson did not elaborate beyond Starkovich’s public comments.\nThe strike comes just a day after workers at Chicago O’Hare International Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world, announced a strike ahead of the busy holiday travel season .",

The 1:20-spot features a priest and an imam (both with bad knees) enjoying tea together, and later ordering presents for each other on Amazon. \nThe big reveal (spoiler alert), is that they both order each other knee pads so that they could pray more comfortably. You can see the ad, and its message of holiday season unity below.",

      "title": "Pilots strike at cargo carrier serving Amazon, DHL - MarketWatch",
      "text": "A union representing pilots for a cargo carrier that serves Deutsche Post AG's DHL and Amazon.com Inc. went on strike Tuesday, just days before the peak holiday shopping season.\nThe pilots are picketing ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., and aren't flying scheduled routes, the union said Tuesday. ATSG has 58 freighter aircraft in its fleet, including 50 widebody Boeing 767 planes.\nPilots aren't crossing the picket lines, which means planes are unable to leave an Amazon hub in Wilmington, Ohio, and a DHL hub in Cincinnati, said a person familiar with the matter.\nAmazon will see a limited impact, since it has only a few flights operating at this point and not all of them will be going through Ohio, the person said. Still, the action will throw off both DHL and Amazon's networks as they head into the all-important holiday season.\nDHL said some \"inbound deliveries to portions of the Americas will be delayed today\" due to the work stoppage. Amazon said it works with a variety of carriers and is \"confident in our ability to serve customers.\"\nAir Transport Services Group said it is trying to end what it calls an illegal work stoppage. ABX Air President John Starkovich said the airline is seeking a court order to force the pilots back to work.\n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments\" aren't legal, Mr. Starkovich said.\nAirlines and railroads fall under the U.S. Railway Labor Act, which makes it more difficult to strike. Under that law, contracts don't expire, and federal mediation is mandated if the two sides can't come to an agreement. The mediators also can call for a recess in negotiations if the two sides reach a stalemate.\nABX Air pilots say they operate 45 flights a day for DHL and an unspecified number for Amazon as they ship millions of online orders during the holiday season.\n\"We are going to do our best to correct that situation with as small an impact as possible,\" said ATSG spokesman Paul Cunningham.\nThe company's ABX subsidiary operates 13 of the 767 aircraft entirely for DHL under long-term leases, he said. The airline is phasing in contract operations for Amazon that eventually will include 20 aircraft, but the spokesman didn't have up-to-date information on how many planes ABX has in service for the e-commerce retailer.\nThe pilot union says ABX Air has been \"significantly understaffed\" recently, forcing pilots to work \"emergency assignments\" on their off time, a violation of the union contract. They are represented by the Airline Professionals Association, Teamsters Local 1224\nATSG Chief Executive Joseph Hete said earlier this month that problems finding pilots had contributed to a steep year-over-year profit decline in the period.\n\"Our third quarter results were adversely impacted by premium pay to ABX Air pilots, despite an aggressive crew member recruiting program and rigorous training schedule,\" Mr. Hete said in a Nov. 3 earnings release.\n--Paul Ziobro contributed to this article.\nWrite to Paul Page at paul.page@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com\nMore from MarketWatch Opinion Journal: The New Trump Democrats Donald Trump and Mitt Romney Make Move to Reconcile Two big Black Swans lurk for stocks’ record run",

      "text": "Amazon faces holiday shipping disaster as pilots go on strike  30 PM Hayley Peterson - Business Insider \nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages. \nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price. \nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots. \nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nABX Air President John Starkovich said the company is \"notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume.\" \n\"We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period,\" he said in a statement to Business Insider. \nThe company is also seeking a court order to force pilots to return to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" he said. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.

      "text": "Reddit \nAmazon Prime subscribers may soon get live sports streaming as part of their Prime Video, with the retail behemoth said to be in talks with multiple leagues about a potential deal. Prime , Amazon’s $99.99 a year membership scheme, began originally as a way for shoppers to get faster shipping on all of their orders with no individual surcharges, but has subsequently expanded to include a variety of content as well. In addition to Prime Video, which offers on-demand TV shows and movies, there’s Prime Music, a lending library of Kindle ebooks, and more. \nNow, Amazon is believed to be exploring how it can add live sports to that mixture as well. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, execs at the retailer have been holding talks with The National Football League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, and Major League Soccer. The retailer declined to comment on the insider whispers. \nHowever it’s not only big-name leagues that Amazon is apparently interested in. The company has supposedly also been negotiating with more niche sports, including lacrosse, surfing, and Mexican soccer league games. Its intention, sources say, is to either pick up the unbroadcast scraps from traditional networks, or bypass them altogether, and deliver an internet-based option for those not wanting to cough up more cash to their cable TV providers. \nThat could prove lucrative, not to mention help Amazon stand out in an increasingly crowded on-demand TV segment. Currently, sports subscription packages are one of the most common reasons people avoid cutting their cable TV cord, with sizable fees for “tickets” to each season’s viewing. Meanwhile it would also help Amazon differentiate itself from Netflix, Hulu, and upcoming on-demand launches like AT&T’s DirecTV Now . \nAmazon has invested heavily into homegrown content for Prime Video, and with critical success too, winning awards for shows like Transparent . However some have questioned how much that investment has paid off in terms of overall revenue. One possible bonus to adding live sports content could be targeting possible shopping items to the audience, once their favorite sport and team have been identified by viewing habits. \nThrowing a wrench in the whole thing, the WSJ points out, is the traditionally lengthy exclusivity contracts that most of the big sporting leagues have already agreed with more traditional broadcasters. Amazon, as a result, will need to both cherry-pick what less in-demand games are currently being overlooked, and wait out for when those deals are due to be renegotiated. As with any such scheme, Amazon could decide the idea is good but the reality less appealing, and abandon its licensing efforts. \nEven if that’s not the case, it’s not to say your $100/yr Prime package will automatically include all the sporting content you usually pay your cable company for. Internal discussions about what, exactly, might fall within Prime membership and what could be sold separately as an add-on is apparently also underway.",

      "text": "Amazon faces holiday shipping disaster as pilots go on strike   12:30 PM Hayley Peterson - Business Insider \nA pilot strike is threatening to ground flights carrying cargo for Amazon during the busy holiday season. \nAbout 250 pilots employed by ABX Air, a subsidiary of Air Transport Services Group Inc., went on strike Tuesday morning to protest alleged staffing shortages. \nNow Amazon and shipping company DHL Worldwide Express, which are both customers of ABX, will have to pay the price. \nABX operates 35 flights daily for Amazon and 45 flights a day for DHL, according to Teamsters Local 1224, the union representing the pilots. \nThis could cause major disruptions and delays for some Amazon customers during the busy holiday season, according to the union. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nABX Air President John Starkovich said the company is \"notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume.\" \n\"We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period,\" he said in a statement to Business Insider. \nThe company is also seeking a court order to force pilots to return to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" he said. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.

      "text": "You can Pre Order the A6500 AT B&H Photo or Amazon \nGreetings Steve Huff readers. Chad Wadsworth here – your man on the street from my hometown of Austin, TX where Sony just hosted a media event last week to show-off the production capabilities of the new a6500 and RX100v cameras. \nAs a Sony Artisan of Imagery, I was originally slated to just make a concert photography presentation during the event but when Steve couldn’t make it due to family obligations I offered to file a report. Since I’ve never been to one of these events it was a great opportunity to meet all of the other camera reviewers and You Tubers out there. The group was super nice and Sony put together several shoots that were designed to help us critique the new features, with a focus on action/sports photography and my own niche – concert photography. \nFirst, a few housekeeping items – I focused exclusively on the a6500 as this was the camera I was most excited to use. Lightroom does not yet support the a6500 RAW files so everything shown here was captured in JPEG Fine and edited in post to taste . I fully expect files to be more malleable once RAW support is available but didn’t feel too restricted with the out of camera JPEGs. My lenses of choice were the E 24/1.8, FE 28/2 (both great walk lenses around on the a6500), E 16-70/4, FE 55/1.8, FE 50/1.4, GM 85/1.4 and GM 70-200/2.8. Finally, I’m a stills guy so apologies to anyone looking for information on video – guessing if you are here on Steve Huff you get that. This isn’t a full-blown camera review, just some thoughts on the key new features of the a6500 and how it felt in the field. \nI currently shoot the a6300 as a second body to the a7RII so have a good handle on how the a6300 performs and what the differences are between it and the a6500. One of the appealing things about the combination of the current a6300 and a7RII is that the color spaces are very similar between the two cameras. This means that I can apply edits in post evenly and consistently, regardless of what body took the shot. The a6500 proved to be no different in that aspect and that’s a good thing. Looking over the images from this week, I would have been extremely hard pressed to tell them apart from captures made with my a7RII. \nWhile the a6300 and a6500 generally share a physical design, in hand I much preferred the a6500. The new camera carries a tad more heft, and the grip is improved with more depth and space for your fingers against the lens mount. But these are all things that have been previously reported so let’s get to the fun stuff – what’s different under the hood and how did it perform in the field? \nWhen the a6500 was announced, I instantly placed my pre-order due to one single feature: 5-Axis In Body Image Stabilization (IBIS). While the a6300 makes for a competent second body to my workhorse a7RII, without IBIS I tend to put it away when the light goes down and a longer lens is required for concert work. Certainly high ISO performance is very good for APS-C but with longer focal lengths IBIS helps keep things steady and maximizes your ability to shoot at higher ISOs. Nothing really to report other than the stabilization works and works well. \nBeyond image stabilization, the other major feature is the new deep buffer. Maybe not a flashy marketing point but the buffer and LSI front end chip combine for a drastic improvement in the overall performance of the image processing pipeline. Technically, the depth of the buffer is finite (307 shots) but by any sane measure, shooting in high speed bursts, you will likely never run into a situation where the camera stops responding due to a clogged buffer. We shot everything from skateparks and rodeo, to tennis, lacrosse and indoor basketball, and not once did the buffer fill up and lock the shutter. The one time I thought it had hit its limit I was wrong – instead my memory card had filled up. The other nice improvement related to the buffer is the time it takes to review and zoom in on an image, both of which are near instantaneous. There is also a new graphic display that indicates in real-time how many images remain in the pipeline – helpful when shooting long, high frame-rate bursts. \nSince Sony is rightly marketing this camera to customers interested in shooting sports and fast action, Sony Artisan, and professional sports photographer Patrick Murphy-Racey gave us all a helpful presentation on how to shoot sports and action photography. For the uninitiated, shooting sports is daunting, but the combination of IBIS and the fast buffer, paired with an extremely intelligent and powerful autofocus system borrowed from the a6300 locked in and tracked fast moving subjects with eerie accuracy. Throughout the shoot I frequently stopped to marvel at how easy they system was making the task. The AF system is so solid with high speed action that I realized the system was no longer the barrier, my reaction time was. I predominately used either wide area or lock-on flexible spot and continuous AF with the frame rate set to high (8fps). That combination seems to be the best for tracking action across the sensor with a clear view similar to an optical viewfinder. The highest speed mode (High +) grants 11fps but suffers from a display lag making it more challenging to visually track a fast moving subject – the AF won’t suffer, just your ability to keep a clear view through the EVF. \nWhile sports and action got top bill for our shoots, I did put on my own Artisan hat and present a concert photography session to the group. My friends at one of Austin’s newest venues, 3Ten at ACL Live, helped book a show with blues guitarist Ian Moore, who was kind enough to allow for an enormous photo pit with almost 30 photographers snapping away for the first few songs of his set. Of all the activities Sony had planned, this one was nearest to my heart and I think the other members of the media enjoyed the experience immensely. Lighting for the show was excellent so we didn’t push the ISO boundaries too far but I do like what I see. Sony claims a small improvement in high ISO performance in the new camera due to improved image processing but without seeing the RAW images I can’t make any judgement. \nI know there is some interest out there regarding the new touch screen feature but I wasn’t able to give it much of a test. As a left eye dominate shooter my big nose tends to press against the LCD screen while using the EVF, so the touch feature was not applicable. However, if you are right eye dominant or use a tripod for stills or video, the feature may have real merit. Note that the touch capabilities are currently limited to selecting focus and are not used for playback or menu selection. \nSpeaking of menus, at the request of the user community, Sony made some changes with the A6500 so I was anxious to acclimate to the new structure. Turns out the changes are modest and pretty logical – color coding and most video features are now more intelligently grouped. I’ve never had a problem with the Sony menu structure and don’t know if this reorganization will sooth those that are most critical, but it is a step in the right direction.The camera can easily be configured to match the shooting style of the user but does demand some investment in menu education. Once I put 5-10 minutes into the menu setup, configuring my rear AF, custom buttons, control wheel and quick fn menu, the need to ever menu dive is nearly eliminated and I can concentrate on exposure, focus and composition in a traditional way. By the end of the first shooting session, everything felt tight and well controlled. \nTechnical talk aside, what I was anxious to learn about the a6500 is how it behaves in the field – is it confidence inspiring or does the tech get in the way of an organic shooting experience? For me personally, shooting the a6500 was like catching up with your fun friend from college who is now more capable, successful and perhaps a more well mannered adult. Being intimately familiar with the camera controls from time spent with the original a6000 and then the a6300, the a6500 just puts a new polish on the experience. A feature like IBIS is pretty much set and forget and the deep buffer asks nothing of the shooter so in the end, if you aren’t using the touchscreen feature, the experience is a nice combination of familiarity matched with some pretty significant operability and performance improvements. My confidence in the camera as a tool for high speed action and stable low light performance is high. My one wish would be for a native battery grip to help with comfort when holding the camera with longer lenses. At the same time, let’s not forget that with such a small footprint, the a6500 makes for a nice take everywhere, definitive moment camera. While we were tasked with shooting a lot of action during the event, I equally utilized the camera as a street or portraiture tool. \nThanks again to Steve for allowing me to attend the event on his behalf. \n(From Steve: Thanks to Chad for covering this event and letting us take a sneak peak into the capabilities of the A6500 from Sony!)

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nABX Air President John Starkovich said the company is \"notifying its customers and other affected parties about temporary interruptions in ABX’s flight operations, allowing them to adjust their networks until pilots return to work and normal flight operations resume.\" \n\"We stand ready to assist our customers in any way we can to minimize any impact on their own operations during this critical holiday period,\" he said in a statement to Business Insider. \nThe company is also seeking a court order to force pilots to return to work. \n\"We expect the court will uphold our position that the actions taken by the union to refuse work assignments is not legal, and the issues involved constitute a minor dispute to be resolved via arbitration under terms of our current labor agreements,\" he said. \nThe pilots say they are striking because they have been forced to work \"emergency assignments\" during contractually obligated time off as a result of alleged understaffing. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq \nSo far this year, pilots have been scheduled to cover more than 8,000 emergency assignment days on days they should have had off, according to the union. \nThe striking pilots are picketing on Tuesday outside of ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington, North Carolina and outside DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nPilots at ABX Air and four other cargo carriers that fly for DHL voted to strike earlier this year if negotiations with the company stalled.

They announced picketing at ABX Air’s headquarters in Wilmington and DHL’s North American hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. \nThe carrier’s parent company, Air Transport Services Group, Inc., tells the Dayton Daily News it will seek a court order to try to get operations back to normal while it discusses the pilots’ concerns with their union. \nThe pilots allege the carrier has been understaffed and they’ve been forced to work on off days and denied compensatory time that’s due under their contract.",
