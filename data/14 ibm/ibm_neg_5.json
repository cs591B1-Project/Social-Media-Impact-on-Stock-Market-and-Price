      "text": "Organizations that run their analytics workloads on IBM Corp.’s public cloud now have access to three new services designed to ease day-to-day operations.\nThe first and most significant addition that the company announced today is a tool called Decision Optimization, which can be best described as a virtual assistant for business analysts. Under the hood, it’s based on the CPLEX mathematical programming software that Big Blue acquired in 2009. The service can ingest unstructured information such as supplier contracts and produce automated insight in response to various user questions. A planner at an electronics retailer, for instance, could use it to find the most efficient approach to restocking a product that is in high demand.\nDecision Optimization is meant to spare users the tedious task of manually comparing shipping costs, delivery times and the countless other factors involved in such calculations. IBM says that the resulting time savings can significantly speed up decision-making in a variety of different business scenarios. Besides the retail industry, the company also sees its service coming handy for the manufacturing, utilities and financial sectors among others.\nMany of the companies that stand to benefit from Decision Optimization should also be able to make use of dashDB for Transactions, the second new tool that IBM is rolling out. It’s a repurposed version of the company’s existing hosted columnar store that is designed to power web applications rather than back office analytics projects.\nBoth DashDB for Transactions and Decision Optimization are set to become available as part of the company’s Bluemix platform-as-a-service suite, as is the third offering introduced today. Dubbed Bluemix Lift, it’s designed to help organizations move records from their on-premises infrastructure to the IBM Cloud more easily. The company says that the tool can provide transfer rates of up to 225 gigabytes per hour depending on how much bandwidth is available.\nBluemix Lift should help level the playing field against better-established rivals such as Amazon.com Inc. that are also working to ease customers’ data migration struggles. The provider introduced a service called S3 Transfer Acceleration earlier this year that promises to improve upload times by up to 300 percent. And in scenarios where transferring information over the web isn’t practical, companies can physically ship their information to Amazon by way of its traveling Snowball appliances .\nImage courtesy of IBM ",

      "text": "  09:59 AM EST Banks using IBM i Switch to Maxava in Malaysia with AS Networks \nStrategic Partnership delivers sophisticated high availability and disaster recovery solutions to banks in Malaysia. \nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Philadelphia, PA (8 December, 2016) – AS Networks has recently partnered with Maxava in order to enhance their high availability and disaster recovery services portfolio across South East Asia. AS Networks is the leading player in Malaysia for traditional, on-premise disaster recovery services and specializes in offering a comprehensive suite of high availability and disaster recovery solutions for the IBM i platform. \nAndrew Lim, CEO of AS Networks chose Maxava after reviewing several IBM i HA/DR solutions. Presenting to a group of banking customers at a recent launch event that was held at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Andrew says “Maxava is easy to install, it is fast, can be controlled by a mobile app and once live, it becomes the critical basis of a business’s recovery. Our aim is to help our customers exercise a greater control over their data retention policies, whilst supporting them to overcome complex replication and backup management challenges.” \n“In case of a major data loss and/or downtime incident, our customers will get their data back faster, more securely and with greater control and visibility, using the most innovative technologies available in the market. Since 2014, we have been expanding our areas of expertise to stay ahead of the rapidly changing data management trends and expectation, and today we strive to be one of the leading business continuity services providers in Malaysia,” continues Lim. \nAS Networks has already implemented Maxava at Maybank, the largest bank in Malaysia and also at CIMB, the world’s largest Islamic bank. The pipeline is continuing to expand with an additional four banks ready to swap to Maxava in the region. IBM i customers who previously relied on magnetic tape media or older solutions for their disaster recovery strategies have responded enthusiastically to the offering which delivers lightning-fast, real-time replication that allows for rapid operational resumption, with no data loss occurring in the event of a disaster. \nSimon O’Sullivan, Senior VP at Maxava, who is responsible for the Asia Pacific region explains, “Our partnership with AS Networks has created numerous joint opportunities in Malaysia and we are very excited about the potential for growth – not just in banking but in all other industries. \n-The End- \nAbout AS Networks – AS Networks specializes in offering a comprehensive suite of high availability and disaster recovery solutions and services for the IBM i platform.

      "text": "Tweet \nBusinesses are turning to the cloud as a way of coping with ever larger amounts of data. But moving to the cloud at the same time retaining control of where data resides and how it’s accessed is a challenge. \nTo help enterprises migrate and more easily generate business insights, IBM is announcing a range of new services on its Bluemix cloud platform. \nIBM Decision Optimization on Cloud is capable of ingesting large amounts of data including predictions, master and transactional data, business goals, and business rules to prioritize and rank business decisions such as plans and schedules. It includes the CPLEX Optimizer Engines and can run as standalone, embedded in applications using a Rest API, or be used in Jupyter Notebooks within IBM's Data Science Experience . \nBluemix Lift is a data migration tool to quickly, securely and reliably migrate databases from existing on-premise data centers to IBM Bluemix and the IBM Watson Data Platform. Bluemix Lift encrypts data being transferred, helping to securely move it at a rate up to ten times faster than traditional offerings. It's also designed to minimize downtime, so that applications using the source database can run uninterrupted during migration. In addition, Lift has been designed to be highly reliable, enabling data transfers to keep flowing even during a connectivity loss. \nIBM dashDB for Transactions is a fully managed SQL database service on Bluemix, optimized for transactional and web workloads to help developers fuel cloud-based applications. It's part of IBM's dashDB portfolio, offering a workload-optimized database environment designed to meet both the data warehousing and transactional needs of applications. It can be implemented on a pay-per-use basis. \n\"Cloud is the platform that enables cognitive intelligence,\" says John Murphy, vice president of the IBM Watson Data Platform. \"We're continuing to grow our catalog of cloud data services on Bluemix so that we can help developers and data scientists better manage and more quickly interpret data for business innovation\". \nYou can find out more about all of these services on the IBM Cloud Marketplace .",

      "text": "IBM Subsidiary to Relocate HQ to Atlanta (IBM) By Daniel Kobialka | November 18, 2016 — 11:28 AM EST \nInternational Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ) subsidiary The Weather Company will move its headquarters to Atlanta. (See also: IBM Closes Sanovi Technologies Acquisition .) \nThe Weather Company and Georgia Governor Nathan Deal this week announced the IBM business will relocate its HQ to Atlanta and add 400 staff members. Also, The Weather Company stated it intends to grow its weather services to ensure it can provide \"accurate, personalized and actionable weather data and insights to millions of consumers and thousands of businesses around the world.\" \nCameron Clayton, The Weather Company's CEO, said he believes his business's HQ relocation and addition of new staff members could help the company thrive for years to come. \"The additional hiring and the move to a new headquarters are indicative of the support and investment that IBM is providing to attract and retain the best and brightest as we build this amazing business,\" he noted. \nIBM acquired The Weather Company in January. The Weather Company provides consumers and businesses with intelligence to help them understand the impact of weather conditions. Some of The Weather Company's digital products include The Weather Channel and Weather Underground, and the business could play a key role in IBM's revenue growth in the foreseeable future. What Does the Future Hold for The Weather Company and IBM? \nThe Weather Company's recent moves show the business is ready to grow, and the company could help drive IBM's revenue growth accordingly. \nIBM reported revenue from continuing operations of $19.2 billion in the third quarter of 2016, which remained flat year to year. The company also recorded double-digit growth on its strategic initiatives — cloud, analytics, mobility and security — during the quarter, according to IBM CEO Ginni Rometty. \"IBM's third-quarter performance … is a testament to our leadership in cognitive solutions and cloud,\" she said. \nThe Weather Company could provide substantial value for IBM. Ultimately, The Weather Company's Atlanta relocation and staff expansion may enable the business to better serve consumers and businesses around the world and help IBM further extend its global reach.

      "text": "Cloud New IBM cloud services could get your company data to the cloud 10x faster IBM recently announced some updates to its Bluemix cloud platform that could boost data migration to the cloud, and help enterprises more easily glean insights. By Conner Forrest | November 18, 2016, 7:50 AM PST Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/mihtiander \nNew IBM Bluemix cloud services could help companies migrate data to the cloud more quickly, and improve the ability to gain useful insights from that data. The three services—IBM Decision Optimization on Cloud, IBM Bluemix Lift, and IBM dashDB for Transactions—were announced via a press release on Friday. \nIn the release, IBM said that many organizations are struggling to get their data to the cloud in the first place, and to manage it once it's there. The release also cites IDC statistics, which predict that the amount of \"high-value\" data to be analyzed will double by 2020, complicating the problem. \n\"Cloud is the platform that enables cognitive intelligence,\" John Murphy, vice president of the IBM Watson Data Platform, said in the press release. \"We're continuing to grow our catalog of cloud data services on Bluemix so that we can help developers and data scientists better manage and more quickly interpret data for business innovation.\" \nSEE: Cloud computing policy template (Tech Pro Research) \nIBM Bluemix Lift is the new tool responsible for speeding up data migration from on-premises data centers to IBM Bluemix and IBM Watson Data Platform, the press release said. IBM claims that the solution can move data up to 10 times faster than traditional solutions, and it encrypts the data during transfer to improve security, the release said. It is designed for high reliability, and to lessen potential downtime. \nAnother part of the announcement is that IBM Decision Optimization on Cloud is now available in beta on Bluemix. This tools takes in data such as \"predictions, master and transactional data, business goals, and business rules\" to help businesses with their planning and scheduling by balancing goals against available resources, the release said. Must-Read Cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy \nOne example given for use of the IBM Decision Optimization on Cloud was retail inventory replenishment. When it comes time to restock for a seasonal item, the tool could help businesses weigh the costs of different replenishment plans relative to which warehouse has the best supply, versus the shipping cost from that location. \nIBM also announced a new database product, IBM dashDB for Transactions, which is a managed SQL database for Bluemix that is \"optimized for transactional and web workloads to help developers fuel cloud-based applications,\" the release said. \nFor businesses that are looking to make the switch to the cloud, but that are wary of the potential time investment involved in migration, these new services for Bluemix could be a good option. That is, only if IBM's core cloud offerings meet your infrastructure needs. \nIBM has long been a strong enterprise player, but has struggled to keep up with other cloud providers in the past. However, Gartner's recent Magic Quadrant rating for cloud PaaS providers did list IBM as a \"visionary.\" Additionally, IBM recently consolidated many of its cloud brands under the Bluemix moniker in a bid to further its mission as a cloud broker . The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers IBM recently announced three new services for its Bluemix cloud platform that could ease data migration and help companies get better insights from their data. IBM Bluemix Lift is the core migration offering, which encrypts data in transit, and offers a 10 times increase in speed, according to a press release. IBM has advanced as a player in the cloud market, making moves to unify its brand and reaching the \"visionary\" category on Gartner's Magic Quadrant.

      "text": "Abraham Jonah, Middle East Bureau Chief\nCEMEX (NYSE: CX), one of the leading building materials companies in the world, and IBM (NYSE: IBM), on Friday announced that CEMEX will undertake a sweeping digital transformation designed to improve its operations, substantially improve its customer experience and increase business efficiencies.\nCEMEX’s digital transformation will enable real-time, mobile engagement with its building materials customers and distributors, including companies that build everything from sports complexes and skyscrapers to houses and high-scale infrastructures around the world. CEMEX will deploy a suite of custom made-for-business apps, built to meet the needs of CEMEX’s customers, transforming how the entire company does business from attracting new clients to collecting payments, invoicing and after-sale support.\nBeginning in early 2017, CEMEX will launch a suite of custom apps designed in collaboration with IBM iX (Interactive Experience) to create the best mobile-led customer experience in the building materials supply industry. CEMEX will follow a “speed-to-market” approach, launching a pilot project, followed by user testing, adjusting the solutions to meet the users’ needs, and then scaling the apps worldwide. For example, a new Foreman app that will enable construction foremen to manage many aspects of their ready-mix concrete orders in real-time is currently being field tested by select CEMEX customers in several markets prior to global implementation.\n“At CEMEX, the future for our industry will be driven by the quality of the customer experience, not just the quality of the products and services. Our customers are increasingly expecting to have the same kind of experiences in working with businesses that they have in the consumer space,” said Fernando A. Gonzalez, CEMEX’s Chief Executive Officer. “By deploying IBM’s new and innovative methods of experience design and process reinvention, CEMEX can create a superior customer experience and more readily deliver higher value to our stakeholders.”\nCEMEX is teaming up with IBM on one of the most comprehensive digital transformation strategies undertaken in the industry, including digital experience design, digital process reinvention, agile delivery, dev-ops implementation and business process operation. The transformation will fundamentally change how foremen, field operations managers, cement masons, concrete finishers, truck drivers and other construction professionals do their jobs and interact with CEMEX.\n“We are committed to reinventing how work gets done using IBM iX and IBM Design as the new methods to reengineer business processes. We forged our partnership with Apple to change the nature of work by combining our expertise in customer experience design with our technological acumen,” said Jesus Mantas, General Manager, IBM Global Business Consulting Services. “The changes we are driving with CEMEX focus on digital reinvention and customer experience transformation at speed and scale. Our approach always starts with user experience – creating exceptionally elegant and simple ways for clients, employees and partners to better perform their jobs.”\nCEMEX is also leveraging Mobile at Scale for iOS, a new IBM app design and development model for the rapid development and deployment of multiple iOS apps. This unique, integrated approach enables CEMEX to work closely with IBM to quickly and efficiently design, develop, deploy and maintain apps over their lifecycle.\n \n",

      "text": "How Trump’s Presidency Could Affect IBM and Its Peers PART: How Trump’s Presidency Could Affect IBM and Its Peers PART 1 OF 9 The US Dollar Hits a 14-Year High: How Will IBM Be Affected? By Anne Shields | Nov 18, 2016 2:07 pm EST Dollar reached a 14-year high \nFollowing the US election results and Donald Trump’s win, the market is speculative about the US economic growth outlook as well as the timing of a US interest rate hike, considering Trump’s protectionist policies. \nTrump has announced that he will spend $1 trillion on infrastructure construction. This spending, along with a reduction in taxes, is likely to give trade restrictions as well as the economy a significant boost, which could fuel inflation. Trump’s inflationary policies, combined with the already hawkish Federal Reserve, points to higher interest rates in the future. These sentiments have led to the upward trajectory of the US dollar ( UUP ), which reached a 14-year high on November 16, 2016. Tech sector’s vulnerability to US dollar fluctuations \nThe above chart shows that IBM generates more than half of its revenue from outside the United States. Apart from IBM, Oracle ( ORCL ), Symantec ( SYMC ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ) are some of the leading technology players that derive a majority of their revenues from regions outside the United States. These regions include the EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) and the Asia-Pacific. As a result, their top lines are significantly impacted by the appreciating US dollar. \nApart from significant revenue generation, cash parked overseas adds to these companies’ vulnerabilities to currency fluctuations. \nLater in this series, we’ll discuss the growing cash reserves in the tech sector.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nIBM just passed two milestones in artificial intelligence . From a distance, the accomplishments seem insignificant but IBM Research Audio Analytic’s Jason Pelecanos called them necessarily small steps toward increasingly intelligent machines. \nThe first milestone involved demonstrating higher sensitivity in IBM’s automatic speaker recognition software, which is tasked with recognizing the identity of a speaker based solely on his or her voice patterns. Back in 2000, the best speaker verification software had an error rate of about 10 percent. Today’s industry standard has an error rate of less than one percent. IBM’s software has set a new record of just 0.59 percent, eclipsing Microsoft’s recent record of 0.63 percent. \nMore : Microsoft hits another milestone in speech-recognition software accuracy \nPelecanos acknowledges that a decrease of 0.04 percent is slight, and in most cases wouldn’t be obvious to active users trying to gain access to their smartphones. “However,” he told Digital Trends, “if a system was stricter and had a higher accept threshold, the user would notice that they are rejected on several occasions,” by both a system with a 0.6 percent and with a one percent error rate. “[But] the better-performing system may incorrectly deny access to you for about half of the occasions of the poorer performing system. This difference will be very noticeable.” \nThe IBM team also also developed a system to estimate the age of someone who is speaking, and the company says it’s published the most accurate results of any system yet with an average error rate of 4.7 years. The system’s success rate even exceeded that of human listeners in a prior study, according to the company. \nSo — you’re wondering — what could this be good for? \nFirst of all, the age estimate software may enable more personalization while tailoring conversations to age groups by considering things like vocabulary and syntax. \nBesides better voice activation and security, Pelecanos thinks these highly sensitive speaker recognition systems will soon be able to multitask. \n“One key focus for us is to have systems that can interact with more than one person at a time,” he says. “Current technologies, for example speech applications and personal assistants on smartphones or home units, have dialogue, which is established for a one-to-one interaction. Systems that can interact with multiple people at once bring about exciting opportunities for group collaborations with systems.” Also watch: Formlabs 1+ 3D SLA Printer – Hands on",

      "text": "Tweet Share ARMONK, N.Y., Nov. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced several cloud data services and features on Bluemix designed to help organizations accelerate the migration of their data to the cloud and more easily generate business insights. IBM Corporation logo. More Organizations look to the cloud as a powerful engine to collect and interpret vast amounts of data. However, many are struggling to move their already existing datasets to the cloud, as well as retain control of where they reside and how they are accessed. Without the right tools in place, the problem will only get worse as the amount of data continues to grow. According to IDC 1 , the amount of high-value data worth analyzing will double by 2020, and much of this data will be in the form of complex, unstructured information. Now available on Bluemix, IBM Decision Optimization, Bluemix Lift and dashDB for Transactions can help organizations overcome this challenge and make more informed business decisions by enabling them to more easily aggregate, ingest and analyze expanding workloads. \"Cloud is the platform that enables cognitive intelligence,\" said John Murphy, Vice President, IBM Watson Data Platform. \"We're continuing to grow our catalog of cloud data services on Bluemix so that we can help developers and data scientists better manage and more quickly interpret data for business innovation.\" The services include: IBM Decision Optimization on Cloud (including the CPLEX engines) is now in beta on Bluemix. It can ingest large amounts of data including predictions, master and transactional data, business goals, and business rules to prioritize and rank business decisions such as plans and schedules. Applicable across all industries, including manufacturing, utilities, finance and retail, this powerful tool offers the ability to trade-off conflicting business goals while balancing resource limitations to make more informed decisions. This offering includes the CPLEX Optimizer Engines and can run as a standalone, embedded in applications using a Rest API, or be used in Jupyter Notebooks within IBM's Data Science Experience . For example, consider a major clothing retailer in need of restocking its winter coat supply. Local warehouses might be very low in stock, and shipping and transferring supplies from international locations could incur costly fees. Using Decision Optimization, a retail planner could automatically get recommendations and choose the most cost-effective replenishment plan, considering all possible suppliers, warehouses, shipping lanes, and costs, without having to do a potentially time-consuming manual \"what-if\" analysis or manual comparison of options. IBM Bluemix Lift is a data migration tool to quickly, securely and reliably migrate databases from existing on-premises data centers to IBM Bluemix and IBM Watson Data Platform.

      "text": "How Trump’s Presidency Could Affect IBM and Its Peers PART 2 OF 9 Apple and Peers Expected to Drive a Rise in US Corporate Cash By Anne Shields | Nov 18, 2016 2:07 pm EST US corporate cash reserves will rise to $1.8 trillion in 2016 \nEarlier, we discussed how a rise in the US dollar could impact the growths of IBM ( IBM ) and its peers. Let’s have a look at the cash reserves of the leading technology players and how a change in the tax rate could affect them. \nAccording to a recent Moody’s report released in November 2016, tech players now hold almost 50% of the overall cash held by US non-financial companies. The report further highlights that the top five cash holders are tech companies that include Apple ( AAPL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Google ( GOOG ), Cisco Systems ( CSCO ), and Oracle ( ORCL ), in that order. Moody’s expects US corporate cash reserves, driven by the tech sector, to rise to $1.8 trillion in 2016, compared to $1.7 trillion in 2015. \nThe table above, released in March 2016, shows a list of the 20 non-disclosing companies, which includes the technology companies with the biggest cash reserves. These 20 companies include leading technology players such as IBM and Google. Collectively, these 20 companies possess $1 trillion in unrepatriated foreign income—more than 50% of the total income held by the 248 “non-disclosing” companies. Tech sector drives the surge in US corporate cash \nA majority of the cash that corporations possess is generated and held overseas. According to Moody’s, overseas cash is expected to reach ~$1.3 trillion in 2016, compared to an estimated $1.2 trillion in 2015. \nThe rises in the cash reserves of US companies can be majorly attributed to selected big tech players. Moody’s expects that Apple ( AAPL ) will continue to lead its peers, as its cash reserves are reaching toward $253 billion. It will be followed by Microsoft, which has $115 billion in cash reserves. \nGoogle and Oracle are expected to possess $85 billion and $68 billion, respectively, while Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) is expected to stand in fifth place, with $67 billion in cash reserves. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"AAPL\",\"CSCO\",\"GOOG\",\"IBM\",\"MSFT\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Apple Inc.\",\"Cisco Systems, Inc.\",\"Google Inc\",\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"Microsoft Corporation\"]} X",

      "text": " IBM\nBluemix, IBM's cloud platform, launches technologies to fuel faster cloud adoption and build a foundation for data-driven decisions\nARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced several cloud data services and features on Bluemix designed to help organizations accelerate the migration of their data to the cloud and more easily generate business insights.\nOrganizations look to the cloud as a powerful engine to collect and interpret vast amounts of data. However, many are struggling to move their already existing datasets to the cloud, as well as retain control of where they reside and how they are accessed. Without the right tools in place, the problem will only get worse as the amount of data continues to grow. According to IDC 1 , the amount of high-value data worth analyzing will double by 2020, and much of this data will be in the form of complex, unstructured information.\nNow available on Bluemix, IBM Decision Optimization, Bluemix Lift and dashDB for Transactions can help organizations overcome this challenge and make more informed business decisions by enabling them to more easily aggregate, ingest and analyze expanding workloads.\n\"Cloud is the platform that enables cognitive intelligence,\" said John Murphy , Vice President, IBM Watson Data Platform. \"We're continuing to grow our catalog of cloud data services on Bluemix so that we can help developers and data scientists better manage and more quickly interpret data for business innovation.\"\nThe services include:\nIBM Decision Optimization on Cloud (including the CPLEX engines) is now in beta on Bluemix. It can ingest large amounts of data including predictions, master and transactional data, business goals, and business rules to prioritize and rank business decisions such as plans and schedules. Applicable across all industries, including manufacturing, utilities, finance and retail, this powerful tool offers the ability to trade-off conflicting business goals while balancing resource limitations to make more informed decisions. This offering includes the CPLEX Optimizer Engines and can run as a standalone, embedded in applications using a Rest API, or be used in Jupyter Notebooks within IBM's Data Science Experience .\nFor example, consider a major clothing retailer in need of restocking its winter coat supply. Local warehouses might be very low in stock, and shipping and transferring supplies from international locations could incur costly fees. Using Decision Optimization, a retail planner could automatically get recommendations and choose the most cost-effective replenishment plan, considering all possible suppliers, warehouses, shipping lanes, and costs, without having to do a potentially time-consuming manual \"what-if\" analysis or manual comparison of options.\nIBM Bluemix Lift is a data migration tool to quickly, securely and reliably migrate databases from existing on-premises data centers to IBM Bluemix and IBM Watson Data Platform. Bluemix Lift encrypts data being transferred, helping to securely move it at a rate of up to ten times faster than traditional offerings. The technology is also designed to minimize downtime, so that applications using the source database can run uninterrupted during migration. In addition, Lift has been designed to be highly reliable, enabling data transfers to keep flowing even during a connectivity loss.\nIBM dashDB for Transactions is a fully managed SQL database service on IBM Bluemix, optimized for transactional and web workloads to help developers fuel cloud-based applications. It offers high availability on selected plans, as well as pay-per-use units. It is part of IBM's dashDB portfolio, offering a workload-optimized database environment designed to meet both the data warehousing and transactional needs of applications.\nTo get started with these services, visit the Bluemix Developers Catalog for IBM Bluemix Lift, Decision Optimization, and dashDB for Transactions .\nBluemix , IBM's Cloud platform, has grown rapidly to become one of the largest open, public cloud deployments in the world. Based in open standards, it features over 150 advanced technologies and services, including 35 cloud data services and a roster of others spanning categories of cognitive computing, blockchain, Internet of Things, DevOps and security.\n1.

      "text": "IBM's journey toward cognitive computing is well documented in the media. Cognitive computing is loosely defined as a simulating of human thought processes in a computerized model. It's a self-learning system that mimics the way the human brain works. Cognitive computing is an evolution of the artificial intelligence work that started in the 1960's. Many people are familiar with IBM’s cognitive computing product, called Watson, through the famous Jeopardy episode where Watson won the game in 2011 .[caption id=\"attachment_1877\" align=\"\" width=\"2362\"] Rometty and Haque interview at the Churchill Club[/caption]Five years later, the cognitive field has changed tremendously. To learn more about cognitive computing, I attended a Churchill Club meeting titled 'Digital Today, Cognitive Tomorrow' where Promod Haque , the Senior Managing Partner, from Norwest Venture Partners interviewed Ginni Rometty, the Chairman, President, and CEO of IBM .[caption id=\"\" align=\"\" width=\"780\"] Ginni Rometty - Chairman, President, and CEO IBM[/caption] Haque started the event by saying the move to cognitive computing was a big bet for IBM. Rometty responded that it was a big bet, but not a risky one. She elaborated by saying that IBM had been on its cognitive computing journey for roughly two decades. While most people align cognitive computing with IBM's Watson product, Rometty was quick to point out that IBM doesn’t consider cognitive computing a specific product. It’s an era that will include multiple vendors and various technologies. The move to this new era is driven by changes in the data landscape. Rometty stated that businesses must find a new way to deal with processing and understanding massive volumes of data. Cognitive computing is vital to turning zettabytes of data into meaningful information. Rometty said computing had to evolve to a place where it could understand, reason and learn without a person programming everything to achieve answers.IBM's is correct. We're living in a zettabyte era. According to the Cisco 's Visual Networking Index , the annual global IP traffic will pass the zettabyte threshold by the end of 2016 and will reach 2.3 ZB per year by 2020. Companies must embrace new computing solutions to deliver actionable insights from massive volumes of data.Haque asked how startups could benefit from cognitive computing technologies such as Watson . Rometty said firms of all sizes would benefit from the technology as long as the company had data. She also noted that it required a culture of transformation and change. According to Rometty, cognitive computing will have a profound impact on society by helping solve critical issues in healthcare, the environment, and even employment. She sees it as a 'man plus machine era,' where the machines augment, rather than replace, human intelligence. Rometty said ‘Data is the next natural resource.’ Cognitive computing will help businesses and governments use data to solve problems that couldn’t be solved in the past. When asked to describe IBM’s differentiation against Alphabet and Microsoft, Rometty confidently noted that IBM was well positioned based on its longstanding artificial intelligence (AI) investments, patent portfolio and its approach to working with business. She said that IBM’s approach differs in three ways. First, IBM's solution is intended to assist a person in doing their job versus replacing the person. Second, IBM says it helps companies learn from their data without sharing it with the world. If data is the new competitive advantage, you don’t want to train a system like Watson with your intellectual property and have it shared with others. A customer must own its data and control its use. Finally, she stated that IBM had focused heavily on building an ecosystem around Watson and contributing to the open source community.Rometty closed by saying IBM was a 105-year-old company. As she reflected on IBM’s history, she said every company must continue to transform. Successful companies can transcend one or two technology eras but transcending four or more challenges even the best of companies. With that in mind, she said an organization must focus on defining which parts of the culture should endure and what must change. For IBM, she said it focused on creating solutions, not products, to societal and business challenges. Focusing on a solution versus a product allows you to make the tough calls to address changing market needs.Second, she noted that you couldn't protect your past. You have to enable the company to do other things by letting certain products go. Haque agreed and stated that this is of particular importance as the rate of technology change has accelerated. He added that products that used to last years have a much shorter lifecycle today. Finally, Rometty said a company shouldn't allow itself to become too comfortable. Growth and change have inherent risks which itself means progress can be uncomfortable. It's well-suited advice given the rapid changes in the technology and business landscape.",

      "text": "IBM just passed two milestones in artificial intelligence . From a distance, the accomplishments seem insignificant but IBM Research Audio Analytic’s Jason Pelecanos called them necessarily small steps toward increasingly intelligent machines.\nThe first milestone involved demonstrating higher sensitivity in IBM’s automatic speaker recognition software, which is tasked with recognizing the identity of a speaker based solely on his or her voice patterns. Back in 2000, the best speaker verification software had an error rate of about 10 percent. Today’s industry standard has an error rate of less than one percent. IBM’s software has set a new record of just 0.59 percent.\nMore : Microsoft hits another milestone in speech-recognition software accuracy\nPelecanos acknowledges that the milestone is slight, and in most cases wouldn’t be obvious to active users trying to gain access to their smartphones. “However,” he told Digital Trends, “if a system was stricter and had a higher accept threshold, the user would notice that they are rejected on several occasions,” by both a system with a 0.6 percent and with a one percent error rate. “[But] the better-performing system may incorrectly deny access to you for about half of the occasions of the poorer performing system. This difference will be very noticeable.”\nThe IBM team also also developed a system to estimate the age of someone who is speaking, and the company says it’s published the most accurate results of any system yet with an average error rate of 4.7 years.\nSo — you’re wondering — what could this be good for?\nFirst of all, the age estimate software may enable more personalization while tailoring conversations to age groups by considering things like vocabulary and syntax.\nBesides better voice activation and security, Pelecanos thinks these highly sensitive speaker recognition systems will soon be able to multitask.\n“One key focus for us is to have systems that can interact with more than one person at a time,” he says. “Current technologies, for example speech applications and personal assistants on smartphones or home units, have dialogue, which is established for a one-to-one interaction. Systems that can interact with multiple people at once bring about exciting opportunities for group collaborations with systems.”\nSamsung may name its voice assistant ‘Bixby,’ and debut it on the Galaxy S8 IBM’s switch to Macs in the workplace is saving the company quite a bit of money Watch an eerie, IBM Watson-made trailer for a film about the dangers of AI",

      "text": "Introducing and Implementing IBM FlashSystem V9000 A draft IBM Redbooks publication View online Permanent link Abstract \nThe success or failure of businesses often depends on how well organizations use their data assets for competitive advantage. Deeper insights from data require better information technology. \nAs organizations modernize their IT infrastructure to boost innovation rather than limit it, they need a data storage system that can keep pace with highly virtualized environments, cloud computing, mobile and social systems of engagement, and in-depth,real-time analytics. \nMaking the correct decision on storage investment is critical. Organizations must have enough storage performance and agility to innovate as they need to implement cloud-based IT services, deploy virtual desktop infrastructure, enhance fraud detection, and use new analytics capabilities. At the same time, future storage investments must lower IT infrastructure costs while helping organizations to derive the greatest possible value from their data assets. \nThe IBM® FlashSystem V9000 is the premier, fully integrated, Tier 1, all-flash offering from IBM. It has changed the economics of today’s data center by eliminating storage bottlenecks. Its software-defined storage features simplify data management, improve data security, and preserve your investments in storage. The FlashSystem V9000 SAS expansion enclosures provide new tiering options with read-intensive SSDs or nearline SAS HDDs. IBM FlashSystem® V9000 includes IBM FlashCore® technology and advanced software-defined storage available in one solution in a compact 6U form factor. FlashSystem V9000 improves business application availability. It delivers greater resource utilization so you can get the most from your storage resources, and achieve a simpler, more scalable, and cost-efficient IT Infrastructure. \n  provides information about IBM FlashSystem V9000 Software V7.7 and introduces the recently announced V7.8. It describes   software, hardware, and implementation, and provides hints and tips. It illustrates use cases and independent software vendor (ISV) scenarios that demonstrate real-world solutions, and also provides   offers FlashSystem V9000 scalability concepts and guidelines for planning, installing, and configuring, which can help environments scale up and out to add more flash capacity and expand virtualized systems. Port utilization methodologies are provided to help you maximize the full potential of IBM FlashSystem V9000 performance and low latency in your scalable environment. \nThis book is   professionals,   anyone   exciting technology.

      "text": "Here’s an interview that I recently did with IBM DeveloperWorks TV at the recent World of Watson conference. In it, I discuss a project I’ve been working on that analyzes drone imagery to perform automatic damage detection using the Watson Visual Recognition, and generates 3D models from the drone images using photogrammetry processes. The best part – the entire thing runs in the cloud on IBM Bluemix .\n\nIt leverages the IBM Watson Visual Recognition service with custom classifiers to detect the presence of hail damage on shingled roofs, Cloudant for metadata/record storage, the IBM Cloud Object Storage cross-region S3 API for massively scalable and distributed image/model/asset storage, and Bare Metal servers for high-performance computing.\nBare Metal servers are dedicated machines in the cloud: not shared, and not virtualized. I’ve got mine setup as a linux server with 24 cores (48 threads), 64 Gigs of RAM, a SSD RAID array, multiple GPUs, etc… and it improved my photogrammetry rendering from hours on my laptop down to merely 10 minutes (in my opinion the best part).\nI’ve done all of my testing with DJI Phantom and DJI Inspire aircraft, but really, it could work with any images, from any camera that has embedded GPS information.\nCheck out the video to see it in action.",

      "text": "How to Build a Robot with IBM Watson Smarts Nicolette Emmino 21 November 2016 \nIBM Watson – you’ve heard all about the cognitive system technology platform that combines machine learning, natural language processing akin to a human’s, and statistical analysis by now. \nBut aside from the plethora of applications Watson has found itself in, including support systems, data insights, medical, and recently automotive connectivity, the platform is making its way into the Maker Movement. \nIn order to rouse maker community and student enthusiasm, IBM launched TJ Bot, a cardboard-constructed, open-source robot that allows users to access Watson services in a fun way. \n(Image Credit: IBM) \nTJ Bot is the first kit in the IBM Watson Maker Kit collection, created at IBM Research as an experiment to find the best practices in the design and implementation of cognitive objects. The bot was named after the first Chairman and CEO of IBM, Thomas J. Watson. \nUsing the online demos and instructions, makers can either 3-D print or laser-cut their own TJ Bot and then follow the step-by-step instructions to connect it to Watson services. The guidelines were designed based on a Raspberry Pi and are available on Instructables.com and GitHub. \nSo far, the IBM Research team has managed to get TJ Bot to respond to emotions via a RGB LED on its head, accept voice control commands, and engage in conversational chats. \n“Whether you spend your days coding the next “big idea”, or simply playing with code for your school project, we invite you and the global community of makers to meet TJ Bot and join us in building the future of AI. We look forward to seeing the videos, blogs, recipes and photos published by the Maker community to see what, and how, you create your own cognitive objects,” wrote Maryam Ashoori , on the IBM Research Blog. \nSo not only will we continue to see Watson expand capabilities in the Internet of Things, or read information, speak a variety of languages and perform image diagnostics, but the cognitive software will now find its way into the hearts of Makers everywhere. \nFor more information, visit IBM Watson Maker Kits.

      "text": "How Trump’s Presidency Could Affect IBM and Its Peers PART 5 OF 9 How IBM’s CEO Responded to Trump’s Allegations By Anne Shields | Nov 18, 2016 2:07 pm EST Rometty refutes Trump’s claims \nEarlier, we discussed how Donald Trump’s presidency could affect IBM ( IBM ) and its peers. In response to the criticisms hurled by Trump on IBM, the company’s CEO, Virginia Rometty, addressed these issues in an open letter to the president-elect. \nIn response to IBM’s outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries, Rometty said that IBM, which has been in operation for the last 105 years, is the largest technology employer in the United States. \nIn 2015, IBM hired more US employees than in the last five years, and it still has thousands of vacant positions in cybersecurity, cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, and data science. Apart from IBM, Amazon ( AMZN ), Intel ( INTC ), and Microsoft ( MSFT ), leading players in the cloud space, are also making investments in these spaces. \nThese areas fall under IBM’s Strategic Imperatives umbrella. The creation of new positions in these areas would lead to jobs. These new jobs won’t necessarily require a college degree but will place more emphasis on relevant skills. As a result, skilled US workers who fit the criteria could be hired by IBM. \nApart from IBM, Trump also criticized Ford Motor Company (F) for its move to shift all of its small-car production to Mexico ( EWW ). Rometty supports Trump’s proposed tax rate reduction \nRometty expressed her support for Trump’s investment plan on infrastructure development. She also lauded Trump’s proposed reduction in the tax structure from its current 35% down to 10%. In September 2016, Trump said of cash held offshore, “By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country.” \nLater in the series, we’ll see why Trump may have been forced to reduce the tax rate. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"EWW\",\"IBM\",\"AMZN\",\"INTC\",\"MSFT\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"iShares MSCI Mexico Inv.

      "title": "How Donald Trump’s Anti-Immigration Policy Could Affect IBM",
      "text": "How Trump’s Presidency Could Affect IBM and Its Peers PART 4 OF 9 How Donald Trump’s Anti-Immigration Policy Could Affect IBM By Anne Shields | Nov 18, 2016 2:07 pm EST IBM faced the wrath of Trump’s anti-immigration policy \nEarlier in the series, we discussed how IBM’s geographical presence could impact its revenue and profits. Apart from its revenue and cash, IBM, like its peers Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Oracle ( ORCL ), also depends on foreign markets for talent acquisition. \nIn early November 2016, IBM was accused by now president-elect Donald Trump of depriving the United States of employment opportunities. He said, “IBM laid off 500 workers in Minneapolis and moved their jobs to India and other countries. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America, and we will stop the jobs from leaving Minnesota.” \nTrump’s administration could block companies such as IBM from moving jobs out of the United States. Trump’s camp warned of a tax levy of 35% for products made overseas by these companies. Trump’s protectionist policies could dampen prospects for international tech companies \nAs we’ve highlighted in the past, companies that derive the majority of their revenues from the United States will be the biggest beneficiaries of this tax revolution, and those who don’t will be the losers. \nApart from his anti-immigration policy, Trump has planned a reduction in the current tax structure, as we discussed earlier in the series. Both immigration and taxation impact the information technology sector, especially the software sector. \nIf Trump keeps his promise to keep US jobs in the country, American tech companies such as IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle, which generate substantial portions of their revenues from overseas markets, could see severe falls in their revenues and profits. \nGiven Trump’s views on immigration, H1B and J1 Visa restrictions, and taxation, it’s clear that most of his policies are protectionist. Trump’s policies may work well to drive US economic growth, but they’ll likely hurt technology companies with considerable overseas presences. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"IBM\",\"MSFT\",\"ORCL\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"Microsoft Corporation\",\"Oracle Corporation\"]} X",

      "text": "| Share \n5 Characteristics Professional IT Consultants Must Possess \nTo one degree or another, IBM has been tapping into Internet of Things (IoT) opportunities even before it launched its Smarter Planet initiatives way back in 2008. At the same time, IBM since 2011 has been steadily building a portfolio of applications combining Big Data analytics and the IBM Watson cognitive computing platform. \nToday, IBM noted the achievement of a milestone in that journey with the formal launch of IoT Watson Consulting Solutions , which will combine IBM’s IoT and Watson expertise to create a new dedicated IBM consulting practice consisting of over 1,500 IBM employees. \nAs part of that effort, IBM is also moving to make its IoT and Watson portfolio of technologies available as a suite of technologies optimized for specific vertical industries, starting withIBM Watson IoT for Manufacturing. IBM also committed today to making the core IBM Watson IoT platform available for free to application developers. \nJesus Mantas, general manager for IBM Business Consulting, says that unlike other consulting practices in this space, IBM has developed the actual technologies that will drive next-generation IoT technologies. From the application programming interfaces (APIs) made available on the Watson platform to data models that harken back to Smarter Planet initiatives, Mantas says IBM is unique in that it’s not just trying to launch a business consulting practice. \n“We’ve spent years creating industry-specific semantic models,” says Mantas. \nMost organizations, however, are still challenged in terms of how to monetize an IoT investment, much less figure out who will be put in charge of managing IoT projects . Because of those issues, a whole host of IoT consulting practices has been launched by almost any IT services provider of any size. IBM, however, is clearly betting that when the IoT rubber finally meets the road, organizations in need of some IoT direction will lean more on the consulting organization with the most hands-on experience with the underlying technologies.",

      "text": "Telephone: 585-475-5064 or 585-475-5097 (Fax) Internal Mail: Brown Hall U.S. Mail: University News Services, 132 Lomb Memorial Drive, Rochester, N.Y. 14623-5608 Ph.D. in computing and information sciences—Ken Wong ’10, IBM Nov. 21, 2016 Ken Wong ’10, IBM \nKen Wong ’10 (computing and information sciences) is working with IBM Watson Health to help save lives. \nAs a research staff member at IBM Research since earlier this year, Wong is teaching the artificially intelligent computer system Watson—made famous by its winning run on the quiz show Jeopardy!—how to identify specific features in X-rays, MRI scans and other medical images. \nUsing Wong’s work and the cognitive computing power of Watson, doctors will be able to diagnose diseases faster and more accurately. \n“Medical images are essential for finding problems, such as tumors, but it can be very time consuming and easy for humans to miss things,” said Wong. “With the help of a trained eye like Watson, physicians will know what areas they should concentrate on for each individual patient.” \nWong began his work with computational physiology and medical image analysis as a student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. In 2007, he made his way to RIT on the tails of his Ph.D. adviser, Pengcheng Shi. \nShi had been hired to lead the new Ph.D. program in RIT’s B. Thomas Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences. The interdisciplinary degree would allow Ph.D. students to conduct both hard-core computing research and work in other fields—including medicine, art and engineering—that can be assisted, enabled and inspired by research in computing. \n“I invited Ken and several other students to come with me and finish their degrees,” said Shi, director of the Ph.D. program and associate dean for Research and Scholarship. “Ken sets high expectations for himself and has a true passion for his work.” \nAs a student, Wong’s research challenged him to use imaging data to understand the mechanics of the human heart. Collaborating with Linwei Wang, fellow Ph.D. student and current associate professor in the Ph.D. program at RIT, the team created a computer simulation of the complete electro-mechanical physiology of the heart. \nAfter graduating, Wong continued this work and moved to France to become co-leader for the $25 million euHeart Project with the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation. The group developed individualized, computer-based, human heart models that could provide insight into the origin and progression of specific disease patterns, including those associated with heart rhythm disorders and coronary artery disease. \n“Usually, the computer-generated models are not patient specific,” said Wong. “But with individualized models, a surgeon can run countless simulations before actually operating on a patient.” \nWong has tested the waters in academia—teaching several Ph.D. courses at RIT as a visiting assistant professor. He also spent time at the National Institutes of Health creating personalized models for predicting tumor growth. \n“I have discovered that if I work for a private company like IBM, my research will make its way to products faster,” Wong said. “This gives me a higher chance to really contribute to patients and society as a whole.” Alumni today \nGraduates take on roles in computer theory, networking, software engineering, finance, big data, animation, cybersecurity and academia. They work at Intel, Qatar Computing Research Institute, Google, Microsoft, Uber, RIT and Stevens Institute of Technology. Ken Wong ’10, IBM",

      "text": "print An IBM data centre. IBM \nIBM has announced that it plans to build four more data centres in the UK, confirming a report from earlier this month. \nWhen complete, the US tech giant will have six data centres in the UK, 16 across Europe and more than 50 worldwide. \nThe New York-headquartered company uses a network of data centres worldwide to power its cloud business. They contain servers that allow IBM customers to access services like IBM Watson, the company's artificial intelligence platform, and IBM analytics applications, as well as more than 100 other IBM applications. \nIn the UK, the multinational currently has two data centres in Portsmouth and Chessington. \nThe first of the four new IBM data centres — expected to be operational next month, will be located in Fareham, which is a short distance away from IBM's existing data centre in Portsmouth. IBM refused to be drawn on where the other three new data centres will be but it did say they'll be up and running by the end of 2017. IBM also declined to comment on how much they're costing. \nRobert LeBlanc, senior vice president of IBM Cloud, said in a statement: \"By adding four new cloud data centres in the UK, IBM is giving local businesses an easy route to the cloud, helping them quickly innovate and respond to market demands.\" \nDigital minister Matt Hancock welcomed the news, saying: \"We are already among the most digitally connected countries in the world, with a globally successful digital economy worth more than £118 billion a year and strong cyber security defences to protect consumers and business. \n\"Today's announcement by IBM is a further boost for this thriving area, and another vote of confidence which shows Britain is open for business. These new cloud data centres will help our firms work smarter and quicker to become the world-leading businesses of tomorrow.\" \nAlmost all of the major US tech companies now have data centres in the UK or Ireland. Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Amazon have all opened facilities within the last few years to help them deliver a quicker and smoother experience for heir European users. \nApple is one of the few large US tech companies that is yet to open a data centre in the UK or Ireland. However, it's hoping to build one just outside the small Irish town of Athenry near the west coast of Ireland.",

      "text": "IBM Director Buys Nearly $195K in Stock (IBM) By Daniel Kobialka | November 21, 2016 — 1:04 PM EST \nInternational Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ) Director David Farr recently purchased 1,300 additional shares of his company's stock. (See also: IBM Subsidiary to Relocate HQ to Atlanta .) \nDailyQuint reported Farr acquired IBM shares valued at nearly $195,000 on Oct. 25. Farr now owns 3,758 shares of the company's stock valued at roughly $563,436. \nIBM shares boast a 200-day moving average price of $154.37 per share and a 50-day moving average price of $155.38 per share. The shares also feature a one-year price high of $165.00 per share and a one-year price low of $116.90. Why Did Farr Add Shares of IBM? \nFarr is one of many IBM shareholders who appears optimistic about the company's future. Meanwhile, IBM continues to explore ways to increase its earnings , which is reflected in the company's most recent financial results. \nIBM CEO Ginni Rometty said her company enjoyed double-digit growth in its strategic imperatives — cloud, analytics, mobility and security — in the third quarter of 2016. Rometty pointed out her business offers technologies designed to empower organizations globally and remains committed to investing in these technologies. \"Our ability to apply deep expertise and breakthrough technology, led by Watson and the IBM Cloud, to massive amounts of data is enabling us to build new markets and transform industries,\" she said. \nIn addition, IBM's revenues increased for each of its strategic imperatives in 3Q16. Martin Schroeter, IBM's chief financial officer, also stated his company is constantly on the lookout for ways to bolster its reputation as an IT leader. \"Throughout the year, we have continued to invest where we see the greatest opportunities to create new markets and strengthen our enterprise IT leadership position,\" he pointed out. \nIBM's diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations were $7.67 for the first nine months of 2016, down 15 percent year to year. However, IBM's investments in its strategic imperatives may help the business expand internationally, which may enable the company to boost its earnings in the near future.

      "text": "IBM Invests $200 Million in Cybersecurity (IBM) By Daniel Kobialka | November 21, 2016 — 8:05 AM EST \nInternational Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ) is allocating $200 million to the cybersecurity market. (See also: IBM Closes Sanovi Technologies Acquisition .) \nThe multinational technology company this week announced several cybersecurity investments as part of its efforts to expand its incident response capabilities, including: A new global security headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The expansion of capabilities and capacity for the global network of IBM's X-Force Command Centers. The creation of IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Systems (IRIS), an incident response and intelligence consulting team. \nMarc van Zadelhoff, general manager of IBM's security division, noted IBM's cybersecurity investments may help the company ensure its customers can better prepare for cyberattacks. \"With our investments, we've moved IBM into a unique position in the industry with a comprehensive cybersecurity immune system for customers to build world-class capabilities for thwarting cybercrime,\" he said. IBM and the Cybersecurity Market \nCybersecurity threats are evolving, and IBM looks poised to capitalize on the rising demand for state-of-the-art solutions to minimize such issues. Thus, IBM's new investments may help the company seize new opportunities in the cybersecurity market, a sector that may expand over the next few years. \nMarket research firm MarketsandMarkets has estimated the global cybersecurity market could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.6 percent from $122.45 billion this year to $202.36 billion by 2021. By allocating time and resources to cybersecurity investments, IBM could gain a stronghold on the sector and accelerate its revenue growth. \nIBM recorded $81.8 billion in revenue last year, but the company struggled in the third quarter of 2016. The business reported revenue from continuing operations of $19.2 billion in 3Q16, which remained flat year to year. Also, IBM's diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations reached $7.67 in the quarter, down 15 percent from 3Q15. \nAlthough IBM encountered a difficult 3Q16, the company's cybersecurity investments highlight its commitment to finding innovative ways to grow its operations and enhance its global reputation. \"We have continued to invest where we see the greatest opportunities to create new markets and strengthen our enterprise IT leadership position,\" said Martin Schroeter, IBM's chief financial officer.

      "text": "IBM Has Devised a Way to “Grow” Computer Chips Butch Colyear In Brief Scientists have devised a way, inspired by nature, of coaxing carbon nanotubes to build themselves into structures that could be used to replace silicon chips. The successful implementation of this technology could lead to faster than silicon computer chips along with bendable electronics. Growing Like Crystals \nTraditionally, computer microchips are made of the semiconductor silicon. Silicon is turned into wafers where complex circuitry is carved—but there’s a limit to this complexity and to the chips’ processing capacity, and it’s coming soon . \nScientist from IBM are ushering in a revolution of microchip design by seeking to use carbon nanotubes. The researchers theorize that these nanotube chips could use less electricity, and be six to ten times faster than silicon-based ones. \nThe difficulty with carbon nanotubes is that their tiny size makes them hard to work with—they are basically tiny tubes whose walls are just one carbon atom thick. Unlike with silicon, chip makers can’t carve carbon nanotubes into their intended circuit patterns, nor arrange the tubules one by one. Credit: Goeff Hutchison \nThe materials scientists at IBM are addressing this by borrowing a trick from nature. Using chemistry, they developed a method to coax the carbon nanotubes into the desired structures. The developers described it to be similar to how crystals grow. \n“We’re trying to tackle that problem by borrowing from nature, because nature builds everything that way,” said George Tulevski , IBM Research materials scientist. “We think that’s one of the key missing pieces.” A Nano Revolution \nA revolution in microchip technology could bring us more powerful processors that can crunch more data at a better speed, all while consuming less energy. There are efforts from other groups that are also exploring microchip technology using carbon nanotubes, like Stanford University’s N3XT project , and it could only be too soon when carbon nanotube chips replace silicon-based ones. \nWhen we harness the power of nanotechnology, we can expect a slew of new capabilities from our gadgets. Such possibilities include injectable microchips that could revolutionize medicine, and bendable computers that could be key to developing futuristic wearable tech.",

      "text": "IBM pushes to offer IoT from development to production To help enterprises, the company is combining Watson, cloud, consulting, and services Senior U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 21, 2016 12:03 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nThe Internet of Things is Watson's next challenge. How the Apple Watch copies Samsung and why you need to be scared \nThe internet of things is so complex that some enterprises would rather turn to one vendor to determine the business case for an IoT deployment, design the system, roll it out, and operate it as a service. \nAt least that’s what IBM believes. The company’s combining several of its products and services into what it calls the IoT Solutions Practice. The move, announced Monday, is designed so customers can find all of IBM’s IoT offerings in one place. \nTurning IoT into a service isn’t a new idea. Consultancies like Accenture and carriers like Verizon, among others, say they can reduce the complexity of adopting these systems and making them pay for themselves. \nIBM says it alone has all the pieces to do the job from end to end. Many customers will combine those pieces with components from other vendors and service providers, so the company makes sure its offerings work with those of others. In fact, IBM has partnerships with several other enterprise IoT players, including AT&T and Cisco Systems . \nBut end-to-end expertise is IBM’s big sales pitch, and it's one that some customers may buy into. Complexity is up there with security as something that enterprises find hard about IoT, industry analysts say. \nAt the heart of the company’s offering is the Watson IoT Platform, which combines analytics, security, and other capabilities, including blockchain technology for authentication in some cases. The platform lets customers take advantage of a set of APIs (application programming interfaces), IBM’s SoftLayer cloud infrastructure, and all the analytical smarts that make up the Watson computing universe. Add consulting and ongoing support, and IBM can be a one-stop solution, the company says. \nImplementing IoT may have broad implications for a business beyond just deployment projects and changes in technology, said Jesus Mantas, general manager for IBM’s business consulting practice. For example, the way a company monitors its assets can change from a “pull” to a “push” process, he said. \n“You don’t need somebody to now go every day and check something,” Mantas said. “Event-trigger notifications do that. Well, that changes people’s jobs.” \nPart of what IBM can do for companies adopting IoT is help them through the business implications of the changes, he said. The IoT Solutions Practice applies to a broad range of industries, says IBM, which will first target automotive, electronics, industrial products, insurance, retail, transportation, and buildings. More than 1,500 experts at nine IoT centers around the world are dedicated to the practice. \nTo help enterprises work on how they’ll use IoT, IBM also offers free access to the Watson IoT Platform, said Brett Greenstein, IBM’s vice president for the platform. \n“They can use anything we have in our cloud, effectively, for free,” Greenstein said. As long as customer operations stay below a certain level, around a few dozen devices, they can keep the free access until they’re ready to move up to production scale.

      "text": "How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity \nAccording to the Society for Information Management, the average CIO tenure is just under five years. Mike Keller, CIO of Nationwide, has held his position for more than 15 years. \nWhat’s his secret? Keller says he’s had only two bosses during that time, noting that CEO transitions are one of several factors that can “end things early.” But clearly, he wouldn’t have lasted so long if he hadn’t successfully moved Nationwide forward. [ InfoWorld's quick guide: Digital Transformation and the Agile Enterprise . | Download InfoWorld’s essential guide to microservices and learn how to create modern web and mobile applications that scale. ] \nThat’s no mean feat in an IT organization the size of Nationwide's, with approximately 5,000 permanent employees and 3,600 contractors. Many of the advances have come through adoption of lean and agile processes along with what Keller terms “unsexy” modernization of legacy systems. \nBut Keller also bucked a widespread trend: Instead of decentralizing IT and allowing it to become absorbed in lines of business, he has centralized many major functions. InfoWorld’s hourlong interview with Keller, edited for length and clarity, began with that very question. \nInfoWorld: One of the trends we’ve seen over time is that IT becomes less and less of a separate entity from business units. Does that track with the way things are organized at Nationwide? \nKeller: No. When I joined the company in 2001, it was a decentralized IT organization. There were some shared corporate staffs, but the bulk of IT hard-lined into the business units. Shortly after I got here, we created a federated model, a matrix-managed model where we left the application development groups hard-lined into the business but with a strong dotted line in to me -- and then hard-lined in infrastructure, architecture, security, those kinds of functions. \nIn 2008, I believe, we centralized IT and went through a pretty major transformation of how we do IT. That’s when we established our IT Delivery Model and did our first generation of that. \nWhat I have seen and experienced both at Nationwide and other places I’ve been is that a lot of people like to keep IT decentralized to keep it very close to the business. You tend to get high degrees of inconsistent performance and you don’t leverage economies of scale. Other organizations will centralize and they will get the benefit of standardization and economies of scale but lose touch with the business. \nWe’ve created a construct that we call our Organizational Reference Model. Basically, we try to architect the organizational model so that the right things are very close to the business and the things that would really benefit from centralization are centralized. \nInfoWorld: Break that down for me. How does that work? \nKeller: The business-facing component of our organization model we call a business solution area. But accountability for planning, building, and running of all of the applications and data assets that support business are managed by an IT group that is very tightly aligned with the business area. \nAs an example, in our world if you look at our property and casualty claims function, we have a business solution area -- Claims IT, which is a group of people who are dedicated to claims and who learned the claims business processes. They manage a relationship with those partners and they own all assets and all projects that face off with that part of the business. That’s the part that has kept the business partnership and the business intimacy in place. \nIf you look at the things that have the biggest economies of scale -- infrastructure, application development, governance-and-control functions such as cybersecurity -- those things are centralized. We built a model where we try to be very clear which organizational units are accountable for what and how they interact with each other. We have tried to tweak this in such a way that you get both efficiency and effectiveness as an organization, but also business intimacy. \nIt’s been tricky. I will tell you that when we centralized a lot of our application development, we made major progress and won awards for how we design, develop, test, and implement. Yet when you looked at the end-to-end process, it really wasn’t as efficient and as effective as it needed to be because of the handoff from plan to build, if you will -- things like the requirements pipeline and the handoff from build to run -- there were just some orchestration problems. \nWe’ve done a lot of work to get better processes implemented, like lean, but also worked a lot on culture and teamwork so that you can basically optimize and have it feel like one cohesive organization. We have over 20 of these business solution areas that are the business-facing, business-intimate groups streamlining how they work together with the centralized application development group so you get the best of both worlds. \nInfoWorld: If I want an application development project done, say a customer-facing web or mobile application, walk me through how that process would work. \nKeller: Let’s say that our direct property and casualty business wants a mobile app. The business team that would be working on that has a very tightly integrated and aligned team, our digital business solution area, and they would work together on requirements. \nDevelopment lines are typically staffed with people coming from both groups. The people that are in that business solution area who understand that part of the business best are in the same development line with scrum masters and developers and testers that are coming from the central shared services group. We can very quickly bring these lines together, and if the demand goes away and the project is done send people back to their home in a variable-capacity model. It’s highly efficient and it brings together the right skills from across the organization. \nInfoWorld: Do you see IT an internal services organization to the rest of the business? Is that how you think of it? \nKeller: I’d say that’s accurate. I hope and certainly have aspired to have that internal service provider be one that provides consultation and advice, not just development services or operational services. \nInfoWorld: I’m interested in your implementation of lean and agile and how you recognized that had to happen. As you know, there are many organizations that talk the talk, but they’ve just solidified the agile methodology into something that ends up resembling waterfall more than agile. \nKeller: There wasn’t a clearcut point at which we said we’re going agile or we’re going lean. It was more evolutionary. When we still had decentralized IT, we found that most of the larger teams had started to do some agile, but when we brought all of those practitioners together we discovered we had a dozen different flavors of agile. \nSome were working better than others. When we began experimenting with centralizing IT, we didn’t do all that in one step. We brought together the best thought leaders and told them that they needed to come up with one agile methodology for the enterprise. We had some really smart, capable people who did the work to try to sort through all the best practices internally as well as comparing notes with external consultants and partners to learn from them. \nWe also decided to go through external process assessment so we pretty quickly got to CMMI level three, which typically isn’t done in an agile environment. We were actually one of the early lean, agile, CMM-certified groups. What we found was the ability to create working software quickly, create software that met user requirements, the ability to have low-defect (or even in a lot of cases, defect-free releases) was just producing substantially better results than waterfall and better than a lot of the less mature agile practices that we started with. \nWe started bringing together our practices, trying to refine them, seeing that we liked the results, putting more and more scale in there to the point where now we’re moving into a model where it will be all of our application development in that model. One of the core principles of lean, as I’m sure you know, is creating a continuous improvement engine. \nInfoWorld: That’s what it’s all about. \nKeller: Exactly. \nInfoWorld: To do that you need measurement of how your application is doing. How do you measure the effectiveness and then turn that around into direction for improvement? \nKeller: A lot of what we do with lean is decide what we want to measure -- measuring story point velocity, measuring defects and using local visual management systems -- but then we aggregate the data. We bring it together and measure it and then we also benchmark it so we know where our productivity, quality, and velocity are compared to benchmarks. Just like you try to continuously improve practices, you also try to continuously improve the metrics. \nWe measured things like productivity and velocity in development, but we didn’t have an end-to-use view. As we started to look at devops concepts we realized you really should be measuring it all the way into production. We’re continuing to refine and move more and more to full end-to-end requirements through production. \nInfoWorld: One of the perspectives I’ve heard across several organizations is that one of the transformations of IT, whether you call it “digital transformation” or not, is the idea of transforming IT from being a cost center to a revenue generator. Since you’ve been there for 15 years, have you seen that kind of change in attitude? \nKeller: Yes. I guess the way I would look at it is we build and run different kinds of systems. You can pick your terminology, but historically IT was back-office automation, transactions across what most people today would call systems of record. Most of those systems of record were really geared towards automating tasks to be more efficient. That is still an important part of our portfolio. \nInfoWorld: Roughly how much of your portfolio is systems of record versus systems of engagement? \nKeller: I haven’t measured it that way, but we’re also starting to look at a third category: systems of insight. Sometimes it gets pretty fuzzy. For example, we’ve made a big investment in customer information management. That includes an operational customer information file so that we know all of our customers, we have clean addresses, we know their preferences, we know all their products with us, and we capture all of the interactions in the interaction history. \nIn fact, this was very heavy lifting. Our customer system of record used to be the individual product or policy systems. We changed that in most cases, so the enterprise customer file became the system of record and we had to create some very challenging two-way interfaces between that new set and all of those legacy systems that were not designed to have common customer formatting and weren’t designed to have somebody else be in control. \nThere was a big traditional system of record component of that, but as I said, when we built that out we also started doing things like keeping all the interaction history and taking those operational data stores and feeding data warehouses and doing predictive analytics on it. We spent well over $100 million on customer information management, but I’d be hard-pressed to say how much of that was system of record and how much of that was system of insight. It was both. \nI can tell you that on our project portfolio, we have more going into replacements of core systems of record than we do in either systems of insight or systems of engagement -- but we are investing pretty heavily in all three. What we’re finding is you can’t really do the systems of insight or the systems of engagement well if you have broken core systems, broken systems of record, where you can’t feed those things in real time or you don’t have the data quality you need. \nInfoWorld: Would you say that what you just described is one of the biggest initiatives on your watch? \nKeller: Yes. To your earlier question if IT has to save money or be more top line, my answer is, yes. A lot of times they go together. \nInfoWorld: A flaw in the distinction between systems of record and engagement is that people act as if they’re not connected. \nKeller: Yeah. In other industries like retail, where you might have 20x the volume of customer interaction on shopping than you do on actual buying, you can separate that shopping engagement and have a lot less dependency on systems of record. But once they buy, you have a touchpoint there. \nGiven the nature of our businesses, you really can’t have somebody shop or change their products or services without heavier degrees of interaction with systems of record. We can’t create the kinds of systems of engagement we want without modern backend systems. If you’re going to let somebody go on a mobile phone and … change their auto insurance from one car to the other, they can’t do that without hitting the backend, and if you’re dealing with 1980 Cobol back end system it’s not very pretty. \nOur conscious decision has been invest in digital, invest in data, invest in next-gen technology so that we can provide the kind of customer experience we need. But we’re making an even bigger investment in core systems replacement because we don’t think those other investments would actually work or pay off if we didn’t do the former. \nInfoWorld: Tell me about the most exciting initiatives happening right now. \nKeller: I’m very, very excited about our core transformation programs. We have just about completed moving all of our claims to Guidewire and the productivity of the claims organization is up dramatically. The productivity of IT in that area is up dramatically. We’ve cut development timelines and costs by 60 percent, meaning that we can do two and a half times as much work in a given amount of time for a given amount of money than we used to do -- and we can start to build customer-facing digital capabilities radically faster and better and do things we couldn’t even have done before. \nWe’re beginning the rollout of our personalized policy administration, and that’s where a lot of our direct consumer interaction will be. When both personalized policy and claims are done, I really think we will save a whole bunch of money internally. We’ll be much more agile as a business, so we can change products or pricing or internal processes much better and we can create a much better customer digital experience. \nGetting these core transformations done isn’t sexy. It’s very heavy, hard lifting, very expensive. But when you see what it enables, the dramatic business and technology simplification and the real benefits of being on a modern architecture, I actually find that very exciting. The cool stuff that you can build on that is also very exciting. To comment on this article and other InfoWorld content, visit InfoWorld's LinkedIn page , Facebook page and Twitter stream .

      "text": "PowerAI: The World’s Fastest Deep Learning Solution Among Leading Enterprise Servers November 15, 2016 | Written by: Scott Soutter \nCategorized: Linux servers | Servers - Power \nOver the past several weeks, my IBM colleagues have written about our progress porting and optimizing popular deep learning frameworks for the most advanced platform for accelerated computing in the enterprise, the IBM S822LC for HPC . \nToday I am pleased to announce another major milestone: the creation of the world’s fastest deep learning solution among leading enterprise servers. This offering includes new IBM PowerAI software toolkit paired with NVIDIA NVLink and GPUDL libraries optimized for IBM Power architecture. We call it PowerAI. \nFoundations of PowerAI \nPowerAI brings together a collection of the most popular open source frameworks for deep learning, along with supporting software and libraries, all in a single installable package. Our design goal was to simplify the acquisition, installation and system optimization required to bring up a deep learning infrastructure, allowing users to spend less time on implementation and more time training neural networks for results. More about those results soon. \nAt the core of the PowerAI solution is the high-performance Power Systems S822LC for a high-performance computing (HPC) server, incorporating two POWER8 CPUs, up to four NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs, and across-the-system high-bandwidth NVLink connectivity, tying together GPU-GPU and GPU-CPU with multiple point-to-point connections. \nThis architecture is designed for the compute intensive requirements of deep learning software, providing a high bandwidth connection between the GPU and system memory, and GPU to GPU. With PowerAI and NVIDIA NVLink, deep learning workloads can utilize this bandwidth, moving large training data sets from system memory to GPU memory; the outcome is designed to be a shorter training cycle and the ability to train with larger data sets for improved accuracy. \nOptimizations and industry exclusives \nWorking closely with IBM Research in Tokyo, the PowerAI development team has integrated several performance enhancements into one of these frameworks. These optimizations, packaged in the IBM-Caffe binary, leverage NVIDIA NVLink bandwidth and reduce some of the redundant data movement within this deep learning framework. This optimization, along with the increased performance of the NVIDIA Tesla P100s, enables a four GPU S822LC for HPC system to outperform an eight GPU plus Intel Broadwell system running the VGGNet workload on the Caffe framework by 24 percent. [1] S822LC/HPC with 4 Tesla P100 Tesla GPUs is 24 percent faster than 8 Tesla M40 GPUs \nWe’re extremely excited about the promise of this optimization and look forward to seeing how our clients and partners incorporate it into their deep learning workflows. \nThe toolkit also leverages GPUDL libraries including deep neural network library (cuDNN), basic linear algebra subroutines (cuBLAS) and collective communication library (NCCL) as part of NVIDIA SDKs to deliver multi-GPU acceleration for optimizing performance on IBM servers. \nOver time, we intend to explore additional optimizations and unique capabilities integrated into future releases of PowerAI. \nGetting started with PowerAI \nThe PowerAI packages are available now, linked to our PowerAI landing page . These images will install on an S822LC for HPC server running Ubuntu 16.04, NVIDIA CUDA 8 and NVIDIA cuDNN 5.1. If you were to build this infrastructure from scratch, it could likely take days; our design point is to be running in an hour or less. \nIf you would like to evaluate this solution in the cloud, we are excited to announce that IBM’s Power HPC cloud partner, Nimbix, has made the IBM Caffe framework available on their S822LC for HPC infrastructure as a service; instead of an hour, you could be training in minutes. \nWe’re truly excited about this offering and would welcome the chance to hear from you. As you and your organization get started with PowerAI, please share your results and comments. \n[1] Test System: IBM S822LC 20-cores 2.86GHz 512GB memory / 4 NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs / Ubuntu 16.04 / CUDA 8.0.44 / cuDNN 5.1 / IBM Caffe 1.0.0-rc3 / Imagenet Data \nCompetitive System: Intel Broadwell E5-2640v4 20-core 2.6 GHz 512GB memory / 8 NVIDIA TeslaM40 GPUs / Ubuntu 16.04 / CUDA 8.0.44 / cuDNN 5.1 / BVLC Caffe 1.0.0-rc3 / Imagenet Data Share this post: Scott Soutter Offering Manager, High Performance Computing and Deep Learning IBM Systems ",

      "text": "IBM expands its UK presence with 4 new data centers Posted DeepMind Health inks new deal with UK’s NHS to deploy Streams app in early 2017 \nIBM today announced that it is launching four new data centers in the U.K. This brings IBM’s total data center footprint in the U.K. to six, in addition to 16 other locations across Europe. \nThis is yet another example of the company’s increasing infrastructure investment. The first of these new U.K. locations in Fareham will go online in December, with the other three U.K. locations launching next year. As an IBM spokesperson told me, IBM isn’t building its own data centers, though. It’ll lease raw space and build out its own infrastructure (electrical, networking, compute, storage, etc.) in these leased spaces. \nThe last new data center IBM opened in Europe was its Oslo location, in September, but the company also recently expanded its presence in Asia with the launch of its Korean data center in August. In total, IBM’s cloud services are now available in 50 data centers. \nIBM is betting on a number of different brands for these data centers. Its Watson cognitive services, for example, are only one of hundreds of different services that run in its data centers. Under the SoftLayer brand, it also offers more basic cloud servers and storage solutions, as well as its Bluemix platform as a service offering. But there is also the OpenStack-based Blue Box private cloud as a service and a plethora of other services that run on those different platforms. \nLooking at IBM’s cloud portfolio can quickly become overwhelming, but it’s also driving a good bit of IBM’s revenue. In its third quarter, cloud revenue grew to $12.7 billion. In the U.K., its marquee customers include the likes of Wimbledon, Dixons Carphone, Shop Direct, National Express and, as the company announced today, tour operator Thomson. \nIt’s worth noting that IBM’s second new data center in the U.K. will operate out of an Ark data center. Ark Data Centres is a join venture between the U.K. government and the public sector. This will likely increase IBM’s footprint in the public sector in the U.K., as well. \n“By adding four new Cloud data centres in the UK, IBM is giving local businesses an easy route to the cloud, helping them quickly innovate and respond to market demands,” said Robert LeBlanc, senior vice president of IBM Cloud, in a canned statement. “IBM is continuing to invest in high growth areas, offering clients higher-value cloud data services such as Watson and Blockchain running on our cloud infrastructure that delivers world-class scalability, performance and security.” Featured Image: Mark Renders/Getty Images 0",

      "text": "Despite the complications that the Brexit vote has caused for some British cloud computing buyers, IBM Corp. still sees a big growth opportunity in the local infrastructure-as-a-service market.\nThe company plans to address the increasing demand by launching four new data centers in the U.K. through 2017. The first facility is set to open by the end of this year in Fareham, a southern town located near the busy port cities of Southampton and Portsmouth. It should enable IBM to better target the numerous companies that operate in the two municipalities and the encompassing County of Hampshire, which is the fifth-largest in England with a population of nearly 2 million.\nBig Blue’s second planned cloud facility will come online in mid-2017 on a site leased from Ark Data Centres Ltd. The latter firm became the main infrastructure provider to the U.K. government last year after winning a £700 million ($865 million) contract known as the Crown Hosting Framework. IBM hopes that delivering services from the same location where several local agencies already run their workloads will put it in a better position to target the lucrative British public sector. Like the White House before it, the U.K. government adopted a “cloud-first” policy towards technology spending in 2013.\nIBM didn’t divulge where the two other planned facilities will be located or when they’re scheduled to come online. But the company did specify that the data centers are set to offer services that are currently available to customers stateside, including Watson, Bluemix and its recently introduced blockchain platform .\nThe expansion will bring the number of data centers that IBM operates in the U.K. to six, which puts it well ahead of bigger rivals such as Amazon.com Inc. that have only recently started establishing a local presence. Overall, Big Blue expects to have a total of 16 cloud facilities in Europe and more than 50 worldwide when construction completes next year. The company must keep investing in infrastructure if it wants to stay ahead of the competition, which is working hard to close the gap.\nAmazon Web Services powered up three new data centers in Ohio just a few weeks ago as part of an effort to court companies from the Great Lakes region. And a few months earlier, Google announced plans to launch 10 new cloud facilities of its own by 2018 in a bid to target international customers.\nImage courtesy of IBM ",

The investment in the new facilities underscores IBM's long-standing commitment to providing innovative solutions to the UK market and triples its cloud center capacity in the UK. \n\"We are already among the most digitally connected countries in the world, with a globally successful digital economy worth more than £118billion a year and strong cyber security defences to protect consumers and business,\" said Matt Hancock , Minister of State for Digital and Culture. \"Today's announcement by IBM is a further boost for this thriving area, and another vote of confidence which shows Britain is open for business. These new cloud data centers will help our firms work smarter and quicker to become the world-leading businesses of tomorrow.\"\nIBM expands its global cloud data center footprint by opening 4 new facilities in UK. IBM Cloud will have 6 cloud data centers in UK, 16 across Europe and 50+ worldwide. IBM is expanding its cloud data centers from two to six in the UK and 16 total across Europe serving more countries and making it the most comprehensive network for delivering cloud services. Cloud adoption rates increased to 84% in the UK over the course of the last five years, according to Cloud Industry Forum .  IDC forecasts that the global market opportunity for public cloud services will exceed $195 billion by 2020. 1   The expansion strengthens IBM's ability to bring clients greater flexibility, transparency and control over how they manage data, run their businesses and deploy IT operations locally in the cloud. \nThese new facilities expand IBM's cloud data center footprint from two to six in the UK and 16 across Europe as part of IBM's network of more than 50 data centers worldwide.  With these new data centers, clients have access to a complete portfolio of IBM cloud services for running their mission critical enterprise workloads and innovations through more than 150 digital services (APIs). These digital services are available via IBM's development platform, Bluemix and include Watson, IBM's cognitive intelligence technology that allows computers to think and learn like humans, building blocks for innovative Blockchain applications that increase trust in transactions, plus enabling technologies for Internet of Things (IoT) and analytics applications.\nThomson, part of TUI UK & Ireland , the UK's largest tour operator, is trialling a new travel search tool, which leverages Watson cognitive services on the IBM Cloud with its customers giving them the opportunity to find travel inspiration by interacting with the virtual travel assistant.  The tool is a smart chatbot that interacts with consumers to provide real-time search results on travel destinations and holiday inquiries, such as \"I want to visit local markets/ go on an adventure/ have a cultured holiday/ see exotic animals\". Thomson is tapping into IBM's Cloud data center in the UK and leverages Watson APIs such as conversation, natural language classifier and speech-to-text.  The experimental website gains insights and learns from data via frequent requests to provide more digital intelligence that matches customer requirements.\n\"By leveraging IBM's Cloud platform with Watson's cognitive intelligence we have raised the bar in the travel industry and delivered an interactive website to our digitally savvy customers in a fun and innovative way. We are excited to learn how customers interact and what they get out of the experience,\" said Jo Hickson , Head of Innovation, TUI UK&I.  \nIBM Cloud Expands Capabilities for Highly Regulated Industries in the UK and EU\nIBM was first to offer cloud services to clients in the UK through an existing Cloud data center more than five years ago, which was swiftly followed by a second UK Cloud data center in 2014.  IBM was recently cited as a \"strong performer\" in Forrester's latest Wave Report on global public cloud platforms in Europe . IBM also earned the highest possible score for its hybrid cloud strategy as well as the top ranking for IBM's infrastructure services. 2 \n\"By adding four new Cloud data centers in the UK, IBM is giving local businesses an easy route to the cloud, helping them quickly innovate and respond to market demands,\" said Robert LeBlanc , senior vice president of IBM Cloud. \"IBM is continuing to invest in high growth areas, offering clients higher-value cloud data services such as Watson and Blockchain running on our cloud infrastructure that delivers world-class scalability, performance and security.\"  \nIBM client Armakuni, a provider to financial services and fintech, commented: \"Data security and residency are two key concerns when considering use of cloud services in financial services. IBM's investment and expansion of their cloud data center footprint in the UK goes a long way to address these concerns and enables us to better serve UK customers securely.\"\nIBM also signed an agreement to lease space within Ark Data Centres in the UK, which will see the second of the four new cloud data centers fully operational in mid-2017.  Ark is the joint venture partner with the UK Government delivering public sector data center services under the Crown Hosting Framework.  Crown Hosting, based in the same Ark facility, is already being used by a number of public sector departments and agencies.\nIBM Cloud: A Focus on Quality, Performance, Innovation and Choice\nClients choosing IBM Cloud services will benefit from the company's experience across public, private and hybrid cloud deployments and easy access to cloud innovations on a simple pay-as-you-go model.  Clients also benefit from services like load balancing, auto scaling, object storage, bandwidth pooling and Static IPs that are resilient across the cloud data centers in the UK.   From migrating existing workloads to the cloud for the first time to supporting advanced applications that draw on High Performance Computing and cognitive technologies, IBM Cloud data centers are distinct in several ways:\nModern Infrastructure: The new facilities are designed to provide users with the largest portfolio and pool of bare metal servers in the market delivering up to an 8X performance increase on database applications. This design also means clients can mix infrastructure resources, including bare metal servers, virtual servers, storage, and networking, to find the right balance for their workloads. These facilities will also offer users the latest IBM POWER and x86 processors, NVIDIA GPU accelerators, OpenPOWER-based servers, SAP HANA applications and IBM Bluemix development tools. Enhanced Network Performance: All IBM Cloud data centers connect to a global backbone network that enables seamless data transfer, lower latency, and more consistent network performance between cloud infrastructure and end users around the world. With this innovative network foundation, high-bandwidth apps and services like video streaming, database querying and HPC applications perform at their best. Next-Generation Data Center Capabilities: Clients using these facilities will also have access to IBM Watson, Blockchain, IoT and other leading cloud-based services through more than 150 open APIs. IBM provides a complete stack of cloud services with IaaS, PaaS and SaaS capabilities that can be accessed. The new facilities provide clients greater flexibility, transparency and control over how they manage data, run business operations and deploy IT operations locally in the cloud. The facilities also connect to IBM's public data centers around the world to help clients transfer and replicate their data in multiple locations and quickly balance or reroute workloads between multiple locations. \nUK Clients Already Benefitting from IBM Cloud\nHundreds of UK clients of all sizes are already taking advantage of the benefits IBM Cloud offers including  Dixons Carphone , National Express , National Grid , Shop Direct , Travis Perkins PLC and Wimbledon . \nDixons Carphone , Europe's largest telecommunications retailer, migrated to IBM Cloud to integrate two distinct infrastructures following its 2014 merger, and enable easy scaling to better manage seasonal shopping trends.  \"One of the biggest IT challenges in the retail industry is performance, reliability and rapid scalability to manage the peaks and valleys of seasonal shopping trends. IBM's investment and expansion in the UK provides us with an even more seamless ecommerce and retail experience for our customers during these busy retail periods including holidays and new product launches,\" said David Hennessy , IT Director, Dixons Carphone.\nIBM's Global Cloud Footprint\nWith more than 50 global cloud data centers, IBM helps companies securely manage and gain insight into their data no matter where it resides.  The news also reinforces IBM strong cloud presence across Europe , and the additional facilities announced today uniquely position IBM as the market leader with more UK data centers than any other vendor.  In September, IBM announced the opening of its first cloud data center in the Nordics. The addition of the new UK data center facilities will mark 16 IBM data centers across Europe .\nThe new UK facilities will enable companies of all sizes to digitize business and operations and drive innovation through the IBM Cloud. The first facility will open in Fareham at the end of December, with three more opening in the UK next year.\nAbout IBM Cloud: \nFor more information, visit: http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing .\nMedia Contact\nEmma Bennett \nIBM UKI External Communications Cloud\nE mail - emma.bennett@uk.ibm.com \nMobile - 07976 839109\n1 IDC Worldwide Semiannual Public Cloud Services Spending Guide, 10 th August 2016 \n2 The Forrester Wave: Enterprise Public Cloud Platforms in Europe , Q4 2016\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161121/441872-INFO \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161121/441873 \nLogo -  http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090416/IBMLOGO  \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-triples-cloud-data-center-capacity-in-the-uk-300367029.html \nSOURCE IBM",

      "text": "Tue Nov 22, 2016 | 12:12am GMT IBM invests in UK data centers as tech sector defies Brexit worries A woman passes by the IBM offices in New York City, U.S., October 17, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nLONDON Global IT group IBM ( IBM.N ) will triple the number of its cloud data centers in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union. \nIBM said it would build four new data centers to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. \nIBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. \n\"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview. \nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. \n\"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said. \nTech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fueled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. \nCompanies including Google ( GOOGL.O ) and Facebook ( FB.O ) have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasized the importance of being able to attract the best people. \nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centers to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. \nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. \nKrause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centers in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future. \n(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Mark Potter) Up Next Sneakers show limits of trade policy in reviving jobs for Trump \nAmerican companies from appliance makers to auto parts suppliers have lined up to offer a quiet caution to President-elect Donald Trump as he considers pulling the United States from trade deals: most lost manufacturing jobs aren’t coming back, but higher costs for consumers could.",

      "text": "Technology   7:12pm EST IBM invests in UK data centers as tech sector defies Brexit worries A woman passes by the IBM offices in New York City, U.S., October 17, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nLONDON Global IT group IBM ( IBM.N ) will triple the number of its cloud data centers in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union. \nIBM said it would build four new data centers to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. \nIBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. \n\"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview. \nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. \n\"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said. \nTech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fueled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. \nCompanies including Google ( GOOGL.O ) and Facebook ( FB.O ) have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasized the importance of being able to attract the best people. \nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centers to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. \nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. \nKrause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centers in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future. \n(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Mark Potter) Next In Technology News",

IBM invests in UK data centres as tech sector defies Brexit worries Reuters – 19 minutes ago 162.77 +2.38 \nLONDON (Reuters) - Global IT group IBM (IBM.N) will triple the number of its cloud data centres in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union. \nIBM said it would build four new data centres to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. \nIBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. \n\"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview. \nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. \n\"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said. \nTech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fuelled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. \nCompanies including Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O) have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasised the importance of being able to attract the best people. \nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centres to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. \nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. \nKrause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centres in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future. \n(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Mark Potter) Nissan supplier Calsonic says board to discuss KKR bid Reuters - 9 minutes ago Calsonic Kansei Corp (7248.T) said it would discuss KKR & Co's (KKR.N) bid for the Nissan Motor Co supplier at its board meeting later on Tuesday, nearing a deal worth $3.6 billion (2.88 billion pounds).

It did not disclose the size of the investment. \nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. \nKrause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centres in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future.

      "text": "LONDON: Global IT group IBM will triple the number of its cloud data centres in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union.\nIBM said it would build four new data centres to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud.\nIBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing.\n\"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview.\nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision.\n\"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said.\nTech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fuelled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc.\nCompanies including Google and Facebook have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasised the importance of being able to attract the best people.\nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centres to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment.\nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled.\nKrause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centres in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future.\n(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Mark Potter)\n ",

Posted 22 Nov 2016 08:15 A woman passes by the IBM offices in New York City, U.S., October 17, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid A \nLONDON: Global IT group IBM will triple the number of its cloud data centers in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union. \nIBM said it would build four new data centers to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. \nIBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. \n\"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview. \nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. \n\"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said. \nTech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fueled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. \nCompanies including Google and Facebook have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasized the importance of being able to attract the best people. \nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centers to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. \nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. \nKrause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centers in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future. \n(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Mark Potter) - Reuters",

      "title": "IBM Triples Cloud Data Center Capacity in the UK",
      "text": " 10 PM EST IBM Triples Cloud Data Center Capacity in the UK \nLONDON   IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced that it is adding four new cloud data centers infused with cognitive intelligence in the UK, to keep pace with growing client demand. The investment in the new facilities underscores IBM's long-standing commitment to providing innovative solutions to the UK market and triples its cloud center capacity in the UK. \n\"We are already among the most digitally connected countries in the world, with a globally successful digital economy worth more than £118billion a year and strong cyber security defences to protect consumers and business,\" said Matt Hancock , Minister of State for Digital and Culture. \"Today's announcement by IBM is a further boost for this thriving area, and another vote of confidence which shows Britain is open for business. These new cloud data centers will help our firms work smarter and quicker to become the world-leading businesses of tomorrow.\" \nCloud adoption rates increased to 84% in the UK over the course of the last five years, according to Cloud Industry Forum . IDC forecasts that the global market opportunity for public cloud services will exceed $195 billion by 2020. 1 The expansion strengthens IBM's ability to bring clients greater flexibility, transparency and control over how they manage data, run their businesses and deploy IT operations locally in the cloud. \nThese new facilities expand IBM's cloud data center footprint from two to six in the UK and 16 across Europe as part of IBM's network of more than 50 data centers worldwide. With these new data centers, clients have access to a complete portfolio of IBM cloud services for running their mission critical enterprise workloads and innovations through more than 150 digital services (APIs). These digital services are available via IBM's development platform, Bluemix and include Watson, IBM's cognitive intelligence technology that allows computers to think and learn like humans, building blocks for innovative Blockchain applications that increase trust in transactions, plus enabling technologies for Internet of Things (IoT) and analytics applications. \nThomson, part of TUI UK & Ireland , the UK's largest tour operator, is trialling a new travel search tool, which leverages Watson cognitive services on the IBM Cloud with its customers giving them the opportunity to find travel inspiration by interacting with the virtual travel assistant. The tool is a smart chatbot that interacts with consumers to provide real-time search results on travel destinations and holiday inquiries, such as \"I want to visit local markets/ go on an adventure/ have a cultured holiday/ see exotic animals\". Thomson is tapping into IBM's Cloud data center in the UK and leverages Watson APIs such as conversation, natural language classifier and speech-to-text. The experimental website gains insights and learns from data via frequent requests to provide more digital intelligence that matches customer requirements. \n\"By leveraging IBM's Cloud platform with Watson's cognitive intelligence we have raised the bar in the travel industry and delivered an interactive website to our digitally savvy customers in a fun and innovative way. We are excited to learn how customers interact and what they get out of the experience,\" said Jo Hickson , Head of Innovation, TUI UK&I. \nIBM Cloud Expands Capabilities for Highly Regulated Industries in the UK and EU IBM was first to offer cloud services to clients in the UK through an existing Cloud data center more than five years ago, which was swiftly followed by a second UK Cloud data center in 2014. IBM was recently cited as a \"strong performer\" in Forrester's latest Wave Report on global public cloud platforms in Europe . IBM also earned the highest possible score for its hybrid cloud strategy as well as the top ranking for IBM's infrastructure services. 2 \n\"By adding four new Cloud data centers in the UK, IBM is giving local businesses an easy route to the cloud, helping them quickly innovate and respond to market demands,\" said Robert LeBlanc , senior vice president of IBM Cloud. \"IBM is continuing to invest in high growth areas, offering clients higher-value cloud data services such as Watson and Blockchain running on our cloud infrastructure that delivers world-class scalability, performance and security.\" \nIBM client Armakuni, a provider to financial services and fintech, commented: \"Data security and residency are two key concerns when considering use of cloud services in financial services. IBM's investment and expansion of their cloud data center footprint in the UK goes a long way to address these concerns and enables us to better serve UK customers securely.\" \nIBM also signed an agreement to lease space within Ark Data Centres in the UK, which will see the second of the four new cloud data centers fully operational in mid-2017. Ark is the joint venture partner with the UK Government delivering public sector data center services under the Crown Hosting Framework. Crown Hosting, based in the same Ark facility, is already being used by a number of public sector departments and agencies. \nIBM Cloud: A Focus on Quality, Performance, Innovation and Choice Clients choosing IBM Cloud services will benefit from the company's experience across public, private and hybrid cloud deployments and easy access to cloud innovations on a simple pay-as-you-go model. Clients also benefit from services like load balancing, auto scaling, object storage, bandwidth pooling and Static IPs that are resilient across the cloud data centers in the UK. From migrating existing workloads to the cloud for the first time to supporting advanced applications that draw on High Performance Computing and cognitive technologies, IBM Cloud data centers are distinct in several ways: Modern Infrastructure: The new facilities are designed to provide users with the largest portfolio and pool of bare metal servers in the market delivering up to an 8X performance increase on database applications. This design also means clients can mix infrastructure resources, including bare metal servers, virtual servers, storage, and networking, to find the right balance for their workloads. These facilities will also offer users the latest IBM POWER and x86 processors, NVIDIA GPU accelerators, OpenPOWER-based servers, SAP HANA applications and IBM Bluemix development tools. Enhanced Network Performance: All IBM Cloud data centers connect to a global backbone network that enables seamless data transfer, lower latency, and more consistent network performance between cloud infrastructure and end users around the world. With this innovative network foundation, high-bandwidth apps and services like video streaming, database querying and HPC applications perform at their best. Next-Generation Data Center Capabilities: Clients using these facilities will also have access to IBM Watson, Blockchain, IoT and other leading cloud-based services through more than 150 open APIs. IBM provides a complete stack of cloud services with IaaS, PaaS and SaaS capabilities that can be accessed. \nThe new facilities provide clients greater flexibility, transparency and control over how they manage data, run business operations and deploy IT operations locally in the cloud. The facilities also connect to IBM's public data centers around the world to help clients transfer and replicate their data in multiple locations and quickly balance or reroute workloads between multiple locations. \nUK Clients Already Benefitting from IBM Cloud Hundreds of UK clients of all sizes are already taking advantage of the benefits IBM Cloud offers including Dixons Carphone , National Express , National Grid , Shop Direct , Travis Perkins PLC and Wimbledon . \nDixons Carphone , Europe's largest telecommunications retailer, migrated to IBM Cloud to integrate two distinct infrastructures following its 2014 merger, and enable easy scaling to better manage seasonal shopping trends. \"One of the biggest IT challenges in the retail industry is performance, reliability and rapid scalability to manage the peaks and valleys of seasonal shopping trends. IBM's investment and expansion in the UK provides us with an even more seamless ecommerce and retail experience for our customers during these busy retail periods including holidays and new product launches,\" said David Hennessy , IT Director, Dixons Carphone. \nIBM's Global Cloud Footprint With more than 50 global cloud data centers, IBM helps companies securely manage and gain insight into their data no matter where it resides. The news also reinforces IBM strong cloud presence across Europe , and the additional facilities announced today uniquely position IBM as the market leader with more UK data centers than any other vendor. In September, IBM announced the opening of its first cloud data center in the Nordics. The addition of the new UK data center facilities will mark 16 IBM data centers across Europe . \nThe new UK facilities will enable companies of all sizes to digitize business and operations and drive innovation through the IBM Cloud. The first facility will open in Fareham at the end of December, with three more opening in the UK next year. \nAbout IBM Cloud: For more information, visit: http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing . \nMedia Contact IBM UKI External Communications CloudE mail - \n1 IDC Worldwide Semiannual Public Cloud Services Spending Guide, 10 th August 2016 2 The Forrester Wave: Enterprise Public Cloud Platforms in Europe , Q4 2016",

      "text": "A woman passes by the IBM offices in New York Thomson Reuters\nLONDON (Reuters) - Global IT group IBM will triple the number of its cloud data centers in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union.\nIBM said it would build four new data centers to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud.\nIBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing.\n\"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview.\nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision.\n\"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said.\nTech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fueled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc.\nCompanies including Google and Facebook have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasized the importance of being able to attract the best people.\nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centers to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment.\nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled.\nKrause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centers in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future.\n(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Mark Potter)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "The NTSB is investigating the ‘structural failure’ of Facebook’s Aquila internet drone Posted IBM expands its UK presence with 4 new data centers \nSay what you will about the merits of Facebook’s Internet.org and Free Basics — it’s pretty cool that they’re building a huge, solar-powered, laser-shooting drone to deliver it. But a “structural failure” that occurred on the Aquila’s first test flight may be more serious than Facebook made it out to be: the National Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation, Bloomberg reports . \nWe’ve contacted the NTSB for more information and to acquire the report on the incident, if it exists (these things can take time), but haven’t heard back yet. We’ll update the post when we do. \nFacebook wrote about its tests (which occurred on June 28) in July, listing several things they were looking at, learned, and so on. Under the “real world conditions” bullet point, the blog post admits things weren’t entirely nominal: \nWe are still analyzing the results of the extended test, including a structural failure we experienced just before landing. We hope to share more details on this and other structural tests in the future. \nReally, it was too much to hope that nothing would go wrong on the first full-scale test of an enormous, experimental aircraft design. But the NTSB doesn’t get involved if a screw drops off — Bloomberg reports that the safety organization classified the incident as an “accident,” which implies the damage was “substantial.” \nThese terms, however, have specific meanings to NTSB investigators and aircraft testers. If the Aquila had nosedived into the ground, caught fire, or sustained some other high-profile damage, that likely would have come out by now. We’re waiting on the incident report for the rest of the information — but considering the scope of the project and pride evinced by Facebook in the Aquila’s development, it seemed reasonable to, well, clip its wings a little bit. 0",

      "text": "IBM has joined fellow US tech giants Facebook and Google in announcing a major multi-million dollar investment into the UK.\n\nThe company is today announcing plans for four new cloud data centres – where corporate and consumer information is stored remotely – in the UK “to keep pace with growing client demand”.\n\nThe commitment marks IBM Cloud’s largest single investment into one country and City A.M. understands it will lead to a triple-figure headcount increase in the UK. The firm currently employs around 15,000 people in Britain.\n\n*Read more*: London needs to stay a welcoming hub for tech, says Facebook exec\n\n“Today's announcement by IBM is a further boost for this thriving area, and another vote of confidence which shows Britain is open for business ,” said Matt Hancock, minister for digital and culture. “These new cloud data centres will help our firms work smarter and quicker to become the world-leading businesses of tomorrow.”\n\nThe announcement comes after Facebook said on Monday it would be hiring an additional 500 employees next year when it opens a new London headquarters. And Google last week confirmed plans to expand its London headquarters and create 3,000 new jobs in the capital. \n\nThe IBM investment will increase the company’s cloud data centre footprint in the UK to six, on top of 10 across Europe and more than 50 worldwide.\n\n*Read more*: Tech-tastic: May pledges billions to support tech champions\n\n“By adding four new cloud data centres in the UK, IBM is giving local businesses an easy route to the cloud, helping them quickly innovate and respond to market demands,” said Robert LeBlanc, senior vice president of IBM Cloud.\n\n“IBM is continuing to invest in high growth areas, offering clients higher-value cloud data services such as Watson and blockchain running on our cloud infrastructure that delivers world-class scalability, performance and security .”\n\nThe race to control the cloud computing market has triggered a spending spree from some of the world’s biggest tech titans.\n\n*Read more: *Oracle and BT team up for UK cloud push\n\nIBM is rushing to catch up with the likes of Microsoft and current leader Amazon, who grabbed early market share by offering rock-bottom prices.\n\nGoogle, Adobe and Oracle are also looking to increase their cloud computing footprint.\n\nThe first of IBM's two new UK data centres will be opened in Hampshire.",

These new cloud data centers will help our firms work smarter and quicker to become the world-leading businesses of tomorrow.\" \nCloud adoption rates increased to 84% in the UK over the course of the last five years, according to Cloud Industry Forum .  IDC forecasts that the global market opportunity for public cloud services will exceed $195 billion by 2020. 1   The expansion strengthens IBM's ability to bring clients greater flexibility, transparency and control over how they manage data, run their businesses and deploy IT operations locally in the cloud. \nThese new facilities expand IBM's cloud data center footprint from two to six in the UK and 16 across Europe as part of IBM's network of more than 50 data centers worldwide.  With these new data centers, clients have access to a complete portfolio of IBM cloud services for running their mission critical enterprise workloads and innovations through more than 150 digital services (APIs). These digital services are available via IBM's development platform, Bluemix and include Watson, IBM's cognitive intelligence technology that allows computers to think and learn like humans, building blocks for innovative Blockchain applications that increase trust in transactions, plus enabling technologies for Internet of Things (IoT) and analytics applications. \nThomson, part of TUI UK & Ireland , the UK's largest tour operator, is trialling a new travel search tool, which leverages Watson cognitive services on the IBM Cloud with its customers giving them the opportunity to find travel inspiration by interacting with the virtual travel assistant.  The tool is a smart chatbot that interacts with consumers to provide real-time search results on travel destinations and holiday inquiries, such as \"I want to visit local markets/ go on an adventure/ have a cultured holiday/ see exotic animals\". Thomson is tapping into IBM's Cloud data center in the UK and leverages Watson APIs such as conversation, natural language classifier and speech-to-text.  The experimental website gains insights and learns from data via frequent requests to provide more digital intelligence that matches customer requirements. \n\"By leveraging IBM's Cloud platform with Watson's cognitive intelligence we have raised the bar in the travel industry and delivered an interactive website to our digitally savvy customers in a fun and innovative way. We are excited to learn how customers interact and what they get out of the experience,\" said Jo Hickson , Head of Innovation, TUI UK&I.  \nIBM Cloud Expands Capabilities for Highly Regulated Industries in the UK and EU IBM was first to offer cloud services to clients in the UK through an existing Cloud data center more than five years ago, which was swiftly followed by a second UK Cloud data center in 2014.  IBM was recently cited as a \"strong performer\" in Forrester's latest Wave Report on global public cloud platforms in Europe . IBM also earned the highest possible score for its hybrid cloud strategy as well as the top ranking for IBM's infrastructure services. 2 \n\"By adding four new Cloud data centers in the UK, IBM is giving local businesses an easy route to the cloud, helping them quickly innovate and respond to market demands,\" said Robert LeBlanc , senior vice president of IBM Cloud. \"IBM is continuing to invest in high growth areas, offering clients higher-value cloud data services such as Watson and Blockchain running on our cloud infrastructure that delivers world-class scalability, performance and security.\"  \nIBM client Armakuni, a provider to financial services and fintech, commented: \"Data security and residency are two key concerns when considering use of cloud services in financial services. IBM's investment and expansion of their cloud data center footprint in the UK goes a long way to address these concerns and enables us to better serve UK customers securely.\"",

      "text": "Tweet Share LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Global IT group IBM will triple the number of its cloud data centres in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union. IBM said it would build four new data centres to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. IBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. \"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview. IBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. \"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said. Tech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fuelled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. Companies including Google and Facebook have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasised the importance of being able to attract the best people. IBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centres to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. Brexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. Krause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centres in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future.

      "text": "How Trump’s Presidency Could Affect IBM and Its Peers PART 6 OF 9 Will Apple Force Trump to Reduce the Tax Rate? By Anne Shields | Nov 18, 2016 2:07 pm EST Trump’s tax reduction move could be the only way to bring billions back to the United States \nEarlier, we discussed the comments made by IBM’s ( IBM ) CEO, Virginia Rometty, regarding the company’s layoffs in the United States and the reduction in the tax rate, after Trump publicly called IBM out for moving jobs to other countries. \nIn August 2016, Apple’s ( AAPL ) CEO, Tim Cook, in a talk with The Washington Post about the company’s cash held overseas, said, “We’re not going to bring back until there’s a fair rate.” \nAs the chart above shows, Apple tops the list of tech companies that have significant cash reserves offshore. It’s followed by Microsoft ( MSFT ), Google’s Alphabet ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ), and Oracle ( ORCL ). Recently, we discussed how Trump’s unexpected victory led to a fall in the tech sector. \nRometty’s letter voiced a similar opinion. It stated, “Many billions of dollars of American companies’ earnings do not come home because of an outdated and punitive tax system.” The letter said that the change as a result of the reduced tax rate would “free up capital that companies of all sizes can reinvest in their U.S. operations, training and education programs for their employees, and research and development programs.” \nWe’ve already highlighted the importance of R&D (research and development) in the success of tech companies. IBM, which has an annual R&D budget of $5.4 billion, has spent more than half of its R&D funds in the United States. IBM’s investments in R&D led to its having the most AI (artificial intelligence) patents among its peers in 2015. IBM leveraged its position to push Watson \nLeveraging its data analytics and security business and not passing up a chance to push Watson, IBM’s cognitive computing platform, Rometty suggested that by applying data analytics, the federal government could enhance health insurance programs. Being in a dominant position, the US government could aim to lower the cost of patient care and prescription drugs. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"IBM\",\"AAPL\",\"GOOG\",\"ORCL\",\"MSFT\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"Apple Inc.\",\"Google Inc\",\"Oracle Corporation\",\"Microsoft Corporation\"]} X",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Why Oracle Paid More Than $600 Million for Dyn \nBusiness software titan Oracle paid somewhere between $600 million and $700 million to acquire Dyn , a source close to the deal told Fortune . \nEarlier on Monday, Dan Primack reported that Oracle paid “north of $600 million” for the Manchester, N.H.-based company. Oracle and Dyn announced the deal, without financial details, Monday morning. \nDyn raised under $100 million in funding, making the $600 million low-end estimate a good haul. But Oracle orcl was not the only suitor circling Dyn, which has an outsized presence in making sure thousands of web sites remain accessible. IBM ibm was also interested, according to the source who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak about the purchase. \nOracle and IBM declined comment. Dyn has not responded to a request for comment. Get Data Sheet, Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nDyn offers what are called domain name system (DNS) services. That’s geek speak for what is basically a high-tech directory that ensures that when a user clicks on an Internet address, say http://www.Fortune.com , he or she gets routed through to the more arcane numbered address of the servers that run that site. \nOracle’s acquisition was finalized weeks ago, before the well publicized distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack that overwhelmed Dyn’s systems in late October. That attack, which involved millions of Internet-connected devices sending messages to overwhelm Dyn’s servers, made it impossible for users in big chunks of the country to access Twitter twtr , Netflix nflx , Zendesk zen , Github github , and other popular and corporate web sites for several hours. \nBig public cloud players like Amazon amzn Web Services amzn , Microsoft msft , Google googl , and Rackspace offer their own DNS services, but much of the rest of the world, including many Fortune 500 companies, relies on providers like Dyn, Cloudflare , and Verisign for these services. \n“Big cloud companies that want to compete with Amazon but don’t want to build their own DNS services were all looking at Dyn,” said Fortune’s source. \nGiven that Dyn is now taken, it’s safe to assume that Cloudfare and Verisign are sought after now.

      "text": "Why IBM is tripling its cloud data center capacity in the UK November 21, 2016 | Written by: Sebastian Krause \nCategorized: Infrastructure \nThe need for cloud data centers in Europe continues to grow. \nUK cloud adoption rates have increased to 84 percent over the last five years, according to Cloud Industry Forum . \nThat’s why I am thrilled to announce a major expansion of IBM UK cloud data centers , tripling the capacity in the United Kingdom to meet this growing customer demand. The investment expands the number of IBM cloud data centers in the country from two to six. \nIt is the largest commitment IBM Cloud has made to one country at one time. Expanding the cloud data center foot print in UK that has started over five years ago, IBM will have more UK data centers than any other vendor. Meeting demand in highly regulated industries \nHighly regulated industries, such as the public sector and financial services, have nuanced and sensitive infrastructure and security needs. \nThe UK government’s Digital Transformation Plan to boost productivity has put digital technologies at the heart of the UK’s economic future. \nThe Government Digital Service (GDS) leading the digital transformation of government, runs GOV.UK , helping millions of people find the government services and information they need every day. To make public services simpler, better and safer, the UK’s national infrastructure and digital services require innovative solutions, strong cyber security defenses and high availability platforms. Cloud computing is thus essential to embrace the digital intelligence that will deliver outstanding services to UK citizens. \nIn response, IBM is further building out its capabilities through its partnership with Ark Data Centres, the majority owner in a joint venture with the UK government. Together, we’re delivering public data center services that are already being used at scale by high-profile, public-sector agencies. It is all about choice \nThe IBM point of view is to design a cloud that brings greater flexibility, transparency and control over how clients manage data, run businesses and deploy IT operations. \nHybrid is the reality of cloud migration. Clients don’t want to move everything to the public cloud or keep everything in the private cloud. They want to have a choice. \nFor example, IBM offers the opportunity to keep data local in client locations to those enterprises with fears about data residency and compliance with regulations for migration of sensitive workloads. Data locality is certainly a factor for European businesses, but even more businesses want the ability to move existing workloads to the cloud and provide cognitive tools and services that allow them to fuel new cloud innovations. From cost savings to innovation platform \nData is the game changer in cloud. \nIBM is optimizing its cloud for data and analytics, infused with services including Watson, blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) so that clients can take advantage of higher-value services in the cloud. This is not just about storage and compute. If clients can’t analyze and gain deeper insights from the data they have in the cloud, they are not using cloud technology to its full potential. \nBesides, our customers are focusing more and more on value creation and innovation. That’s why travel innovators are adopting IBM Cloud, fueled by Watson’s cognitive intelligence, to transform interactions with customers and speed the delivery of new services. \nThomson, part of TUI UK & Ireland, one of the UK’s largest travel operators, taps into one of IBM’s UK cloud data centers to run its new tool developed in IBM’s London Bluemix Garage. The app uses Watson APIs such as Conversation, Natural Language Classifier and Elasticsearch on Bluemix to enable customers to receive holiday destination matches based on natural language requests like “I want to visit local markets” or “I want to see exotic animals.” \nOther major brands, including Dixons Carphone , National Express , National Grid , Shop Direct , Travis Perkins PLC , Wimbledon , Finnair , EVRY and Lufthansa , are entrusting IBM Cloud to transform their business to create more seamless, personalized experiences for customers and accelerate their digital transformation. \nBy the end of 2017, IBM will have 16 fully operational cloud data centers across Europe, representing the largest and most comprehensive European cloud data center network. Overall, IBM has now the largest cloud data center footprint globally with more than 50. \nThese new IBM Cloud data centers will help businesses in industries such as retail, banking, government and healthcare meet customer needs.

      "text": "Ton Ngo / @tango245 / November 21, 2016 / 0 comments \nIf you have installed OpenStack manually, you would have gone through a long sequence of installing and configuring various services and drivers. In every case, these services and drivers run as processes on hosts designated as controllers, compute nodes, etc. When containers became a topic of interest to the community about two years ago, it quickly became apparent that these processes can easily be wrapped in containers. There are several benefits for containerizing the OpenStack services: \n1. Filesystem isolation: required packages can be installed freely without modifying the base host and potentially impacting other services. This provides a clean way to add and remove services. \n2. Simplified management: common way to start, suspend, stop containers. \n3. Easier upgrading and packaging. \nFast forward to the present, there are now several projects that deploy OpenStack cloud where all its services run in containers, and development is continuing to push OpenStack further onto the container platform. In this blog, we will take a quick look at some key aspects of two projects: OpenStack Ansible (OSA) and Kolla. I will take the perspective of a user installing OpenStack, so this is not intended to be an exhaustive comparison of the two projects, although there may be useful information if you are trying to choose between the two. Please refer to the documents of these projects for the actual instructions on using OSA or Kolla . \nFirst, what are the common themes between OSA and Kolla? All OpenStack services and drivers run in containers. But the containers themselves still need to be deployed onto the hosts by some mechanism. Both OSA and Kolla use Ansible to deploy and manage the containers. To give users a quick way to evaluate the tool, both OSA and Kolla provide an all-in-one installation: the full OpenStack is installed onto one server, similar to DevStack. Both assume the hosts to be prepared with certain prerequisites for the containers to work. The prerequisites are documented and there are some utilities to help prepare the hosts, but I found it does take some experimentation to sort out the details and get the environment to the correct starting state. For instance, OSA assumes that a set of network bridges with specific names exists for the containers to connect to. \nWhat are the differences? The key difference is in the container technology being used, and this in turn leads to other differences. OSA deploys LXC containers, while Kolla uses Docker containers. Compared to LXC, Docker provides a rich set of utilities to manage its containers, a reason behind its popularity. Kolla leverages these advantages by packaging particular versions of the services into Docker images. Official release versions are available on Docker Hub, or you can build your own. \nOSA, on the other hand, creates the containers but treats them more or less as a VM: a private repo is created to serve the installation packages of a particular version of OpenStack, then the LXC containers are created and the software are installed onto the containers. \nSince Kolla images are fully pre-built, they are faster to deploy. For an environment of around 100 nodes, Kolla has been reported to install OpenStack in less than 30 minutes, while OSA would take about a day since it would go through the actual installation of the software. \nThe layering in Docker images also allows for Kolla to support more distros than OSA: Kolla can install onto Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL and OracleLinux while OSA only supports Ubuntu. \nOSA, on the other hand, does derive some benefits for being fully based on Ansible. If the dev-op team is fluent in Ansible, then OSA can be very appealing. When a user needs to troubleshoot a problem, understand the steps being done, or make some customization, the playbooks are readily available on the system. In this respect, OSA does offer more flexibility in configuring and managing the cloud. \nWhat’s next for OpenStack in containers? Currently Ansible is used to deploy and manage the containers. However, container platform such as Kubernetes offers a rich set of functionality to manage containers, so the natural question is whether it makes sense to let Kubernetes manages the OpenStack containers themselves. Although this may seem convoluted, there are benefits to this approach. Kubernetes can ensure high availability of the containers, and can provide rolling upgrade of OpenStack services. However, one gap to be filled is that Kubernetes’ descriptor for container is not quite an orchestration language since it does not describe dependencies to express a sequence of actions. This functionality will need to be provided elsewhere. \nKolla is embarking on this development in the Ocata release: running OpenStack within Kubernetes.

      "text": "Global IT group IBM will triple the number of its cloud data centers in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union. IBM said it would build four new data centers to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. IBM Europe’s general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing.\n“UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,” he said in an interview. IBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June “Brexit” vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. “Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,” he said. Tech bosses have been balancing Britain’s enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fueled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country’s future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. Companies including Google and Facebook have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they’ve emphasized the importance of being able to attract the best people.\nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centers to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. Brexit also creates uncertainty about Britain’s future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. Krause, however, said IBM was “well-equipped” for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centers in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future.\nReuters \nThe post IBM invests in UK data centres, joining tech sector in defying Brexit worries appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Home > Technology IBM invests in UK data centres as tech sector defies Brexit worries Global IT group IBM will triple the number of its cloud data centres in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union. PHOTO: REUTERS Nov 22, 2016 8:17 AM \n[LONDON] Global IT group IBM will triple the number of its cloud data centres in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union. \nIBM said it would build four new data centres to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. \nIBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. \n\"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview. \nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. \n\"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said. \nTech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fuelled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. \nCompanies including Google and Facebook have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasised the importance of being able to attract the best people. \nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centres to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. \nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. \nMr Krause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centres in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future. \nREUTERS ",

      "text": "Related resources \nLONDON, UK - 22 Nov 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced that it is adding four new cloud data centers infused with cognitive intelligence in the UK, to keep pace with growing client demand. The investment in the new facilities underscores IBM's long-standing commitment to providing innovative solutions to the UK market and triples its cloud center capacity in the UK. \"We are already among the most digitally connected countries in the world, with a globally successful digital economy worth more than £118billion a year and strong cyber security defences to protect consumers and business,” said Matt Hancock, Minister of State for Digital and Culture. \"Today's announcement by IBM is a further boost for this thriving area, and another vote of confidence which shows Britain is open for business. These new cloud data centers will help our firms work smarter and quicker to become the world-leading businesses of tomorrow.\" \nCloud adoption rates increased to 84% in the UK over the course of the last five years, according to Cloud Industry Forum . IDC forecasts that the global market opportunity for public cloud services will exceed $195 billion by 2020. [1] The expansion strengthens IBM’s ability to bring clients greater flexibility, transparency and control over how they manage data, run their businesses and deploy IT operations locally in the cloud. \nThese new facilities expand IBM's cloud data center footprint from two to six in the UK and 16 across Europe as part of IBM’s network of more than 50 data centers worldwide. With these new data centers, clients have access to a complete portfolio of IBM cloud services for running their mission critical enterprise workloads and innovations through more than 150 digital services (APIs). These digital services are available via IBM's development platform, Bluemix and include Watson, IBM's cognitive intelligence technology that allows computers to think and learn like humans, building blocks for innovative Blockchain applications that increase trust in transactions, plus enabling technologies for Internet of Things (IoT) and analytics applications. \nThomson, part of TUI UK & Ireland, the UK’s largest tour operator, is trialling a new travel search tool, which leverages Watson cognitive services on the IBM Cloud with its customers giving them the opportunity to find travel inspiration by interacting with the virtual travel assistant. The tool is a smart chatbot that interacts with consumers to provide real-time search results on travel destinations and holiday inquiries, such as \"I want to visit local markets/ go on an adventure/ have a cultured holiday/ see exotic animals\". Thomson is tapping into IBM's Cloud data center in the UK and leverages Watson APIs such as conversation, natural language classifier and speech-to-text. The experimental website gains insights and learns from data via frequent requests to provide more digital intelligence that matches customer requirements. \n\"By leveraging IBM's Cloud platform with Watson's cognitive intelligence we have raised the bar in the travel industry and delivered an interactive website to our digitally savvy customers in a fun and innovative way. We are excited to learn how customers interact and what they get out of the experience,\" said Jo Hickson, Head of Innovation , TUI UK&I. \nIBM Cloud Expands Capabilities for Highly Regulated Industries in the UK and EU \nIBM was first to offer cloud services to clients in the UK through an existing Cloud data center more than five years ago, which was swiftly followed by a second UK Cloud data center in 2014. IBM was recently cited as a \"strong performer\" in Forrester's latest Wave Report on global public cloud platforms in Europe. IBM also earned the highest possible score for its hybrid cloud strategy as well as the top ranking for IBM’s infrastructure services. [2] \n\"By adding four new Cloud data centers in the UK, IBM is giving local businesses an easy route to the cloud, helping them quickly innovate and respond to market demands,” said Robert LeBlanc, senior vice president of IBM Cloud. \"IBM is continuing to invest in high growth areas, offering clients higher-value cloud data services such as Watson and Blockchain running on our cloud infrastructure that delivers world-class scalability, performance and security.\" \nIBM client Armakuni, a provider to financial services and fintech, commented: “Data security and residency are two key concerns when considering use of cloud services in financial services. IBM's investment and expansion of their cloud data center footprint in the UK goes a long way to address these concerns and enables us to better serve UK customers securely.” \nIBM also signed an agreement to lease space within Ark Data Centres in the UK, which will see the second of the four new cloud data centers fully operational in mid-2017. Ark is the joint venture partner with the UK Government delivering public sector data center services under the Crown Hosting Framework. Crown Hosting, based in the same Ark facility, is already being used by a number of public sector departments and agencies. \nIBM Cloud: A Focus on Quality, Performance, Innovation and Choice \nClients choosing IBM Cloud services will benefit from the company's experience across public, private and hybrid cloud deployments and easy access to cloud innovations on a simple pay-as-you-go model. Clients also benefit from services like load balancing, auto scaling, object storage, bandwidth pooling and Static IPs that are resilient across the cloud data centers in the UK. From migrating existing workloads to the cloud for the first time to supporting advanced applications that draw on High Performance Computing and cognitive technologies, IBM Cloud data centers are distinct in several ways: Modern Infrastructure: The new facilities are designed to provide users with the largest portfolio and pool of bare metal servers in the market delivering up to an 8X performance increase on database applications. This design also means clients can mix infrastructure resources, including bare metal servers, virtual servers, storage, and networking, to find the right balance for their workloads. These facilities will also offer users the latest IBM POWER and x86 processors, NVIDIA GPU accelerators, OpenPOWER-based servers, SAP HANA applications and IBM Bluemix development tools. Enhanced Network Performance: All IBM Cloud data centers connect to a global backbone network that enables seamless data transfer, lower latency, and more consistent network performance between cloud infrastructure and end users around the world. With this innovative network foundation, high-bandwidth apps and services like video streaming, database querying and HPC applications perform at their best. Next-Generation Data Center Capabilities: Clients using these facilities will also have access to IBM Watson, Blockchain, IoT and other leading cloud-based services through more than 150 open APIs. IBM provides a complete stack of cloud services with IaaS, PaaS and SaaS capabilities that can be accessed. \nThe new facilities provide clients greater flexibility, transparency and control over how they manage data, run business operations and deploy IT operations locally in the cloud. The facilities also connect to IBM’s public data centers around the world to help clients transfer and replicate their data in multiple locations and quickly balance or reroute workloads between multiple locations. \nUK Clients Already Benefitting from IBM Cloud \nHundreds of UK clients of all sizes are already taking advantage of the benefits IBM Cloud offers including Dixons Carphone , National Express , National Grid , Shop Direct , Travis Perkins PLC and Wimbledon . \nDixons Carphone , Europe’s largest telecommunications retailer, migrated to IBM Cloud to integrate two distinct infrastructures following its 2014 merger, and enable easy scaling to better manage seasonal shopping trends. \"One of the biggest IT challenges in the retail industry is performance, reliability and rapid scalability to manage the peaks and valleys of seasonal shopping trends. IBM's investment and expansion in the UK provides us with an even more seamless ecommerce and retail experience for our customers during these busy retail periods including holidays and new product launches,\" said David Hennessy, IT Director, Dixons Carphone. \nIBM’s Global Cloud Footprint \nWith more than 50 global cloud data centers, IBM helps companies securely manage and gain insight into their data no matter where it resides. The news also reinforces IBM strong cloud presence across Europe, and the additional facilities announced today uniquely position IBM as the market leader with more UK data centers than any other vendor. In September, IBM announced the opening of its first cloud data center in the Nordics. The addition of the new UK data center facilities will mark 16 IBM data centers across Europe. \nThe new UK facilities will enable companies of all sizes to digitize business and operations and drive innovation through the IBM Cloud. The first facility will open in Fareham at the end of December, with three more opening in the UK next year. \nAbout IBM Cloud: \nFor more information, visit: http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing . \n[1] IDC Worldwide Semiannual Public Cloud Services Spending Guide, 10 th August 2016 \n[2] The Forrester Wave: Enterprise Public Cloud Platforms in Europe, Q4 2016 Contact(s) information",

      "text": "An open letter to my boss, IBM CEO Ms. Ginni Rometty Dear Ms. Rometty, My name is Elizabeth Wood and I am a senior content strategist within the IBM corporate marketing department, based in New York City. I have worked hard to get to this stage in my career, and have been a valued member of my team at IBM. However, I have chosen to resign, as I can no longer contribute to an organization that would ignore the real needs of its workforce. Last Tuesday, you shared with the world your open letter to president-elect Donald Trump, outlining ways for his administration’s success to conveniently dovetail with that of IBM products. Your letter offered the backing of IBM’s global workforce in support of his agenda that preys on marginalized people and threatens my well-being as a woman, a Latina and a concerned citizen. The company’s hurry to do this was a tacit endorsement of his position, and has signaled to me something very important about IBM’s values: a willingness to legitimize threats to our country for financial gain. The president-elect has demonstrated contempt for immigrants, veterans, people with disabilities, Black, Latinx, Jewish, Muslim and LGBTQ communities. These groups comprise a growing portion of the company you lead, Ms. Rometty. They work every day for IBM’s success and have been silenced by your words. As a female CEO at a Fortune 500 company, you are in a painfully small club. There is no doubt that you have faced many obstacles to get to where you are now, including from men like president-elect Trump. Why not be clear that his words and actions are unacceptable? For example, take Pespico, Inc. CEO Indra K. Nooyi who publicly remarked in response to his despicable conduct , “Forget about the Pepsi brand. How dare we talk about women that way?” A look at IBM recruitment collateral suggests that the future of the company hinges on realizing an inclusive and welcoming culture, though you do not communicate this vision within the many pages of your letter to a man who will soon be in the top office of the United States government. There have been days of protest across the country. Students everywhere — future IBMers — are marching out of their high schools and colleges to express their outrage. The spike in hate crimes that has erupted across this country since the election emphasizes what a disservice to your workforce it is to ignore their safety. When the president-elect follows through on his repeated threats to create a public database of Muslims, what will IBM do? Your letter neglects to mention. The choice to leave IBM did not come lightly. I am not leaving for another offer, nor do I have a safety net to fall back on. What I do have is the knowledge that my own life — and those of the several hundred thousand that serve your company worldwide — are too valuable to waste at an organization where we are not respected. It is my belief that you owe your staff and the president-elect a public clarification on IBM’s commitment to the protection and representation of all of its employees. Sincerely,",

      "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Global IT group IBM <IBM.N> will triple the number of its cloud data centers in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union. IBM said it would build four new data centers to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud.\nIBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing.\n\"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview.\nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision.\n\"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said.\nTech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fueled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc.\nCompanies including Google <GOOGL.O> and Facebook <FB.O> have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasized the importance of being able to attract the best people.\nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centers to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment.\nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled.\nKrause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centers in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future.\n\n(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Mark Potter)",

They will be used to provide UK enterprises with local access to the company’s entire cloud portfolio, which includes its Softlayer Infrastructure as a Service offering and its Bluemix app development platform. \nSpeaking to Computer Weekly, Helen Kelisky, vice-president of cloud at IBM UK and Ireland, said its UK datacentre investments are geared towards satisfying the soaring enterprise demand the company is seeing for both traditional and more innovative cloud services. \n“We can see the demand for cloud is soaring,” she said. “IDC said the global cloud market in 2015 was worth $70bn, and is predicting it will reach $195bn by 2020. IDC is saying it, but we are seeing it. \n“Our decision to invest in the UK is based on the surge in customer demand we are seeing. We recognised it a number of years ago [with our first UK datacentres], which is why we have been here a long time.” \nIn reference to the surge in demand for IBM is seeing, she said the cloud needs of enterprises are expanding beyond “traditional” hosting and infrastructure services, whereby moving to cloud is solely viewed as a means of cutting IT costs. Read more about UK datacentre builds Google has revealed the next wave of work to increase the enterprise-readiness of its cloud platform, including opening its first UK datacentre region. \n“Data and innovation is where IBM sees the cloud market going, so it is broadening out from cost savings to services that can give companies real differentiation and allow our clients to use cloud for growth,” she said. \n“Our cloud platform is helping clients have their data where they want it. Then there are the services that go on top of that, which we are driving around Blockchain, Watson and the internet of things.” \nKelisky cites UK-based tour operator Thomson as an example of a company drawing on IBM Watson’s cloud capabilities to help its customers find holidays that more closely match their requirements by using a real-time, chatbot-based search tool. \n“The application is based on Bluemix, and was developed in our Bluemix garage in London,” she said. “It uses Watson APIs, including conversation and natural language classifiers, to allow customers to receive holiday destination matches based on natural language requests.” Location, location, location \nThe first of these two datacentres will be in Fareham, near Portsmouth. The second is due to come online in mid-2017, and will be located at Ark Data Centres’ facility in Farnborough. \n“Ark have their joint venture with the Cabinet Office, Crown Hosting , in Farnborough,” said Kelisky. “We are building Softlayer in a datacentre next door, and we will be going to market together with Ark.” \nThe arrangement should help reinforce IBM’s standing among public sector cloud users, with the company set to draw on Ark’s network resources to secure deals. \n“The key thing for us is the networks, as Ark has access to N3 for health, PSN and Janet for education, and we will be right there plugging into those,” she said. \nThe remaining two sites will also be in the south-east of England, IBM confirmed, with confirmation of their locations due in 2017.

      "text": "IBM to add four new cloud data centres infused with cognitive intelligence in the UK The move will help IBM keep up with growing client demand. By Kedar Grandhi November 22, 2016 04:22 GMT The move by IBM will further strengthen its ability to help clients manage their data with greater flexibility, transparency and control Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images \nIBM, in an effort to keep up with growing client demand, will add four new cloud data centres in the UK, the American technology company announced on Tuesday. These centres will be infused with cognitive intelligence, which allows computers to think and learn like humans, IBM added. \nThis multi-million pound investment will triple IBM's cloud data centre footprint to six in the UK and a total of 16 in Europe. \nThe move will help IBM's clients gain access to its complete portfolio of cloud services to run both their mission critical enterprise workloads and innovations. It will further strengthen the American firm's ability to help clients manage their data with greater flexibility, transparency and control. \n\"By adding four new Cloud data centers in the UK, IBM is giving local businesses an easy route to the cloud, helping them quickly innovate and respond to market demands...IBM is continuing to invest in high growth areas, offering clients higher-value cloud data services such as Watson and Blockchain running on our cloud infrastructure that delivers world-class scalability, performance and security,\" Robert LeBlanc, SVP of IBM Cloud, was quoted as saying in a company statement. \nThis comes just a day after Facebook announced its plans to expand its presence in the UK. The American social media giant had said it will hire 500 additional employees at its new London headquarters, which will open in 2017. \nSuch announcements are expected to support British Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts in sending out the message that the UK will remain open for business even after it leaves the European Union. \nCommenting on the IBM move, Matt Hancock, Minister of State for Digital and Culture said, \"We are already among the most digitally connected countries in the world, with a globally successful digital economy worth more than £118bn [$147.51bn] a year and strong cyber security defences to protect consumers and business...Today's announcement by IBM is a further boost for this thriving area, and another vote of confidence which shows Britain is open for business. These new cloud data centers will help our firms work smarter and quicker to become the world-leading businesses of tomorrow.\" More from IBTimes UK ",

      "text": "IBM invests in UK data centers as tech sector defies Brexit worries A woman passes by the IBM offices in New York. Photo: Reuters Tweet Published: 8:20 AM, November 22, 2016 \nLONDON - Global IT group IBM <IBM.N> will triple the number of its cloud data centers in Britain, it said on Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in investing in the UK after its vote to leave the European Union. \nIBM said it would build four new data centers to meet demand from its corporate and public sector clients who were increasingly storing data and managing their businesses in the cloud. \nIBM Europe's general manger for cloud services, Sebastian Krause, said the investment reflected the strength of the UK economy and the size of the opportunity in cloud computing. \n\"UK customers truly understand the capabilities of cloud to drive innovation, to be more flexible on their business model, to have better insight for decision making, and to deliver better customer service,\" he said in an interview. \nIBM had evaluated its cloud capacity in Britain before the June \"Brexit\" vote, he said, but it saw no reason to change course as a result of the decision. \n\"Everyone has concluded the UK economy will continue to be very strong and there will be significant opportunities with or without Brexit,\" he said. \nTech bosses have been balancing Britain's enthusiasm for technology and a deep pool of talent, fueled by world class universities, against the uncertainty of the country's future relationship with the European Union, and in particular the ability to attract workers from across the trading bloc. \nCompanies including Google <GOOGL.O> and Facebook <FB.O> have decided the advantages outweigh the risks, but they've emphasized the importance of being able to attract the best people. \nIBM said its footprint in Britain would increase from two data centers to six, serving customers such as travel group Thomson, which is owned by TUI, retailers Boots and Dixons Carphone, and National Grid, as well as the government. It did not disclose the size of the investment. \nBrexit also creates uncertainty about Britain's future compliance with European data protection rules, which have recently been overhauled. \nKrause, however, said IBM was \"well-equipped\" for any post-Brexit scenario, and it had 10 data centers in continental Europe that it could also use if Britain did not adhere to any European standards in the future.

Apple is offering free battery replacements because some iPhone 6s handsets are randomly shutting down. The company said that only a \"very small number\" of devices are affected. \n2. Tesla's acquisition of SolarCity has closed. Shareholders voted in favor of the acquisition last Thursday, with more than 85% of Tesla shares voted in favor. \n3. Apple is killing its line of routers. The engineers who formerly worked on the AirPort Extreme, Airport Express, and AirPort Time Capsule have been moved to other products. \n4. Oracle is going to buy Dyn. Dyn monitors internet traffic, and it was recently hit by a cyber-attack that took many sites offline. \n5. Snapchat's Spectacles are now on sale in New York City. The latest vending machine is located inside a pop-up shop at 5 East 59th Street, near Central Park in Manhattan.",

      "text": " IBM\n- Move aims to meet growing client demand for digital transformation and cognitive intelligence\n- Investment expands IBM Cloud data centers to six in UK; 16 total across Europe making it one of the most comprehensive cloud networks for delivering cloud services\n- The UK's largest travel operator, Thomson, taps into Watson cognitive services on the IBM Cloud to transform consumer interactions\nLONDON , Nov. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced that it is adding four new cloud data centers infused with cognitive intelligence in the UK, to keep pace with growing client demand. The investment in the new facilities underscores IBM's long-standing commitment to providing innovative solutions to the UK market and triples its cloud center capacity in the UK.\n\"We are already among the most digitally connected countries in the world, with a globally successful digital economy worth more than £118billion a year and strong cyber security defences to protect consumers and business,\" said Matt Hancock , Minister of State for Digital and Culture. \"Today's announcement by IBM is a further boost for this thriving area, and another vote of confidence which shows Britain is open for business. These new cloud data centers will help our firms work smarter and quicker to become the world-leading businesses of tomorrow.\"\nCloud adoption rates increased to 84% in the UK over the course of the last five years, according to Cloud Industry Forum . IDC forecasts that the global market opportunity for public cloud services will exceed $195 billion by 2020. 1 The expansion strengthens IBM's ability to bring clients greater flexibility, transparency and control over how they manage data, run their businesses and deploy IT operations locally in the cloud.\nThese new facilities expand IBM's cloud data center footprint from two to six in the UK and 16 across Europe as part of IBM's network of more than 50 data centers worldwide. With these new data centers, clients have access to a complete portfolio of IBM cloud services for running their mission critical enterprise workloads and innovations through more than 150 digital services (APIs). These digital services are available via IBM's development platform, Bluemix and include Watson, IBM's cognitive intelligence technology that allows computers to think and learn like humans, building blocks for innovative Blockchain applications that increase trust in transactions, plus enabling technologies for Internet of Things (IoT) and analytics applications.\nThomson, part of TUI UK & Ireland , the UK's largest tour operator, is trialling a new travel search tool, which leverages Watson cognitive services on the IBM Cloud with its customers giving them the opportunity to find travel inspiration by interacting with the virtual travel assistant. The tool is a smart chatbot that interacts with consumers to provide real-time search results on travel destinations and holiday inquiries, such as \"I want to visit local markets/ go on an adventure/ have a cultured holiday/ see exotic animals\". Thomson is tapping into IBM's Cloud data center in the UK and leverages Watson APIs such as conversation, natural language classifier and speech-to-text. The experimental website gains insights and learns from data via frequent requests to provide more digital intelligence that matches customer requirements.\n\"By leveraging IBM's Cloud platform with Watson's cognitive intelligence we have raised the bar in the travel industry and delivered an interactive website to our digitally savvy customers in a fun and innovative way. We are excited to learn how customers interact and what they get out of the experience,\" said Jo Hickson , Head of Innovation, TUI UK&I.\nIBM Cloud Expands Capabilities for Highly Regulated Industries in the UK and EU\nIBM was first to offer cloud services to clients in the UK through an existing Cloud data center more than five years ago, which was swiftly followed by a second UK Cloud data center in 2014. IBM was recently cited as a \"strong performer\" in Forrester's latest Wave Report on global public cloud platforms in Europe . IBM also earned the highest possible score for its hybrid cloud strategy as well as the top ranking for IBM's infrastructure services. 2\n\"By adding four new Cloud data centers in the UK, IBM is giving local businesses an easy route to the cloud, helping them quickly innovate and respond to market demands,\" said Robert LeBlanc , senior vice president of IBM Cloud. \"IBM is continuing to invest in high growth areas, offering clients higher-value cloud data services such as Watson and Blockchain running on our cloud infrastructure that delivers world-class scalability, performance and security.\"\nIBM client Armakuni, a provider to financial services and fintech, commented: \"Data security and residency are two key concerns when considering use of cloud services in financial services. IBM's investment and expansion of their cloud data center footprint in the UK goes a long way to address these concerns and enables us to better serve UK customers securely.\"\nIBM also signed an agreement to lease space within Ark Data Centres in the UK, which will see the second of the four new cloud data centers fully operational in mid-2017. Ark is the joint venture partner with the UK Government delivering public sector data center services under the Crown Hosting Framework. Crown Hosting, based in the same Ark facility, is already being used by a number of public sector departments and agencies.\nIBM Cloud: A Focus on Quality, Performance, Innovation and Choice\nClients choosing IBM Cloud services will benefit from the company's experience across public, private and hybrid cloud deployments and easy access to cloud innovations on a simple pay-as-you-go model. Clients also benefit from services like load balancing, auto scaling, object storage, bandwidth pooling and Static IPs that are resilient across the cloud data centers in the UK. From migrating existing workloads to the cloud for the first time to supporting advanced applications that draw on High Performance Computing and cognitive technologies, IBM Cloud data centers are distinct in several ways:\nModern Infrastructure: The new facilities are designed to provide users with the largest portfolio and pool of bare metal servers in the market delivering up to an 8X performance increase on database applications. This design also means clients can mix infrastructure resources, including bare metal servers, virtual servers, storage, and networking, to find the right balance for their workloads. These facilities will also offer users the latest IBM POWER and x86 processors, NVIDIA GPU accelerators, OpenPOWER-based servers, SAP HANA applications and IBM Bluemix development tools. Enhanced Network Performance: All IBM Cloud data centers connect to a global backbone network that enables seamless data transfer, lower latency, and more consistent network performance between cloud infrastructure and end users around the world. With this innovative network foundation, high-bandwidth apps and services like video streaming, database querying and HPC applications perform at their best. Next-Generation Data Center Capabilities: Clients using these facilities will also have access to IBM Watson, Blockchain, IoT and other leading cloud-based services through more than 150 open APIs. IBM provides a complete stack of cloud services with IaaS, PaaS and SaaS capabilities that can be accessed. The new facilities provide clients greater flexibility, transparency and control over how they manage data, run business operations and deploy IT operations locally in the cloud. The facilities also connect to IBM's public data centers around the world to help clients transfer and replicate their data in multiple locations and quickly balance or reroute workloads between multiple locations.\nUK Clients Already Benefitting from IBM Cloud\nHundreds of UK clients of all sizes are already taking advantage of the benefits IBM Cloud offers including Dixons Carphone , National Express , National Grid , Shop Direct , Travis Perkins PLC and Wimbledon .\nDixons Carphone , Europe's largest telecommunications retailer, migrated to IBM Cloud to integrate two distinct infrastructures following its 2014 merger, and enable easy scaling to better manage seasonal shopping trends. \"One of the biggest IT challenges in the retail industry is performance, reliability and rapid scalability to manage the peaks and valleys of seasonal shopping trends. IBM's investment and expansion in the UK provides us with an even more seamless ecommerce and retail experience for our customers during these busy retail periods including holidays and new product launches,\" said David Hennessy , IT Director, Dixons Carphone.\nIBM's Global Cloud Footprint\nWith more than 50 global cloud data centers, IBM helps companies securely manage and gain insight into their data no matter where it resides. The news also reinforces IBM strong cloud presence across Europe , and the additional facilities announced today uniquely position IBM as the market leader with more UK data centers than any other vendor. In September, IBM announced the opening of its first cloud data center in the Nordics. The addition of the new UK data center facilities will mark 16 IBM data centers across Europe .\nThe new UK facilities will enable companies of all sizes to digitize business and operations and drive innovation through the IBM Cloud. The first facility will open in Fareham at the end of December, with three more opening in the UK next year.\nAbout IBM Cloud:\nFor more information, visit: http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing .\nMedia Contact\nEmma Bennett\nIBM UKI External Communications Cloud\nE mail - emma.bennett@uk.ibm.com\nMobile - 07976 839109\n1 IDC Worldwide Semiannual Public Cloud Services Spending Guide, 10 th August 2016\n2 The Forrester Wave: Enterprise Public Cloud Platforms in Europe , Q4 2016\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161121/441872-INFO\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161121/441873\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090416/IBMLOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-triples-cloud-data-center-capacity-in-the-uk-300367029.html\n©2016 PR Newswire.

      "text": "Tuesday newspaper round-up: Branson, broadband boost, IBM, Diageo \n22-11-2016 07:03 Tweet Alan Milburn, the former Labour health minister and government social mobility tsar, is at the helm of a new group funded in part by Sir Richard Branson to fight Britain's exit from the European Union. The aim is to bring together disparate pro-European groups behind an explicit campaign to reverse the referendum decision to leave, probably only after the government has revealed the content of its exit terms and the UK economy has reacted. Brussels is proposing to tighten its grip over overseas banks operating in the EU in a tit-for-tat step against the US that will raise costs for big foreign lenders and potentially hurt the City of London after Brexit. The European Commission will unveil provisions on Wednesday that mirror controversial US \"intermediate holding company\" rules that ringfence foreign bank capital. - Financial Times Job security is at a record high with more Britons feeling confident that their employment is here to stay, according to a study from Lloyds Bank. With unemployment at its lowest rate in 11 years and wages growing faster than prices, 82pc of people felt confident in their job security in October, the highest number in the study's five year history. - Telegraph The chancellor will deploy more than ÂŁ1bn to boost broadband speeds for up two million homes and businesses as part of an infrastructure plan to be outlined in the autumn statement. Responding to calls from business for the government to back the digital economy, Philip Hammond will back a ÂŁ400m digital infrastructure fund, which the Treasury expects will be matched by private sector investors. - Guardian IBM has committed to a multi-million pound project to build four new data centres in the UK, the latest in a series of UK investments by major US technology groups. Coming as a boost to the Government ahead of the Autumn Statement, the move will treble IBM's capacity for \"cloud computing\" in the UK. - Telegraph Exports of branded British food and non-alcoholic drinks shot up by nearly 14 per cent in the third quarter after the steep plunge in the pound since the vote to quit the European Union. The Food and Drink Federation said that its latest export figures represented the biggest quarterly export sales it had recorded and built on the second quarter, \"which was in turn the largest [increase] up to that point\". - The Times Christmas deliveries in the UK could be hampered by a shortage in lorry drivers as the pool of workers shrank to its lowest level since records began in 2005, according to recruiters. A lack of truck drivers has long been an issue for UK businesses as the popularity of the profession has decreased among British workers. - Financial Times The Baltic Dry Index, which is seen by many as a leading indicator of the state of the world economy, has surged to its highest level in almost two years. The index measures shipping costs for commodities including iron ore, copper and steel. It is comprised of three-sub indexes that measure different sizes of merchant ships, and is based on a daily survey of agents all over the world. - Telegraph Train companies will only have to provide slow free Wi-Fi for customers despite a government pledge to introduce \"fast, cheap internet connections\" across the rail network. Before the general election, the government announced that all train operators bidding on future franchises and direct contracts in England and Wales would have to include free Wi-Fi as part of their pitches. - Guardian Drinks giant Diageo faces its workers going on strike just four weeks before Christmas after staff voted in favour of industrial action over proposed cuts to their pensions. Members of the GMB Scotland union, which include those working at bottling plants at Leven and Shieldhall and distilleries across the country, backed the walkouts by 63pc and other forms of industrial action by 69.7pc. - Telegraph Hema, the Dutch retail chain referred to as a \"posh Poundland\" , has said it will not raise prices and press ahead with its UK roll-out, despite concerns in certain quarters about the health of the British high street. The Dutch chain opened its seventh shop in Britain on Monday in London's Euston train station and is plotting to open between 15 and 20 stores over the next two years. - Telegraph Flybe is to end its franchise with Loganair for providing services across Scotland after failing to agree terms on a new contract. The airlines had been talking about extending the contract, under which Loganair aircraft flew routes bearing the Flybe logo, but the partnership will end next August. Flybe said that the decision would not have a material impact on profits. - The Times The new boss of Debenhams must wait at least six months before he is granted any performance share plan awards. The retailer's remuneration committee has decided that Sergio Bucher, the former Amazon fashion executive who joined last month, must wait until after first-half results next year before any awards are given. - The Times Related share prices Stock News is provided by Digital Look Corporate Solutions from Sharecast news.

      "text": " IBM\n- Move aims to meet growing client demand for digital transformation and cognitive intelligence\n- Investment expands IBM Cloud data centers to six in UK; 16 total across Europe making it one of the most comprehensive cloud networks for delivering cloud services\n- The UK's largest travel operator, Thomson, taps into Watson cognitive services on the IBM Cloud to transform consumer interactions\nLONDON IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced that it is adding four new cloud data centers infused with cognitive intelligence in the UK, to keep pace with growing client demand. The investment in the new facilities underscores IBM's long-standing commitment to providing innovative solutions to the UK market and triples its cloud center capacity in the UK.\n\"We are already among the most digitally connected countries in the world, with a globally successful digital economy worth more than £118billion a year and strong cyber security defences to protect consumers and business,\" said Matt Hancock , Minister of State for Digital and Culture. \"Today's announcement by IBM is a further boost for this thriving area, and another vote of confidence which shows Britain is open for business. These new cloud data centers will help our firms work smarter and quicker to become the world-leading businesses of tomorrow.\"\nCloud adoption rates increased to 84% in the UK over the course of the last five years, according to Cloud Industry Forum . IDC forecasts that the global market opportunity for public cloud services will exceed $195 billion by 2020. 1 The expansion strengthens IBM's ability to bring clients greater flexibility, transparency and control over how they manage data, run their businesses and deploy IT operations locally in the cloud.\nThese new facilities expand IBM's cloud data center footprint from two to six in the UK and 16 across Europe as part of IBM's network of more than 50 data centers worldwide. With these new data centers, clients have access to a complete portfolio of IBM cloud services for running their mission critical enterprise workloads and innovations through more than 150 digital services (APIs). These digital services are available via IBM's development platform, Bluemix and include Watson, IBM's cognitive intelligence technology that allows computers to think and learn like humans, building blocks for innovative Blockchain applications that increase trust in transactions, plus enabling technologies for Internet of Things (IoT) and analytics applications.\nThomson, part of TUI UK & Ireland , the UK's largest tour operator, is trialling a new travel search tool, which leverages Watson cognitive services on the IBM Cloud with its customers giving them the opportunity to find travel inspiration by interacting with the virtual travel assistant. The tool is a smart chatbot that interacts with consumers to provide real-time search results on travel destinations and holiday inquiries, such as \"I want to visit local markets/ go on an adventure/ have a cultured holiday/ see exotic animals\". Thomson is tapping into IBM's Cloud data center in the UK and leverages Watson APIs such as conversation, natural language classifier and speech-to-text. The experimental website gains insights and learns from data via frequent requests to provide more digital intelligence that matches customer requirements.\n\"By leveraging IBM's Cloud platform with Watson's cognitive intelligence we have raised the bar in the travel industry and delivered an interactive website to our digitally savvy customers in a fun and innovative way. We are excited to learn how customers interact and what they get out of the experience,\" said Jo Hickson , Head of Innovation, TUI UK&I.\nIBM Cloud Expands Capabilities for Highly Regulated Industries in the UK and EU\nIBM was first to offer cloud services to clients in the UK through an existing Cloud data center more than five years ago, which was swiftly followed by a second UK Cloud data center in 2014. IBM was recently cited as a \"strong performer\" in Forrester's latest Wave Report on global public cloud platforms in Europe . IBM also earned the highest possible score for its hybrid cloud strategy as well as the top ranking for IBM's infrastructure services. 2\n\"By adding four new Cloud data centers in the UK, IBM is giving local businesses an easy route to the cloud, helping them quickly innovate and respond to market demands,\" said Robert LeBlanc , senior vice president of IBM Cloud. \"IBM is continuing to invest in high growth areas, offering clients higher-value cloud data services such as Watson and Blockchain running on our cloud infrastructure that delivers world-class scalability, performance and security.\"\nIBM client Armakuni, a provider to financial services and fintech, commented: \"Data security and residency are two key concerns when considering use of cloud services in financial services. IBM's investment and expansion of their cloud data center footprint in the UK goes a long way to address these concerns and enables us to better serve UK customers securely.\"\nIBM also signed an agreement to lease space within Ark Data Centres in the UK, which will see the second of the four new cloud data centers fully operational in mid-2017. Ark is the joint venture partner with the UK Government delivering public sector data center services under the Crown Hosting Framework. Crown Hosting, based in the same Ark facility, is already being used by a number of public sector departments and agencies.\nIBM Cloud: A Focus on Quality, Performance, Innovation and Choice\nClients choosing IBM Cloud services will benefit from the company's experience across public, private and hybrid cloud deployments and easy access to cloud innovations on a simple pay-as-you-go model. Clients also benefit from services like load balancing, auto scaling, object storage, bandwidth pooling and Static IPs that are resilient across the cloud data centers in the UK. From migrating existing workloads to the cloud for the first time to supporting advanced applications that draw on High Performance Computing and cognitive technologies, IBM Cloud data centers are distinct in several ways:\nModern Infrastructure: The new facilities are designed to provide users with the largest portfolio and pool of bare metal servers in the market delivering up to an 8X performance increase on database applications. This design also means clients can mix infrastructure resources, including bare metal servers, virtual servers, storage, and networking, to find the right balance for their workloads. These facilities will also offer users the latest IBM POWER and x86 processors, NVIDIA GPU accelerators, OpenPOWER-based servers, SAP HANA applications and IBM Bluemix development tools. Enhanced Network Performance: All IBM Cloud data centers connect to a global backbone network that enables seamless data transfer, lower latency, and more consistent network performance between cloud infrastructure and end users around the world. With this innovative network foundation, high-bandwidth apps and services like video streaming, database querying and HPC applications perform at their best. Next-Generation Data Center Capabilities: Clients using these facilities will also have access to IBM Watson, Blockchain, IoT and other leading cloud-based services through more than 150 open APIs. IBM provides a complete stack of cloud services with IaaS, PaaS and SaaS capabilities that can be accessed. The new facilities provide clients greater flexibility, transparency and control over how they manage data, run business operations and deploy IT operations locally in the cloud. The facilities also connect to IBM's public data centers around the world to help clients transfer and replicate their data in multiple locations and quickly balance or reroute workloads between multiple locations.\nUK Clients Already Benefitting from IBM Cloud\nHundreds of UK clients of all sizes are already taking advantage of the benefits IBM Cloud offers including Dixons Carphone , National Express , National Grid , Shop Direct , Travis Perkins PLC and Wimbledon .\nDixons Carphone , Europe's largest telecommunications retailer, migrated to IBM Cloud to integrate two distinct infrastructures following its 2014 merger, and enable easy scaling to better manage seasonal shopping trends. \"One of the biggest IT challenges in the retail industry is performance, reliability and rapid scalability to manage the peaks and valleys of seasonal shopping trends. IBM's investment and expansion in the UK provides us with an even more seamless ecommerce and retail experience for our customers during these busy retail periods including holidays and new product launches,\" said David Hennessy , IT Director, Dixons Carphone.\nIBM's Global Cloud Footprint\nWith more than 50 global cloud data centers, IBM helps companies securely manage and gain insight into their data no matter where it resides. The news also reinforces IBM strong cloud presence across Europe , and the additional facilities announced today uniquely position IBM as the market leader with more UK data centers than any other vendor. In September, IBM announced the opening of its first cloud data center in the Nordics. The addition of the new UK data center facilities will mark 16 IBM data centers across Europe .\nThe new UK facilities will enable companies of all sizes to digitize business and operations and drive innovation through the IBM Cloud. The first facility will open in Fareham at the end of December, with three more opening in the UK next year.\nAbout IBM Cloud:\nFor more information, visit: http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing .\nMedia Contact\nEmma Bennett\nIBM UKI External Communications Cloud\nE mail - emma.bennett@uk.ibm.com\nMobile - 07976 839109\n1 IDC Worldwide Semiannual Public Cloud Services Spending Guide, 10 th August 2016\n2 The Forrester Wave: Enterprise Public Cloud Platforms in Europe , Q4 2016\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161121/441872-INFO\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161121/441873\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090416/IBMLOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-triples-cloud-data-center-capacity-in-the-uk-300367029.html\n©2016 PR Newswire.
