      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- In a bid to win European Union antitrust approval of its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., Microsoft has proposed concessions that would allow rival professional social networks access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMicrosoft has offered to allow other professional social networks access to its Outlook add-in program and Outlook APIs (or application programming interface, which allow various programs to communicate with one another) following its merger with LinkedIn, the people said. Some of the rival networks already have access to those Outlook programs, they added.\nThe safeguards would, for example, allow the display of profiles from other sites besides LinkedIn, such as German business professionals' network XING, into an Outlook calendar entry of a meeting between two or more people.\nIn addition, Microsoft has pledged to allow manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the people said. An EU antitrust decision in 2004 condemned Microsoft for bundling products into its Windows software.\nNone of the remedies, however, would offer rivals direct access to LinkedIn's pool of data -- a condition Salesforce.com Inc., which lost to Microsoft in its bid for LinkedIn, has publicly pressed for. However, no outside entity currently has unlimited access to LinkedIn's data trove, people familiar with the matter have said.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's antitrust regulator, has sought comment from rivals after Microsoft submitted the remedies last week.\nThe EU's current deadline to complete the review is set for Dec. 6 but that could be extended if the regulator still has concerns about the deal and decides to open an in-depth investigation.\nThe EU's antitrust authority, which has said it would scrutinize mergers involving large amounts of data more closely, sent out questionnaires to rivals in October posing questions about the rough value of LinkedIn's data and whether rival sites can replicate it.\nMicrosoft has argued that much of the user data on LinkedIn is also found on other social-networking sites, including Facebook Inc., which should therefore also be considered as part of the same market in the EU's review process.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 22, 2016 10:06 ET (15:06 ",

      "text": "BRUSSELS—In a bid to win European Union antitrust approval of its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., Microsoft has proposed concessions that would allow rival professional social networks access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMicrosoft has offered to allow other professional social networks access to its Outlook add-in program and Outlook APIs (or application programming interface, which allow various programs to communicate with one another) following its merger with LinkedIn, the people said. Some of the rival networks already have access to those Outlook programs, they added.\nThe safeguards would, for example, allow the display of profiles from other sites besides LinkedIn, such as German business professionals' network XING, into an Outlook calendar entry of a meeting between two or more people.\nIn addition, Microsoft has pledged to allow manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the people said. An EU antitrust decision in 2004 condemned Microsoft for bundling products into its Windows software.\nNone of the remedies, however, would offer rivals direct access to LinkedIn's pool of data—a condition Salesforce.com Inc., which lost to Microsoft in its bid for LinkedIn, has publicly pressed for. However, no outside entity currently has unlimited access to LinkedIn's data trove, people familiar with the matter have said.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's antitrust regulator, has sought comment from rivals after Microsoft submitted the remedies last week.\nThe EU's current deadline to complete the review is set for Dec. 6 but that could be extended if the regulator still has concerns about the deal and decides to open an in-depth investigation.\nThe EU's antitrust authority, which has said it would scrutinize mergers involving large amounts of data more closely, sent out questionnaires to rivals in October posing questions about the rough value of LinkedIn's data and whether rival sites can replicate it.\nMicrosoft has argued that much of the user data on LinkedIn is also found on other social-networking sites, including Facebook Inc., which should therefore also be considered as part of the same market in the EU's review process.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 22, 2016 08:05 ET (13:05 ",

      "text": "November 22, 2016 0 In a recent interview to Financial Review (Australia), Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has reiterated Microsoft’s focus to find that “most ultimate mobile device”. Microsoft, as per Nadella will not play in the market defined by major Smartphone leaders. \n“We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device,” he said. This is not the first time however that Nadella has talked about bringing something category-defining to the table, when it comes to Phones based on Windows 10 Mobile. In a previous Interview he talked about creating Phone Categories with “some new form, new function, new value added”. We also reported about Terry Myerson talking about Windows 10 Mobile Devices with ARM chips and cellular connectivity. \nHe referred HP Elite X3 as one of the examples of structural innovation pursued by Microsoft. \nReferring to HP’s Elite X3 device, which is part smartphone and part mini Windows PC, Mr Nadella said Microsoft was already present in “structural innovation” in the phone arena, and was focusing on productivity, management and security in mobile. \n“We don’t want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That’s where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,” he said. We have reported via our sources that Surface Phone may not be just another phone but a 3-in-1 form factor device in itself . We recently reported that Microsoft may be have finally found a way to make X86 apps to run on ARM64 Windows 10 Mobile devices. \nWe have reasons to believe that upcoming Snapdragon 830 / 835 processor will have capability to support such level of virtualization. Windows 10 Mobile Redstone 3 will not only bring 64-Bit architecture for Windows 10 Mobile, but will also enable X86-on-ARM64 -Emulator. \nRead our round-up of all the Microsoft Surface Phone leaks, rumors, concepts posted yet.

The company is partnering up with Oculus to enable this feature, which will allow users to play their Xbox One games on the Oculus Rift thanks to Xbox One game streaming. Similar to how game streaming works on Windows 10 PCs, Oculus Rift users will be able to stream games to their headset from their Xbox One. For example, if you are playing Forza Horizon 3 on your Xbox One, you can simply stream it to your Windows 10 PC, where you can connect your Oculus Rift and be able to experience the game on your headset which is pretty neat.\nThis feature comes with three different virtual reality environments: Citadel, Retreat, and Dome — which you’ll presumably be able to switch between depending on the game you are currently playing.\nDeveloping… ",

      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- In a bid to win European Union antitrust approval of its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., Microsoft Corp. has proposed concessions that would allow rival professional social networks access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAfter the merger, the people said, rival networks would have access to Microsoft's Outlook add-ins program -- which allows third-party tools to integrate with Outlook -- and Outlook APIs -- or application programming interface, which allows discrete programs to communicate with one another. Some of the networks already have access to those Outlook programs, they added.\nMicrosoft's Outlook offers email and calendar management.\nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft would allow for the display of profiles from other sites besides LinkedIn, such as German business-professionals network XING, in an Outlook calendar entry of a meeting between two or more people.\nIn addition, Microsoft has pledged to allow computer manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the people said. In an earlier EU review, Microsoft had to take steps after antitrust regulators in 2004 condemned it for bundling products into its Windows software.\nNone of the remedies, however, would offer rivals direct access to LinkedIn's pool of data -- a condition Salesforce.com Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in bidding for LinkedIn, has pressed for publicly. No outside entity currently has unlimited access to LinkedIn's data trove.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June and aims to close the transaction this year. Regulators in the U.S., Canada, and Brazil have cleared the acquisition.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's antitrust regulator, has sought comment from rivals after Microsoft submitted the concessions on the acquisition last week. Following the submission, the EU extended its deadline to Dec. 6 to complete its review of the merger. That could be extended further if the regulator still has concerns about the deal and decides to open an in-depth investigation.\nThe EU's antitrust authority, which has said it would scrutinize mergers involving large amounts of data more closely, sent out questionnaires to rivals in October posing questions about the rough value of LinkedIn's data and whether rival sites can replicate it.\nMicrosoft has argued that much of the user data on LinkedIn is also available on other social-media sites, such as Facebook Inc., and that Facebook in particular should be considered as part of the same market in the EU's review process.\nHowever, Salesforce continues to press for regulatory scrutiny. \"We believe this deal raises significant antitrust and data privacy issues,\" said Burke Norton, Salesforce's chief legal officer.\nMr. Norton wrote in an October blog post that the issue is not whether Microsoft allows other service providers to integrate their offerings with its products and services, but \"the much richer and irreproducible interactivity data, or metadata, to which Microsoft alone will have access.\" Microsoft's exclusive access to that information, Salesforce contends, will confer an unfair advantage over competitors.\n--Rachael King contributed to this article.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 22, 2016 13:28 ET (18:28 ",

      "title": "Microsoft CEO: We're staying in the phone market to create \"the most ultimate mobile device\"",
      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior   @gcaweir · 2 minutes ago with 1 comment \nLast month, Microsoft published its latest earnings report, revealing that quarterly revenue from its phone hardware business had dropped to just $300 million, down from $2.6 billion two years earlier . A few days later, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella acknowledged that the company had unquestionably \"missed the mobile boom\" , but added: \"Our goal now is to make sure we grow new categories.\" \nIn an interview this week, Nadella reiterated the company's commitment to the mobile market, and said that it is now focused on offering something truly unique, rather than trying to compete with more popular rivals on their terms. \nSpeaking with the Australian Financial Review , he said that Microsoft is not afraid to take risks in its efforts to enter new market segments, and perhaps even 'redefine' old ones. \"The key in any momentum we have is that you have to have some amount of boldness in taking risk, and knowing that you are not always going to get it right,\" he said. \nHe referred to Surface to illustrate this point. \"Three years ago, the two-in-one as a form factor was questioned. 'Does anybody need one?'\", he said. \"And now, guess what, even our competition has decided that it's not a refrigerator and a toaster but it's actually a two-in-one.\" \nGiven the seemingly endless rumors that Microsoft is working on a 'Surface phone' , the company's conviction in creating convergent devices seems particularly relevant - and even more so with partners like HP releasing '3-in-1' devices running its Windows 10 Mobile smartphone OS. \nIndeed, Nadella referred to HP's Elite x3 flagship phone as an example of the \"structural innovation\" that Microsoft has brought to the mobile space. High-end Windows 10 Mobile handsets like the Elite x3 include support for Continuum, which allows owners to use a mouse and keyboard with the phone when connected to a larger display, including a desktop-style interface and Start menu. Acer promotes its Windows 10 Mobile flagship as a 'pocket PC' for this reason. \nNadella said that this kind of feature differentiation will be the hallmark of Microsoft's future efforts in the mobile space. According to Gartner, Windows' share of the global smartphone market dropped to just 0.6% this summer , and Microsoft evidently recognizes that it needs to change its approach. \n\"We will continue to be in the phone market, not as defined by today's market leaders,\" Nadella explained, \"but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.\" He added: \nTherefore, we stopped doing things that were me-too and started doing things, even if they are today very sub-scale, to be very focused on a specific set of customers who need a specific set of capabilities that are differentiated and that we can do a good job of. \nOne defining feature on the way to Windows 10 Mobile - and perhaps for the mythical Surface phone - may be the ability to run full desktop applications on handsets. Microsoft is expected to introduce x86 app emulation for Windows 10 Mobile phones in its Redstone 3 update in late 2017.",

      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS--In a bid to win European Union antitrust approval of its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., Microsoft has proposed concessions that would allow rival professional social networks access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMicrosoft has offered to allow other professional social networks access to its Outlook add-in program and Outlook APIs (or application programming interface, which allow various programs to communicate with one another) following its merger with LinkedIn, the people said. Some of the rival networks already have access to those Outlook programs, they added.\nThe safeguards would, for example, allow the display of profiles from other sites besides LinkedIn, such as German business professionals' network XING, into an Outlook calendar entry of a meeting between two or more people.\nIn addition, Microsoft has pledged to allow manufacturers such as Dell Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to disable the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the people said. An EU antitrust decision in 2004 condemned Microsoft for bundling products into its Windows software.\nNone of the remedies, however, would offer rivals direct access to LinkedIn's pool of data--a condition Salesforce.com Inc., which lost to Microsoft in its bid for LinkedIn, has publicly pressed for. However, no outside entity currently has unlimited access to LinkedIn's data trove, people familiar with the matter have said.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's antitrust regulator, has sought comment from rivals after Microsoft submitted the remedies last week.\nThe EU's current deadline to complete the review is set for Dec. 6 but that could be extended if the regulator still has concerns about the deal and decides to open an in-depth investigation.\nThe EU's antitrust authority, which has said it would scrutinize mergers involving large amounts of data more closely, sent out questionnaires to rivals in October posing questions about the rough value of LinkedIn's data and whether rival sites can replicate it.\nMicrosoft has argued that much of the user data on LinkedIn is also found on other social-networking sites, including Facebook Inc., which should therefore also be considered as part of the same market in the EU's review process.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 07:32 ET (12:32 ",

      "text": "Microsoft's dream of making Windows a major player on smartphones is all but dead, with 1% overall market share.\nTellingly, even top executives are signaling that the company is treating Windows 10 Mobile as more of an academic exercise than a serious product.\nAnd yet, a new report from ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley indicates that Microsoft could yet have something up its sleeve: Microsoft is said to be working on a project, to be finished by late 2017, that would let full versions of Windows software run on an ARM processor — the same processors used in the vast majority of smartphones. \nThis report just adds fuel to the idea that Microsoft is still secretly hard at work on the Surface Phone , the long-rumored device that the company had previously hinted would be a serious contender with Apple's ubiquitous iPhone . \nTo understand why, it helps to know a little history.\nContinuum Windows 10 Mobile's flagship feature is what Microsoft calls \"Continuum.\" \nBasically, you can plug certain Windows phones like the Microsoft Lumia 950 or HP Elite x3 into a display, attach a mouse and keyboard, and use it like a computer. It works, but it's limited to a very few specially-designed apps from Microsoft's anemic Windows Store app market, including the mobile versions of Microsoft Office. \nAccording to various reports and industry whispers over the last year or so, the Surface Phone's breakthrough feature would be the ability to run any piece of Windows software while in that PC-like Continuum mode.\nThat would be a huge deal for large businesses, where the majority of work still gets done on PC software, rather than apps. Given Microsoft's well-documented ability to sell to those same big customers, it would indeed be a competitive threat with the iPhone, at least among professionals.\nGetty Images/Andrew Burton \nBut it's much easier said than done. Smartphones largely use ARM processors, which balance power consumption with performance. Even Apple moved to ARM for its latest MacBook laptops. \nThe problem is that Windows for PC, and thus Windows PC software, is designed to run on Intel's trademark x86 processor architecture, only. And facing competitive pressure from ARM and Qualcomm, Intel scuttled plans to build its next major smartphone chip, seemingly sinking the Surface Phone before it was even officially announced .\nEmulation What Microsoft is reportedly building is the next-best thing to an Intel-powered phone, given the circumstances.\nIn technical parlance, what Microsoft is said to be building is an \"emulator;\" essentially a way to trick a gadget into thinking it's another gadget. It's similar technology to what Nintendo is using with the NES Classic to get old games to run perfectly on a smaller, more modern console.\nThis emulator would essentially \"trick\" Windows software into thinking it's running on an Intel processor, even if it's actually running on an ARM-powered smartphone.\nGetty Images/Andrew Burton \nThe traditional drawback with emulation is power consumption, since it takes way more processor resources to run software in emulation than it would if it were running as a proper app on that device. It's one thing to run NES games from the eighties in emulation; it's another entirely to use powerful enterprise software, and it would drain any phone's battery in a heartbeat.\nBut, as Ars Technica's Peter Bright points out , that's not such a huge deal if you're using the hypothetical Surface Phone in Continuum mode, since you'll probably be plugged into the wall anyway.\nThe Surface Phone still isn't a sure thing, especially given Microsoft's recent trepidation to talk about any kinds of plans for mobile. From a technology perspective, though, it seems that things are slowly but surely starting to come together, if and when Microsoft decides to take what could well be its last shot at mobile dominance.\nMicrosoft declined to comment.\nNOW WATCH: Here's what it's like to use Microsoft's new Paint 3D \n",

Some even claimed that this device might show up at the company's Surface event last month. As it turns out, it doesn't seem to be a device at all, according to a tweet from Microsoft tipster WalkingCat . \nHomeHub is meant to be a family-centric feature, which will allow users to access certain parts of the OS without having to log in. These would include things like music, lists, calendar, and more. The name is apt, as it would be a sort of hub for everyone in the home, rather than just allowing for personal accounts that are targeted at individual usage. lol, apparently HomeHub is a family oriented feature of Windows 10 PC, called \"Family Desktop\", basically a shared account pic.twitter.com/kkEJalD1Tq — WalkingCat (@h0x0d) November 22, 2016 \nSo instead of it being hardware, it's a feature of the software. Since it's coming to Windows 10 for PCs and we've heard about HomeHub for some time, it sounds like it might show up in the Creators Update, which is slated for release in early 2017 . Tags",

      "text": "Microsoft Azure \nA common step when registering your account is to set up a pull zone or distribution . A pull zone or distribution is used by the CDN as a bucket for your everyday support files. It will automatically pull the data from a location that you specify upon the first request for the file. The files are served to the end user from either a subdomain of your CDN of choice or a custom domain (sub domain) of your choice that points to the CDN. The data in the bucket is automatically purged from the server after a customizable amount of time. Step 2: Create your CDN URL \nYour CDN URL is the URL all of your assets will point to once things have been set up. A good rule of thumb is to use a URL name that is easy to do a search and replace in your database for all of your existing URLs. \nLike any other subdomain, this will need to be set up as a CNAME record in your host's DNS settings. A typical cPanel screen for configuring CNAME records with a host Step 3: Point Your Assets to the CDN \nLet's look at a method for creating a variable for the CDN URL and how it can be used to help programmatically prepend the URL to our static resources. The reason we want to do this is that (1) it makes it tougher to make mistakes in our markup and (2) it is easier to maintain the URL should we need to change it. \nWe’ll do this is by defining a global CDN variable, then prepend this variable to our static resources URL. We define this variable at both the PHP level and the JavaScript level so that we have more flexibility in how we use it down the road. It also makes it easier for us if we decide to ditch the CDN because all we have to do is replace the variable with a simple / to get things back to the relative path of our original server. \nNote that the following examples are here to serve illustrate examples rather than to be used literally. Your actual usage may vary. <?php define('cdnURL', 'http://cdn.css-tricks.com/'); ?><html> <head><title>Hello World!</> <script type='text/javascript'> /* Let’s define a javascript global for using the CDN inside scripts */ var cdnURL = '<?php echo cdnURL ?>'; </script> <link rel='stylesheet' href='<?php echo cdnURL ?>css/style.css' /> </head> <body> <img src='<?php echo cdnURL ?>img/logo.png' /> <button>Submit</button> <script type='text/javascript' src='<?php echo cdnURL ?>js/main.js'></script> </body></html> \nOr, done in JavaScript: (function() { var preloadImage = document.createElement('img'); preloadImage.src = cdnURL + 'img/logo.png'; })(); \nThis does require a slight change in your thought processes as a developer. Every static resource needs to get the cdnURL variable prepended to it. \nSame thinking goes for your CSS. For example, we can also setup a global CDN variable and prepend it to our CSS resources using a CSS preprocessor, like LESS: @cdnURL: 'http://cdn.css-tricks.com/'; button { background-image: url('@{cdnURL}img/button.png'); &:hover { background-image: url('@{cdnURL}img/button_hover.png'); } } \n...or Sass for that matter: $cdnURL: 'http://cdn.css-tricks.com/'; button { background-image: url('@{cdnURL}img/button.png'); &:hover { background-image: url('@{cdnURL}img/button_hover.png'); } } \nThe great thing about this is that you can switch off your CDN by simply setting the cdnURL to / which will recreate all of your relative URLs. This also has the advantage that should you want to switch the CDN URL, you just need to change the cdnURL . \nThat is really the three-step process for setting up a CDN, linking it to your server and then pointing your existing assets to it for so the CDN can serve things up when requested. Let's talk about some advanced settings \nSetting up the CDN wasn't that scary, right? Now that we've gotten past the main hurdles, we can have some fun with advanced settings that optimize the way our assets are served. TimeToLive (TTL) \nCDNs typically have a TimeToLive (TTL) set for assets. This is a fancy way of telling the CDN how long (in seconds) before it should treat an asset as stale. At that point, it looks it up on the server again for a \"fresh\" copy. \nThe longer the TTL, the longer a \"version\" of that asset will stay with the CDN and continue to be served. The shorter the TTL, the more often it ditches the \"version\" of the asset it stores and goes back to the original server to look for an updated version. MaxCDN cache settings screen for setting TTL expirations Invalidating assets \nThe double-edged sword with TTL is that you can update an asset on your server and the change will not reflect on your site until the TTL has expired and the CDN makes its next stop to the server to find a new copy. \nWe can overcome this by invalidating an asset. The trick here is to change the filename on update. If the filename changes, the CDN doesn't know any better and reads the newly named file as a completely new asset rather than an update to the existing one. \nIn other words, this: http://cdn.css-tricks.com/image100.jpg \n...would be renamed to something like this: http://cdn.css-tricks.com/image101.jpg \nSo long old version and hello new one! Leveraging TTL for version control \nHey, so if the CDN is holding onto one version of an asset and there is a fresh copy of it living on our server that it hasn't fetched yet, then we technically have two iterations of the same asset. We can use this to create a form of \"version control\" where updating our assets on the server doesn't mean we automatically lose them and can revert to a past copy, if needed. \nThe really complicated way to do this is to rename all of your resources every time you make a change like we did when invalidating the asset. However, this is overkill from a maintenance perspective, even if we had to create a variable to do this like we did for the cdnURL . We’re going to do some cheating instead because that's how we roll on a blog that is built around tricks. \nWe'll start by placing our static assets into their own folders so that this: http://cdn.css-tricks.com/image.jpg \n...becomes this: http://cdn.css-tricks.com/img100/image.jpg \nTo invalidate the file and force the CDN to serve the latest version, we would modify the subdirectory path like this: http://cdn.css-tricks.com/img101/image.jpg \nSee the difference? The filename stays the same but it now appears to live in a directory on the server. Again, the CDN does not know the difference and sees this as a completely new file. We just created a faux form of version control that happens directly in the folder! \nBut wait, we can do better. \nChanging the number on a folder on every update is still a cumbersome process and yet another step in the maintenance of our site. What we can do instead is make a few small changes to the site's .htaccess file to do the heavy lifting for us. \nWe'll outsmart the CDN by serving all our assets from the same folder, but make it look like it’s being served from a versioned folder, thanks to some rewrite rules. <IfModule mod_rewrite.c> RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteRule ^ver-[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+(.*)$ $1 [L,NC] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?/$1 [QSA,L] </IfModule> \nHa! Now our server is spoofing the version number in the URL while delivering our example image.jpg asset from the same path on the server where it was originally uploaded. Invalidating all assets on demand \nThe last thing to round this out is to integrate our version control trick into our HTML markup so that the CDN will refresh all of the assets as soon as we want to fully invalidate them. \nWe'll set up a config file where we define a variable for the version number, import that variable into our asset URL structure and then change the version number each time we want to push a refresh of our assets across the board. \nHere's what that might look like in a PHP config file: VERSION 1.0.0 Configure::load('cdn'); define('VERSION', file_get_contents(APP.DS.\"Config\".DS.\"VERSION\")); define('CDN', Configure::read('CDN.path').VERSION.'/'); /* the trailing slash is important */ \nHere's how that might work as a LESS config file: @VERSION: '1.0.0'; @import 'cdn'; @import 'version'; @CDNURL: '@{CDN}@{VERSION}/'; button { background-image: url('@{CDNURL}img/button.png'); &:hover { background-image: url('@{CDNURL}img/button_hover.png'); } } \nAs you can see, you can also choose to use the CDN variable as a file, environment variable or whatever would work best for you. The principles are mostly the same, all will achieve the desired end result of incorporating the CDN URL (and version number) into all of our external resources. CDN, FTW! \nHopefully this takes the scare out of setting up a CDN. It can certainly appear to be a daunting task and there absolutely are advanced settings that can get you lost in the weeds. The initial setup is what most of us need anyway and the benefits are profound when it comes to performance and user experience, among a host of other things (pun intended). \nThe truth is that it gets even simpler if you manage content on your site with a popular CMS like WordPress, where there are plugins galore to streamline the process even further. \nEven if we do not have the luxury of plugins, setting up a CDN can still be pretty straightforward, even for the least hosting-oriented of us. The setup is the largest hurdle and we were able to break that down into three basic steps. All else flows nicely from there. ",

      "text": "Microsoft issues apology after people take offense to perceived racial slur in Dead Rising 4 email Do zombies even say \"NNNNGGGHHHAAAA?\" on Nov 22, 2016, 3:30 PM TechSpot \nCompanies don’t always get it right when it comes to marketing their products. Razer found itself it some very hot water a few weeks ago after the company posted a (now deleted) tweet referencing the lack of an SD card in Apple’s new MacBook Pro. “Call yourself a Pro? S my D,” it read . But while some firms knowingly court controversy with these sort of messages, some are genuinely unintentional. \nYesterday, Microsoft sent out a Xbox promotional email for Dead Rising 4. As the series famously features the undead, the company decided to use a series of letters in the subject line that are meant to be read and pronounced as a noise that zombies typically make: “NNNNGGGHHHAAAA.” \nUnfortunately for Microsoft, some people took offense to the word, claiming that it looks and sounds a bit too much like a certain racial slur. \nThe response was enough for Microsoft to issue an apology via Larry “Major Nelson” Hryb. He Tweeted: “Today we sent a DR4 email where a zombie roar was interpreted by many as a racial slur. We apologize and promise to do better next time.” Today we sent a DR4 email where a zombie roar was interpreted by many as a racial slur. We apologize and promise to do better next time. — / Larry Hryb / + 1m (@majornelson) November 22, 2016 \nIt shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise to learn that more people appear to be annoyed at the apology than the original email. Microsoft obviously didn't want to purposely offended people, and no doubt didn’t expect the way they spelled a zombie groan to cause outrage. \nSo remember, if you’re trying to write a stereotypical zombie noise, it may be best to stick with the classic “BRR IIINNNSSS,” or, for purists, “GGGGR .” Related Reads",

      "title": "Microsoft’s Home Hub appears to be on the Windows and Device Group product roadmap",
      "text": "Terry Myerson, Executive Vice President of the Windows and Devices Group We reported earlier that the software foundations for Microsoft’s Home Hub have been spotted, showing that it would allow access to a Family Desktop above the Lock Screen featuring “a quick view of all the things your family uses every day like shared calendar, lists, music, and more.”\nWe then suggested that Microsoft would be building hardware to take advantage of the software in the form of a kitchen PC of some kind. We now have further evidence that a Home Hub device is on Microsoft’s Windows and Device Group product roadmap.\nAccording to a LinkedIn post by a Microsoft Principal Hardware engineering manager similar products have been in development since 2014.\nHe writes:\nOctober 2014 – Present (2 years 2 months)\nSet up hardware team and testing lab, each team member is handpicked from previous NOKIA Beijing mobile phone development center, all of them are top level expert in different area include RF, baseband, audio, display/touch, camera, mechanical, EMC, battery and antenna. Together with software team in Beijing, Munich and Redmond developed 2 product concept, one is far field voice interactive smart home Hub, the other one is an IOT connectivity platform solution. Both product stopped after first round of prototype build because of re-organization , performance has been proven and key concept of smart home Hub has been put into Microsoft Windows and Device Group product roadmap. So it appears Microsoft Beijing was working on an Amazon Echo style device and another less clear “Internet Of Things connectivity platform solution.” After the Microsoft layoffs of ex-Nokia staff, the project was shelved, but the idea had already been proven viable in the prototype stage and has now been placed into the Microsoft Windows and Device Group product roadmap.\nIn Mandarin, he notes that “the first project concept and programs be included in the next major release of Microsoft product plans?” It is still not clear of we are talking off a speech-only device (as in the original Home Hub concept) or now a full kitchen computer with voice control as envisioned in many Microsoft Future of the Smart Home videos.\nWhat is clear is that at least very recently, some new hardware is in the works, and given how accomplished Microsoft has become in this field, can only be good news for the brand.",

      "text": "Microsoft Apologizes for Sending Xbox Newsletter With Seemingly Racist Subject Line \nImage: Youtube \nMicrosoft has issued an apology after sending an email advertisement that received complaints regarding its “racist” subject line. It appears to be a case of poorly though out advertising copy. The company issued the advertisement for Dead Rising 4 , which will be released at the beginning of December. Every individual who signed up for the newsletter received the email, which promoted outrage. Source: WinBeta \nMicrosoft are committing time and money into marketing Dead Rising 4 – with it being a console exclusive that looks set to bump sales of the Xbox One S in time the holiday period. \nThe bulk of the email looks relatively controversy-free. It involves an image of Frank West with two zombies and the caption reads: “All We Want for the Holidays.” It was meant to mimic a DR4-themed Christmas card, owing to the game being set during the festive period. \nHowever, this is not what alarmed recipients of the email. It was the subject line of the email itself which read: “NNNNGGGHHHAAA.” Some interpreted this as an offensive racial slur. Can’t say we blame them. Source: GameSpot \nMajor Nelson (real name Larry Hryb) who is in charge of marketing through Xbox Live has since apologized for the email and says the company will \n“do better next time.” \nHere’s a screenshot of the email in question: Source: https://gamerant.com/microsoft-appologize-dead-rising-4-email/ \nThe controversy comes hot on the heels of another marketing blunder by a big company. Recently, EA were under fire for producing “insensitive” social media marketing materials for their FPS Battlefield 1. \nIn the Tweets, the company used a hashtag #JustWW1Things to promote the game and treated images of the war with less tact than expected. They too apologized for the incident.",

      "text": "videos Advertisement Microsoft Surface Pro 5 to come in 2017 with Windows 10 Redstone and Android 7.0 Nougat OS variants By Harsh Soni Nov 22, 2016 09:11 AM EST NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 06: Microsoft Corporate Vice President Panos Panay introduces a new tablet titled the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 at a media event for new Microsoft products on October 6, 2015 in New York City. Microsoft also unveiled a virtual reality head set titled the HoloLens, a phone titled the Lumia 950, a laptop titled the Surface Book and a biometrics wristband titled the Band 2. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Advertisement \nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 5 has been one of the most predictable devices of 2017. The tech company has failed to deliver the 2-in-1 PC tablet to its fans this year. But now the good news is coming that the upcoming device will be coming in two variants- Windows and Android OS. \nWhen Microsoft held an event in October 2016, fans were waiting as they have expected that the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 would finally be launched. However, they were disappointed when the tech company instead unveiled a new Windows 10 update and the new, Surface Studio. Advertisement \nFresh reports are claiming that what may be causing the delay for the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release is in the new software side. It has been rumored that the upcoming -hybrid device will be coming with the proprietary Windows 10 operating system and also the Android OS. \nAccordingly, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 would come out with one version that is Windows-base and the way its predecessors came out as well as the other one would run on Android OS, reports the University Herald . \nOn the Windows side, it would be powered by the Windows 10 Redstone Update to be released next year. For the Android version, it would be the Android 7.0 Nougat launched earlier this year. \nThis variation in operating systems powering same model is not unheard of in the tech world. The Lenovo Yoga Book has also come in Windows and Android OS variants. With this innovative decision, Microsoft Surface Pro 5 fans would be having more options in terms of customizing their device. \nMicrosoft Surface Pro 5 is also rumored to have the glaring battery draining issue that inundated the Surface Pro 4. In addition to that the Intel Kaby Lake chipsets are also geared to power all versions of the upcoming device and high resolution displays are also an obvious upgrade. \nSome reports also say that Microsoft has filed a new patent for a Surface Pen support on the Surface Pro 5. This new technology would allow the Surface Pen to be charged upon contact with the Microsoft Surface Pro 5. The latest Surface Pro 5 is also expected to come with a USB Type-C charging port, which has become the new paradigm in modern-day devices for faster data transfers. \nHowever, many critics believe that the Android OS running on Surface Pro 5 is a misdirect and an inaccurate rumor because Microsoft would not be using a product of Google for its device in the same way as Apple is protective of its iOS software's exclusivity to iOS devices. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved.

      "text": "MacBook Pro 2016 vs Microsoft Surface Book: Head-to-head comparison By Mizgan Masani Nov 21, 2016 02:21 PM EST MacBook Pro and Microsoft Surface Book are giving each other a tough competition Advertisement \nThis week Apple and Microsoft revealed their latest visions for Notebook computing, giving users a real choice for how they interact with their devices. \nWhile both offer similar specifications , they primarily differentiate in how you use their touch. Microsoft is focusing on touch and pen-based input right on the screen, while Apple is making smaller, but potentially just as important, tweaks to its established input methods. Advertisement \nMore Best laptops of 2016. \nIn design , Microsoft has stuck with their same design as of last year's surface book. This means same magnesium alloy body, and the same hinge that curls around the back, leaving the middle section of the device feeling strangely open. \nBy contrast, Apple have managed to shave a large chunk off the new MacBook Pro's chassis. It is quite lighter than the Microsoft's latest model. That lightness is down to a completely redesigned MacBook Pro. It's all-metal (so no plastic hinge). \nIn display section, Surface Book has 13.7 inch display and is ever so slightly bigger than the MacBook Pro. Microsoft's machine packs in more pixels, too, with a stunning 3,000 x 2,000 pixel resolution. As for the quality, the Surface Book attains an Adobe RGB score of 67.6% and a contrast ratio of 1,750:1, both of which were good enough to beat the previous MacBook Pro at 60% and 1,000:1 respectively. We're not so sure it will manage to keep the new MacBook Pro at bay though. \nMacBook Pro has 13.3 inch display and only manages 2,560 x 1,600 pixel resolution. Apple reckons that the new screen is 67% brighter than the previous version, has a 67% higher contrast ratio, and has a 25% wider colour gamut. We'll have to wait to be sure that Apple's new laptop beats the aforementioned figures, but it's shaping up to be a truly stunning laptop display. \nThe Surface Book includes a 6th Gen Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD and Intel HD graphics while Apple MacBook includes quad-core Core i7 processors, 16GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and a 2GB Radeon Pro 450 graphics card which is significantly better and much more improved. \nMicrosoft is continuing to focus on touch screen and pen input, and its Surface Dial adds one more way to offer input. Apple's Touch Bar may be a fantastic way to enable users to do more with their Macs, and we'll have to see how many apps develop for it. \n",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior   @gcaweir · 6 seconds ago with 0 comments \nWay back in June 2015, Microsoft announced details of a partnership with virtual reality specialists Oculus . Each Oculus Rift headset would come with an Xbox One controller and wireless adapter, and Microsoft said that owners would be able to stream Xbox One games to the headset too. \nToday, Microsoft revealed that Xbox One game streaming will finally come to the Oculus Rift in a few weeks' time, eighteen months after its original announcement. \n\"Today marks an evolution in our ongoing partnership with Oculus, as Rift owners will be able to stream their Xbox One library to Rift with the new Xbox One Streaming to Oculus Rift app,\" Microsoft said. The app connects the headset to the Xbox One via your wireless network, streaming the console's video output into one of three VR environments: 'Citadel', 'Retreat' or 'Dome'. \nWith native support for the Rift in Windows 10, including DirectX 12 support, Microsoft promises that \"made-for-VR games on Windows 10 will have the fastest frame rates and top peformance.\" \nThe new Xbox One Streaming to Oculus Rift app will be available to download free from the Oculus Store on December 12.",

      "text": "PC Asus' Surface Pro 4 alternative By following the design of Microsoft's Surface Pro so closely, Asus has left itself with little room to innovate and improve. PHOTO: ASUS Published Vincent Chang \nMicrosoft's Surface Pro has spawned a number of imitators since its debut in 2013. \nBut, to me, none has come closer to aping the look and feel of this tablet-laptop hybrid than the new Asus Transformer 3 Pro. \nLike the Surface Pro, the Asus Transformer 3 Pro comes with an integrated kickstand, a keyboard cover accessory and a stylus. \nFlip out the kickstand on the 12-inch Transformer, connect its keyboard accessory and the tablet becomes a laptop. \nHowever, by following the design of the Surface Pro so closely, Asus has left itself with little room to innovate and improve. \nThere are areas where it betters the Surface Pro, but these are minor improvements and do not really help the Asus stand out. \nTECH SPECS \nPROCESSOR: Intel Core i7-6500U (2.5GHz) \nGRAPHICS: Intel HD Graphics 520 \nRAM: 16GB \nSCREEN SIZE: 12.6-inch, 2,880 x 1,920 pixels \nCONNECTIVITY: 1 x USB 3.1 Type-C with Thunderbolt 3, 1 x USB 3.0, HDMI, microSD card slot, audio jack \nBATTERY: 39 watt-hour \nBATTERY LIFE: 3/5 \nOVERALL: 4/5 \nThe lack of innovation is perfectly illustrated by Asus' guide for reviewers, which lists, in painstaking detail, how the Transformer compares against the Surface Pro 4. \nSome seem trivial, such as the fact that the Transformer is 0.1mm thinner than the Surface Pro. Others, like the Transformer having an HDMI port instead of a mini-DisplayPort like the Surface, are useful. \nBut these are not exciting upgrades. I would argue that the most significant difference is the addition of a USB 3.1 Type-C port with Thunderbolt 3 support. Yes, this newfangled port, found on the latest computers this year, seems like a minor improvement, too. \nHowever, the Transformer becomes a gaming machine when it is connected to the Asus ROG XG Station 2 via the USB Type-C port. \nCurrently unavailable, the ROG XG Station 2 houses a desktop-class Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card and can be tapped by the Transformer to run games and other graphically intensive apps. \nThe Transformer's backlit keyboard cover feels as good as the Surface's Type Cover, with impressive key travel of around 1.4mm. \nBut the touchpad had some wonky moments - it felt jumpy and behaved erratically at times. \nThe included stylus provides 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity, like the Surface Pen. However, the Asus Pen lacks the convenient eraser function found at the end of the Surface Pen and cannot be attached magnetically to the Transformer, unlike Microsoft's. \nIn the PCMark 8 Home benchmark, the Transformer scored 2,292. This is lower than the Core i5-equipped Surface Pro 4 (2,307). The fan also became quite noisy during the benchmark. \nThe Transformer has a dismal battery life. It lasted 4hr 12min, or an hour shorter than the Surface Pro 4, in our video-loop battery test. \nTo my surprise, the Transformer 3 Pro with an Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB solid-state drive costs $2,598. Also included: the keyboard and stylus accessories. A similarly configured Surface Pro 4 is priced at $3,399. And this is without the Type Cover keyboard ($199). \n•Verdict: Largely inspired by the Surface Pro, the Asus Transformer 3 Pro offers minor upgrades, as well as a lower price point.   'Asus' Surface Pro 4 alternative'.  ",

      "title": "Alcatel grabbing some Windows phone US market with Fierce XL and Idol 4S",
      "text": "\nMicrosoft retrenchment plans for Mobile centered around the idea of the company backing away from its Lumia line with the hope that OEM partners could fill the space. That plan was always risky as businesses see little advantage in winning that market since the numbers are so small.\n\nAlcatel, however, seems to be finally making inroads. That's impressive if only because they company produces just two Windows 10 Mobile phones restricted to one US carrier (T-Mobile). Nonetheless, the latest numbers from AdDuplex , which focuses only on the US market, shows that the company is having some success. ",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior   @gcaweir · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nThe festive shopping season has well and truly arrived, with all sorts of deals popping up in recent days on a vast range of products. Last week, Brits interested in the Surface Pro 4 were able to buy one of the tablets for as little as £699 - but now, an even better deal has arrived. \nMicrosoft is now offering its entry-level Surface Pro 4 - with an Intel Core m3 processor, 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD - for £599; that's £150 less than its usual price. On top of that, it's also offering a Type Cover keyboard at no extra cost, in the color of their choice, saving buyers a further £109.99. The combined savings of £259.99 off the full price of the tablet and keyboard adds up to a 30% discount. \nThe same deal is available on the next model up in the Surface Pro 4 range, with an Intel Core i5 processor, 4GB RAM and 128GB SSD. Usually priced at £849, it's now on sale for £699, including the Type Cover - the £259.99 savings are identical, but the 27% discount is slightly lower given the higher price of that bundle. \nThe deal represents Microsoft's largest UK discount on the Surface Pro 4 to date, and will remain available until December 1. But with Christmas right around the corner, we'll no doubt see more deals appearing in the coming weeks.",

ABC's American Music Awards claimed a record-low 8.2 million viewers Sunday, down from 11 million last year to less than a third of February's audience for CBS' Grammy Awards . Univision's Latin Grammy Awards claimed 3.2 million Thursday, its smallest turnout since 2008.\nTuesday openers. A batch of late-fall starts included USA's delayed drama Shooter (1.4 million same-day viewers); TNT's Good Behavior (a weak 813,000); MTV's Teen Wolf (567,000) and revenge fantasy Sweet/Vicious (271,000); and TruTV's Billy on the Street (255,000).\nDucky. A&E's 11th (and final) season opener of onetime hit Duck Dynasty managed 1.3 million Wednesday, when FX's American Horror Story: Roanoke (2.5 million) and FXX's You're the Worst (200,000) wrapped up their seasons. Showtime's The Affair returned with a below-average 599,000 Sunday.\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fOU2BP",

      "text": "» News & Magazin-Redakteur Microsoft wird sich warm anziehen müssen, denn die Zahl an Surface Pro 4 -Konkurrenten wächst stetig. Eben erst hat Eve mit dem V das erste crowdfinanzierte 2-in-1-Gerät auf die Zielgerade gebracht, und Lenovo hat mit dem Miix 510 und Miix 710 zwei starke Konkurrenten im Surface-Stil angekündigt. Doch Lenovo gönnt sich offenbar keine Ruhe und hat sich gleich wieder an die Arbeit gemacht. Kürzlich leakten erste Bilder und Daten zum Miix 720 und nun haben Winfuture-Kollegen auch bereits den Nachfolger zum Miix 510 ausgegraben . Wann Lenovo das Miix 520 als Nachfolger das Miix 510 offiziell ankündigen wird, ist derzeit nicht absehbar, in jedem Fall hat Lenovo noch mal ordentlich nachbessert. So sind im Miix 520 Intel Skylake und Kaby Lake-Prozessoren der U-Serie lüfterlos integriert, zudem setzt man auf eine Kamera die offenbar Augmented Reality-fähig ist und auf die Integration eines Windows Hello-kompatiblen Fingerabdrucksensors. Auch ein Wacom-Stylus mit 2.048 Druckstufen ist wieder mit dabei. Das 12,3 Zoll-Display soll eine Auflösung von 1.920 x 1.200 Pixeln bieten und mit Gorilla Glas geschützt sein. Die vier möglichen Prozessorvarianten, ein Skylake i3-6006U , ein Kaby Lake i3-7100U , ein Kaby Lake i5-7200U oder ein Kaby Lake i7-7500U sollen mit auf 10 Watt reduzierter Verlustleistung ohne Lüfter nur durch Heatpipes und das Lenovo Vapor-Chamber-System gekühlt werden. Es sind Varianten zwischen 4 und 16 GB RAM sowie 128 GB bis 1 TB-SSD geplant, wobei Lenovo auf PCIe-SSDs setzen wird. An Anschlüssen sind ein USB Type 3.0-Port sowie zwei USB-C-Anschlüsse vorgesehen, zudem natürlich ein MicroSD-Slot. Thunderbolt 3 wird leider nicht erwähnt. Geladen wird das Miix 520 über ein 45 Watt USB-C-Netzteil. Auf der Rückseite ist eine Dual-Kamera mit einem 8 MP- und einem 2 MP-Sensor verbaut, die wie erwähnt Augmented Reality-fähig sein soll. Auf der Frontseite gibt es eine 5 MP-Kamera. Dual-Band 802.11ac WLAN sowie Bluetooth 4.2 und optional LTE sind vorgesehen. Der Akku soll 41 Wh bieten, genug für maximal 10 Stunden Idle-Laufzeit. Das 9 mm dicke Gehäuse besteht aus einer Metall-Aluminium-Legierung. Preise und Verfügbarkeit sind derzeit nicht bekannt, zudem könnten sich einige Daten noch ändern, laut Winfuture-Quelle steckt das Modell noch in der Entwicklung. Tests",

      "text": "BRUSSELS — In a bid to win European Union antitrust approval of its $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., Microsoft Corp. has proposed concessions that would allow rival professional social networks access to its Outlook programs, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAfter the merger, the people said, rival networks would have access to Microsoft’s Outlook add-ins program — which allows third-party tools to integrate with Outlook — and Outlook APIs, or application programming interface, which allows discrete programs to communicate with one another.

(Source: The Verge) Microsoft's foray into virtual reality should be much more accessible than other available options. by Sam Medley, 2016/11/22 Accessory Gaming Rumor Software Virtual Reality (VR) Windows Wearable Working For Notebookcheck Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team! Especially wanted: German-English-Translator - Details here Virtual Reality may be the next big thing in computer technology. HTC’s Vive and the Oculus Rift have certainly made waves, but Microsoft will soon enter the game with the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update. In order to support the more affordable VR headsets coming next year, Microsoft will develop their own VR platform, Windows Holographic . Thanks to an app that tests compatibility with Windows Holographic (dubbed “Windows Holographic First Run”), the minimum system requirements for the software have been released. Tom Warren of the Verge has tested multiple systems, and it appears that the minimum required specs are fairly low end. Users will need at least 4 GB of RAM, USB 3.0, a graphics card with DirectX 12 support, and either a quad-core or hyperthreaded dual-core CPU. In contrast, both the Vive or Rift require high-end components, including top-tier graphics cards and powerful CPUs. Machines that can adequately support the Vive and the Rift are typically enthusiast-class rigs that can be prohibitively expensive. Windows Holographic looks much less demanding and may run on much more affordable PC setups. This should pair well with the aforementioned VR headsets for Windows 10, which will start at about $300. Microsoft is expected to release Windows Holographic early next year with VR headsets from third parties going on sale around that time. See our Top 10 Notebooks:",

      "text": "These Are 3 Reasons Not to Use Microsoft's New Outlook CRM Offering 11/22/2016 04:38 pm ET Gene Marks Small business management columnist, author, speaker, and business owner \nMy ten-person company is a Microsoft Partner and a fan of Microsoft. We specialize in Customer Relationship Management (CRM). We sell their recently re-branded Dynamics CRM product line. We sell and implement three other great customer relationship management applications, too -- Salesforce.com , ZohoCRM and GoldMine . \nEarlier this month, Microsoft announced a new product called Outlook Customer Manager, which is a lighter CRM product that will be included at no extra charge in the Office 365 Business Edition. It looks like a great product, particularly for small businesses. Your team will be able to track -- on pretty much any device -- customer interactions, emails, activities, notes, deals and other information right from within Outlook. \nSeems like a no-brainer for any Office user, right? Well, hold your horses. \nWe have been implementing CRM applications for more than 20 years. Our company serves more than 600 active CRM clients. We have had many awesome, celebratory, cork-popping successes. Unfortunately, we've also had our share of sad, tearful, profanity-filled failures. Why? Why do some companies succeed with these systems while others fail? We've learned that the product doesn't matter. The size of the company doesn't matter. It's something else. The Outlook Customer Manager can be a huge asset for your business. But, like some of my clients, you may fail with it. And for these three reasons: \nReason 1: You don't have an administrator in charge. \nMicrosoft is giving you a shared database as part of Office 365. That database will quickly turn into useless data unless someone is in charge of it. That person doesn't need to be a technical guru -- just a good power user. And you, the owner, need to make sure that this person has your authority to kick butt, wipe noses and change the diapers of the sales and service people who will be entering data into the system. Your administrator is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of the database -- anything incorrect, out of date or missing is not that person's fault, but it is his or her responsibility to fix it and implement controls so that it doesn't happen again. If you don't have this person in place (it's a cost, by the way), you will fail. \nReason 2: The boss (that's you) isn't committed. \nFor a CRM system to work, even a lighter version like the Outlook Customer Manager, the executive in charge must be fully committed to it. That's you. You're using the system. You are the leader. You're providing emotional, financial and educational support for your administrator. You tell your team that this is the company's system, and everyone's going to use it. You invest in outside help (that's me) to get it up and running and used the right way with the proper training and service. You don't cave in when people complain because they don't like the color of the screen or the font, or that things take extra clicks or that it's not \"user friendly.\" For this system to work, your people will need to do more work. You provide resources to help them, but you stand firm because this is your database. You realize that using this product the right way will help you increase your sales, improve your customer service and make your company more profitable...and valuable. Stand firm. Commit. Or you will fail. \nReason 3: You're not using the data. \nMy best clients have 2-3 key reports coming out of their CRM systems every week or so -- open quotes, new leads, customer problems, salespeople activities, etc. Managers read these reports and rely on the data to help them run their companies. In the end, the Outlook Customer Manager is nothing more than a shared database that you can use to grow your business. If you're looking at data in the system -- through reports or even an output to Excel -- you can not only ensure that the data is accurate but that your team is also using the system the right way. Have a few key reports, or you will fail. \nAs a Microsoft partner with CRM competency, I plan to reach out to our smaller clients and discuss with them the advantages of getting Office 365 with the Outlook Customer Manager. I will offer our services to help them use it the right way. But I will respectfully advise not using this product if a client is not prepared to invest in an administrator or reports or shows little interest in adopting the system into their company culture. \nAny of these three reasons are reasons enough not to use this great new service. \nA version of this column originally appeared on Inc.com .

      "text": "Cognitive Business: Inside the Microsoft Cortana Intelligence Suite 11/22/2016 04:40 pm ET Lolita Taub IE Business School MBA Candidate · Enterprise Tech \nIn this Cognitive Business interview we talk to Lance Olson, Director for Cortana Intelligence at Microsoft, where he works with organizations around the world in the pursuit of insight through the use of big data and advanced analytics. \nLance Olson, Director for Cortana Intelligence at Microsoft / Source: Microsoft \n\nThe Cortana Intelligence Suite helps the span of all organization types (from nonprofit to public to private) manage their business decisions through a suite of services centered around analytics and big data predictions. The suite supports cross-functions, from product development to operations. The Cortana Intelligence Suite, can for example, help businesses find the right market segmentation for a given product, understand customer needs, and find the problems that need fixing in areas such as manufacturing. \nInteresting, right? Let’s dive into the Q&A. \n\nHow does Cortana Intelligence work, from an AI perspective? \nFirst, we must think about the prediction(s) we want, and then we must follow a series of steps to get there. Let me explain through an example. \nLet’s say Rolls Royce wants to predict - in real time - engine health and fuel usage (to assure maximum aircraft health). With identified prediction goals, the next steps would require us to: \nIdentify the outcome you’re tracking, such as aircraft and engine health. Think of data needed to understand the health of the engine and acquire relevant data inputs - be it data that is streaming, batched (from relational systems), or weather data feeds. Combine data points to see what’s likely to happen in the engine, and feed the data into Cortana Intelligence to train the system to make predictions - this involves starting with defining what a healthy engine looks like and what an unhealthy engine looks like. Train the system to identify patterns of healthy and unhealthy engines based on examples; this way the system will learn when to create alerts when it finds anomalies and predicts malfunctions, failures, or inefficiencies. Continue training, re-training, and fine-tuning the AI systems to assure higher prediction accuracy rates over time. \nTo see an example of this in action, check out this Rolls Royce case . \n\nWhat sets Cortana Intelligence apart from its competition? \nWe focus on simplicity that can be done out of the box. In a matter of minutes, a business decision maker can look at the business dashboards that they can play with, plug in data, and see what the solutions look like with their data online using the Cortana Intelligence Gallery . Other differentiators include: \nlower consulting footprint the breadth of the cloud Cortana Intelligence sits on; we’re in 34 regions worldwide and growing quickly, hold the record of having the most secure cloud in the world, offer sovereign clouds, and meet sovereign country compliance requirements 15+ years working on search (i.e., Bing) and related research; we understand how people search; we’ve spent a lot of time understanding image processing and the search process, which requires the ability to accurately learn what people mean from written and spoken communication. \n\nHow do you define AI vs Big Data? \nBig data involves new patterns for processing data that differ from traditional methods in their volume (size of data), variety (unstructured and semi-structured data), or velocity (real-time streaming data). Artificial Intelligence is about using algorithms and data to create a result that takes on more human traits such as speech, vision, and language understanding – the ability to read a sentence and understand the intent of the person who created it. AI often uses big data to build better algorithms and learn, but AI can be applied to many use cases that operate on traditional data sources, such as looking at a customer table in a relational database and predicting the customer’s propensity to buy a particular product. \nWhat trends and challenges are most impacting AI right now? \nThree trends that are having a transformative impact on AI today are the growth and availability of data through IoT, the increase in compute capacity from maturing cloud architectures such as Azure, and the increasing sophistication of the resulting algorithms that are available to us. One challenge we face is that the tools needed to build AI-driven systems are still relatively immature and therefore the skillsets needed are in scarce supply. So while it is now possible to do amazing things, it is not as easy as it should be. \nWhat are your predictions about the future of AI 2016 and beyond? \nCognitive services such as speech and language understanding will continue to become increasingly useful, especially in bot scenarios in which written and spoken conversations are the primary interface. \nArtificial Intelligence tools like Cortana Intelligence will become usable by a much broader set of people, often embedded as intelligence within existing tools and applications. This will enable more people such as developers and business analysts to perform machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks without being formally trained as data scientists. Here’s an example of how we recently did this with Uber to enable face authentication for their drivers . \n\nWhat makes a company ready to implement Cortana Intelligence? \nMost organizations can see ways they could better achieve their goals if they had an increased ability to predict future outcomes, but having the desire to improve in this area is one of the key requirements. \n\nHow can a company prepare for Cortana Intelligence and AI in general? \nPick a few key areas where you’d like to focus and start with a relatively simple project. Becoming highly data and AI-driven is like running a long-distance race. We don’t usually just go out and have great success on the longer distances without building up. It is an iterative process where we solve smaller problems that build on each other, and increase our momentum with each project. Having the right data is critical to success in these projects so it is good to start by taking stock of your current data assets and identifying areas where you can use what you have or extend its value in interesting ways by combining it with new datasets. \n\nWhat industries do you see AI benefiting first in your space, and why? \nAI is likely to impact nearly every industry in the world much in the same way the computer has done over the past 50 years. That said, in the last couple years I’ve seen a lot of momentum in Retail (e.g., Lowe’s smart kitchen design center, Ziosk restaurant kiosks), Manufacturing (e.g., Rolls Royce connected engines, eSmart Systems, Schneider Electric smart power), Healthcare (e.g., Dartmouth Hitchcock connected care), and Banking and other Financial services (e.g., Tangerine, Quarterspot loan success predictions). These industries have significant amounts of data already available to them that they can use at relatively low costs to gain real efficiencies in how they run their operations, employ their people, improve their products, and anticipate the needs of others so they can better serve their customers. \n\nWhat is your favorite AI use case? \nI’m torn. My favorite use cases range between a health and a business case. I’ll tell you about both. In India, doctors are using Cortana Intelligence to predict Lasik eye surgery outcomes and recovery times, ensuring optimal results for surgery patients at a lower cost and higher success rate. \nIn the U.S., Lowe’s is using Cortana Intelligence to provide their kitchen remodeling customers an exciting experience that allows them to quickly decide on their dream kitchen and quickly bring it to life. Partnering with Pinterest, Lowe’s today is leveraging Cortana Intelligence in the HoloLens. \nWhen people set out to remodel their kitchen, they find it hard to make decisions on what it should look like - especially when there are multiple stakeholders involved, as is often the case. What we found is that people will use Pinterest and they will pin images of dream kitchens that they want. Taking note, we partnered with Lowe’s and Pinterest, to show what’s possible if we enable customers to log into their Pinterest account once inside the store. Cortana Intelligence takes the visual information, extracts ideas from images pinned (on Pinterest), and identifies the customer’s style preferences. Cortana Intelligence then compares those preferences with the Lowe’s catalog and popular purchases. Through that process it produces a Lowe’s version of your dream kitchen. \n\nEnter the HoloLens. Cortana Intelligence interacts with the HoloLens and creates the customer’s augmented kitchen. The customer can then click and style - multiple people can participate. The customer can see the design in an immersive and dynamic environment. Say they want to change the backsplash that was generated, they can do that. Cortana Intelligence recommends adjustments to the kitchen design, based on customer sentiment. When the customer is happy with the design, he can decide to have the design sent to him as well as an estimate of his kitchen remodel. \nThis use case has proven to be a win-win for the customer and Lowe’s. For the customer, they get their dream kitchen. For Lowe’s, they get insights into customer sentiment and they get to see a decrease in time to decide on a kitchen remodel, which results in revenue. \n\n\n“Cognitive Business” is an interview series featuring awesome people in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) world.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nEarlier this year, Apple launched a refresh of its MacBook Pro laptop that featured an OLED Touch Bar in place of the traditional functional keys. Now, a patent application might have revealed that Microsoft has plans to field a similar product. \nIn July 2016, Microsoft applied for a patent on a “keyboard with input-sensitive display device,” according to a report from MS Power User . Attached images show a tablet-like screen being used in conjunction with a standard keyboard to allow different types of input beyond that of the Roman alphabet. U.S. Patent & Trademark Office \nThe device is intended to make text entry easier for users working with character-based and phonics-based languages, which are prevalent in Asia. The patent states that the error rate for this kind of text input on a standard QWERTY keyboard can be as high as 20 percent for the average individual, a figure that could perhaps be cut by implementing a peripheral of this kind. \nThere simply aren’t enough keys on a standard keyboard to represent each possible character in many such languages, so the process of typing is typically peppered with breaks to choose the desired option from an on-screen menu. Microsoft’s device could cut down on the time lost by users as they switch from keyboard to mouse and back again, as they could choose the right option with a simple tap of the touchscreen. \nMore: No screen’s too small for Doom : Classic game now playable on MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar \nLike Apple’s Touch Bar, the peripheral could be implemented in a variety of different ways. Images attached to the application show the device being used to operate menus that would typically be displayed on the primary monitor. \nMicrosoft has been bullish about new accessories as of late, so it will be interesting to see what becomes of this project. On the one hand, it could be a specialty peripheral aimed squarely at users who work with non-Roman languages, but it could also be used as a direct competitor to the Touch Bar that’s sold as a separate peripheral.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nAs part of Microsoft’s ongoing partnership with Oculus, Rift owners are in for a treat come December. The VR headset will support streaming games from your Xbox One or Windows 10 via a free app that will hit the Windows and Xbox Stores on December 12. Get ready to experience your favorite games in virtual reality — sort of. \nIt’s exciting news for Rift owners, but don’t get your hopes up — it doesn’t mean you’ll be playing your games in VR. Well, you will, just not the way you might think. The Rift app essentially creates a VR environment in which you can play your games, the app reportedly includes three different environments you can immerse yourself in while you immerse yourself in your games. \nMore: Turns out virtual reality may soon be used to prepare patients for full human head transplants \nThe Rift app effectively mimics a gigantic screen in one of three VR environments: Citadel, Retreat, or Dome. From that screen, you can stream any of your Windows 10 or Xbox One streamable titles like Gears of War 4 and Forza Horizon 3 . \nThe partnership between Microsoft and Oculus has been ongoing ever since the launch of the Oculus Rift, which shipped with an Xbox One controller in the place of the then-forthcoming Oculus Touch controllers. The Rift app will be the next step in that relationship, and it comes at an interesting time just after the release of the PSVR and PS4 Pro. \nAccording to the Xbox news release you can give it a try at a few different retail locations this holiday season, in case you’re not quite sold on the Xbox One and Oculus Rift partnership. It’s a step in the right direction, and the closest you’re likely to get to a fully VR version of Halo 5: Guardians for the time being.

      "text": "Microsoft joins Linux Foundation in another nod to open-source code November 22, 2016 by Matt Day, The Seattle Times \nMicrosoft has joined the Linux Foundation, the latest sign that the software giant is embracing open-source technologies it formerly treated with hostility. \nThe foundation helps advise the development of the Linux and other software tools built on open-source terms that allow the public to freely use and modify software. Microsoft last week said it had joined the foundation on its most expensive tier of corporate membership, alongside the likes of Intel and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Linux, which former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer once called a cancer, was for years one of Microsoft's biggest rivals. The free-to-use operating system was seen for a time as the primary threat to expensive, proprietary Windows. \nWindows won the battle for the personal computer but didn't fare so well in the broader debate about the value of open-source versus proprietary technology. \nLinux-derived Android dominates the smartphone market, and open-source tools are a force in cloud-computing technologies. Many software startups favor open-source software by default. \nMicrosoft teams plugging away on developer tools and server software, realms heavily influenced by Linux, broke with the company line during the last several years in pushing greater involvement with the open-source community. \nWhen Satya Nadella, previously Microsoft's server and tools chief, was named company chief executive in early 2014, the tone shifted companywide. Microsoft, Nadella said at an event in October 2014, loves Linux. \nThe company, headquartered outside Seattle, has since released elements of its own software under open-source terms and announced a version of its database management software, SQL Server, for Linux, among other steps. \nGitHub, an online developer community and repository for software projects, said in September that there were more Microsoft employees contributing to open-source projects than representatives of any other single company . Microsoft is making .NET Core open source, cross-platform November 13, 2014 \nMost of you are old enough to remember when you would never use the word Linux in the same sentence as Microsoft without a middle word such as versus. How times have changed. Microsoft's announcement on Wednesday indicates ... India State to Dump Windows for Linux August 31, 2006 \n(AP) -- A southern Indian state plans to switch all school computers from Microsoft Windows to the free Linux operating system, an official said Thursday. Microsoft's Patent Threats Evoke Retorts May 18, 2007 \nPartly in response to Microsoft's recent patent threats to Linux and other open-source software, the FSF (Free Software Foundation) announced on May 16 the creation of a new activist campaigns team to organize public support ... Mellower Microsoft now clicks with its rivals May 13, 2015 \nTodd McKinnon, the chief executive of a San Francisco technology startup, has no illusions about how the Microsoft of an earlier era would have viewed his firm. Microsoft cuts more jobs in troubled mobile unit May 25, 2016 \nMicrosoft will cut up to 1,850 jobs and book an approximately $950 million writedown as it attempts to salvage its rocky entrance into the smartphone market. IBM to invest $1b in Linux, open-source September 17, 2013 \nIBM said Tuesday it would invest $1 billion in new Linux and open source technologies for its servers in a bid to boost efficiency for big data and cloud computing.

      "text": "print The Eve V laptop/tablet. Starting at $1,399, it comes with the keyboard. Eve \nMicrosoft's Surface tablets essentially invented the market for laptop/tablet hybrid computers , setting a standard that even Apple ended up following with its iPad Pro . \nNow Eve , a Helsinki-based startup with backing from Intel, thinks it can one-up Microsoft with the Eve V (pronounced \"Eve Vee\") — its own Windows 10-powered take on the Surface Pro, starting at $1399 for preorder via IndieGoGo , though it's backordered to April 2017. \nToday, Eve says so many people lined up to buy the first run of Eve V devices, it actually briefly overwhelmed IndieGoGo's payment processing system. At the time of writing, the Eve V had raised $722,833, or 964% of its $75,000 goal. \nEven Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has taken an interest in the Eve V project after reading about it, says Eve CEO Konstantinos Karatsevidis, and will be getting a unit to try out when it starts shipping in February. After all, from Microsoft's perspective, the whole reason it first created the Surface was to inspire PC manufacturers . \n\"[Microsoft] really wanted to see the device,\" Karatsevidis says. The Eve team, based in Helsinki. Eve \nThe machine is totally finished and functional, thanks to Intel's funding, Eve says; the IndieGoGo campaign is to cover manufacturing costs and handle preorders. \nAt this point, you may be wondering what makes the Eve V so special. If you ask Karatsevidis, the answer is simple: It's all about the community. See, every aspect of the Eve V, from the design to the processor to the keyboard cover material, was decided with full and complete input from Eve's community of fans. \"We immediately started to see huge advantages\" \nThe Eve V is actually Eve's second bit of Windows hardware. The first, early 2015's Eve T1, was a budget Windows 8.1 tablet, designed to balance price with performance. At the time, Karatsevidis says, Eve was really just two guys looking to make the kind of gadget they themselves would want to use. \n\"We were pretty unhappy with the products in the market,\" Karatsevidis says. \nAn Eve fact sheet on how the Eve V stacks up against competitors. Eve \nThe Eve T1 got pretty solid reviews , but Karatsevidis says that Eve was getting a ton of feedback, both via e-mail and in the comments sections of press articles about the tablet. A lot of people had a lot of ideas for how the T1 could have been done better. \nKaratsevidis didn't just welcome the feedback — he rebuilt the company around it. In June 2015, Eve introduced Eve.Community, a site where anybody could register and help guide the company as it worked on its next project, what would become the Eve V. \n\"We immediately started to see huge advantages to this,\" Karatsevidis says. \"The community stepped in and stopped us\" \nKaratsevidis says that there's this tendency in the market, especially when talking about hybrids like the Surface Pro, to focus on sleekness above all else. \nThe problem, Karatsevidis says, is that this sleekness comes at the cost of things that users really care about, like battery life or additional USB and monitor ports. So while Eve's original designs called for something as thin and light as possible, the community came in and set them straight. \nMicrosoft Surface Pro 4 Microsoft \n\"The community kicked in and prevented us from doing so,\" Karatsevidis says. \"As a result, we have a lot of battery life.\" \nNow, Karatsevidis says, he realizes that battery life can make or break a product, \"no joke.\" Similarly, the Eve V sports Thunderbolt 3, USB-C and 2 full-sized USB-A 3.0 ports, which beats the Surface Pro 4, which only has one USB port. \nThe payoff has been this tremendous rush of interest in the Eve V, as a device built by power users, for power users. \"We really want to challenge the big guys\" \nIntel found the project \"quite accidentally,\" Karatsevidis says, but was really intrigued by the notion of product development via the wisdom of the crowd, which is a big bet for Eve in the future. \nGoing forward, Karatsevidis says, he's happy to see the Eve V go head-to-head with Microsoft, Asus, Lenovo, and every other PC manufacturer.

Decide whether runbooks, DSC or other alternatives would work best for you.

And today, PowerShell serves as the backbone for the Microsoft Azure Automation service. \nAlthough Azure Automation was initially designed around PowerShell workflows -- a sequence of steps, also known as runbooks, that can execute tasks and commands -- it now also supports declarative patterns. These patterns describe a system or service configuration called Desired State Configuration (DSC) , which was first introduced with PowerShell. \nThese two automation techniques offer different ways to achieve the same goal. Runbooks are like providing turn-by-turn navigational directions to get from point A to point B, while DSC gives GPS mapping software a destination and lets it compute the optimal path to get there. \nHere are some considerations for choosing between the two. Azure Runbooks \nRunbooks in the Microsoft Azure Automation service work just like they do in Windows Server; admins can use PowerShell to control any service with an API. Furthermore, any application that includes a PowerShell module implementing a cmdlet can be controlled via an Azure Automation workflow. Although Automation runbooks are designed to manage Azure services , they can also control resources in private data centers with a feature called Hybrid Runbook Workers. \nAdmins can either create workflows from scratch or tweak those available in the Runbook Gallery. They can also develop custom runbooks in PowerShell code with a text editor or use a graphical UI on the Azure portal. The portal also has an Automation dashboard that shows job activity and error conditions, resource usage and log details for individual jobs. Recommendations and comparisons \nAutomation is key to improve admin efficiency, as well as Azure consistency, reliability and security. Here are some recommendations for more effectively managing Azure via automation: For organizations standardizing on a single public cloud, Azure Automation should be the default home for system administration scripts, as it's tightly integrated with the Azure service portfolio and supports the scripting environment most Windows admins already use. Windows shops already familiar with PowerShell should use it to build Automation runbooks. However, they should also experiment with DSC for some activities, such as keeping VM configurations and patch levels in sync. The risk with this approach is vendor lock-in . Although both Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform support PowerShell, the scripts themselves won't necessarily be reusable. Try and keep code as portable as possible by parameterizing, not hard-coding, Azure-specific API calls or encapsulating Azure-specific code in modules, not the script itself. Linux shops will benefit from learning PowerShell for automation, but can start with the CLI, which works in any shell environment. Multicloud organizations should investigate third-party configuration management software that works across public and private environments. Also, because automation tools play a role in continuous integration and deployment, consult with developers and DevOps teams before making a decision. Azure DSC \nDSC describes the required configuration for an Azure node. It's particularly useful when an organization runs clusters in which multiple nodes share the same configuration, such as load-balanced web frontends or VDI servers. DSC requires a Pull Server that stores configurations and sends them to the Local Configuration Manager (LCM) engine on each managed node. The LCM parses the configuration, compares it to the existing state and executes any required changes using Windows Management Instrumentation. \nAs with runbooks, DSC is a PowerShell script that uses configuration blocks, which admins can use to build custom DSC resources . Microsoft also provides 12 built-in DSC resources, including functions to archive files, write to the event log or manage registry keys. \nWhether using runbooks or DSC, Microsoft Azure Automation is useful for a variety of cloud admin tasks, such as creating and cloning VMs across Azure subscriptions or regions, or configuring and modifying security policies across all machines in a subscription. Azure Automation alternatives \nAdmins can also script Azure using PowerShell or a command-line interface (CLI) from any PC, with the same runbook capabilities listed above. Since PowerShell is now open source, you don't need Windows to use it; there are install packages available for OS X, Ubuntu and CentOS. \nMicrosoft also offers a CLI and open source shell commands for Azure that are available on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The CLI can work with either Azure Resource Manager or the classic Azure management portal. \nAdmins can also use third-party DevOps software, such as Chef, Puppet , Ansible and Salt, to automate Azure resources and manage system installation, configuration, updates, security patches and more. Chef has integrated its software with Azure to simplify the deployment of preconfigured Chef servers from the Azure Marketplace .

      "text": "Microsoft and SAP are longtime business partners. So the two company's say it's not that exceptional that Microsoft decided to implement the SAP SucessFactors Human Capital Management suite. SAP's cloud-based human capital management scored a major new customer recently. Last week, German business software giant announced that Microsoft had selected its SuccessFactors HCM Suite to help manage the latter's workforce. Microsoft will use the SuccessFactors HCM Suite to provide human resources (HR) services and improve employee engagement among its 114,000 full-time employees. eWEEK asked why the Redmond, Wash. software maker turned to SAP instead of using homegrown solutions like its own Dynamics AX HRM capabilities. \"While Dynamics 365 has a robust enterprise offering, key modules in [the] scope of the implementation, including succession planning and learning, are not part of our current offering,\" replied Vivan Mirchandani, senior director, Business Operations at Microsoft. \"Given Microsoft's business needs and requirements, it makes sense to partner with a company that extends our cloud platform and integrates with our ecosystem.\" Mike Ettling, president of SAP SuccessFactors, reminded eWeek that Microsoft and SAP already enjoy a cozy relationship.\"This announcement is a continuation of a longstanding partnership between SAP and Microsoft, including the recent news that SAP has selected Microsoft Azure as a preferred public cloud service for SAP SuccessFactors solutions,\" he said, referring to his company's decision last month to break from tradition and offer the HCM software on a third-party cloud. Over the next five years, SuccessFactors will be available to joint customers using Microsoft's public cloud infrastructure.Furthermore, many of SAP's offerings are already compatible with several Microsoft technologies. \"The history of the SAP-Microsoft partnership includes integrations between Office 365 and SAP SuccessFactors, as well as SAP Fieldglass, SAP Ariba and Concur, broad support for the SAP HANA platform on Azure, and hardware configurations specifically designed for the largest and most demanding SAP workloads,\" Ettling added. SAP acquired SuccessFactors in early 2012 for an estimated $3.4 billion. In February, the company added new continuous performance management capabilities to its SuccessFactors Performance & Goals , the platform's talent management component. In the spring, the company tackled workplace bias with machine-learning and text-mining technologies that enable customers to uncover the often inadvertent signs that bias and patterns of exclusion have taken root in their organizations. More than 6,000 companies use SAP SuccessFactors, including the over 1,350 customers like Microsoft who are also using SuccessFactors Employee Central, a companion collection of HR apps. Ettling said Microsoft's needs mirrored those of other big multinational corporations seeking \"global capabilities, flexibility, extensibility and [an] open platform strategy.\" Notably, the solution also aligns with Microsoft's own cloud- and analytics-focused approach to business software. \"Employee Central goes beyond automation to help businesses manage global workforces more efficiently in the cloud, adding intelligence and insight to the most demanding business priorities,\" said Ettling. \"We're excited that 114,000 people at Microsoft join the community of 45 million users benefiting from our HCM solutions in the cloud, and we look forward to working with Microsoft to help transform how it manages and engages its workforce for business success.\"",

      "title": "December's Free Games With Gold Should Keep You Busy Until Christmas",
      "text": "By William Usher 20 minutes ago \nIt's already that time of the month where Microsoft is giving gamers the heads-up on what new games they can get their hands on for free in December through the Games With Gold program. The four new titles are actually all pretty cool and should keep you busy until Christmas. \nOver on the Major Nelson blog they rolled out details on the four available games for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One for Xbox Live Gold subscribers. \nThere's Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition for the Xbox One that will be available for free between December 1st and December 31st. \nThe original Outlast from Red Barrel will be available between December 16th, 2016 and January 15th, 2017 for the Xbox One. \nXbox 360 gamers will have access to Outland between December 1st and December 15th. The game is also backwards compatible, so even if you don't have an Xbox 360 you can still get the game and play it on the Xbox One. \nLast, but not least, is Criterion Games' Burnout Paradise , the open-world, multiplayer racing game for the Xbox 360, which will be available for free between December 16th and December 31st. \nThat's actually a pretty diverse collection of games. You have a first-person horror game in Outlast , you have a side-scrolling, action-puzzle game in Outland , you have a racing game in Burnout Paradise and you get an awesome open-world, action-martial arts experience with Sleeping Dogs . \nOut of them all, Sleeping Dogs was easily one of the best games I've played throughout all of the seventh generation. In fact, it's one of the few of the many open-world games that I've actually replayed. The only other open-world title that I repeatedly played over and over again was Electronic Arts' _ The Godfather _(The first one, not that crappy sequel). \nHowever, in the case of United Front Games' Hong Kong gangster-drama, it just does so many things so right. The fighting system is actually easy to learn but complex and difficult to master. It's one of the few games that made fighting multiple opponents a real joy and it nearly rivals Assassin's Creed when it comes to cinematically dispatching multiple enemies at one time. That's not to mention that there are some cool John Woo-inspired shootouts, a great set of racing mini-games and tons of smaller side-quests to complete. \nSleeping Dogs was probably the first open-world game I played where I sought out and completed every single side-quest because I enjoyed it so much. It's a really, really amazing game. \nMy only worry about the free games is that Burnout Paradise was a ghost town the last time I played it a few years back. A large part of the game was reliant on the multiplayer aspect, but with no one playing it's going to be tough to convince people to dive back in. Maybe giving the game away for free will revive the online community? It would be a cool way to spend Christmas because it was easily one of Criterion's best, not quite as good as Burnout: Revenge, but it's good. \nOnce again, the free Games With Gold are only available for those who are Xbox Live Gold subscribers.

      "text": "Microsoft's Surface tablets essentially invented the market for laptop/tablet hybrid computers, setting a standard that even Apple ended up following with its iPad Pro.\nNow Eve , a Helsinki-based startup with backing from Intel, thinks it can one-up Microsoft with the Eve V (pronounced \"Eve Vee\") — its own Windows 10-powered take on the Surface Pro, starting at $1399 for preorder via IndieGoGo . \nToday, Eve says so many people lined up to buy the first run of Eve V devices, it actually briefly overwhelmed IndieGoGo's payment processing system. At the time of writing, the Eve V had raised  $722,833, or 964% of its $75,000 goal.  \nEven Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has taken an interest in the Eve V project after reading about it, says Eve CEO Konstantinos Karatsevidis, and will be getting a unit to try out when it starts shipping in February. After all, from Microsoft's perspective, the whole reason it first created the Surface was to inspire PC manufacturers . \n\"[Microsoft] really wanted to see the device,\" Karatsevidis says. Eve \nThe machine is totally finished and functional, thanks to Intel's funding, Eve says; the IndieGoGo campaign is to cover manufacturing costs and handle preorders. \nAt this point, you may be wondering what makes the Eve V so special. If you ask Karatsevidis, the answer is simple: It's all about the community. See, every aspect of the Eve V, from the design to the processor to the keyboard cover material, was decided with full and complete input from Eve's community of fans. \n\"We immediately started to see huge advantages\" The Eve V is actually Eve's second bit of Windows hardware. The first, early 2015's Eve T1, was a budget Windows 8.1 tablet, designed to balance price with performance. At the time, Karatsevidis says, Eve was really just two guys looking to make the kind of gadget they themselves would want to use. \n\"We were pretty unhappy with the products in the market,\" Karatsevidis says. \nEve \nThe Eve T1 got pretty solid reviews , but Karatsevidis says that Eve was getting a ton of feedback, both via e-mail and in the comments sections of press articles about the tablet. A lot of people had a lot of ideas for how the T1 could have been done better.  \nKaratsevidis didn't just welcome the feedback — he rebuilt the company around it. In June 2015, Eve introduced Eve.Community, a site where anybody could register and help guide the company as it worked on its next project, what would become the Eve V. \n\"We immediately started to see huge advantages to this,\" Karatsevidis says. \n\"The community stepped in and stopped us\" Karatsevidis says that there's this tendency in the market, especially when talking about hybrids like the Surface Pro, to focus on sleekness above all else. \nThe problem, Karatsevidis says, is that this sleekness comes at the cost of things that users really care about, like battery life or additional USB and monitor ports. So while Eve's original designs called for something as thin and light as possible, the community came in and set them straight. \nEve \n\"The community kicked in and prevented us from doing so,\" Karatsevidis says. \"As a result, we have a lot of battery life.\" \nNow, Karatsevidis says, he realizes that battery life can make or break a product, \"no joke.\" Similarly, the Eve V sports  Thunderbolt 3, USB-C and 2 full-sized USB-A 3.0 ports, which beats the Surface Pro 4, which only has one USB port. \nThe payoff has been this tremendous rush of interest in the Eve V, as a device built by power users, for power users.\n\"We really want to challenge the big guys\" Intel found the project \"quite accidentally,\"  Karatsevidis says, but was really intrigued by the notion of product development via the wisdom of the crowd, which is a big bet for Eve in the future.  \nGoing forward, Karatsevidis says, he's happy to see the Eve V go head-to-head with Microsoft, Asus, Lenovo, and every other PC manufacturer. But he doesn't see the company stopping there: There's no reason why Eve couldn't apply its approach to crowdsourcing designs for phones, tablets, or even electric vehicles, he says. \nEve \n\"We really want to challenge the big guys,\" Karatsevidis says. \"We want to crowd-develop all kinds of tech with the community.\" \nStill, don't expect to see the Eve V on the shelves at Best Buy or Target any time soon. From Karatsevidis' perspective, a big part of maintaining the relationship with the community is by selling the devices directly to fans. \nNOW WATCH: Everything you need to know about the $3,000 Surface Studio — Microsoft's first desktop PC \n",

      "text": "Microsoft might get to take its last shot at the iPhone after all (MSFT) Matt Weinberger, provided by | on November 22, 2016 \nGetty Images/Andrew Burton \nMicrosoft's dream of making Windows a major player on smartphones is all but dead, with 1% overall market share. \nTellingly, even top executives are signaling that the company is treating Windows 10 Mobile as more of an academic exercise than a serious product. \nAnd yet, a new report from ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley indicates that Microsoft could yet have something up its sleeve: Microsoft is said to be working on a project, to be finished by late 2017, that would let full versions of Windows software run on an ARM processor — the same processors used in the vast majority of smartphones. \nWhile that tech could be used on any Windows phone, this report just adds fuel to the idea that Microsoft is still secretly hard at work on the Surface Phone , the long-rumored device that the company had previously hinted would be a serious contender with Apple's ubiquitous iPhone . \nTo understand why, it helps to know a little history. Continuum \nWindows 10 Mobile's flagship feature is what Microsoft calls \"Continuum.\" \nBasically, you can plug certain Windows phones like the Microsoft Lumia 950 or HP Elite x3 into a display, attach a mouse and keyboard, and use it like a computer. It works, but it's limited to a very few specially-designed apps from Microsoft's anemic Windows Store app market, including the mobile versions of Microsoft Office. \nAccording to various reports and industry whispers over the last year or so, the Surface Phone's breakthrough feature would be the ability to run any piece of Windows software while in that PC-like Continuum mode. \nThat would be a huge deal for large businesses, where the majority of work still gets done on PC software, rather than apps. Given Microsoft's well-documented ability to sell to those same big customers, it would indeed be a competitive threat with the iPhone, at least among professionals. \nGetty Images/Andrew Burton \nBut it's much easier said than done. Smartphones largely use ARM processors, which balance power consumption with performance. Even Apple put an ARM chip to power the Touch Bar in its newest MacBooks , and is rumored to be considering a move to ARM for the processor of future MacBooks. \nThe problem is that Windows for PC, and thus Windows PC software, is designed to run on Intel's trademark x86 processor architecture, only. And facing competitive pressure from ARM and Qualcomm, Intel scuttled plans to build its next major smartphone chip, seemingly sinking the Surface Phone before it was even officially announced . Emulation \nWhat Microsoft is reportedly building is the next-best thing to an Intel-powered phone, given the circumstances. \nIn technical parlance, what Microsoft is said to be building is an \"emulator;\" essentially a way to trick a gadget into thinking it's another gadget. It's similar technology to what Nintendo is using with the NES Classic to get old games to run perfectly on a smaller, more modern console. \nThis emulator would essentially \"trick\" Windows software into thinking it's running on an Intel processor, even if it's actually running on an ARM-powered smartphone. \nGetty Images/Andrew Burton \nThe traditional drawback with emulation is power consumption, since it takes way more processor resources to run software in emulation than it would if it were running as a proper app on that device. It's one thing to run NES games from the eighties in emulation; it's another entirely to use powerful enterprise software, and it would drain any phone's battery in a heartbeat. \nBut, as Ars Technica's Peter Bright points out , that's not such a huge deal if you're using the hypothetical Surface Phone in Continuum mode, since you'll probably be plugged into the wall anyway. \nThe Surface Phone still isn't a sure thing, especially given Microsoft's recent trepidation to talk about any kinds of plans for mobile. From a technology perspective, though, it seems that things are slowly but surely starting to come together, if and when Microsoft decides to take what could well be its last shot at mobile dominance. \nMicrosoft declined to comment.",

      "title": "Telemetry will not tell Microsoft why I have to open Chrome to save an image",
      "text": "\n\nIn a blog post Microsoft explained that in the fight to balance user friendliness with power, they have decided to hide browser developer tools by default from the right-click menu in Edge, until developers enable them in About:flags or by invoking developer tools via keyboard shortcuts (F12 & CTRL+SHIFT+I) or from the “…” menu in Microsoft Edge.\nTelemetry has told Microsoft that most visits to the Inspect Elements menu was by accident and not by web developers, which justified the change, helpful when menu items are larger by default on Windows 10 to maintain finger friendliness.\n\nAs one of the few who use Edge as my main browser, I fear this plan to shave functionality from the browser (justified by telemetry) will not detect users who have to switch to another browser to complete a task.\nIn the above picture I wish to open the image in a new tab ( adding :orig to the url gives you the original size uncompressed image ) , something which is easily possible on Chrome but impossible in Edge.\nOf course popping into Chrome to complete a task is not a big deal, but the reasons forcing this will never detect via Microsoft’s Edge telemetry, especially when most of the power users who need these features have probably switched it off.\nMicrosoft has found some success with plugins by cloning Google Chrome’s plugin interface. I wish to urge Microsoft once again to consider doing the same with the features and functionality of Chrome. There should be no reason why some-one needs to switch to another browser to complete a task, particularly when it comes to something as simple as opening an image in a new tab.",

      "text": "(Microsoft Photo) Xbox One players will soon be able to strap on an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset to further immerse themselves in their games.\nMicrosoft announced today that a long-planned concept to stream Xbox One games on Rift headsets will debut Dec. 12. Gamers can download the Xbox One Streaming to Oculus Rift app from the Oculus store and then run the games on the virtual reality headsets via their home networks.\n“Once connected, your console’s video output is streamed to your Rift headset and projected onto a massive screen in your choice of one of three immersive VR environments: Citadel, Retreat and Dome,” Kevin Unangst, senior director of global marketing at Xbox, wrote in a blog post Tuesday.\nVR streaming is the next step in Microsoft’s quest to make it easier to game across multiple devices. Xbox previously made it possible stream games from the company’s home console to any Windows 10 PC or tablet.\nEach Rift headset ships with an Xbox One controller, so game designers can design with that in mind. The Oculus runs natively on Windows 10, which Xbox says makes VR streaming easy to set up.\nMicrosoft has a partnership with Facebook-owned Oculus despite the fact that it is making its own headset, HoloLens . HoloLens, Microsoft has said, is a mixed reality device that doesn’t compete directly with virtual reality headsets like HTC Vive, Rift and others.",

      "text": "Holiday shoppers can score big discounts on Microsoft Surface devices, except for the company's new and in-demand Surface Studio all-in-one PC. Microsoft has started its Black Friday sale a little early this year, but buyers hoping to save some cash on the company's newly announced Surface Studio are out of luck. Surface Studio , the company's first all-in-one PC designed for designers, digital artists and other creative professionals, is only available for preorder at its full price. Shoppers who reserve a unit now won't receive it until early 2017, according to the company's online store. However, those eyeing Surface Pro 4 tablets and Surface Books can save upwards of $400 in some cases during the sales period. Surface Pro 4 tablets with an Intel Core i5 processor and 128GB of storage are now available for $799, a savings of $200. The base Surface Book 2-in-1 laptop is available now for $1,249, or $250 off its MSRP. Waiting a couple of days yields even bigger savings.On Thanksgiving Day (Nov. 24) and running through Cyber Monday (Nov. 28), Microsoft is slashing the price of the Surface Book i5 256GB model by $400. Its retail partner Best Buy is offering an exclusive Surface Pro 4 Core M model with 128GB of storage and a Signature Type Cover for $599. Also on Nov. 24, the company is offering the Surface Pro 4 Core i5 with 256GB of onboard storage and 8GB of RAM for $999, complete with a Type Cover. This model normally costs $1,299 for the tablet alone.For the gamers on the gift list, Microsoft will cut the price of any Xbox One S bundle by $50 between Nov. 24 and Nov. 28. First introduced during the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles in June, the upgraded video game console features High Dynamic Range (HDR) support and 4K output, albeit only for video content and not gameplay. Finally, fans of Microsoft smartphones can pick up an unlocked Lumia 950XL handset ($499) and get an unlocked Lumia 950 and a Microsoft Display Dock at no added cost. Shoppers who prefer the competition from Cupertino may be in luck this year. After sitting out Black Friday last year, Apple is teasing a one-day shopping event on its website. \"Friday can't come soon enough,\" reads the new webpage , which shows an image of an Apple Watch displaying a \"save the date\" notification for Nov. 25. \"Our one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to check everyone off your list.\" Apple already held a sale of sorts earlier this month when it slashed the price of its USB-C adapters after the late-October launch of the company's new MacBook Pros. Featuring a slimmer profile and a new Touch Bar that replaces the function keys on all but the base 13-inch model, the latest flagship laptops from Apple also dispense with many of the legacy ports that customers use to connect their equipment and accessories. To mend fences, Apple is offering reduced pricing on its USB-C and adapters through the end of 2016.",

      "text": "Microsoft Word: Control your pasting with this alternate approach By J. Carlton Collins, CPA Related Information Management and Technology Assurance Q. When I copy text from the internet and paste it into a Word document (using Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V), sometimes the results are properly formatted, and other times the formatting is so arcane that it seems easier to simply retype the text. Why is that? A. By default, Windows copies and pastes both text and formatting from one window to the next (from a browser window to a Word or Excel window, for example). In many cases your best copy - and - paste results are achieved by pasting the copied contents by hitting the Alt key and then the H, V, and T keys in succession. (This command produces the same result as pasting using the Home tab's Paste , Paste Special , Keep Text Only command, but it's quicker.) The result of this action is that the pasted content adopts the default format for the target location; for example, if you copy 9 - point , red, Verdana font text from a browser and paste it into a Word document (using the Alt+H, V, T combination) with a default 12 - point , black, Times New Roman font text, then the pasted results will automatically adopt and display the 12 - point , black, Times New Roman font format. \nAbout the author \nJ.

      "title": "Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella wants to build the ‘the ultimate mobile device’",
      "text": "\nMany Microsoft execs have been spoken of building new category of devices lately. This, of course, includes Satya Nadella. In a recent interview, Nadella acknowledged the fact that Microsoft missed the “mobile boom”. In another recent interview with Australia’s Financial Review , Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella stated the company will “continue to be in the phone market” with unique features and the “most ultimate mobile device”. Nadella’s likely suggesting that the firm wants to build products like the Surface Pro and Surface Studio which bring new elements to the market rather than just being yet another “me-too” product. Here’s the statement:\n“We don’t want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That’s where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI. We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device,”\nHe also added that Microsoft stopped investing in projects that were “me-too” and started focusing on projects that were focused on a niche market with products (e.g. the Surface Studio) that can be differentiated:\n“Therefore [with Nokia assets], we stopped doing things that were me-too and started doing things, even if they are today very sub-scale, to be very focused on a specific set of customers who need a specific set of capabilities that are differentiated and that we can do a good job of.”\nThis isn’t anything surprising to see, Microsoft already rebooted its mobile platform a couple of times but it never really succeeded in breaking in into the mobile market. The company likely wants to do what it did a few years ago with the Surface Pro devices — bringing something unique to the market that can be differentiated, and something the company can “do a good job of” — even if it’s a niche market.\nWhat Microsoft plans to do isn’t yet known, of course. We recently reported that the company is looking into bringing x86 emulation for ARM64 based devices to Windows 10 with Redstone 3, which will bring a lot of power to Windows 10 Mobile’s Continuum feature. We’re also told by our sources that the company is internally investing on another project which might be related to Microsoft’s plans for the “ultimate” mobile device to the smartphone market, but details are pretty scarce at the moment.\n",

      "text": "\nAs a part of our mission to make the web a better experience for all Windows customers, we spend a lot of time looking for ways to improve the Microsoft Edge user experience for end users and developers alike. Introducing a “soft developer mode” for Microsoft Edge \nStarting with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, we introduced a change to how developer items are represented in the Microsoft Edge context menu. This change is designed to reduce end user confusion and accidental invocation of the F12 Developer Tools, while preserving full fidelity for developers and minimizing the need for settings toggles. \nThe Windows 10 Anniversary Update introduces a “soft developer mode,” which disables context menu entries for the F12 Developer Tools by default. Developer-specific options like “View Source”, and “Inspect Element” are hidden, but developers will still be able to open the developer tools using the keyboard shortcuts (F12 & CTRL+SHIFT+I) or from the “…” menu in Microsoft Edge. \nThe first time a user invokes the F12 Developer Tools, they will be alerted that the developer tools have been enabled and developer options will be shown in the context menu, with an option to undo the change. \nThis setting can also be configured manually in about:flags: The motivation and data behind this change \nIn recent customer studies, we found many non-developer users of Microsoft Edge were confused by accidentally invoking the F12 Developer Tools. Specifically, we saw user confusion about the “Inspect element” item in the right-click context menu. Correlating this feedback with our telemetry data, we found a significant number of sessions lasting less than 15 seconds in duration with 5 or less actions taken within the F12 Developer Tools. This usage pattern made it clear to us that there was room for improvement. \nWe expect this change to provide a better experience to the overwhelming majority of Microsoft Edge users, while surfacing developer context menu items in a convenient and persistent way to the users who need them – the web is for everyone, not just developers. \nWe look forward to any feedback on this change in the comments below or on Twitter @MSEdgeDev .

      "text": "Published 25 min ago Walmart offers the Microsoft Surface Dock for Surface Pro 3, 4, or Book , model no. PD9-00003, for $124.99 with free shipping . (For Prime members, Amazon charges the same.) That's tied with our mention from two weeks ago as the lowest total price we've seen. (It's also the best deal now by $24.) The dock acts as a charger and features two mini DisplayPorts, Gigabit Ethernet, four USB 3.0 ports, and audio jack.",

      "text": "cortana gets new list skill holidays cortanaface More Microsoft’s Cortana personal digital assistant offers a nice set of functionalities today. She provides a machine-intelligence-backed voice response system for searches, roots through email to offer up suggestions for upcoming events and package deliveries, and ties systems together with reminders that can be set on one device and show up everywhere.\nCortana is also largely a back-end system, meaning that adding features and functionality to the personal assistant is as easy as flipping a switch on Microsoft servers. This is particularly helpful as holidays and other important events roll around, and a new list skill is being rolled out just in time for the upcoming holiday season, as Microsoft lets us know via a Windows blog post.\nMore: Cortana wants to get to know you better to improve her interactivity\nGiven that December brings a number of holidays that involve gift-giving worldwide, of which Christmas is just one, PC users around the globe are likely already cleaning up their shopping lists. Now, Cortana is hoping to make the task of managing the hectic process of matching loved ones, business associates, teachers, and others with their wish lists just a little bit easier.\ncortana_list_holiday_survival_ More Starting today, you can simply ask Cortana to make a new list and she’ll respond accordingly. Once a list has been created, you can ask Cortana to add an item and she’ll do so, and opening a list is just a “Hey Cortana” away. Because Cortana runs on iOS, Android, and Windows 10 devices, she’ll also keep your lists synced and up to date no matter which of them you’re using.\nFor even more complex lists, Cortana also works with Microsoft’s Wunderlist task manager. Connect Cortana to your Wunderlist account, and you can use Cortana to create tasks in that app for even more list-management functionality.\nYou can give the new Cortana list skill a try by saying, “Hey Cortana, create a holiday list.” Stay tuned to the Microsoft blog for more holiday fun, as the company is known for using Cortana as the conduit for adding some personality to Windows 10 as holidays roll around.\nHow to take control of the Action Center in Windows 10 Microsoft's new speech recognition system achieves human parity in audible words MacOS Sierra review",

      "text": "Bill Roberson/Digital Trends\nAs part of Microsoft’s ongoing partnership with Oculus, Rift owners are in for a treat come December. The VR headset will support streaming games from your Xbox One or Windows 10 via a free app that will hit the Windows and Xbox Stores on December 12. Get ready to experience your favorite games in virtual reality — sort of.\nIt’s exciting news for Rift owners, but don’t get your hopes up — it doesn’t mean you’ll be playing your games in VR. Well, you will, just not the way you might think. The Rift app essentially creates a VR environment in which you can play your games, the app reportedly includes three different environments you can immerse yourself in while you immerse yourself in your games.\nMore: Turns out virtual reality may soon be used to prepare patients for full human head transplants\nThe Rift app effectively mimics a gigantic screen in one of three VR environments: Citadel, Retreat, or Dome. From that screen, you can stream any of your Windows 10 or Xbox One streamable titles like Gears of War 4 and Forza Horizon 3 .\nThe partnership between Microsoft and Oculus has been ongoing ever since the launch of the Oculus Rift, which shipped with an Xbox One controller in the place of the then-forthcoming Oculus Touch controllers. The Rift app will be the next step in that relationship, and it comes at an interesting time just after the release of the PSVR and PS4 Pro.\nAccording to the Xbox news release you can give it a try at a few different retail locations this holiday season, in case you’re not quite sold on the Xbox One and Oculus Rift partnership. It’s a step in the right direction, and the closest you’re likely to get to a fully VR version of Halo 5: Guardians for the time being.\nWindows 10 Creators Update lets you dominate your friends in custom tournaments PlayStation VR can play 2D games from Xbox One, Wii U, and PC Eyeing the new Oculus Touch controller? Here’s everything you need to know",

Well its pretty easy to misinterpret that, even when giving it your best shot at pronouncing it correctly, something that Microsoft PR rep Larry Hryb recognized, as he was quick to issue an apology before the message has insulted someone.\nToday we sent a DR4 email where a zombie roar was interpreted by many as a racial slur. We apologize and promise to do better next time.\n— / Larry Hryb / + 1m (@majornelson) November 22, 2016 \n\nThough no one has yet to officially complain about the dubious subject line meant to advertise the upcoming fourth installment of open-world zombie apocalypse game ‘Dead Rising’, it may have been a good idea for Microsoft to clean this up before it got any messier, especially after the company sent out an email invite for one of its recruitment events that contained phrases like ‘hella nom’, ‘lots of dranks’ and ‘getting lit’. \nThough this was an accident on the company’s part, lets hope that this behavior does not become the norm from the Redmond giant.

      "text": "During the Connect(); // 2016 , the Windows team talked about the Universal Windows Platform and about some of the great tooling improvements that have happened in recent months.\nKevin Gallo, VP and Program Manager Director of the Windows Platform team, was joined by Mazhar Mohammed and Dave Alles for an hour-long panel discussion and Q&A on Channel 9. Mazhar is the Director of Partner Services of for the Windows Store team, and Dave is the Group Program Manager for the team that created the Maps app for Windows.\nCheck out the video below to see the interesting conversation between leaders of the teams that create the Windows Platform and the Store, and one of the teams that uses both in creating a major Windows app. Kevin talks about why developers should target UWP, while Mazhar discusses the constant improvements in the Store and Dev Center . Dave talks about what a 1 st -party app thinks about new features, and interacts with the platform team to provide feedback and request functionality. This is actually very similar to the way external developers provide input and feedback via UserVoice !\nIn the keynote, Stacey Doerr joined Scott Hanselman on stage to talk about automated UI testing of Windows apps using WinAppDriver and Appium. This isn’t just for testing UWP apps, but all Windows applications, including applications built in VB6 or Delphi and more. For more details about WinAppDriver, check out Yosef’s in-depth blog post: Windows Application Driver for PC integrates with Appium . Scott also has a great overview on getting started tested on Windows with Appium .\nThe Windows teams also did the following four presentations to provide deeper dives into the Desktop Bridge and a set of new and improved developer tooling capabilities:\nUsing the Desktop Bridge to bring desktop apps to the Windows Store with Stefan Wick Improvements to Bash on Windows and the Windows Console with Rich Turner Windows Device Portal with Hirsch Singhal Improving App Quality with UI Automation with Yosef Durr Updated November 22, 2016 5:26 pm",

The rebranded phones will retain Lumia features such as ClearBlack screens as well as Glance and others. (Photo : Upcoming Smart Phone Review/YouTube) \nIt is rumored that Windows Surface phone will be released in 2017. This is going to be a big leap from the last Windows 10 phone release. The Windows Surface Phone will be based on the old Lumia handsets. The rebranded phones will retain Lumia features such as ClearBlack screens as well as Glance and others. Advertisement \nAlso expected to be released with the Windows Surface phone is the improved Microsoft Surface Pro 5 tablet-laptop hybrid. Windows has put a lot of effort into the Surface hybrid series. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is expected to pack more features, especially since it will be using Windows 10 and coming on the heels of the Surface Studio. \nNewseveryday mentioned that these both devices Windows Surface phone and Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will be announced during the 2017 Mobile World Congress. In the meantime, the company is busy with upgrades to the current Surface Pro 4. Some may see this as a confusing signal, because it does not make sense to upgrade the current crop of product, if the new one will be released soon. \nWindows phones have had a history of flat sales since it was first released. It has not made any dent in smartphone sales in terms of volume or in revenue. It has been reported that the total market share of all phones running Microsoft Windows is at 1%. If the new release proves a success, these numbers might increase a little bit. Microsoft Shareholder Letter Has Us Thinking About A Surface Phone http://t.co/xHqS3VlJ \n— Pocketnow (@Pocketnow) October 10, 2012 \nAccording to PCWorld , there were earlier rumors that the Windows Surface phone would be released last October. However, there was no mention of a phone during the October press event where the Surface Studio was announced. \nMSPowerUser also reported that there was also a rumor that Microsoft is partnering with HP in the development of a Windows 10 phone.

      "text": "microsoft xbox one vr streaming oculus rift on matt wideview More Bill Roberson/Digital Trends\nAs part of Microsoft’s ongoing partnership with Oculus, Rift owners are in for a treat come December. The VR headset will support streaming games from your Xbox One or Windows 10 via a free app that will hit the Windows and Xbox Stores on December 12. Get ready to experience your favorite games in virtual reality — sort of.\nIt’s exciting news for Rift owners, but don’t get your hopes up — it doesn’t mean you’ll be playing your games in VR. Well, you will, just not the way you might think. The Rift app essentially creates a VR environment in which you can play your games, the app reportedly includes three different environments you can immerse yourself in while you immerse yourself in your games.\nMore: Turns out virtual reality may soon be used to prepare patients for full human head transplants\nThe Rift app effectively mimics a gigantic screen in one of three VR environments: Citadel, Retreat, or Dome. From that screen, you can stream any of your Windows 10 or Xbox One streamable titles like Gears of War 4 and Forza Horizon 3 .\nThe partnership between Microsoft and Oculus has been ongoing ever since the launch of the Oculus Rift, which shipped with an Xbox One controller in the place of the then-forthcoming Oculus Touch controllers. The Rift app will be the next step in that relationship, and it comes at an interesting time just after the release of the PSVR and PS4 Pro.\nAccording to the Xbox news release you can give it a try at a few different retail locations this holiday season, in case you’re not quite sold on the Xbox One and Oculus Rift partnership. It’s a step in the right direction, and the closest you’re likely to get to a fully VR version of Halo 5: Guardians for the time being.\nWindows 10 Creators Update lets you dominate your friends in custom tournaments PlayStation VR can play 2D games from Xbox One, Wii U, and PC Eyeing the new Oculus Touch controller? Here’s everything you need to know",

      "text": "Print Message It is good to see in this month's issue of Architecture Magazine the new architecture school at Kent State University. The Photos of the studio class show every desk out fitted with a drawing board, covered in our typical green protective vinyl, and each board has a parallel edge attached. That tells me some one is still teaching hand drawing!!! I saw one desk with a computer. I am 67 and I still draw by hand. I too have a subscription to Revit and Autocad that I keep up every year and when I need to work on a project I draw up the project by hand and have a student draw it in CAD. I too work on small homes and apartment buildings. Original Message Original Message I've been using Revit for 10 years now...and quite successfully on small projects. I would love to take a project mobile by getting a Surface with Revit installed. Then I can take the entire model to a client, allowing us to collaboratively explore the model through 2d views, 3d perspectives, etc....all generated on the fly with Surface. My question...does anyone have experience with running Revit on Surface? Does Surface have enough power/processing strength to manipulate a Revit model? Similarly, I'm interested in creating new 3d projections, sections, etc. \"on the fly\" in front of the client. None of this works if Surface is bogged down by Revit and it can't perform. Surprise, Microsoft says it has plenty of power, but any \"on the ground\" experience and input is welcome! Axios Architecture LLC | 2218 Lebaron Drive | Atlanta, Georgia | 30345 | 404/636-0611",

      "text": "microsoft patent application touch based accessory ifa More Earlier this year, Apple launched a refresh of its MacBook Pro laptop that featured an OLED Touch Bar in place of the traditional functional keys. Now, a patent application might have revealed that Microsoft has plans to field a similar product.\nIn July 2016, Microsoft applied for a patent on a “keyboard with input-sensitive display device,” according to a report from MS Power User . Attached images show a tablet-like screen being used in conjunction with a standard keyboard to allow different types of input beyond that of the Roman alphabet.\nmicrosoft-keyboard More U.S. Patent & Trademark Office\nThe device is intended to make text entry easier for users working with character-based and phonics-based languages, which are prevalent in Asia. The patent states that the error rate for this kind of text input on a standard QWERTY keyboard can be as high as 20 percent for the average individual, a figure that could perhaps be cut by implementing a peripheral of this kind.\nThere simply aren’t enough keys on a standard keyboard to represent each possible character in many such languages, so the process of typing is typically peppered with breaks to choose the desired option from an on-screen menu. Microsoft’s device could cut down on the time lost by users as they switch from keyboard to mouse and back again, as they could choose the right option with a simple tap of the touchscreen.\nMore: No screen’s too small for Doom : Classic game now playable on MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar\nLike Apple’s Touch Bar, the peripheral could be implemented in a variety of different ways. Images attached to the application show the device being used to operate menus that would typically be displayed on the primary monitor.\nMicrosoft has been bullish about new accessories as of late, so it will be interesting to see what becomes of this project. On the one hand, it could be a specialty peripheral aimed squarely at users who work with non-Roman languages, but it could also be used as a direct competitor to the Touch Bar that’s sold as a separate peripheral.\nApple’s new MacBook Pro Touch Bar is powered by a variant of WatchOS MacBook Pro 15 (with Touch Bar): Our first take Check out Apple’s touchy new OLED bar mounted in the new MacBook Pro laptops",

      "text": "More than $10 million has been saved every year and emissions reduced by the equivalent of 7.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide through investments in energy efficiency, green power and carbon offset community projects, software giant Microsoft says in a new report. The company, which set a voluntary internal carbon fee four years ago, says its carbon-neutral initiatives have impacted more than 3.2 million people in emerging nations.\nIt has purchased more than 10 billion kilowatt-hours of ‘green power’ for lighting up its offices since July 2012. These facts came to light in its white paper that was released at the just concluded COP-22 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Marrakech in Morocco. “We seek to serve as a model in our commitment to environmental sustainability by delivering on our carbon neutrality commitment and uncovering new ways technology can help us better understand our planet,” says the paper, quoting Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\nIt says the company’s goal is to reach a point where all greenhouse gas emissions are safely absorbed by healthy forests, soils, and other natural or nature-based infrastructure. “Since we implemented the carbon fee (July 2012), we have reinvested a portion of the carbon fee investment fund into our company through a range of internal carbon reduction initiatives, such as lighting equipment upgrades and e-waste recycling,” says the paper.\n“Specifically, part of the cost of energy that we consume from carbon-based sources is ultimately redirected to invest in projects that reduce the environmental impact of our operationally controlled facilities.” The paper says that since the launch of the programme, the company has funded over 60 projects in 23 countries by investing more than $2 million. To establish the price on carbon, the company has a Carbon Neutral Council, a cross-corporate group that provides feedback on and buy-in to the programme.\nTo retire its e-waste appropriately, the company has recycled over 400,000 assets and reused over 350,000 assets in the US alone. The programme also supports additional recycling and reuse in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. To light up its offices, the company is switching over to renewable sources.\nIn November 2013, the company signed a long-term agreement with RES Americas to purchase 100 percent of the energy from the Keechi Wind Project, a 110-megawatt facility in Texas. Similar pacts were also signed with other renewable companies.\nIANS \nThe post Microsoft saves more than $10 million every year by being environmentally friendly appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Microsoft “offers EU hardware, software LinkedIn concessions” November 22, 2016 - 16:11   Microsoft (MSFT.O) will still allow LinkedIn's (LNKD.N) rivals access to its software and give hardware makers the option of installing other services to try to win EU approval for its takeover of the U.S. firm, people familiar with the matter said, according to Reuters. \nThe U.S. software company submitted its LinkedIn concessions to the European Commission last week after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the $26 billion deal, Microsoft's biggest ever acquisition. \nThe offer aims to show that Microsoft will not favor LinkedIn at the expense of rivals, the people said, in an attempt to address a key concern for regulators. \nBoth the Commission and Microsoft, which have not provided details of the offer, declined to comment on Monday. \nThe EU is now seeking feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open an investigation which can take up to five months. They have until Tuesday to do so. The Commission is scheduled to rule on the deal by Dec. 6. \nProfessional social networks which have access to Microsoft's API (application program interface) will continue to have this facility once LinkedIn becomes part of the company, the people said. \nThe other key element of the company's concessions is the option for computer hardware makers to install either LinkedIn or rival networks on computers, indicating that the company is keen to avoid any suggestion of packaging products to crush competitors. \nMicrosoft's website shows it has software deals with hardware makers such as Dell, HP (HPE.N), Lenovo (0992.HK), Acer (2353.TW) and Huawei [HWT.UL], among others. \nThe Commission has fined Microsoft more than 2.2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) over the past decade for various infringements, one of them being the tying of some products to its Windows operating system to stifle competition. \nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.

      "text": "A specially crafted web-page can cause Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 toattempt to read data beyond the boundaries of a memory allocation. Theissue does not appear to be easily exploitable.Known affected software, attack vectors and mitigations An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling Javascript should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.DescriptionThe issue requires rather complex manipulation of the DOM and results inreading a value immediately following an object. The lower three bits ofthis value are returned by the function doing the reading, resulting ina return value in the range 0-7. After exhaustively skipping over theread AV and having that function return each value, no other sideeffects were noticed. For that reason I assume this issue is hard if notimpossible to exploit and did not investigate further. It is stillpossible that there may be subtle effects that I did not notice thatallow exploitation in some form or other.Time-line**June 2014*: This vulnerability was found through fuzzing.**October 2014*: This vulnerability was submitted to ZDI.**October 2014*: This vulnerability was rejected by ZDI.**November 2014*: This vulnerability was reported to MSRC.**February 2015*: This vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft in MS15-009.**November 2016*: Details of this issue are released.Cheers,",

      "text": "up vote 0 down vote favorite \nI've created a DocumentDB instance on Microsoft Azure, but I'm unable to connect to it from MongoDB Compass (or MongoVUE). In MongoDB Compass, I've entered all of the connection parameters and it is logging in, however then it opens a windows which just sits there with a loading icon forever. I can connect to a MongoDB instance on the local machine, so I know that works. Is MongoDB Compass incompatible with DocumentDB for some reason? Is there another tool that I can use to connect and browse my DocumentDB instance? screenshot",

      "text": "By William Usher 6 minutes ago \nMicrosoft had announced previously that they were collaborating with Oculus for the Rift, the VR company's newest VR headset. Well, now we're starting to see how that connection is coming to fruition with a brand new update that will allow Oculus Rift gamers to stream Xbox games to the headset. \nOver on the official Xbox Newswire , Microsoft announced that Windows 10 users can use the Xbox app to stream Xbox One and Xbox 360 backwards compatible games to their desktop computer. Not only that, but if you have an Oculus Rift the app will setup a viewing hub so that you can view the Xbox One games and Xbox 360 backwards compatible titles in VR. \nIf you have your Xbox One connected to your Windows 10 desktop computer through the home network setup along with using the free Xbox app for Windows 10, you'll be able to easily stream the games to your Oculus Rift. \nThis is part of the continued relationship shared between Microsoft and Oculus, which was announced earlier this year when Microsoft included free Xbox controllers into the bundle with the Oculus Rift before the Oculus Touch motion controllers were released. This allowed users to make use of the VR headset while the Touch controllers were still being ironed out and prepped for release. \nThis partnership between Microsoft and Oculus has a lot of people suspecting that there may be a further announcement next year where the Oculus Rift will be usable on the Xbox Scorpio , the codename for the mid-generation refresh from Microsoft. The Xbox Scorpio will still be able to play Xbox One games but will have a beefier GPU on the APU and more processing power and RAM to spare for dedicated gaming purposes. \nThe article detailing the feature isn't very long, but they do provide a few images of what the play experience will be like. Essentially Oculus Rift users will be taken to a virtual theater hub where they can play their games, interact with their buddies on the friends list and essentially utilize all of the features present on the Xbox One through the virtual hub. \nGiven that you aren't actually seeing the game in full screen mode like other VR titles, I do wonder if this will limit the amount of nausea that some people suffer from when playing VR titles or if it will dampen the effects of frame-rate stutter and frame drops? \nWe don't have a lot of information on benchmarks when playing games through these virtual hubs. They also exist on Steam as well, where gamers can download apps like the Retro Arcade and play games using the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift as if the games were being played right there on the arcade machines. Again, the games aren't played in full screen and that could help limit the effects of VR sickness. \nEither way, gamers who own a Windows 10 desktop and have an Oculus Rift can make use of the Xbox app right now and start playing their games through the new VR theater.

      "text": "For the Holidays, Give the Gift of a Tablet Microsoft Surface Book Intel Core i7 \nUnlike most of today’s 2-in-1’s, the Surface Book doesn’t have a detachable keyboard — instead, it flips 360 degrees and rests against the Surface Book’s display. The 2-in-1 is also extremely powerful, running Windows 10 Pro on the Intel’s latest Core i7 professor, and has a beautiful display, with a pro-grade Nvidia GeForce dGPU. Plus it has the memory and storage capacity to handle a heavy workload. And instead of that Touch Bar, try a full-screen PixelSense touch-screen display. Display: 13.5-inch PixelSense touchscreen display (3,000 x 2,000) resolution Resolution: 3,000 x 2,000 resolution Processor: 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 OS: Windows 10 Pro Ports: 2 USB 3.0, full-size SD card reader, 2 Surface Connect Memory: 16GB RAM Buy Now: $2,699 Dell XPS 15 \nThe XPS 15 beats the new MacBook Pro’s in several ways. It has a 4K touchscreen display — Apple’s new Pro has neither 4K nor touch functionality. It has twice the memory (32GB) and just as much storage (256GB), and a variety of ports: Thunderbolt 3, USB 3.0, HDMI and an SD card reader. Display: 15.6-inch FHD InfinityEdge Processor: up to 3.5 GHz Intel Core i7-6700HQ Quad Core OS: Windows 10 Home Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M with 2GB GDDR5 Memory: up to 32GB RAM Storage (SSD): 256GB SSD Buy Now: $1,850 Asus ZenBook 3 UX390UA \nThe ZenBook 3 is Asus’s latest from the ultra-portable ZenBook line. At just two pounds and less than 0.5 inches in width, it’s lighter and thinner than anything in Apple’s new MacBook Pro line. It also comes with plenty of power in the form of an Intel Core i7 processor, despite the lean frame. Specs",
