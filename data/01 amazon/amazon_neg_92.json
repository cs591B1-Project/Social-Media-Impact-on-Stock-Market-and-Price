      "text": "By John Tamny \nThe majority of alarmist headlines yesterday were all about Seattle, WA-based Amazon's latest profit-making venture. Expanding its operations into the grocery space, the retailer is set to open stores sans checkout clerks. Upon entry in Amazon Go stores set to be opened to the public in the next year, customers will choose items for purchase only to be billed electronically. The days of long checkout lines may well be over with if the experiment succeeds. \nReaders can probably imagine that what's great for the customer is apparently not great for the typical American worker if traditional media are to be believed. As the New York Post put it, Amazon's entrance into groceries will \"automate American workers out of existence.\" And if the Daily Caller's Christopher Bedford is to be taken seriously, this erasure of the human element that has forever defined shopping is a ‘this time is different' scenario that foretells mass unemployment for the non-elites presently earning their keep in this sliver of the service sector. President-elect Donald Trump must have a plan in place to penalize Amazon's latest job-killing stab at productivity? \nBack to reality, and reason , it should be pointed out up front what was mentioned previously; specifically that Amazon is based in Seattle. This requires mention simply because in the past, Seattle's wealth was a function of human-conducted manufacturing. But thanks to economic progress, the traditional, manufacturing-based work that had employed so much of its citizenry no longer exists. If the media hysteria of the present is to be taken at all seriously, Seattle still hasn't recovered from the loss of manufacturing jobs decades ago. \nBut that's not what happened. In fact, Seattle is an excellent destination today for individuals of all skill sets who are desirous of well-paid work. A city defined by technological innovation that is always and everywhere an enemy of the jobs of the present, Seattle is but one of many U.S. cities that Americans move to in order to cure their unemployment. \nWhat explains this? Figure that technological advances are all about job destruction . While at least half of all Americans worked on farms 150 years ago, the introduction of the primitive robot that we call a tractor rendered the vast majority of farm work redundant. Looking at technology in the bigger picture, the car, airplane, computer, internet and ATM list among the biggest job-destroyers in the history of commerce. Yet despite their ubiquity in what is the world's richest country, Americans are known around the world as intensely work focused; so much so that the companies of the present are increasingly demanding that their workers take the paid vacation that is but one perk of their employment. \nWhat does this seeming paradox tell us? Quite explicitly it tells us that jobs are most plentiful in the locales where they're most readily being destroyed. Getting right to the point, willing workers in tech outposts like Seattle enjoy feverish bidding for their skills precisely because the city's brightest technological minds are constantly pushing into the past the work of the present. \nConversely, it's in the locales where the nature of work is changing the least that jobs are least plentiful. Contrary to what we're told by politicians on both sides of the aisle, unemployment is highest in the very locales where the nature of work is most static. That this is true shouldn't surprise those passably familiar with the genius of Adam Smith; Smith the too-frequently forgotten seer who would be mystified by all the confused rhetoric from modern politicians so eager to bring back the jobs of the past. \nSmith knew well that stationary, or backwards economies, are always defined by economic decline. Smith understood that the investors who create all jobs studiously avoid the stationary economies, and instead direct their resources to the areas most defined by change. And advance. Investors direct their resources with great gusto toward the locales most focused on automating work presently performed by human beings. \nThe fact that manufacturing work long ago departed Seattle as the principal source of its wealth explains why much better jobs are abundant there now. At the same time, the towns and cities of today in which manufacturing is the primary employer are the ones in which it's most difficult to find work. Investment is always and everywhere the driver of company and job creation, and investors studiously avoid commercial concepts and locales bent on re-creating what used to be remunerative. That Amazon Go has the potential to erase traditional retail work is a certain sign that new forms of work will replace what Amazon's innovations will render yesterday's news. \nTo understand why, we must never forget that while we go to work and produce each day for dollars, our work in truth represents our demand for all the goods we don't have. Looked at in terms of robots and automation, there would exist no investment in either if the result were going to be mass unemployment. In reality, and this is what modern luddites miss, robots and other forms of automation are a certain signal that much better, and much higher-paying work will immediately replace the jobs lost to automation. \nAutomation by its very name foretells a future of abundant goods and services created by machines, but that it does also foretells immensely productive human labor that will pay for the plenty created by those machines. Sorry, but if robots were truly the future driver of mass unemployment, simple logic dictates that no profit-interested business would invest in them to begin with. In short, the ongoing rise of automation tautologically signals a very exciting work future for human beings that will include all manner of jobs previously unimagined. \nThe mistaken thinking that says robots will impoverish us is rooted in the falsehood that says the work of today predicts the work of tomorrow. But as the tractor and computer's destruction of traditional employment from the past remind us in blinding fashion, that which destroys work through increased productivity begets all manner of new forms of employment. \nLooking at Amazon specifically, automated grocery stores signal much greater profit margins for the company; those profits driving the very investment that is the source of all job creation in the first place. Investors once again rush in the direction of productivity, so if U.S. companies prove adept at doing a great deal more with fewer human inputs, investment will flow toward them on the way to myriad new advances that will employ the very people displaced by automation. \nThe silly notion that robots and automation will render humans unemployable amounts to \"fake news\" of the worst kind. In truth, an unwillingness forego human labor will be the biggest driver of joblessness simply because a lack of productivity is an investor repellent. Amazon Go will power a massive surge of job creation precisely because it will thankfully destroy the work of the past. As is so often the case of late, the media have it 100% backwards.",

      "text": "Home » News » Amazon Pay Replaces Gift Cards On Amazon.in Amazon Pay Replaces Gift Cards On Amazon.in Amazon Pay balance would not be valid for buying gift cards, gold coins, or bank cards on the e-commerce portal.   It looks like Amazon has recently made a silent change on its e-commerce portal. The company has replaced its Gift Card balance with something called ‘Amazon Pay’, which is being claimed by the company as the fastest way to pay. Looking at the portal in totality, both Gift Card balance and Amazon Pay balance are nothing but the same. There seems to be no limits unlike most popular wallets out there, while the money stored in your Amazon Pay balance is valid only for one year,   report published on Gadgets 360. This means, after one year, the Amazon Pay balance would also expire much like how Gift Card balance would until now. However, the difference that we can see is how you top up the money, instead of purchasing gift cards and storing money in Amazon to redeem it while buying products. Additionally, the report on Gadgets 360 also states that the Amazon Pay balance would not be valid for buying gift cards, gold coins, or bank cards on the e-commerce portal, while users can use it for every other purchase. And, if you already have a gift card balance remaining in your account, that gets automatically transferred to Amazon Pay. Interestingly, now users can choose Amazon Pay options while opting for a refunding option. However, don’t get confused. Your Amazon Pay balance cannot be transferred back to your Bank account.",

      "text": "Mindful of Amazon, malls take the Santa experience high-tech   6, 2016 @ 1:10 pm \nIn this Monday, Nov. 21, 2016, photo, Natalia Santia, 9, tries the flight suit visualizer at Santa's Flight Academy in Great Lakes Crossing Outlets in Auburn Hills, Mich. In an effort to lure online shoppers to their stores, many malls are upgrading the traditional visit to Santa into a high-tech experience. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) Tweet \nNEW YORK (AP) — Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the “Naughty or Nice O’Meter.” Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. \nAbout 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa’s lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything. \n“It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,” says Katie Mass, who took her twin daughters through Santa’s Flight Academy, a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey. \nShe had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. “They started running,” says the stay-at-home mom from Westfield, New Jersey. \nThe girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. “It was extravagant and well done,” says Mass. \nMalls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They’re increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates. \n“The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can’t do it,” says Davidowitz. \nSanta’s Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc., which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa’s Flight Academy. \nGuy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman’s Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Connecticut, credited this year’s “great” store traffic to Santa’s Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight. \n“It is getting a lot of good reviews,” says Perry. \nAn old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV. \nAs kids stand on the “Naughty or Nice O’Meter,” they can watch their names pop up on Santa’s “Nice List” screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they’re handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music. \nQuite a difference from last year’s Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees. \n“It’s Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,” says John Scaturro, a marketing manager for the mall. \nQueens Center’s owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro. \nIn addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network’s home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls. \nIt’s cartoon characters that share the spotlight with Santa at another mall display, the DreamWorks DreamPlace. The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio’s “Kung Fu Panda” films — replacing the green ogre from the “Shrek” movies that were last year’s focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa’s sleigh. \nWhatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop. \n“I don’t see many things out there that equal Santa’s power to draw crowds,” he says.",

      "text": "Why Amazon’s ‘Grand Tour’ Is a Raging Success Is this a victory over political correctness? December 7, 2016 by Rick Gershman   6:37 PM \nLast year, the most widely viewed reality show in the world suddenly faced a big problem. Since its premiere in 2002, “Top Gear” had been an unprecedented success for the British Broadcasting Corporation. Over the years, the British car show went from being popular in the United Kingdom to becoming viewers’ favorite show in many other countries — including the United States, where it aired on BBC America. \nIt had a global audience of over 350 million in more than 200 territories worldwide, earning over £150 million ($225 million American) for the BBC. It was a ratings and fandom phenomenon akin to HBO’s “Game of Thrones” (except with cars instead of warring kingdoms and monsters) — and it attracted guest appearances from such superstars as Tom Cruise, Will Smith, and Hugh Jackman. \nThen the face of the franchise, Jeremy Clarkson, went and punched a guy. \nThe \"punch heard ‘round the world\" happened in March 2015, and that’s when everything changed. It’s why we now essentially have two iterations of “Top Gear.” A show still exists on the BBC with that name — but critics and longtime fans alike have panned that show, and its ratings accordingly dropped. \nMeanwhile, Clarkson — who co-created “Top Gear” — and his two longtime co-hosts helped create “The Grand Tour” for Amazon. It has a few new bells and whistles — necessarily, because most established “Top Gear” segments are BBC intellectual property — but for fans, this is the true “Top Gear” in everything but name. \n“The Grand Tour” has been an unprecedented success since it premiered on Nov. 18. While Amazon has declined to disclose specific figures, a study by Symphony Advanced Media indicated the premiere scored a record 1.954 million viewers in the age 18 to 49 demographic so coveted by advertisers. That’s more than triple Amazon’s previous best-ever premiere, for “The Man in the High Castle.” \n“The Grand Tour” appears to have brought everyone along for the ride, and U.S. fans are no exception. \nOn the Internet Movie Database, “The Grand Tour” holds an astonishing 9.5 rating (out of a possible 10) among users, putting it in the company of such shows as “Game of Thrones” and “Breaking Bad,” each of which also hold 9.5 scores. \nBy way of comparison, the two highest-rated films on IMDB — “The Shawshank Redemption” and “The Godfather” — each have an average 9.2 rating. \nNo sensible person would ever claim “The Grand Tour” is an artistic achievement comparable to those universally acclaimed shows and films. But it does speak to fans’ fervent support of the classic “Top Gear” trio. \nThe appreciation isn’t entirely limited to fans: While “The Grand Tour” holds a 97 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, it also has a 100 percent fresh rating among critics on the site. (Granted, it only includes five reviews, but the show is five for five regardless.) \nRelated: College 'Safe Spaces' May Not Be So Safe \nIt’s a huge win for Amazon and a comparable loss for the BBC, which essentially fired Clarkson after he reportedly punched and verbally abused a “Top Gear” producer. Co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May declined to continue without Clarkson, keeping the popular team intact to create what would become “The Grand Tour.” \nThe BBC tried to keep its cash cow alive regardless, tapping British presenter Chris Evans (no relation to the American actor) and American TV star Matt LeBlanc to co-host a new season. \nIt didn’t go well. The thrill of “Top Gear” was always as much about the colorful personalities of Clarkson, Hammond, and May, and the chemistry among them, as it was about the cars themselves. Fans and critics largely found Evans (not a true “car guy”) out of his depth — while LeBlanc had zero chemistry with Evans. By comparison, “The Grand Tour” flourished right out of the gate. \nTo a degree, the Amazon show’s immediate popularity could be interpreted as a victory over political correctness. Over his lengthy tenure on “Top Gear,” Clarkson’s blunt talk and proudly insensitive brand of humor regularly irritated PC proponents. \nRelated: Jon Stewart Gets Candid: 'We're Still the Same Country' \nAs Wikipedia notes, “Top Gear” viewers during Clarkson’s tenure had complained about “incidents and content ranging from … promoting irresponsible driving, ridiculing environmental issues, Germans, Mexicans, and Poles, and alleged homophobia ... British comedian and guest of the program Steve Coogan has criticized [the show], accusing it of lazy, adolescent humor and ‘casual racism.’” \nClarkson is also well known for his loathing of big government and criticism of liberal causes in Britain. He’s said that government should “build park benches and that is it. They should leave us alone” — and he’s taken issue with smoking and hunting bans, among other progressive causes. \nThe future remains very bright for the new show, whereas the BBC program remains in chaos. \nJust as “Top Gear” had a massive worldwide fan base, “The Grand Tour” appears to have brought everyone along for the ride, and U.S. fans are no exception. \n“It's amazing how well the trio slips right back into top form in the first episode,” said Brandon Zarzyczny of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of Little League Baseball. “This show is funnier than most of the comedies on TV, and it has to be one of the most gorgeous shows on TV, as they really spared no expense on the production values.” \n“This is the real ‘Top Gear,’” said Freddie Peters of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. “The name isn’t the brand. The [hosts] are the brand. The fans were always going to follow the guys wherever they went.” \n“The Grand Tour” hasn’t been completely immune to criticism. After its well-reviewed premiere, it took some hits for a shaky second episode, although the third was considered a return to form. And if anything, the humor seems to be even more juvenile than it was on the old “Top Gear” — which is saying a lot. \nRelated: 'Man Down' Shines Strong Light on PTSD and Veterans \nBut the future remains very bright for the new show, whereas the BBC program remains in chaos. Evans resigned from the new “Top Gear” earlier this year, disappointing no one, while LeBlanc is staying on in hopes of righting the ship. \nAt Amazon, “The Grand Tour” is contracted for 36 episodes over three years, ensuring that fans can enjoy the hijinks of Clarkson, Hammond, and May for a long time — at least as long as no one throws any punches. #entertainment",

      "text": "There Will Be No Checkout Line at Amazon’s New Automated Grocery Store Concept Joanna Fantozzi Pin it Share Amazon announced last month its plan to open 2,000 grocery stores over the next decade. Now, more details have been released about the online retail giant’s expansion into the brick-and-mortar business. Amazon Go will allow customers to check out groceries in person simply by tapping their phone, without ever having to wait on line or encounter an employee. It’s the perfect shopping solution for busy introverts. The first Amazon Go store just opened in Seattle and can currently only be used by Amazon employees. Customers can walk in, grab what they need off the shelves, and, with a swipe of their phones, walk out of the store. If the test is successful, other Amazon Go locations will open across the nation starting in 2017. This is how the “Just Walk Out” technology works: When a customer picks up an item, it is automatically added to a virtual checkout. If the product is placed back on the shelf, the amount is deducted. When a customer walks out of the store, his or her account in automatically charged.

Content provided on this site is for entertainment or informational purposes only and should not be construed as medical or health, safety, legal or financial advice. Click here for additional information. Amazon to Launch 2,000 Grab-and-Go Grocery Stores with No Checkout Lines Kaitlin Stanford \nGrocery shopping is fun in theory, but rarely in practice. Nine times out of 10, it just brings a level of stress you don’t quite need — especially if you’ve got a few kids in tow. And God forbid you get stuck on a line with a slow bagger. Or a chatty cashier. Or someone with 80,000 coupons, who appears to be auditioning for an episode of Extreme Couponing . HA! Good luck getting in and out in 20 minutes, like you planned. \nBut checkout lines are so 2016, you guys. Come 2017, you’ll actually be able to zip in and out like magic — without actually having to pay at a register. \nSay what now? \nYep, according to Amazon, the online retail giant has plans in the works to launch 2,000 Amazon Go stores next year, and none of them will have a checkout line in sight. \nNo cashier. No register. No wait. Watch More Videos > \nAn ad for the upcoming store was released on YouTube just yesterday, and in barely 24 hours, it already has almost 3 million views. Here’s how Amazon promises it’ll work: \nCustomers will enter and leave stores using their Amazon app, by scanning in at the store’s entrance, at what basically looks like a high-tech turnstile. As you shop, you can literally take whatever you like, right off the shelf without having to pay — it’s automatically added to your virtual card via your app, so there’s no need to pull out credit cards or cash. \nWondering how anyone knows just what you take? According to Amazon’s website: \n“Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning. Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you’re done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we’ll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.” \nIt’s literally that simple. Related Post Wine and Prime: 10 Things I Bought on Amazon After a Glass (or Three) of Pinot \nNeedless to say, news of the store, which is now being beta tested, has left Amazon customers pretty giddy. And there were signs of that all over the Internet yesterday. OK, this is cool….no lines, no checkouts, and for the retailer – no shoplifting. Not to mention the data mining… https://t.co/TwQoyE5kvB \n— Bob Kurland (@bkurland66) December 5, 2016 #Amazon launches #AmazonGo , a grocery store with no checkout lines! https://t.co/AuL4bLnhlT \n— Jesse Stay (@Jesse) December 6, 2016 Experientially, one of the best parts of the Uber experience is no payment friction, just get out and get on. Amazon Go likely the same. \n— Ben Bajarin (@BenBajarin) December 5, 2016 Amazon Prime/Amazon Go: Do you hate going outside and/or interacting with human beings?

Welcome to #AmazonGo Yet another master stroke from @amazon Analytics simplified @chiefmartec \n— Shilpi Sharma (@Shilpi_SV) December 6, 2016 \nStill, some called out one of the glaring potential downsides to the strategy, noting that this “store-of-the-future” sure looks like a pretty big job-killer. Amazon Go eliminates the need for cashiers. There are 3.4 million of them in America. https://t.co/GwTvptSjMj \n— Christopher Mims™ (@mims) December 5, 2016 as an engineer #AmazonGo is absolutely INCREDIBLE but as a human being the potential millions in job losses is pretty terrifying \n— Christina Zhu (@cszhu) December 5, 2016 If Amazon Go checkout & self-driving trucks become the standard, in 10-15 years we are going to have, literally, 10 million unemployed ppl. \n— Iron Spike (@Iron_Spike) December 5, 2016 \nBut most of all, Twitter users noted just how impressively futuristic this all is. Ever wonder what the stores of the future will be like? Watch & learn! #AmazonGo https://t.co/Kpudem6S0p \n— Yasir Ali (@myasiraly) December 6, 2016 amazon go IS the future \n— Brooke Miccio (@brookemiccio) December 6, 2016 \nIt certainly seems so.

      "text": "Share Save \nWhen Amazon launched its unlimited music streaming subscription in the UK , it offered access to over 40 million tracks, thousands of curated playlists and tight integration with its Echo speaker. The one thing it didn't provide was a dedicated family plan like those offered by Spotify and Apple Music. It took more than three weeks, but Amazon has today extended its subscription to include a Family option -- it costs £15 a month or £149 for a full year and allows up to six people to stream to their heart's content. \nToday's addition means Amazon customers now have four plans to choose from. Prime members can sign up for the standard service at £8 a month or £79 a year, but non-Prime subscribers pay a little extra at £10 a month. The cheaper £4 a month plan is reserved for a single Echo or Echo Dot, which incentivises sales of Amazon's intelligent speaker and gives it an edge over its streaming rivals.",

      "text": "Posted: Dec 7 2016, 4:48am CST | by Luigi Lugmayr , in News | Holiday Gift Guide This story may contain affiliate links. \n  Amazon says to make announcements regarding the Nintendo NES Classic. \nAmazon has not sold a Nintendo NES Classic for $59.99 since launch day. This seems to finally change. Amazon teased NES Classic announcements n the coming week.   \n\"NES Classic fans: we've got a couple exciting announcements to make in the coming week. Stay tuned for more info soon,\" said Amazon on its official Amazon Video Games Twitter account . \nThe Tweet is curious as it refers to a couple of announcements and not just one. Will there be multiple NES Flash sales on Amazon.com? Or will Amazon offer NES Bundles like GameStop? At this point the Tweet is all we have. It only makes sense for Amazon to tease the NES, if they will get a serious amount of NES consoles. The giant online retailer does not need to bother selling a couple thousand units. \nToysRUs sold about 45,000 NES units last Sunday. Amazon needs have about this number of NES in the warehouse to rectify an announcement. \nThe NES Classic has been available on amazon.com all the time since launch, but only from 3rd party resellers. The current offers on Amazon.com are starting at $210, plus $3.99 shipping. \nThe Amazon NES sale is going to be the best opportunity to buy a NES Classic online before the Holidays . ToysRUs had a big NES sale on Sunday. Yesterday, Urban Outfitters hosted a NES Flash sale with overwhelming attention. \nThe demand for the NES is stupendous and Nintendo does not come even close to make enough of this retro console. About the Nintendo NES Classic \nThe $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. Right now all stores are sold out of the retro 80s TV gaming console. \nEven NES accessories are hard to come by. Resellers offer the NES on the Amazon marketplace are $210 and up. \nNintendo had now two weeks time to replenish retailers with NES Classic Edition consoles. There is no update from Nintendo on the status of NES supply. \nOn launch day Nintendo said: \"The Nintendo Entertainment System: NES Classic Edition system is a hot item, and we are working hard to keep up with consumer demand. There will be a steady flow of additional systems through the holiday shopping season and into the new year. Please contact your local retailers to check availability.\" \nThe Target inventory of the NES is the first evidence of a new shipment of NES Classic Edition arriving in the United States. \nThe palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. \nThe NES Classic Edition comes only with a single wired controller. There are 3rd party controllers and accessories that make the NES more fun to use. Gamers can get additional controllers and even wireless controllers. \nThe ThinkGeek store has said to sell the NES as well, but has not given a release date yet. Each day, NES hunters are using services like Brick Seek to spot inventory at local stores. The NES has not been on sale online since December 3, besides the Urban Outfitters sale yesterday. \nAll stores and methods to find a NES Classic are detailed in the NES Classic Shopping Guide for December .",

      "text": "Amazon Rolls Out Music Unlimited 'Family Plan' to the U.K. for £15 per Month Wednesday December 7, 2016 3:31 AM PST by Tim Hardwick Amazon has expanded its Family Plan for Amazon Music Unlimited to the U.K., following initial rollout across the U.S. last month . The plan costs £15 a month, or £149 a year, which works out at a lower price of £12 per month. The subscription supports up to six family members (at least 13 years of age) for simultaneous listening and personal recommendations. On the plan, a single family member uses a \"shared payment method\" to pay for the subscription, such as a debit or credit card that Amazon uses to charge each month for the service. Each member can make purchases on Amazon and Amazon Music Unlimited with the shared payment method, while the main subscriber receives notifications of all activity within the group. The plan also retains the same functionality as the Individual Plan subscription. Amazon Music Unlimited has a library of 40 million songs and is available under four optional plans. Prime members can sign up to the streaming service for £8 per month or £79 per year, while non-Prime members pay £10 per month. For Echo or Echo Dot owners, a cheaper £4 per month plan is available, but is restricted to music playback on the smart device.",

      "text": "Amazon unit says to launch Bahrain office in January \nAmazon Web Services sees opportunities in Gulf kingdom as it seeks to support entrepreneurs Article   1:55 PM \n(Getty Images) \nA subsidiary of online retail giant Amazon has announced plans to set up an office in Bahrain early next year to support local businesses as they transition to Cloud services. \nAmazon Web Services (AWS) said the office will open on January 1 in Manama and will support organisations of all sizes, from start-ups to government institutions, as they make the transition to the AWS Cloud. \nOne of the goals of the office is to expand AWS Cloud training and global certification programs, and upskill citizens on the opportunity that AWS technology brings, a statement said. \nTeresa Carlson, vice president Worldwide Public Sector, AWS, said: \"Major opportunities exist for tech entrepreneurship in the Middle East. Middle Eastern organisations were among the earliest adopters of cloud services when AWS launched in 2006. \n\"The decision to open one of the first AWS offices in the Middle East, in Bahrain, speaks to the creativity, innovation, and forward thinking we see across all of the Bahrain economy from start-ups through to government institutions. We are excited to bring our team to Bahrain to help the country to grow its economy.\" \nKhalid Al Rumaihi, chief executive at the Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) added: “The Bahrain EDB is committed to helping drive forward the development of a strong and supportive environment for innovation and entrepreneurship in the kingdom. \n\"This encompasses a number of areas, including access to finance, education initiatives and regulatory developments, but having the world’s leading cloud computing provider open an office in Bahrain will play a vital role. The AWS team will provide invaluable support to all Bahraini organizations as they move to the cloud.” \nAmazon said it will continue its investment in, and expansion, across Europe, the Middle East and Africa after creating more than 10,000 new jobs in the region last year.",

Sure, the scenario sets the horses of imagination on a derby race but reality is still a few years away and further more for India. However, some companies are using similar technology to completely transform the way one looks at shopping. In the present scenario, one needs to walk into a store, pick the desired stuff and then stand in a queue at the checkout line for paying the bill. At times, especially on weekends, the queue can be more time-consuming than the shopping itself. All this is set to change soon as Amazon has announced it'll soon launch its Go food & convenience stores, which will allow customers to walk in, pick up stuff and simply walk out. Amazon calls this technology 'Just Walk Out'. What about the payment then? \nAccording to Amazon, the store will make use of advanced vision systems, deep learning algorithms and a sensor-based network. This artificial intelligence environment is claimed to be capable of being able of tracking any movement of items within the store. As a result, if you were to pick a packet of corn flakes, it would automatically get billed to your Amazon account when you leave the store. Within the store, if you change your mind and put the packet back again, it'll be unbilled too automatically. As this would mean the store would not need to have a checkout line for bill payment and customers will simply walk in and walk out. \nAmazon hasn't shared further details on the technology or how it'll work but similar technology used in autonomous vehicles is today capable of tracking the slightest movement by drivers and other elements on the road. Based on the road conditions, the car systems can send alerts to the occupants or fellow drivers on the road so it isn't surprising when Amazon claims that articles taken from their self will get billed once the customer walks out of the store. \nThe video herein shows a customer tagging their smartphone with the Amazon application while entering the store. This is probably how the main system would identify each customer for tracking. The cameras along with the sensors will constantly send data on the items removed/ placed by the customer as s/he moves around the store. If one were to believe that Amazon has a plan in place for mass deployment of this retail concept, the possibilities around content-sharing and advertising could be immense. Imagine searching for a specific type of chilli sauce online but it's out of stock. At an Amazon Go store you might pick a regular tomato sauce and be prompted on your phone or on display screens inside the store of the location of the chilli sauce you've been looking for but forgot to pick in the store. Amazon could also share this data with other vendors and do a lot more, hinting at the immense opportunity the digital space provides. Although none of this has been confirmed by the company, these are a few of the multiple options Amazon would already have in mind if it intends to go big on the Go stores. \nAlthough, details are scarce, one cannot help ignoring the huge cost involved in creating such a complex setup. The company has also not disclosed how many such physical stores it'll open in the coming years. Given the available details and the video, for now, we can only say that either this is an attention-catching PR exercise or else the company has figured out a way to bring down the cost of the technology in discussion. If the latter is true, Amazon can soon expect many carmakers taking interest in Amazon Go. If not, the company will still end up creating a technology that will serve as a hotbed for smaller and simpler off-shoot technologies, which might have the potential to enhance the retail shopping experience. \nCheck out the video below By: Arpit Mahendra Dec 07, 2016 2:33 PM RELATED VIDEOS ",

By: The Financial Express | Published: December 7, 2016 6:24 AM It obviously does away with the need for a cashier, but that is likely to be more than offset by the jobs its creates in support for the technology. (Reuters) \n‘Upending traditional retail’ could well be the motto that Amazon lives by. After having taken on brick-and-mortar retail as one of the first movers in e-tail, the e-tail/tech giant has been experimenting with making brick-and-mortar shopping a more efficient experience for some time now. Its newest launch, Amazon Go, is based on a process-integration involving an app, computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning. Go will allow shoppers to walk into a store and pick up stuff and leave—doing away with the requirement to queue up at check-out counters. The billing, made out to a linked Amazon.com account, is carried out seamlessly, digitally—and if there is a linked credit/debit card or digital wallet to the account, payment too can be similarly seamless. While, at the moment, Amazon Go is available only to the company’s employees, at only one company-owned store in Seattle, The Guardian reports that it plans to open 2,000 such stores after analysing the experience with this beta version. \nIt obviously does away with the need for a cashier, but that is likely to be more than offset by the jobs its creates in support for the technology. No check-out line means time-gains for the buyers, which could then translate into productivity gains. If Amazon Go is finally configured to jump across retail players—that is, it functions outside company-owned stores, may be in Amazon verified vendors’ stores or warehouses—that would create a virtuous effect across the brick-and-mortar space. With AI and deep learning, it is also possible that eventually Go is able to identify regularly purchased items and frequency of purchases, and prompts the buyer when a round of shopping is due or is already ready with a template bill. There will be concerns, to be sure, like exchanging or returning a product seems intuitively easier—at least, as of now—with a human cashier. But the technology could nevertheless be truly revolutionary. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

By: FE Bureau | Published: December 7, 2016 6:32 AM The FDI rules bar any e-tailer running a market place model from “directly or indirectly” influencing the sale price of goods or services. In effect, they can’t offer any discounts. (Reuters) \nE-commerce players like Amazon , Flipkart and Snapdeal have conveyed to the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) that they don’t offer any discounts on products sold on their platforms nor do they give advertisements in newspapers announcing mega sale, said DIPP secretary Ramesh Abhishek. \nOn being quizzed by the DIPP following complaints that they are violating foreign direct investment (FDI) rules by influencing product pricing, the e-commerce players have submitted that these discounts and advertisements are funded by sellers and manufacturers that use their electronic platforms for sale. A disclaimer to this effect accompanies every advertisement in newspapers on mega sales, Abhishek said. \nThe latest statement by the secretary suggests the government doesn’t yet have a case against e-commerce players relating to the violation of the FDI guidelines, despite fresh allegations by brick-and-mortar stores that e-tailers are shelling out heavy discounts following demonetisation, as sales against the cash-on-delivery option have been hit. In the past few days, up to 70% of discounts are available on certain products in the fashion category on Amazon India. Similarly, discounts on certain items on Flipkart are as high as 80%. \nThe FDI rules bar any e-tailer running a market place model from “directly or indirectly” influencing the sale price of goods or services. In effect, they can’t offer any discounts. \nApple yet to renew local sourcing request \nIn response to a query, Abhishek said US tech giant Apple hasn’t yet approached him for a relaxation from the local sourcing rule for setting up its own stores in India since the announcement of new FDI guidelines in June. “Now, the company has to decide what it wants to do.” \nThe Centre announced in June that entities having “state-of-the-art” and “cutting-edge” technology could get a waiver from the mandatory 30% local sourcing rule for the initial three years and a “relaxed sourcing regime for another five years” once they set up their own stores in India. \nUnder the earlier FDI norms, announced in November last year, entities having “cutting-edge” technology were promised complete exemption from the local sourcing rule. Apple had earlier applied for such a waiver but the finance ministry rejected the proposal on grounds that such a blanket exemption would hurt the government’s Make in India initiative, following which new norms were notified in June. \nAnalysts have said Apple turned to India to reverse slowing global sales, although its plan to establish retail outlets are still unclear. According to a Morgan Stanley report in April, India is expected to beat the US to become the second-largest market for smart phones next year. Please Wait while comments are loading...

      "title": "Amazon's Register-Free Grocery Shopping Could Disrupt Retail | E-Commerce",
      "text": "Amazon's Register-Free Grocery Shopping Could Disrupt Retail Print Email By David Jones\nDec 6, 2016 2:57 PM PT Amazon on Monday unveiled a prototype convenience store called \"Amazon Go,\" which uses mobile e-commerce, machine learning and computer vision to allow customers to make purchases without a cashier.\nThe 1,800 square foot concept store in Seattle uses the company's Just Walk Out technology, which incorporates many of the same concepts found in self-driving cars, Amazon said.\nCustomers use the Amazon Go app to enter the store, then pluck items off the shelves. Anything a customer takes off a shelf is added to a virtual shopping cart. Items returned to the shelves automatically are removed.\nWhen they're finished shopping, customers just exit. Their purchases automatically are scanned and charged to their Amazon accounts, and receipts are sent to their smartphones.\nThe store sells breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack items freshly made by on-site chefs or provided by local kitchens and bakeries. It offers staples like bread, milk, cheeses and sweets.\nBoth major brands and exclusive items are available, and customers in a rush can pick up Amazon Meal Kits, which include all the ingredients to cook a meal for two in half an hour.\nSelf-Driving Tech The Amazon Go store uses a combination of computer vision, deep learning algorithms and sensor fusion, which are some of the same technologies used in self-driving vehicles, the company said.\n\"We know there are advantages to a multichannel environment,\" noted Robert Hetu, agenda manager for retail and consumer goods research at Gartner .\n\"In my opinion, Amazon is going to launch many stores with the goal of doing retail better through new technology,\" he\nWhat so far is unknown is how the company will expand on the concept. Amazon might choose to locate the stores in gas stations -- like 7-11, for example -- or it could place them at shopping malls or city centers. It's also unknown whether Amazon might allow advance online ordering from outside the store, letting customers pick up their preselected items.\nAmazon is testing both in-store shopping and picking up online orders, according to Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research .\nThe prototype store is currently in beta testing with Amazon employees, and it is expected to open its doors to the public in 2017.\nAmazon's Track Record There is no reason to believe that Amazon cannot transform the convenience store with this new technology, observed David Jones, director of sales engineering at Dynatrace .\nAmazon and newer e-commerce startups have pushed traditional grocers to incorporate more of these technologies into the customer experience, he\n\"The rise of boutique online grocery delivery vendors, as well as Walmart's entry into online grocery ordering, proves there is a market for Amazon's grocery services,\" Jones said. \"Understand that this will be a competitive marketplace; we see that Meijer, Trader Joe's and Stop and Shop are providing some of the fastest online experiences, all under 3.2 seconds, against an industry average of 5.3 seconds.\"\nThe Amazon Go concept represents a broad threat to the retail model as we know it, because it could combine the convenience of a 7-11 store with the breadth of a Walmart, noted Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group .\n\"It defines 'disruption,' because it also blends online with on-premises retail to possibly provide the best of both worlds,\" he \"As VR and mixed reality tech advances, its breadth of products could range from groceries to cars and even homes, eventually.\"\nAmazon has collaborated with automakers to use its technology in ways that help automate passenger cars. It began working with Ford Sync-equipped cars earlier this year, enabling the Amazon Echo and Wink to link home devices with cars in order to turn off lights, open garage doors and control security devices.\nAsked whether Amazon was using any of this technology in self-driving cars or is testing online purchases with the prototype store, spokesperson Lori Richter said the company does not comment on rumors or speculation.",

      "text": "Buy from Amazon \nThe upbeat feel of Blind Melon's biggest hit \"No Rain\" stands in contrast to the band's own tragic history. Lead vocalist Shannon Hoon fought battles against drug addiction through much of the early 90s and would be dead by late 1995 at the age of 28. Although many remember the \"dancing bee girl\" fondly from the video for \"No Rain,\" the genesis of the song is darker. It was written out of the efforts of bassist Brad Smith to cope with the struggles of his girlfriend with clinical depression.",

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock The holiday shopping season is not just big business for virtually every retailer, it is also the season to be jolly for a lot of crooks. And with 90% of holiday shoppers planning to hit the online stores this year, consumers need to be conscious of the possibility that a bargain price that sounds too good to be true may, in fact, be false.\nIt’s not hard to for a counterfeit or fake item to hide in plain sight on the giant e-commerce sites. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) offers more than 350 million products to its customers. Of that total, some 12.23 million are sold directly by Amazon while the rest are sold by the company’s Marketplace sellers. eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY) has 1 billion items for sale from some 25 million resellers. Both suffer from a relatively small, but costly and potentially dangerous, counterfeiting problem.\nAccording to a recent report from counterfeit awareness and consumer advocate site The Counterfeit Report , its research has uncovered 2.5 million counterfeit items for sale on eBay. The firm has also reported 1.8 million counterfeit items to eBay for removal from the auction and retail site’s listing.\nThe Counterfeit Report also has submitted infringement notices on 11,713 counterfeit items sold at Amazon. The firm notes that it “conducted dozens of name-brand test purchases from Amazon Fulfillment and Amazon Marketplace sellers, but never received an authentic item. Counterfeits were also purchased from Amazon Direct and Amazon Warehouse Deals.”\nIn October, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported that nearly 90% of its chargers and cables labeled as genuine at Amazon.com are, in fact, counterfeit. Apple has sued a New Jersey company, Mobile Star, for putting Apple’s logo on the cables and chargers.\nInexplicably, the e-commerce giants don’t notify consumers that they have received a counterfeit, that they may be in danger, and that they are entitled to a refund — even when the websites know or have been notified by the manufacturer that the items are counterfeit, or fake (items that don’t even exist in the manufacturer’s product line but bear its registered trademark).\nCounterfeiting is a $1.7 trillion global criminal enterprise that is profitable, difficult to track and generally unpunished. The damage is not limited to trademark violation, however. According to The Counterfeit Report, counterfeiting costs U.S. manufacturers more than $250 billion annually and has cost U.S. workers more than 750,000 jobs.\nThe Counterfeit Report offers the following advice to consumers:\nAvoid all online purchases of trademarked items from China, and China sellers on Amazon Fulfillment and Amazon Marketplace. Many manufacturers don’t authorize sales on these websites. Buy online directly from the manufacturer, or their authorized retailers with clear return policies. Always buy with a credit card, never cash, PayPal withdrawals or wire transfers. When in doubt about a product, seek advice and compare it with an authentic product at an authorized retailer. Always keep the disputed product; it is your only proof of receiving a counterfeit. If returned, sellers will simply deny it is counterfeit and sell it to another unsuspecting consumer. Notify the offending website and dispute the purchase. Request a refund from the seller or website. If a refund is denied, notify your credit card company that you have retained the counterfeit product and are disputing the charge.

      "text": "Why \"Clerkless\" Shopping Is A Bigger Problem Than You Think 1 hour ago share \nAmazon says that it is developing a system that eliminates checkout clerks at a store it is developing. Scan your phone and start shopping. Everything is taken care of. Takes the money as you go along.When commenting on the story yesterday on The Jim Polito Show, financial expert Barry Armstrong provided his take, noting that kids in this day and age need to get better education because they are competing for jobs not only in this country but around the world. This is true.But he said something interesting. \"The tidal wave of change cannot be avoided. More change and more competition for jobs is coming.\"While this is true and that you can’t stop the tidal wave of change, it is also true that I don’t have to go swimming in the same ocean.Yes I admit it. I don’t use ATM’s. Period. I prefer to deal with the teller. That’s why when I walk into a bank, the bank manager greets me by name, asks questions about the family and deals with John the person rather than John the Customer.I do so because it fits my needs. Let’s remember I know what my needs are more than any other company. The company needs my business rather than I need the company.The issue expands into why young people today can't hold a conversation with you, they text you if you are standing next to them and seemingly unable to solve a problem.Since they have no human contact, they are more likely not negotiate an end to a conflict rather than using violence.Ganhdi said, \" You must be the change you wish to see in the world.\"Unfortunately, that would require putting down our smart phones to get that done and do we think anyone is ready to do that?

      "text": "Don't Miss: Amazon 12 Days of Deals Sale Melting Arctic ice could disappear a third of polar bear popultion in the next 35 years \nPolar bears population is expected to plunge in the next 35 years because of melting Arctic ice, a new research suggests. Don't Miss: Top 100 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 Photos \nAs the climate change melts sea ice, researchers project that one third of the polar bears could disappear by mid-century and this decline in polar bears population is occurring in our lifetime. \nPolar bear, also known as Ursus maritimus, are marine mammals that spend most of their life on icy waters rather than land and depend on sea ice for most of their needs. The loss of its sea ice habitat means fewer hunting opportunities and increased scarcity of food. \n“Climate change is the primary threat to the species because, over the long term, global temperatures will increase and Arctic sea ice will decrease as long as atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise.” Authors wrote in the study , which is the first to assess the abundance of polar bear in relation to sea ice. \nCurrently, the global population of polar bears is around 26,000 individuals. The population is further divided in to 19 subpopulations scattered across four ecological zones in the Arctic. If global warming trends continue in the same say, the polar bear number may decline from 26,000 to just 9,000 over 35 years and the probability that polar bear numbers would drop is more than 70 percent. \nTo forecast the effects of continued sea-ice loss on polar bears, researchers incorporated satellite data with computer simulations and projected that changes in sea ice will have a profound effect on the global population size over the course of next 35 years, a period corresponding to three polar bear generations. \nThe findings are also consistent with International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) – the authority that assesses the biodiversity and ranks species in different categories on the basis of its decline. Polar bears are currently listed as “vulnerable” in IUCN red list of threatened and endangered species.",

The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. (AP Photo/Branden Camp) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter.\" Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. \nAbout 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa's lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything. \n\"It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,\" says Katie Mass, who took her twin daughters through Santa's Flight Academy, a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey. \nShe had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. \"They started running,\" says the stay-at-home mom from Westfield, New Jersey. \nThe girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. \"It was extravagant and well done,\" says Mass. \nMalls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They're increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates. \n\"The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can't do it,\" says Davidowitz. \nSanta's Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc., which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa's Flight Academy. \nGuy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman's Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Connecticut, credited this year's \"great\" store traffic to Santa's Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight. \n\"It is getting a lot of good reviews,\" says Perry. \nAn old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV. \nAs kids stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter,\" they can watch their names pop up on Santa's \"Nice List\" screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they're handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music. \nQuite a difference from last year's Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees. \n\"It's Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,\" says John Scaturro, a marketing manager for the mall. \nQueens Center's owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro. \nIn addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network's home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls. \nIt's cartoon characters that share the spotlight with Santa at another mall display, the DreamWorks DreamPlace. The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio's \"Kung Fu Panda\" films — replacing the green ogre from the \"Shrek\" movies that were last year's focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa's sleigh. \nWhatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop. \n\"I don't see many things out there that equal Santa's power to draw crowds,\" he says.",

      "text": "Amazon Isn’t Trying to Kill Cashier Jobs, It’s After Something Bigger Written by December 7, 2016 // 06:00 AM EST Copy This URL \nOn Monday, Amazon announced that a small grocery store in Seattle that uses technology to deliver a “just walk out” experience with no lines or cashiers will be open to the public in 2017. Twenty-four hours later, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon may be planning on opening up to 2,000 similar stores across the US. \nBasically, it’s a huge deal, and it’s been met with some criticism. Namely, from folks mourning the cashiers whose jobs may soon be automated like the basket-weavers and hamburger-order-takers before them. \nIt’s not an unfounded worry—Amazon probably won’t be hiring any cashiers for its stores, although it does look like some people will be around to, say, stock shelves, since human staff can be briefly seen in a promotional video . But this criticism misses the mark because Amazon’s idea for a grocery store isn’t about automation or saving on wages. Instead, it’s about erecting a closed-loop system of integrated consumer surveillance. Read More: The Future of Robot Labor Is the Future of Capitalism \nA good deal of automation (that is, automatic computer behaviour) is a part of the Amazon Go store system, but what the company is doing is worlds apart from, say, replacing your neighbourhood barista with a mechanical version. This is the idea of automation that we’re familiar with : replacing variable capital with fixed capital that becomes less expensive in the long run than paying people an hourly wage. \nLower wage overhead might be a benefit of Amazon’s plan, but it’s not its raison d’être —that would be finally closing the online-offline consumer information loop. \"The 'you' that Amazon doesn’t see, and so clearly desperately wants to, is the you that buys a cheap hamburger for lunch every Wednesday like clockwork\" \nThe “you” that Amazon the online retailer sees right now is the you that buys a 30-pack of something stupid at four in the morning, the you that mindlessly puts expensive things that you never plan on buying in your cart, and the you that inexplicably buys a large quantity of cardboard boxes one day (it’s because you’re moving apartments, but Amazon doesn’t know this). \nBut the “you” that Amazon doesn’t see, and so clearly desperately wants to, is the you that buys a cheap hamburger for lunch every Wednesday like clockwork, the you that picks up a bag of kale chips at midnight, the you that buys contraceptives on Friday, and so on—all of the tiny, insignificant, stupid things that altogether make up the reality of our daily lives. \nAmazon is being secretive about the technology that will go into the store, and by extension what kinds of information they’ll gain from people who wander in. A patent unearthed by Recode last year appears to confirm the computer vision aspect of the store’s technology (which implies cameras), but an Amazon spokesperson confirmed to Motherboard over email that facial recognition, which is in the patent, is not in use at the Amazon Go store. Regardless, it’s clear that Amazon will know what you’re buying. \nAnybody can get rid of a cashier with a robot. That’s easy, and in fact, a lot of places have already done it with self-service checkout machines. But what only Amazon can do, and what it is seeking to do with Amazon Go stores, is design a hyper-efficient and data-driven information loop built around physical and online shopping. This will likely benefit Amazon’s business for all of the reasons that customer data does now: improving its marketing, recommendations and promotions, and keeping its supply chain in line . All of this comes down to knowing you . \nBut at least you won’t have to talk to a cashier.

      "text": "Amazon Isn’t Trying to Kill Cashier Jobs, It’s After Something Bigger   06:00   \nOn Monday, Amazon announced that a small grocery store in Seattle that uses technology to deliver a “just walk out” experience with no lines or cashiers will be open to the public in 2017. Twenty-four hours later, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon may be planning on opening up to 2,000 similar stores across the US. \nBasically, it’s a huge deal, and it’s been met with some criticism. Namely, from folks mourning the cashiers whose jobs may soon be automated like the basket-weavers and hamburger-order-takers before them. \nIt’s not an unfounded worry—Amazon probably won’t be hiring any cashiers for its stores, although it does look like some people will be around to, say, stock shelves, since human staff can be briefly seen in a promotional video . But this criticism misses the mark because Amazon’s idea for a grocery store isn’t about automation or saving on wages. Instead, it’s about erecting a closed-loop system of integrated consumer surveillance. Read More: The Future of Robot Labor Is the Future of Capitalism \nA good deal of automation (that is, automatic computer behaviour) is a part of the Amazon Go store system, but what the company is doing is worlds apart from, say, replacing your neighbourhood barista with a mechanical version. This is the idea of automation that we’re familiar with : replacing variable capital with fixed capital that becomes less expensive in the long run than paying people an hourly wage. \nLower wage overhead might be a benefit of Amazon’s plan, but it’s not its raison d’être —that would be finally closing the online-offline consumer information loop. \"The 'you' that Amazon doesn’t see, and so clearly desperately wants to, is the you that buys a cheap hamburger for lunch every Wednesday like clockwork\" \nThe “you” that Amazon the online retailer sees right now is the you that buys a 30-pack of something stupid at four in the morning, the you that mindlessly puts expensive things that you never plan on buying in your cart, and the you that inexplicably buys a large quantity of cardboard boxes one day (it’s because you’re moving apartments, but Amazon doesn’t know this). \nBut the “you” that Amazon doesn’t see, and so clearly desperately wants to, is the you that buys a cheap hamburger for lunch every Wednesday like clockwork, the you that picks up a bag of kale chips at midnight, the you that buys contraceptives on Friday, and so on—all of the tiny, insignificant, stupid things that altogether make up the reality of our daily lives. \nAmazon is being secretive about the technology that will go into the store, and by extension what kinds of information they’ll gain from people who wander in. A patent unearthed by Recode last year appears to confirm the computer vision aspect of the store’s technology (which implies cameras), but an Amazon spokesperson confirmed to Motherboard over email that facial recognition, which is in the patent, is not in use at the Amazon Go store. Regardless, it’s clear that Amazon will know what you’re buying. \nAnybody can get rid of a cashier with a robot. That’s easy, and in fact, a lot of places have already done it with self-service checkout machines. But what only Amazon can do, and what it is seeking to do with Amazon Go stores, is design a hyper-efficient and data-driven information loop built around physical and online shopping. This will likely benefit Amazon’s business for all of the reasons that customer data does now: improving its marketing, recommendations and promotions, and keeping its supply chain in line . All of this comes down to knowing you . \nBut at least you won’t have to talk to a cashier.

      "text": "December 7, 2016 Business , Technology \nFive million views since yesterday. US Weekly reports : \nTaking grab-and-go to the next level. Amazon just opened a state-of-the art grocery store called Amazon Go in downtown Seattle that lets customers shop without ever waiting in line or going through a checkout process. In a video introducing the concept Monday, December 5, the e-commerce company refers to it as “just-walk-out technology” and shows a man walking in, picking up a sandwich and immediately leaving. \nThis is how it works: When customers enter the store, they pull up the Amazon Go app and tap their cellphones on a turnstile. When customers pick up items from the shelf, the items are automatically added to their virtual shopping cart in the app. It works for indecisive shoppers, too. If customers change their mind about an item, they can just put it back on the shelf. The charge will be deducted from their cart. \nOnce patrons have everything they need, they simply exit the store. When they leave, Amazon’s technology adds up their purchases and charges it to their Amazon account. A receipt is instantly sent via the app. A source tells The Wall Street Journal that Amazon will soon open two more Seattle-area grocery stores in the next few weeks, but these locations will be drive-thru only. According to the source, the retail giant is hoping to open more than 2,000 grocery stores across the country depending on the success of the test locations.",

      "title": "GE integrates Alexa into its first desk lamp",
      "text": "Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant technology, is branching out from its first home, the Echo series of devices , and finally starting to show up in third-party products. So far, we’ve seen a watch and an intercom, but GE may have the brightest idea yet: an LED lamp.\nGE, which announced the new “C by GE” desktop lamp on Wednesday, says the illuminator is just the first in a series of connected products to come.\nLooking a little like a silver Amazon Echo with a glowing ring attached to it, the C lamp integrates the Alexa voice service and backs it up with a microphone array and speakers. It is the first Alexa-connected lamp that does not need another third-party hub to work or control other smart-home devices that work with the ever-growing list of Alexa Skills. You can also, of course, control the lamp itself with your voice.\nAmazon’s Alexa lets users ask general questions, control smart devices, make shopping lists, play games, stream music and more. The functionality is greatly enhanced when owners have an Amazon Prime account, which costs $99 a year.\n“This introduction is the first in a suite of connected products we’re incubating to create simple, connected experiences that elevate what you can do at home,” Jeff Patton, general manager of connected home products for GE Lighting told Mashable. “Part of our incubation process involves embedding ourselves in homes, and as part of these living labs we quickly confirmed that voice is a powerful means to delight consumers and amplify smart home adoption.\"\nThe unusual-looking lamp was designed, in part, by Richard Clarkson who may be best known for his cloud lamp, which is essentially a whimsical, hanging cloud light fixture that can produce storm-like effects on your ceilings and walls. Clarkson was clearly interested in changing things up as the C by GE lamp’s design has virtually no relation to anything you’d see in nature.\nWhile still in development, the final C by GE lamp will offer the equivalent brightness of a 60-watt bulb and should be between 14-18 inches tall and about 13 inches in diameter.\nThis isn’t the first time an appliance manufacturer has promised deep Alexa integration. In 2015, Samsung told me they were bringing the first Alexa-enabled refrigerator to market , only to pull back on the announcement at the last minute, without any explanation. GE, though, has Amazon’s full support on this project. Perhaps 2017 will be a big year for third-party Alexa integration.\n“We believe that voice is the most natural and convenient user interface, and the new GE LED lamp with Alexa makes it easy for customers to not only control smart devices throughout their homes, but also do things like listen to music, check the daily news or request a ride – using only their voice,\" Aaron Brown, director of Amazon Alexa, told Mashable .\nThe lamp goes on pre-order early in 2017. Pricing has not been set.",

      "text": "\nAmazon now lets you quite literally “upload” a truckload of data to its servers. Its new service Snowmobile transfers your data via the physical highways rather than the Internet.\nThe service is aimed at companies with spectacularly huge amounts of data to upload, to the point that even a fiber connection isn’t practical. Amazon already offers a service nicknamed Snowball, in which companies can fill up a 50 terabyte hard drive and mail it in for upload.\nSnowmobile is instead a truck carrying a shipping container full of digital storage units that will come to your facility. You can then simply plug, upload your data and then watch the truck head off back to Amazon’s facilities. Each storage unit on the truck is 80 terabytes, with the total capacity being 100 petabytes.\nLudicrous as the concept may sound, it does seem to make sense for companies with very large amounts of data. Even on a 1 Gbps Internet connection that worked at full capacity, uploading 80 terabytes would take around a week.\nWired crunched the numbers and estimated that – admittedly if you ignore the time “loading” the truck – if the full capacity was used and the truck was driving at 65 mph, it would be a data transfer speed of almost 5,000 Gbps.\n \nThe post Amazon Ships Data By The Truckload With New Snowmobile Service appeared first on Geeks are Sexy Technology News .\n",

      "text": "Amazon's cancellation of the feminist drama 'Good Girls Revolt' feels timely — but not in a good way Anna Camp, Erin Darke and Genevieve Angelson Amazon Studios Anna Camp, Erin Darke and Genevieve Angelson in the Amazon series \"Good Girls Revolt.\" Anna Camp, Erin Darke and Genevieve Angelson in the Amazon series \"Good Girls Revolt.\" (Amazon Studios) Meredith Blake \nWhen “Good Girls Revolt” premiered on Amazon in late October, shortly before an election Hillary Clinton was widely predicted to win, it seemed like a perfectly timely celebration of second-wave feminism. \nThe series, created by former Los Angeles Times staff writer Dana Calvo, is a tale of workplace revolt that plays like a cross between “Mad Men” and “9 to 5.” Set in late 1969 and early 1970, it follows a group of young female journalists at a fictional news magazine who, barred from becoming reporters or receiving bylines, team up with the ACLU to file a gender discrimination lawsuit. (It was inspired by a real-life case at Newsweek in 1970.) \nThe parallels between the ambitious, trailblazing young characters in the series and the woman poised to break the highest glass ceiling of all were impossible to ignore. \nAs I noted in my initial review , the series was “a love letter to the Hillary Clinton generation,” opening a few months after the future candidate graduated from Wellesley College (and gave a speech that landed her in the pages of Time magazine). \nLate last week, despite generally positive reviews and little more than a month after its debut, Amazon abruptly canceled “Good Girls Revolt,” in what felt like a small-scale reverberation of the election.

But Calvo told Buzzfeed “Good Girls Revolt” had twice the audience of “Transparent,” the critically lauded jewel in Amazon’s crown. (Amazon disputes this claim.) \n“We won the popular vote,” she said in a tweet that explicitly tied the show’s cancellation to Clinton’s electoral fate. \nOf course, all TV shows will one day end, and cancellation is part of the business. But similar to its streaming rival Netflix, Amazon has been unusually magnanimous with renewals, granting second and even third seasons to series that haven’t exactly captured the cultural conversation, such as “Red Oaks,”“Bosch” and even the widely panned “Hand of God.” \nAdding insult to injury is the haste with which the series was canceled, barely a month after its premiere, and before Golden Globe nominations were announced. The rationale, according to the Hollywood Reporter , is that Amazon Studios chief Roy Price “was not a fan of the series” and didn’t view it as “an awards season player.” \nWhile nominations for “Good Girls Revolt” seemed unlikely, even at the streaming-enamored Globes, the “awards player” label is a highly subjective thing, a marker of ambition and institutional support as much as actual quality. As we all know, the Internet is awash in highly unrealistic for-your-consideration ads, and there’s a gendered quality to what’s anointed “prestigious”— often tales of violent male antiheroes. \nAnd just because “Good Girls Revolt” wasn’t going to be the next Emmy-hogging “Game of Thrones” doesn’t mean it wasn’t worth supporting; the cancellation suggests there’s a small-screen corollary to the “Ishtar” effect , one that holds female storytellers to a higher standard than their male peers. \nOn the one hand, the cancellation of such an explicitly feminist series seems curious, given Amazon’s support for female storytellers. The network has staked out a reputation for frank, deeply personal half-hour comedies (and quasi-comedies) written by and starring women, including “Transparent,”“Catastrophe,”“One Mississippi” and “Fleabag.” \nBut tit has also been on a high-profile spending spree of late, doling out (reportedly) enormous sums of money to attract A-list — and mostly male — talent, including Robert De Niro , Matthew Weiner, David O. Russell, Billy Bob Thornton and Woody Allen . (Allen’s “Crisis in Six Scenes” even included an ironic joke about the money to be made in TV. Like “Good Girls Revolt,” it was set in the late 1960s; it was panned by critics.) \nMaybe Amazon decided it had to cut costs to pave the way for these expensive, male-oriented projects from famous men, but the decision — particularly given that “Good Girls Revolt” is about women fighting for equal opportunity in the workplace — seems rather tone-deaf. \n“Good Girls Revolt” wasn’t perfect, but then few shows are, particularly in their first season. Its positive attributes were, I think, rare enough to make it something special, even within a television landscape that grows more diverse by the day. \nIt was a show by, about and (mostly) for women, an admiring look at a movement that has been overlooked in pop culture portrayals of the 1960s and ’70s, one of the most exhaustively chronicled eras in American history. \nThere are dozens of acclaimed movies and TV shows about Vietnam and the civil rights movement, and rightfully so, but the same cannot be said of women’s liberation. Perhaps because of the movement’s unglamorous, dour reputation, Hollywood hasn’t seemed as excited to tell this particular story. Even proto-feminist characters such as Peggy Olson or Joan Harris of “Mad Men” seemed to embrace its tenets reluctantly. \nThe industry’s attitude is reflected in the finale of “Good Girls Revolt,” in which a group of male editors stand around discussing the image that will accompany a cover story about the feminist movement. After making cruel remarks about Betty Friedan’s looks, the editors ultimately go with a sexy red lipstick kiss on the cover, in lieu of an actual human woman. \n“Good Girls Revolt” resisted the militant bra-burning feminist stereotype, instead depicting ambitious young women from a range of backgrounds — a black lawyer, a blond princess, a mousy aspiring novelist — each inspired to take action for unique reasons. It made feminism seem like an endeavor that was not only vital, but thrilling — and not just because of the newfound sexual freedom. \nThe Clinton echoes were always a part of “Good Girls Revolt,” but watching the final few episodes, which featured plots about illegal pre-Roe vs. Wade abortions and a news executive sexually harassing his talented blond employee, after the election, they felt newly relevant. \nSo did the transformation of said blond, a researcher named Jane Hollander (played by the reliably great Anna Camp ), who initially resists joining her peers in the lawsuit because she clings to an image of herself as the Marrying Type and hasn’t fully accepted the scope of her own ambition. “I always thought that I would be standing next to my husband as he announced his bid for office or thanked his colleagues for an award,” she says. \nBut she eventually joins the fight, and in a surprising turn, becomes its public face, reading a statement at the news conference that concludes the finale. Jane speaks of the “talent, hard work and opportunity,” rather than gender identity, required of a successful journalist. “We deserve and are entitled to that opportunity.” \nAnd, in a cruelly ironic twist, that’s where the story ends — with a woman pleading for a chance to tell stories under her own name. \nSony Pictures Television has said it’s shopping for a new home for “Good Girls Revolt,” and its stars have mounted a social media campaign to save the show. Now like the Clinton supporters who flocked to New York’s Javits Center on election night, fans are left to wait for a triumphant conclusion that may never come. ",

      "text": " Google+\nPaul Sancya/Associated Press\nSanta’s Flight Academy, installed at the Great Lakes Crossing Outlets in Auburn Hills, Mich., is typical of the efforts to lure shoppers away from their computers and into malls.\nBy Joseph Pisani Associated Press December 07, 2016\nNEW YORK — Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the ‘‘Naughty or Nice O’Meter.’’ Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online.\nAbout 40 US malls and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa’s lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything.\nAdvertisement\n‘‘It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,’’ says Katie Mass of Westfield, N.J., who took her twin daughters through Santa’s Flight Academy, a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills.\nShe had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. ‘‘They started running,’’ she said.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. The girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers, and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. ‘‘It was extravagant and well done,’’ says Mass.\nMalls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They’re increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates.\n‘‘The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can’t do it,’’ says Davidowitz.\nAdvertisement\nSanta’s Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc., which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa’s Flight Academy.\nGuy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman’s Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Conn., credited this year’s ‘‘great’’ store traffic to Santa’s Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight.\n‘‘It is getting a lot of good reviews,’’ says Perry.\nAn old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by HGTV.\nAs kids stand on the ‘‘Naughty or Nice O’Meter,’’ they can watch their names pop up on Santa’s ‘‘Nice List’’ screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they’re handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music.\nQuite a difference from last year’s Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees.\n‘‘It’s Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,’’ says John Scaturro, a marketing manager for the mall.\n‘’\nQueens Center’s owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro.\n.",

Next up: a high-tech table lamp.\nGE this morning unveiled a new LED table lamp with Alexa inside , as part of GE Lighting’s “C by GE” brand. The company says it’s the first time the Amazon Alexa Voice Service has been used within a lighting product, allowing users to ask questions, control a connected home, and other standard Alexa features.\nGE says it’s designed in part by Richard Clarkson , the designer of “The Cloud” ceiling fixture.\n“We’re excited to work with GE Lighting to bring Alexa to their LED lamp and enable new types of voice experiences,” said Aaron Brown, Director of Alexa, in a news release. “Voice is the future of home automation and the combination of Alexa with the GE LED table lamp, provides people with a simple and frictionless way to interact with their homes.”\nThe base of the Alexa-powered LED lamp. (GE Photo) The product will be available for pre-order in early 2017, and it’s scheduled for release in the second quarter. Pricing hasn’t been announced, but a GE representative said it should cost less than an Amazon Echo device, which sells for $180.",

      "title": "Fluance Fi50 Bluetooth Wood Speaker review: This big box puts out really big sound",
      "text": "Fluance Fi50 Bluetooth Wood Speaker TechHive Rating View on Amazon You'll get big sound from this big box that delivers a broader frequency range than its competitors in this price range. \nCanada-based Fluance is relatively well known in the audiophile and home theater community for building good-performing, high-value speaker systems. The company generally sells direct to consumer in order to keep prices down. Shipping is free and if you don’t like the product after trying it out in your home, you can return it without penalty or even shipping costs—so long is it is within the 30-day return window. By building a good product and keeping its distribution costs in check, Fluance has gained a reputation for delivering audio products at prices far below their value. \nThe Fi50 Bluetooth Wood Speaker System was once the company’s flagship Bluetooth product, but that distinction now belongs to the gargantuan Fi70, which is also in our review queue. Weighing in at 13.4 pounds—the equivalent of eight UE Megabooms— the Fluance Fi50 is by no means a portable speaker. But that mass enables the Fi50 to deliver bass response that no portable powered speaker can touch. A big engine under the hood \nThe Fi50 is a two-way speaker system fabricated from MDF to suppress cabinet resonances that can cause distortion. The cabinet comes wrapped in your choice of three wood veneers: walnut, bamboo, or black ash. My original review sample came in walnut, but it had obviously been around the review block a few times. There were several scrapes, some cosmetic damage, and it had a blown right woofer. The replacement Fluance sent featured the black ash finish, so now I know first hand that those two finishes are of high quality and they look great. I presume the bamboo finish looks just as good. \nFluance provides both rubber feet or high-quality metal spikes that you can thread into sockets on the bottom of the cabinet. The spikes will probably do the better job of preventing vibrations from transferring from the speaker cabinet to the surface the speaker is resting on, but they will easily mark a wooden floor or tabletop. I’d suggest using them only on very hard surfaces such as granite, marble, tile, or glass. Theo Nicolakis \nThe Fi50 gives you your choice of high quality rubber feet or spikes. \nA pair of 3/5-inch coaxially mounted, ferrofluid-cooled silk soft dome tweeters handle the upper end of the audio spectrum, while dual 5.0-inch woven glass fiber composite deliver generous amounts of bass. These are aided by a pair of bass reflex ports in the rear of the cabinet. Everything is driven by a 40-watt amplifier, delivering an impressive frequency response of 40Hz to 20kHz—a rare spec at this price point. \nThe Fi50’s Bluetooth radio supports the aptX audio codec for near-CD-quality audio reproduction, and there’s a 3.5mm aux input for playing from other sources.You’ll only benefit from aptX if the playback device also supports, and when I paired the speaker with a Pioneer XDB-100R high-resolution digital audio player, it immediately displayed a message that it had recognized the Fi50 as an aptX speaker. Theo Nicolakis \nThe Fi50 includes high quality spikes that attach to the bottom of the speaker. \nDon’t be fooled by the USB port on the rear, however; it isn’t capable of playing music from your mobile device. Instead, it serves as a handy charging port so you can charge your smartphone or tablet while playing music. \nYou’ll use four touch-sensitive surface controls on the top of the cabinet to manage the front screen’s brightness (including turning it off), bass and treble, and volume. The well-used damaged review unit showed me that these stickers might not stand up to the the test of time; a couple of them had partially worn off. I didn’t notice any issues with the newer unit, but it’s something to be aware of. \nWhen you first fire up the Fi50, you’ll notice that it sounds more like a pair of good bookshelf speakers than a Bluetooth speaker. I was immediately taken by the Fi50’s presence in my room. It throws a very large soundstage for its size. For example Lady Gaga’s vocals on the MQA version of “Lush Life” from Cheek to Cheek with Tony Bennett were far larger than the speaker’s enclosure. The accompanying piano was also full bodied. This song showed-off the benefits of speaker’s frequency response compared to the competition. Theo Nicolakis \nClose-up view of the Fluance Fi50’s input options and USB charging port. \nThe Fi50 is voiced to the warmer side of neutral, with a gently rolled-off top end. The sound of the unit’s enclosure comes through at times, manifesting itself in a slightly boxy and syrupy midrange that colored vocals and effected how some of the dynamics came across. For example, on the MQA version of Tom Petty’s “Here Comes My Girl,” Petty’s vocals were a bit flat and too relaxed, recessed behind the music. Percussion were good, but not the best in this price range. The drums on this track were cleaner, with a bit more snap and chest-hitting thump through the much smaller Riva S —albeit at a more limited frequency response. \nAll, in all, the Fluance Fi50 did an admirable job of pumping out the tunes—at room-filling, ear-piercing volume—without exhibiting strain. It should do fine whether you are using it as background music in the kitchen or pumping up the jams at a party. Theo Nicolakis \nThe Fluance Fi50 is a big Bluetooth. In this shot, we’re comparing it to the Riva S (front left) and UE Megaboom (front right). TechHive recommends \nThe Fi50 delivers big sound and that’s out of proportion to its budget price tag, but that coloration issue prevents us from giving it a higher score. It’s a great choice if you want a speaker to fill a larger room with sound, but it’s not cut out for critical listening sessions where you want to hear exactly what the artist intended; fortunately, it’s not priced like that type of speaker. Intrigued? The company’s no-risk in-home trial makes it easy to experience for yourself.

Share Save \nToday on In Case You Missed It : Amazon created a smart store in Seattle which is currently open to just employees but next year will open to all. It lets people saunter in, grab whatever they need, then leave without formally checking out. The trick is in using the Amazon Go app and all the sensors within the store, which track which items are placed in a basket and charges shoppers accordingly. \nMeanwhile, Georgia Tech created a ' TuneTable ,' an interactive table with moving coaster-sized tiles people use to both program and then play music. If you're interested, the Guinness Book of World Records video for candles is here , and the behind-the-scenes video from Rogue One is here . As always, please share any interesting tech or science videos you find by using the #ICYMI hashtag on Twitter for @mskerryd. ",

If you subscribe to 4 items or less you’ll pay $2.04. If you subscribe to 5+ items then the price drops to $1.77. If you add enough items before your next monthly Subscribe & Save order goes out, all previously ordered subscription items will automatically drop to the lower price. It can be worth adding more subscribe and save items before they ship so that you save 15% on all the items you subscribe to. \n-You can cancel the subscribe and save service with absolutely no obligation or penalty once the item ships.

( more ) Get all of the links to today's stories right here: https://www.engadget.com/2016/... Today on In Case You Missed It: Amazon created a smart store in Seattle which is currently open to just employees but soon to be open to all; that let’s people saunter in, grab whatever they need, then leave without formally checking out.

If you’re interested, the Guinness Book of World Records video for candles is here, and the behind-the-scenes video from Rogue One is here.

      "text": "What with the year coming to a close, many ebook retailers are releasing their annual lists of best-selling and most popular titles. Google released their list last week, and I will be posting Apple's ist later today (it is hidden inside iTunes, and can only be seen after performing the ceremonial curse).\nAmazon released its lists today, with Chris Schluep, Amazon Senior Book Editor, noting that “This year’s best-selling list showcases the variety of Amazon readers’ tastes, from literary fiction to thrillers to memoirs.”\n\n“The power of Potter is still strong, and readers of all ages can’t get enough of Hogwarts. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was the most anticipated book of the year, breaking pre-order records months before its release,\" Schluep said.\nAmazon's top 20 best-selling books of 2016 overall are:\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts 1 & 2, Special Rehearsal Edition Script by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi The Whistler by John Grisham The Last Mile (Amos Decker series) by David Baldacci Killing the Rising Sun: How America Vanquished World War II Japan by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis by J.D.

      "text": "Rent the Runway Rent the Runway has items on display in its flagship store, but thousands more available online When Amazon.com Inc. unveiled the video for its new Amazon Go convenience stores, many on Twitter felt they were getting a sneak peek into the future of stores. Highlighting its use of technology like artificial intelligence, Amazon AMZN, -1.01% presented viewers with a vision for brick-and-mortar stores that is a departure from what shoppers have come to know at the local mall.\nWow. It's cool living in these futuristic times. 👏🏻 https://t.co/sBZpq6Of3M\n— Sara 🍑y (@saradietschy) December 5, 2016 WHAT! The future is here everyone 👏🏻 https://t.co/LCKOVA5zpk\n— Daniel Gabrielli (@dansvibes) December 5, 2016 In the clip, shoppers check in with their Amazon Go apps and simply start shopping. The technology tracks what’s being purchased and, without stopping first at checkout, sends a receipt through the app.\nOnline retailers are increasingly setting up shop in brick-and-mortar locations. However, they have liberated themselves free from customary store rules, giving them the flexibility to create the kind of in-store experience that they hope will drive traffic.\n“Even as e-commerce and home delivery emerged in the late 90s to present a new shopper expectation of instant gratification, the approaches to merchandising in physical retail have not fundamentally changed in 100-plus years,” said Justin Behar, chief executive of retail data and analytics company Quri.\nSee also: Amazon takes on tech’s white whale: grocery shopping\nNowadays, consumers are focused on experiences over stuff, which is tough for companies that specialize in selling stuff. Retailers are trying to give shoppers a reason to peel themselves off the couch and head to a store. That’s not just a matter of more bells and whistles, but rather fashioning a shopping experience that fits the lifestyle of the shopper.\nIntroducing #AmazonGo , a new kind of store with no lines and no checkout. https://t.co/WMii0bWevi pic.twitter.com/OmZdzobA5F\n— Amazon (@amazon) December 5, 2016 On Tuesday, Rent the Runway, a fashion company that allows subscribers to rent a rotating wardrobe, opened its new New York City flagship store. The company has six other stores in places like Chicago and San Francisco.\nSee also: Cyber Monday goes mobile, breaks $1 billion in sales\nOf Rent the Runway’s six million members, 90% are working women, according to company data. When it launched in 2009, many of the outfits rented were for special events. Now, work wear is a big area.\nA third of rentals are for same-day wear. About 16 % of orders are picked up and dropped off in stores. Using the concierge feature on the Rent the Runway app, users can chat with a sales associate and have items ready for them when they arrive. Or, if they can’t make it to the store, items can be sent using Uber Rush.\nRent the Runway The Rent the Runway flagship’s ‘Dream Closet” also features hi-tech screens “We want to get you in and out of the store in whatever time you’re willing to give us,” Rent the Runway Chief Operating Officer Maureen Sullivan told MarketWatch during a tour of the new store.\nMaking shopping a time-efficient task is one of the things traditional retailers can learn from this new breed of brick-and-mortar store. Note the first guy in the Amazon Go video who walks in and out of the store in about 10 seconds.\n“Putting me in control of how much time it will take to get out of the store and how to organize my life is a value add,” said Brendan Witcher, principal analyst at Forrester. “Companies like Amazon and others are challenging what retail should be and can be.”\nRetailers like Macy’s Inc. M, +0.43% , Gap Inc. GPS, +0.95% and Guess Inc. GES, -0.70% are rethinking their brick-and-mortar footprint, part of an effort to become the “omnichannel” operations that modern retail requires. But reaching that goal is about more than just rationalizing the number of stores they have.\nSee also: Guess joins list of retailers that are shrinking their store footprint\nWhat can artificial intelligence do for retail? (2:34) Customers return about 23% of their purchases both in-store and online, costing retailers $643 billion a year. Can artificial intelligence eliminate returns through virtual 3D try-on?\n“Traditional retailers need to start becoming customer obsessed,” said Witcher. “Today retailers need to take a step back and look at the customer journey and ask, ‘Are we enhancing that customer journey, creating value, consistency and convenience?’ By removing things that add no value, in essence you actually add value.”\nSee also: What not to buy at Target and Walmart\nBonobos, an online men’s apparel retailer, has 29 “Guideshops” across the country with a Nashville location coming this month. At the Bonobos store on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, one goal is to be hands on while using technology to personalize a shopper’s visit, said Chief Revenue Officer Erin Ersenkal.\nThe company never intended to have actual locations. “What we discovered, which is pretty obvious, was there are some customers who do still like to try on and touch things before purchasing,” said Ersenkal.\nBesides that, if you build a store where the shopper feels like a VIP, they will come.\nSee also: Customers hate fitting rooms - and clothing retailers are paying the price\n“Because orders are fulfilled through [the website], we’re able to focus on providing every customer with a unique and personal experience,” Ersenkal said, highlighting the company’s iOS system, created by Tulip Retail, a mobile platform that offers “a more seamless checkout experience.”\nPerhaps the key to the modern store is simply finding a way to get rid of the queue at the register.\n“People don’t walk into a store saying, ‘I hope I spend five minutes in a checkout line,’” said Witcher.\nMore from MarketWatch Every time I deposit $2,000 in my bank for my disabled daughter, the staff treats me like a criminal U.S. Plans to Forgive $108 Billion in Student Loans The ‘hidden’ credit card perk that could earn you up to $2,500",

      "text": "'The Snowy Day' on Amazon is an Adaptation of the Children's Book By: Joey Haar   theverge In 1962, writer and illustrator Ezra Jack Keats published 'The Snowy Day,' a children's picture book that went on to win the Caldecott Medal and become a staple on kindergarten shelves to this day. This year, as the holiday season enters full swing, Amazon has produced an animated short based on 'The Snowy Day.' Taking the same name and using a very similar animated aesthetic, the new Amazon series pays tribute to the original story in many different ways. One of the most noted aspects of the original book was its portrayal of race. Peter, the main character in the book, is black, and the characters he encounters throughout are of many different races -- though the book never overtly mentions race as a topic. Amazon's 'The Snowy Day' similarly portrays people of many races and ethnicities without making any overt statements about race.",

Not too shabby for all the extras you get! \nIn case you've lived under a rock up until 2016, Call of Duty is an immersive military series known for its high-paced action and excellent multiplayer mode.

      "text": "You'll find Amazon's Alexa voice assistant ready to take your commands from an Echo speaker, an Amazon Fire TV remote, and now, a table lamp.\nIt's a very sleek table lamp at that, and its maker, General Electric, envisions it as more than just a way to deliver Alexa to people who don't want another gadget in their house. Indeed, it appears worthy of display in a modern art museum: a free-standing, LED-filled circular tube with a tiny gray base that suggests a portal to an alien world.\nThe lamp is designed by Richard Clarkson, whose previous work includes a cloud-shaped chandelier that doubles as a motion-triggered lightning and thunder performance. Hidden in the base are a microphone and speakers, which probably won't offer the same quality you might expect from an Echo , but nevertheless harness the full power of Alexa.",
