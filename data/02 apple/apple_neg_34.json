      "title": "Apple’s new MacBook Pro is proof Tim Cook doesn’t care about software professionals - Quartz",
      "text": "Jon Evans Principal software engineer, HappyFunCorp Obsession Design 55 mins ago \nIf you are a design professional, it’s a pretty safe bet that you use some flavor of Mac. The industry’s preference for Apple products has been axiomatic for thirty years. And if you are a software professional not in thrall with the fading Windows ecosystem, then for the last decade, you have likely done the same. This made sense from a logistics point of view: The MacBook Pro marries a slick operating system atop a full-fledged Unix core, superb connectivity, and best of all, ferocious processing power. \nAt least, it did until last month, when Apple introduced its new version of the Pro, all but admitting that they were no longer interested in building computers for professional designers and engineers. It is no coincidence that the day the new Pro was announced, Linux laptop company System76 saw a huge jump in traffic , much of it anecdotally coming from disgruntled developers seeking satisfaction elsewhere . Simply put: The new MacBook Pro is anything but. \nSpeaking as a software professional, I can confirm: Apple has abandoned us. \nTo begin, the signature element of Apple’s new laptops is the TouchBar . A cute gimmick, yes, but pros are already accustomed to keyboard “chording” (and touchpad scrubbing) to speed up our work; the TouchBar offers us no real advantages. When using Safari, for example, a new TouchPad button can take you directly to the command/search bar—but Command-L has long done the same thing even faster. And a legion of developers will mourn the vanished ESC key, crucial to the baroque but powerful vim text editor used by many. \nApple does offer a new MacBook Pro without the TouchBar—but, inexplicably, this version has a much slower processor, an inferior GPU, and only two USB-C ports. The TouchBar versions have four of those, but no previous-generation USB ports, no HDMI, and no SD card reader (when both software developers and creative pros tend to be fairly serious photographers.) \nPros want flexibility. Instead we got a computer with only one kind of data port, which will force many of us to carry a flotilla of dongles to do our work. Pros want battery life. Instead we got “thinner and lighter,” which we don’t much care about. Pros want power. Instead we got a fun but useless TouchBar, and, worst of all, a hard limit of 16GB of memory. If you’re doing serious data crunching, video processing, etc., 16GB is not good enough. \nIn fairness, this last problem is also not entirely Apple’s fault. The Intel chips in the new laptops don’t support low-power memory. And yet, Apple could have sacrificed its “thinner and lighter” aesthetic and offered an actually professional Pro model with bigger batteries and more memory. They could have also updated the desktop Mac Pro. Instead they gave us cosmetic speaker grilles . \nApple is clearly no longer particularly interested in the professional market. While frustrating, the company adds insult to injury here by requiring a large swathe of us to use their platform; their Xcode development environment, used to build OS X / iOS / tvOS apps, doesn’t run on anything else. Meanwhile, in a remarkable reversal of roles, Microsoft’s new Surface Studio is earning rave reviews from creative professionals , the same group which has been faithful to Apple for decades. \nWill this abandonment of professional users actually matter to the 800-pound gorilla that Apple has become? It might. Once upon a time, Microsoft took software developers for granted, because it was Microsoft, the biggest and most powerful company in the world. The company grew fat, complacent, and bureaucratic—and it began to decay. \nI’m not saying Apple is necessarily following the same path—this might simply be a misstep corrected by the next generation of tools. But I am saying it should tread carefully. If Apple’s own history shows us anything, it’s that we developers, hackers, and designers are often the canaries in technology’s coal mines. In this context, Apple’s apparent decision to turn its back on us seems deeply unwise. \nFollow Jon on Twitter at @rezendi . We welcome your comments at . Read full story",

      "text": "When Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus this past September, there were almost no surprises left. The phones' \"boring\" new design had leaked months ahead of the event, as it always does, and nearly all of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus's new features had already been revealed by insiders. We knew about the new cameras, we new about the new components, and of course we knew that the 3.5mm headphone jack would no longer be included on the new iPhones. The biggest surprise ended up being a second new color option for Apple's 2016 iPhones.\nThe matte black color that replaced Space Gray had already leaked, and there were murmurs of a possible new deep blue color coming to the iPhone 7. Instead, Apple revealed a stunning new Jet Black color with a glossy, mirror-like finish. The new color is so popular that it's still next to impossible to walk into a store and buy a Jet Black iPhone 7 Plus. And since it's so popular, it goes without saying that Samsung was going to do everything in its power to copy it as quickly as possible.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nT-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen Leak: iPhone 8’s major redesign paves the way for a new killer feature Best Black Friday deals on Apple gear: iPhone 7, MacBooks, iPads, Beats and more ",

      "title": "Review: Skybuds offer truly wireless earbuds for workouts, iPhone 7 users",
      "text": "View on Amazon \nWireless headphones and earbuds have gotten a higher profile after Apple announced the removal of the headphone jack for its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus smartphones . Owners of the new device get to make a decision – either buy an adapter to use with their wired headphones or move to wireless. Apple hopes that you buy its own earbuds (Air Pods), but delays in shipping have left people looking for other options. \nOne such device aiming to fill that gap is Skybuds ($250, available in three color options) – these are individual earbuds (one for each ear) that provide Bluetooth wireless connectivity for your devices. While other earphone systems have a connected strap that usually goes behind the head, the Skybuds are free of such a cable (just like the Air Pods). \nThis brings both advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, there’s no strap or cable that could get caught up in your clothing while you’re working out. On the other hand, it’s much easier to misplace or lose these if you’re not careful. Fortunately, the Skybuds fit quite nicely, so the chances that these are going to drop out of your ears while you’re running or dancing are pretty slim, compared to the dangly nature of the Apple Air Pods (at least from the pictures I've seen). Alpha Audiotronics \nFitting them inside your ears isn’t that difficult. Once you find the ear tip that you feel most comfortable with (it ships with medium tips, but small and large size tips are also provided), you place the earbud into your ear, then twist one quarter of a turn so that the back end rests up against the back cartilage of the outside ear (it’s not as gross as that sentence sounds). Once the Skybuds are powered up and connected via Bluetooth you’re all set for listening to your favorite tunes. The Skybuds also include a microphone, so if a call comes in you can just talk with the Skybuds inside your ears. \nIn my tests, it did take a few attempts to get the right fit inside my ears – it felt like the space between my ear canal opening and the ridge for resting the back part of the Skybud was too small. But I also have smaller ears than normal people (I checked). This also made wearing the Skybuds uncomfortable, at least in the beginning. In a weird sense, the longer I wore these the more comfortable they became. Maybe it’s a Memory Foam type of thing, where my ears adapted to the Skybuds. Maybe it’s just that I’m weird. \nThe Skybuds also feature “passive noise cancellation”, which basically means you won’t be able to hear other people while wearing these. Because, yeah, you have a small device blocking the ear canal on each ear. OK, to be fair, if you turn off your music while wearing these, you can still hear enough of a conversation without having to remove the Skybud from your ear. \nRecharging the Skybuds is done through an included “Skydock”, which includes a carrying case for the Skybuds as well as some additional battery life. The Skydock recharges via an included USB cable. There’s also a Bluetooth connection between the Skydock and your phone, which I assume is needed in order to give the power percentage rating left on the battery for each device. You can monitor the battery levels through a really cool Skybud app, which can tell you if the battery is recharging the Skybuds. The Skybuds also recharged a lot faster than I thought they would. \nSound quality was pretty good overall – they’re not the best in the world (definitely low on the bass side), but it’s good enough for you to listen to music, podcasts or whatever you need when getting through your day (or workout). Speaking of workouts, the Skybuds are sweat- and water resistant. \nThe price ($250) may turn off some people – the Air Pods cost $159 and people thought that price was too high. I’d expect this price to come down a bit once the Air Pods become more widely available. \nGrade : 4 stars (out of five)   At a Glance",

      "text": "  \n(Twitter/Apple) Apple's website is teasing a one-day sales event for Black Friday. \nBlack Friday is just a few hours away and surprise, surprise — Apple is offering consumers a number of deals to make the holidays even more special. \nThe Apple website is currently exhorting fans to \"save the date\" as the company teases a one-day sales event that will take place on Nov. 25. \nInformation about Apple's Black Friday event and the deals that will be offered are admittedly thin on the ground. However, the fact that the Apple Watch is prominently displayed on the page hints that it's one of the products that consumers can get for a discount. \nConsumers are no doubt hoping that the Cupertino-based company will be offering some substantial discounts this time around. Apple is notorious for just knocking back $100 from products it offers at a full price or just offering iTunes or Apple Store gift cards. Advertisement \nApple didn't join the Black Friday frenzy last year and even enjoined other companies to stop the consumer-driven tradition. So its decision to dip its toe back into Black Friday has certainly surprised people and raised not a few eyebrows. \nWhile there's no news on what Black Friday deals Apple will be offering in its stores, some retailers have already revealed some interesting deals on Apple products. \nAccording to reports , one of the best deals consumers can hope to get is Target's $449 offer for the 32 GB, WiFi only, 9.7-inch iPad Pro and its $274 deal for the entry-level iPad Air 2. Best Buy is selling the same device for $275, while the entry-level iPad Mini 4 is being offered at $225. Meanwhile, the more powerful models are also given a $125 discount off of their regular price. \nThose who are planning on getting a new iPhone should resign themselves to the fact that they'll only be offered $250 gift cards instead of discounts for every purchase of an iPhone 7 or an iPhone 7 Plus.

      "text": "  Apple Grabs 91 Percent Of Global Smartphone Profits One of the criticisms against Apple and its iPhone line is that its handsets are often behind the technological curve in terms of hardware and features. Be that as it may, no other company makes more money from smartphone sales than Apple. Heck, it's not even close. The latest research from Strategy Analytics shows that global smartphone profits topped $9 billion in the third quarter of 2016, almost all of which went into Apple's pocket.“We estimate the global smartphone industry realized total operating profits of $9.4 billion during Q3 2016. Apple dominated and captured a record 91 percent share of all smartphone profits worldwide. Apple’s ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits,\" said Linda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics.The next three most profitable smartphone makers behind Apple are Huawei , Vivo, and Oppo, each of which profited around $200 million during the third quarter. Another $200 million in profit can be attributed to all other smartphone makers combined, including Samsung, Apple's chief rival in the mobile phone space.What we're seeing here is the genius of Steve Jobs still at play. There are arguably better, more advanced smartphones at any given point in time than whatever the flagship iPhone is when making the comparison, but no company does a better job than Apple at marketing its handsets. Some of the tricks are subtle, such as limiting the new \"Jet Black\" color option for the iPhone 7 to the 128GB model and above. It's a clever way of getting consumers to pay $100 more on a handset than they might otherwise be inclined.As for the competition, keep an eye on Huawei. It captured 2 percent of all smartphone profits to take second place behind Apple and is now the world's most profitable Android vendor. Strategy Analytics credited Huawei's rise to its efficient supply chain, sleek products ( check out the Honor 8 for an example), and effective marketing.",

      "text": "Apple really knows how to make a buck.\nDuring the third quarter, Apple generated 91% of the smartphone market’s profits, setting a new quarterly record, research firm Strategy Analytics said on Tuesday. Apple secured $8.5 billion of the worldwide smartphone market’s $9.4 billion in profits during the period.\nApple was far ahead of China-based Huawei, which was able to nab 2.4% of the smartphone market’s profits with its $200 million handset net income. Vivo and Oppo, two other Chinese smartphone makers, captured the smartphone market’s remaining profits during the quarter, according to Strategy Analytics.\nApple’s AAPL profit was due in part to the successful launch of its iPhone 7 in September. However, the iPhone 7 was only available for a few weeks in the third quarter, meaning much of Apple’s profits came from older handsets, including the iPhone 6s and iPhone SE.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nEarlier this month, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said in a research note that Apple had secured all of the smartphone market’s profits during the quarter. His calculation, which takes into account companies that lost money during the period, found that Apple also benefited from the demise of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7.\n\"Samsung had a weak third quarter, owing to halt and recall of the Galaxy Note 7,\" Long wrote to investors. \"After registering the highest operating margin since early 2014 last quarter, Samsung's profitability fell to near-breakeven levels in September. Samsung's market share slipped to 22% of global smartphone shipments in the quarter, and we model share to fall to the lowest level since mid-2011 next quarter.\"\nIt’s notable that Samsung, which has been one of the more prominent smartphone makers in the world for the last several years, didn’t even make it into Strategy Analytic’s roundup of companies that generated a sizable profit last quarter. In earlier quarters, Apple and Samsung combined to capture most, if not all, of the smartphone market’s profits.\nWhile Strategy Analytics didn’t discuss Samsung’s troubles during the quarter, the company did say that the Chinese smartphone vendors were able to deliver appealing products while Samsung was dealing with the Galaxy Note 7 fallout.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \n\"Huawei, Vivo and OPPO have not only improved their smartphone product lineups this year, they have also enhanced their operational abilities and kept a tight lid on expanding distribution costs,” Linda Sui, Strategy Analytics director said in a statement.\nStill, the data suggests every other company has a long way to go to catch Apple in generating smartphone profits. Better yet for Apple, its record-breaking profits came despite iPhone unit sales slipping 5% and revenue sliding 13% during its last fiscal quarter ended Sept. 24.",

      "text": "By Jonathan Berr MoneyWatch November 23, 2016, 10:13 AM Why Apple is getting in on the Black Friday action Stumble \nApple ( AAPL ) is betting that its customers, who pay premium prices for its products because they consider them to be high quality, appreciate a Black Friday bargain like everyone else. \nThe maker of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac has sent tongues wagging by announcing in an ad on its website that its offering deals on the unofficial start of the holiday season. However, in keeping with Apple’s penchant for secrecy, the company won’t disclose the deals until Friday. Dan Ackerman, senior editor at CNET, offers money-saving tips for tech shoppers during the holidays. \n“Our one-day shopping event will be here before you know it,” the ad says. \nThe Cupertino, Calif.-based company has been ambivalent about Black Friday in the past, offering “modest” product discounts along with gift cards, according to MacWorld , the website that covers Apple products and software. The tech bellwether skipped the holiday last year, the site says. A spokesperson for Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. \nApple, which has posted three consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales declines, has decided it wanted to get in on the Black Friday action itself. The company even has an online holiday gift guide to help customers find the “perfect gift. Retailers have used Apple products as “doorbusters” for years to drive holiday traffic to their store \nAccording to a Prosper Analytics survey conducted for the National Retail Federation (NRF), 137.4 million Americans plan to or are considering shopping during the Thanksgiving weekend. The trade association says Black Friday is still the most popular day to shop for consumers of all ages, though some analysts dispute this characterization. \nHoliday spending overall is expected to jump 3.6 percent to $655.8 billion, which is above the seven-year average gain of 3.4 percent since the economy began recovering from the recession in 2009, according to the NRF.

So it would come as no surprise to anyone if the Cali tech giants decided to just go for it once and for all and create a full-length mirror tablet. It would be worth it for the selfie span alone.

      "text": "Trump says he talked to Apple CEO Tim Cook about a 'very large tax cut' Wednesday Nov 23, 2016 at 10:25 AM President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday during an interview with The New York Times that Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft founder Bill Gates had called him after the election to congratulate him on his victory. Kif Leswing/Business Insider \nPresident-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday during an interview with The New York Times that Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft founder Bill Gates had called him after the election to congratulate him on his victory. \nTrump said: \n\"I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.' I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.' But we're going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you're liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It's gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can't, they can't even start up, they can't expand, they're choking.\" \nCook supported Hillary Clinton in the election, hosting a fundraiser for the Democratic candidate in August. \nTrump, several times during his campaign, threatened Apple specifically with taxes on imports from China, where Apple's products are manufactured. \n\"I'm going to bring jobs back,\" Trump said in March. \"I'm going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China. How does it help us when they make it in China?\" \nAfter the election, Cook sent a memo to all US Apple employees that did not refer to Trump by name but did include some language about celebrating diversity, which was widely seen as a rebuke to Trump's anti-immigration platform. \nApple has yet to comment on Trump's remarks publicly. Microsoft declined to comment. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation did not immediately return a request for comment. About Us",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Yes, ​Apple's iPhone is still generating monster profits, and Android is still miles behind iPhone grabs 91 percent of worldwide smartphone profits, while the nearest Android maker only manages two percent. But it's not clear how long that will continue. | Topic: Hardware \nApple's iPhone remains a money-generating juggernaut, accounting for 91 percent of all smartphone profits. \nGlobal smartphone profits stood at $9.4bn for the third quarter of 2016, and Apple's iPhone grabbed nearly all of it, according to calculations by Strategy Analytics . \nLinda Sui, director at Strategy Analytics said: \"Apple's ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits.\" \nHuawei, Vivo and Oppo are the next three most profitable smartphone vendors globally this quarter - but they are still a long way behind Apple. \nAccording to Strategy Analytics' calculations, Apple made an operating profit of around $8.5bn from its smartphones in the third quarter of the year. It estimates that Huawei generated $200m of smartphone operating profit worldwide in the quarter -- just two percent of the total -- but enough to make it the world's most profitable Android vendor for the first time \n\"An efficient supply chain, sleek products and effective marketing have been among the main drivers of Huawei's robust profitability,\" said Neil Mawston, executive director at Strategy Analytics. Vivo and Oppo also managed to take two percent of global profit each, thanks to \"disciplined pricing and soaring shipments across Asia\", the analysts said. Strategy Analytics's calculations includes global smartphone hardware profit only, where profit is defined as realized operating profit. \nFrom a market share perspective the situation is very different: according to figures from Gartner , Apple had just a 11.5 percent market share in the third quarter of this year, Huawei had 8.7 percent and Oppo had 6.7 percent. \nSamsung remains the biggest Android device maker on 19.2 percent, but problems surrounding the Galaxy Note 7 drove it to cut $2.3 billion off its profit forecast. \nThe question will be whether Apple can maintain that profit margin in the face of declining iPhone sales.

      "text": "When Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 back in September, it also forced the obsolescence of a 50+ year standard: The 3.5mm audio jack. The sound you heard—beyond the blogger complaints—was that of a million pairs of corded headphones being flung to the back of the drawer, suddenly incapable of natively working with all future models of the most popular brand of audio players on Earth.\nBut if you had a pair of AIAIAI&apos;s modular TMA-2 headphones , which were specifically designed so that the cables, headband, speakers, and earpieces could all be upgraded over time, your smartphone dropping support for a connector didn&apos;t matter, because you knew it would only be a matter of time before the TMA-2s would support the iPhone 7, headphone jack or no. And sure enough, just two months later, AIAIAI has announced the H05 , a replacement headband for the TMA-2 that gives the headphones wireless Bluetooth audio support. \nOur planet simply can&apos;t withstand the current level of waste. A small Danish audio company founded in 2006, the TMA-2 is AIAIAI&apos;s first modular product—a response to the long list of tweaks customers asked after it released its first headphones, which were not upgradeable, in 2010. \"When we released the TMA-1 we got a lot of feedback,\" says AIAIAI CEO Fredrik Jørgensen. \"We were given lots lots of new ideas, as well as requests for small adjustments from our network and users. But with a conventional design, it’s very complex to do a mark 2, let alone a large portfolio of different product versions. That’s why we turned to the modular approach.\"\nThe way Apple suddenly dropped support of the 3.5mm jack—a probable sign that the rest of the industry will soon follow—shows the wisdom of AIAIAI&apos;s modular design thinking. By being able to adapt its current, on-the-market product without resetting the manufacturing process, AIAIAI will be able to weather an industry-wide sea change in a way that might be impossible for other smaller headphone manufacturers. \"Modularity gives us agility, and helps us avoid ending up with a lot of obsolete inventory when the market changes,\" says Jørgensen.\nBut modular design is also more consumer-friendly. When a pair of TMA-2s has a loose connector, or one of the speakers blows out, customers aren&apos;t left facing a total replacement; they can easily replace the broken module themselves. Likewise, modularity encourages a broader customer base: The TMA-2s can be easily customized in configurations ranging from sub-$150 cans perfect for Beats lovers who want to step up their audio game, all the way to $250+ monitors aimed at pros. That&apos;s without taking aesthetic customization into account. As long as you like the general design language of the TMA-2s, they can be easily modified to match any individual&apos;s personal style. This, in turn, gives customers confidence that if they do invest in a pair of TMA-2s, their money won&apos;t go to waste.\nNot all hardware products are suitable for a modular approach, though. Designs that need to be as thin and light as possible—for example, smartphones—are much less practical to make modular, for all sorts of reasons . Google put tens of millions of dollars into designing a modular smartphone called Ara , yet killed the project earlier this year, for unstated reasons—reasons Lars Larsen, founder of Kilo and designer of the TMA-2s, think has to do with complexity.\n\"Even though it sounds so simple, trying to account for as many parameters [as a smartphone] means that modularity can become very complex, very quickly,\" Larsen says. \"For us, in this product category and the size of the company that we are currently looking at, it works, because it’s still pretty basic and controllable.\" In other words, AIAIAI isn&apos;t trying to build a slim, light, modular computer that can be anything for anyone. Its goal is to make a modular gadget that does only one thing well, in a market known for its tolerance of chunky designs. (And even so, it&apos;s obvious why AIAIAI is only trying to design modular headphones, not modular earbuds.)\nBut though designing more complicated modular hardware like Google&apos;s Project Ara can be like lopping the head off a hydra, Jørgensen thinks big companies like Google and Apple will still eventually need to learn how to do it as well as smaller companies like AIAIAI. \"The whole world can’t throw out millions of fully functional smartphones every year, when 80% of the newest model is functionally and even materially identical to the last,\" he says. \"Our planet simply can&apos;t withstand the current level of waste.\"",

      "text": "4.7-Inch ‘iPhone 7s’ Could be Apple’s Upcoming Mid-Range ‘Affordable’ Device Posted by Evan Selleck on Nov 23, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nAs it stands right now, one of the more common rumors regarding Apple’s 2017 iPhone plans suggests the company will launch three new handsets. \nThe first in that line is said to be a 4.7-inch model, while a 5.5-inch “Plus” model will also exist . And then, in the middle with a display reportedly measuring somewhere between 5.1 and 5.2 inches , is the third brand new addition to the mix. The 4.7- and 5.5-inch iPhone 8 models will reportedly hold onto the LCD display technology, while the new handset is said to utilize OLED display technology. \nNow, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is chiming in again, suggesting that Apple could make a few key changes in pricing and market position in 2017. Specifically, Kuo believes that the 4.7-inch LCD iPhone released next year could be called the “iPhone 7s,” and that Apple could market it as a new, “affordable” mid-range device. \nIn fact, Kuo believes that it’s possible Apple drops the price, by some measure, on both LCD-equipped models next year, including what he believes could be the “iPhone 7s Plus.” But that could put the Plus model in an awkward position as far as pricing goes, considering that particular model currently holds a $120 price increase over the smaller variant. If the OLED model is also smaller than the Plus model launched next year, Apple will certainly have to make it a point to distinguish the features in the new OLED model to warrant its higher price tag. \nWhich could be pretty easy for Apple, if the rumors are true. The iPhone 8, with an OLED display, is said to be a radical redesign for the iPhone lineup, lining up with the 10 year anniversary for the smartphone. Of course, there will apparently be similarities between models. It’s been reported that the 5.5-inch LCD iPhone 7s Plus, and the OLED-equipped iPhone 8 will feature dual-camera systems on the back. And, most recently, we heard that all the iPhone 8 models launched next year will boast glass casings to support wireless charging. \nThe Rumor Mill is certainly working overtime to paint an exciting picture for next year. Only a shame that we have to wait so many months to see it come to fruition.",

      "text": "Demand for Apple’s new MacBook Pro shows no sign of slowing down Yoni Heisler Pin it Share You wouldn’t know it based on the sheer volume of complaints surrounding Apple’s new MacBook Pro models, but the company’s new notebook line appears to be resonating with consumers in a big way. Though Apple’s new laptops have been criticized from all angles for being overpriced and under-powered, Phil Schiller a few weeks back said that initial MacBook Pro orders were quick to set new sales records. DON’T MISS: T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen “Our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before,” Schiller said during an interview with The Independent earlier this month. “So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it.” Not only that, but ongoing demand for Apple’s new laptops appears to be holding up as we transition head-first into the busiest shopping period of the year. According to MacBook Pro manufacturer Quanta (via Digitimes ), demand for Apple’s refreshed notebook line is not only strong, but will remain strong all the way through the first few months of 2017. \nQuanta Computer, the sole producer of MacBook Pro products, expects its notebook shipments to be better than expected in the fourth quarter of 2016 and will slip only 2-3% on quarter from the previous quarter, according to company vice chairman CC Leung. \nOrders for MacBook Pro models will remain strong in the first quarter of 2017, stated the sources. Apple’s Mac line has stagnated a bit recently, in no small part due to Apple’s staggered refresh schedule. Indeed, the recent MacBook Pro revamp marks the first significant update to its Pro notebook in quite a few years. What will be interesting to see, and perhaps future earnings data will bear this is out, is whether or not MacBook Pro sales are taking off because consumers are enamored with the machine’s new Touch Bar or if sales are doing well as users with old machines were simply ready to upgrade to any new machine Apple happened to unveil this year. For any Mac users unsure about whether or not now is a good time to upgrade, it’s worth noting that a minor refresh in 2017 will see Apple lower the price of its MacBook Pro line while also adding support for 32GB of RAM . If you can’t wait that long, there’s still good news to be had. Amazon is still running a promotion where you can pick up Apple’s base model 13-inch MacBook Pro (sans the Touch Bar) for just $1399, representing a solid $100 in savings off the normal $1499 retail price.

      "text": "Every time someone asks Apple CEO Tim Cook when the company's next new products are coming, Cook assures them they're just around the corner. It's just that Apple , to maintain its competitive edge, refuses to tip its hand.\nWhen Apple announced its quarterly earnings last month, one analyst asked whether the company was in \"a gap period\" in which new products aren't quite ready. \"We have the strongest pipeline that we've ever had, and we're really confident about the things in it,\" Cook replied. \"But as usual, we're not going to talk about what's ahead.\" Another asked why the Cupertino, Calif. firm's research and development spending had more than doubled in three years, growing much more quickly than revenue. Cook would only say that some of that spending would go to products in development.\nFor some, Cook's discreet act is starting to look old. Apple released the iPod in 2001, the iPhone six years later and the iPad three years after that. All three have defined or redefined their markets in ways that the Apple Watch or Apple TV haven't. It's coming up on seven years since the iPad was unveiled, and Apple doesn't seem to have its next big hit ready for showtime.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nFor investors, this is leading to impatience -- and worry. Apple recently posted its first annual revenue decline in 15 years. Its stock is down 6% over the past year, despite paying investors $12 billion in dividends and $29 billion in stock buybacks. By contrast, the Nasdaq Composite is up 5%. And Apple's longtime rival Microsoft is up an even more impressive 13%.\nUnder Steve Jobs, Apple became the corporate equivalent of Hank Aaron, a champion slugger. Five years into the Tim Cook era, Apple has managed some decent base hits, but it's coming up short on homers. The company is far from broken, posting quarterly revenue of $46.9 billion in the most recent period. But that figure, impressive in a vacuum, marked a nearly 10% drop year-over year. And the iPhone, which makes up nearly two thirds of Apple's revenue, saw revenue decline by 12% last fiscal year. The company synonymous with Silicon Valley innovation is now in need of a major hit.\n\"The cracks are showing in the Apple wall of invulnerability,\" Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Andrew Uerkwitz wrote in a research note this week. He predicts the iPhone's next release will offer \"one last 'growth' hurrah.\" And then? \"Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise,\" Uerkwitz said, arguing that Apple lacks the courage to lead in growth areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and the cloud.\nReview: Apple Finally Brings Touch to the MacBook Pro \nOther analysts have expressed similar worries, though few of them so bluntly. Still others jumped to Apple's defense. \"I think they're making a big mistake,\" CNBC's Jim Cramer said of Apple's doubters. Technology analyst Horace Dediu, speaking at an investment conference, said that Apple has been de-emphasizing the notion it's a hit-driven business, an expectation that has overshadowed its success in other areas.\nApple's aapl defenders can make a strong case. Revenue from services such as music streaming and Apple's mobile app store grew by 22% in its last fiscal year, more than doubling the growth rate of fiscal 2015. Apple's Other Products category, which includes the Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Beats audio products, grew by 11%. Products that saw revenue decline, like the iPhone and MacBooks, recently received significant upgrades that will likely boost revenue in coming quarters.\nThere are also signs that Apple could unveil new products over the next year or so that could bring in new sources of revenue, if not replicate the iPhone's smashing success. Apple is reportedly working on digital glasses that connect to an iPhone and display images through augmented reality. Some technology leaders, including Apple's Cook , believe augmented reality will be bigger than virtual reality.\nHealth care is another area of potential growth for Apple. By building on its health apps and devices like the Apple Watch and iPhone, \"Apple is on the cusp of playing a larger role in the healthcare industry,\" Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a research note. That would put Apple in a unique position \"to better monitor their health and interact with medical professionals in a seamless way relative to current methods.\"\nFor more, read: Here Are the Best Black Friday Deals for Tech ; Here Are the Best Cyber Monday Deals for Tech ; This Carrier Is Bringing Back Its Free iPhone 7 Deal for Black Friday ; Apple Is Holding a Black Friday Shopping Event \nBut there are also recent moves that support the Apple skeptics. The first MacBook Pro redesign in four years received lukewarm reviews, with some calling it \"a step forward and a step back\" and others concluding Apple was \"shooting for a future it can't quite reach.\" Apple is also delaying shipments of its wireless AirPods and backing out of making products like routers and monitors . And it's scaled back its automotive ambitions, too.\nCook has told investors Apple's innovation pipeline is as healthy as its ever been. If so, the bigger questions are when new products will arrive, and how impressive they'll be. The spirit of skepticism embraced by many on Wall Street is lowering the bar of expectations. If and when Cook does deliver a home run, it will catch many by surprise.\nThis article originally appeared on Time.com. ",

      "text": "As Apple extends its reach into healthcare, the tech giant will be competing with its onetime chief executive. \nJohn Sculley, who served as CEO of Apple from 1983 to 1993 and before that as president of PepsiCo, is now trying to upend the healthcare industry with RxAdvance , a cloud-based pharmacy benefits platform. \n\"This is the most important thing I’ve done since I was involved at Apple,\" Sculley told Mashable . \"It's the most exciting time in my life.\" \nSculley, founding partner of RxAdvance, called Mashable to talk about the future of healthcare, why health tech startups aren't tackling the big picture and what entry into healthcare means for Apple. \nThis interview has been edited for clarity. \nWhy was healthcare the next industry you wanted to tackle? \nAfter Apple, I'd gotten involved with mobile wireless services through MetroPCS and I learned how to work in a regulated industry. Then I got involved in fintech, which is also a regulated industry.\nSEE ALSO: This startup says it can save you thousands in medical bills \nI got interested in healthcare nine-and-a-half years ago. Bob Metcalfe, who invented Ethernet, told me you have to reinvent yourself every 10 years — that influence, and what I'd learned from Steve Jobs and Bill Gates in the early '80s. We were talking one evening in the Mac Lab about the \"noble cause.\" I'd never heard the words noble cause in business, because I'd come from the cola wars, where the purpose in business was to be successful at the expense of the competition. The idea of a noble cause, a societal context to it, was an entirely new idea to me in the early '80s. \nAs I thought about reinventing myself nine-and-a-half years ago, I was interested in healthcare. It's unsustainable in its present form, especially in an aging society as we have now. My biggest project is RxAdvance. \nWe're in a confusing time right now for the healthcare industry. What does the unclear future of the Affordable Care Act mean for health tech startups and companies like yours? \nI think we can be a strong advocate that the U.S. healthcare system can be transformed with the same kind of innovation we’ve seen in other industries. Healthcare has missed it. Commerce, media, communications, music and entertainment have taken advantage of cloud, mobility, data analytics, AI, machine learning, the ability to use sensors in rapid deployment. Healthcare missed all of this. \nThe high-tech industry has not taken the time to understand the complexity of healthcare. It's rules-based and special-interest driven. It's very illogical. It has laws and regulations that aren't the real best solution but are what could be negotiated at the time. \nSEE ALSO: Can Uber help Obamacare? The White House hopes so \nIn order to understand how to bring and adapt technologies that worked so well in other industries, that requires tech innovators to go through the deep learning curve of the healthcare industry. I’ve done that for 10 years, connecting the dots between the healthcare industry, the high-tech industry and the role of the consumer. We're very focused on how we can connect those dots and get something implemented. \nIf you look at the many digital health companies, very few have the business model to turn into a large, successful company. It's easy for tech entrepreneurs to get excited about the next shiny object. Look at how continually improving wearables products are. They're doing it better and better, and a sector of the wellness market really likes these products. But there really aren’t many good examples of digital health companies solving big problems. \nWe've seen Apple move into healthcare more and more with the Apple Watch, the HealthKit framework and other projects. Was the healthcare industry ever part of the discussion when you were at Apple? \nNot at all, it never crossed any discussion I was in. I’m glad to see Apple doing it, I'm glad to see other companies moving into the space. \nWhat does it mean for healthcare to have a giant like Apple move into the industry? \nIt's a great thing for Apple to do. Products like the Apple Watch, people are hoping to see it do more. Apple has expressed the importance of health tech in the unregulated space. I expect Apple will start to find more useful things for the Apple Watch, and HealthKit can be part of the whole solution. \nYou mentioned that health tech entrepreneurs aren't tackling the big problems in healthcare. Why is that, and what should they be doing? \nPeople in digital health have to be willing to do the heavy lifting of learning how the healthcare system really works. It's tempting for entrepreneurs to say, 'I can build a cool product and measure a lot of different things.' They haven’t taken that same philosophy to say how to solve problems for people who are sick, and not just for people who are well who want to measure their fitness. Companies making wearable devices, for example, are going to get smarter to solve problems for people who are sick, not just people who are well.",

      "text": "Samsung races to match Apple's iPhone 7 with new glossy black Galaxy S7   06:42 am PT (09:42 am ET) As it did with gold and rose gold handsets before, Samsung is said to be preparing to launch a glossy black version of the Galaxy S7, mimicking the Jet Black color available for Apple's iPhone 7. The new color option should ship in December , sources told The Investor . Samsung is already offering an \"Onyx Black\" with a matte finish, which could be compared to the matte Black for the iPhone 7, though many smartphone makers have some form of black for their phones. Samsung has imitated Apple's colors in the past, for instance by launching a gold version of the Galaxy S4 , and a rose gold edition of the Galaxy Note 5 . Such choices might potentially sway shoppers who would otherwise be tempted to switch to an iPhone. A current gold S7 model. Indeed the S7 is reportedly selling better than the iPhone 7 in Korea thanks to the Nov. 11 launch of a \"Coral Blue\" color, which doesn't have an Apple equivalent. While Samsung is said to be selling about 15,000 Coral Blue units per day, the iPhone 7 is estimated to have dipped to about 10,000 units. Topics:",

      "text": "2017 4.7\" LCD 'iPhone 7s' predicted to become Apple's new mid-range affordable handset   06:10 am PT (09:10 am ET) With Apple expected to launch three new iPhone models next year, a new report suggests the company could slash prices on the 4.7- and 5.5-inch models with legacy LCD technology, allowing them to appeal to a new segment of consumers. Concept rendering of next-gen iPhone with edge-to-edge display. Aligning with numerous other reports , analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities believes Apple will unveil a flagship, redesigned OLED iPhone next year, accompanied by two LCD models at the same size as the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. 2017 'iPhone 7s' \nTwo sizes: 4.7 & 5.5 inches LCD display, glass back \n2017 'iPhone 7s' But Kuo believes that the 4.7-inch 2017 model, in particular, could become a new mid-range or even low-end model for Apple. If Apple does lower the selling price of its models with LCD screens, he sees the so-called \"iPhone 7s\" accounting for between 30 and 35 percent of new-model iPhone shipments in fiscal year 2017. Most sales, he suspects, will go to the OLED \"iPhone 8,\" predicted to account for between 50 and 55 percent of shipments of new models next year. With a new bezel-less design hiding key components —such as the earpiece and Touch ID fingerprint sensor —underneath a screen sized between 5.1 and 5.2 inches , the OLED iPhone is expected to be a radically redesigned handset celebrating the 10th anniversary of Apple's iconic smartphone. And though he said prices may also be lowered accordingly for the jumbo-sized 5.5-inch \"iPhone 7s Plus,\" the phablet-style product could find itself in an \"awkward position\" between the 4.7-inch and OLED models, he believes. Currently, the iPhone 7 Plus carries a $120 premium over the iPhone 7. In all, Kuo is extremely bullish about Apple's 2017 iPhone lineup, expected to launch in the latter half of the year. He expects shipments of new models will balloon to between 90 million and 110 million, up from an estimate 75 million in 2016. Supply chain sources indicated to Kuo that Foxconn will be the primary manufacturer of the new OLED iPhone, while Pegatron is believed to become the exclusive supplier of the 4.7-inch LCD model. A large chunk of manufacturing of the 5.5-inch \"iPhone 7s\" is expected to fall to Wistron, but Kuo believes that model will only account for between 10 and 15 percent of new iPhone shipments next year. The latest indications suggest that OLED production may not be as constrained as was previously feared. Recently, numerous reports suggested that limited availability of OLED displays could limit production of the new flagship iPhone in 2017. Last week, Kuo indicated that both the 5.5-inch \"iPhone 7s Plus\" and slightly smaller OLED \"iPhone 8\" will feature dual-camera systems . But it is not expected that the 2017 4.7-inch \"iPhone 7s\" will gain a second camera, as was introduced on the iPhone 7 Plus. Topics:",

Photo: Credit Hiroko Masuike — The New York Times \"Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States,\" recounted Trump to the New York Times. about the recent call with the Apple CEO. \"Instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.\" According to Trump, Cook's only response was, \"I understand that.\" \"I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it,\" added Trump. \"We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.\" In the portion of the conversation related to Cook and Apple, Trump also pointed to his view that a \"choking\" overly regulatory environment within the federal government is responsible for a poor start-up climate, and hampers expansion. \"I've met so many people. They are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut,\" said Trump. \"And I would've never said that's possible, because the tax cut's going to be substantial.\" Trump added that the reaction to regulatory reduction was surprising to him, and \"more enthusiastically supported\" than large tax cuts.

      "text": "For a while now, reliable rumors have suggested that Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) plans to launch not two, but three new iPhone models next year. Those same rumors suggest that Apple will put out two variants with traditional liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, with a third ultra-high end version sporting a curved organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display.\nImage source: Apple.\nThanks to a new report from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo with KGI Securities, by way of MacRumors , we now have more information about this this, OLED-packing iPhone.\nIt'll have a large display, but... Kuo acknowledges that there's an apparent disconnect between his prior report that the next iPhone lineup could feature a model with a 5.8-inch OLED display and his new comments claiming that the OLED iPhone could have a 5.1-inch to 5.2-inch display.\nHe has a good reconciliation: \"We predict OLED iPhone will adopt a 5.7-5.8 [inch] flexible OLED panel,\" Kuo begins. \"Nonetheless, for 'specific design purposes', the actual active area may be around 5.1-5.2 [inches].\"\nA large (curved) display in a small footprint? Sounds familiar If the notion of a large display in a relatively small footprint sounds familiar, it's because that was one of the things that was quite nice about Samsung 's ( NASDAQOTH:SSNLF ) Galaxy S7 Edge released earlier this year. That phone packs a 5.5-inch curved OLED display, as measured along the diagonal. However, because the display curves into the sides, the phone's physical footprint isn't much larger than that of the Galaxy S7 with a 5.1-inch flat display.\nApple's transition to a curved OLED display should allow it to achieve something similar.\nCalling it now -- this phone is going to sell like crazy Although the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus appear to be doing well in the marketplace, I believe that next year's curved OLED model has the potential to sell like crazy.\nFirst, a significant change in form factor and display technology will probably result in an incredibly impressive-looking device. Apple has been fielding devices with largely the same look and feel for three generations now, so there could be a sizable portion of the iPhone installed base that'll get quite excited for a significant change in those areas.\nThose iPhone owners who have been holding off on upgrading until Apple delivered such dramatic changes could finally hop on board once this OLED iPhone is out. Additionally, I suspect that there are some individuals who prefer the Apple ecosystem and iOS but ultimately opted for phones such as the Galaxy S7 Edge because they liked the curved display. Those customers could come back once the OLED iPhone is available to purchase.\nIndeed, it's hard not to see the parallels between what happened with the iPhone 6 and what could potentially happen with the OLED iPhone. Remember that before the iPhone 6 generation, Apple didn't offer customers iPhone models with large screens. This decision probably cost Apple some business during the iPhone 5s generation. However, once the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus arrived, Apple saw significant market share gains and even pull-ins of iPhone upgrades.\nOnce Apple begins fielding smartphones with curved OLED displays, even if they are relatively pricey, I think the company will be once again poised to take share from high-end Android smartphone makers. And, perhaps, the company could see another pull-in of iPhone demand.",

      "title": "Apple’s Next iPhone Is Shaping Up to Be a Big Update",
      "text": "Rumors surrounding the next iPhone keep coming.\nApple will be transitioning its iPhone design to an all-glass casing in next year’s new iPhones, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote to investors this week, according to Apple-tracking site Macrumors, which obtained a copy of the research note.\nKuo, who is one of the more reliable Apple forecasters, cited sources who said the glass casing would make it easier for Apple to deliver wireless charging in next year’s handsets. But he’s unsure whether Apple would bundle wireless chargers, which can be expensive, with next year’s iPhone. At least one iPhone model will come with a wireless charger, according to the report.\nKuo has been one of the more vocal Apple prognosticators over the last few years. His recent investor notes include predictions that Apple is planning a major update to the iPhone next year that could include three different versions.\nThe first, he has said, would come with the same 4.7-inch screen in this year’s iPhone 7. Apple AAPL could deliver a 5.5-inch iPhone next year, along with an all-new smartphone that could feature a 5.8-inch screen . That handset would come with new screen technology, called organic light-emitting diode, and its display would be curved.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nBut Kuo isn’t alone. Other analysts and market researchers have also predicted a big iPhone update from Apple next year , which could include a curved screen and larger display. There’s also been talk over the last several months of Apple offering wireless charging and an all-glass enclosure . In the 5.8-inch iPhone Kuo has predicted will reach store shelves, it’s believed the display would take up the entire face of the iPhone, eliminating areas above and below the screen where the home button and earpiece reside. Apple might also bake its Touch ID fingerprint-sensing technology into the glass.\nAccording to Kuo, the all-glass design makes it easier to wirelessly charge devices compared to metal, the material Apple currently uses for its iPhone. He added that Apple design chief Jony Ive has wanted to deliver an iPhone that looked like it was made from a single piece of glass.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nStill, it’s impossible to know for sure whether Kuo’s sources are correct or if Apple is planning something radically different for next year’s iPhone. While the next iPhone is believed to be known as the iPhone 8, it might also get iPhone 7s branding. It could also come with an all-new name to commemorate the iPhone’s 10th anniversary.\nApple hasn’t commented on its future plans.",

      "text": "Tip : Use comma (,) to separate multiple quotes. Learn more... \nWed, Nov 23, 2016, 17:05 GMT - UK Markets closed Trump says he talked to Apple's CEO. Here's what he says they talked about. By Anita Balakrishnan | CNBC – 12 minutes ago President-elect Donald Trump told The New York Times he got a call from Apple CEO Tim Cook , and they talked about bringing more production back to the U.S. \nHere's what Trump said on Tuesday, according to a transcript from the Times : \n\"I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates , great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.' I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.'\" \nWe don't know Cook's side of the conversation, though CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. In a wide-ranging interview Tuesday, Trump told Times reporters that by cutting regulations, bringing production back to the United States would boost jobs and further America's position in the robotics industry. \nTrump promised during his campaign to lower the business tax rate to 15 percent and allow the one-time repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a tax rate of 10 percent. With a 26 percent tax rate and $216 billion stored offshore, Apple could be the biggest beneficiary in tech of the policies, according to Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. Cook has said he would love to repatriate Apple's cash, if not for the \" unreasonable,\"\"backward\" and \"awful \" tax rate. \n\"I tell you, one thing I would say, so, I'm giving a big tax cut and I'm giving big regulation cuts, and I've seen all of the small business owners over the United States, and all of the big business owners, I've met so many people,\" Trump told the Times . \"They are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut. And I would've never said that's possible, because the tax cut's going to be substantial. You know we have companies leaving our country because the taxes are too high. But they're leaving also because of the regulations.\" \nBut Trump has also proposed adding one regulation — tariffs on trade with China — that Deutsche Bank said could hurt Apple more than any other technology company. Apple's supplier dossier lists about 350 addresses in China, and Greater China is the company's third-biggest market, behind Europe and the United States. \nCook has been credited for finding the best suppliers and talent around the world since he arrived at Apple, slashing inventory costs and halving the production time for computers, according to biographer Walter Isaacson. The feat earned him a place as one of Steve Jobs' top deputies, before being named CEO. \nReturning manufacturing to the United States — likely a costly proposition for Apple — might cause jobs to be replaced by robots, Trump said. But those robots would also be American made in the Rust Belt, Trump added in the contentious meeting with the Times . \n\"Right now we don't make the robots,\" Trump said. \"We don't make anything. But we're going to, I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we're going to do that. We're going to have more factories. We can't lose 70,000 factories. Just can't do it. We're going to start making things.\"",

      "text": "  @11:40AM from the dominance dept. Apple has captured a record share of profits in the global smartphone industry in the third quarter, according to new research, despite grappling with falling iPhone sales. From a report on CNBC: Third-quarter smartphone operating profit reached $9 billion globally of which Apple took 91 percent of the share , Strategy Analytics said in a note on Tuesday. This amounts to $8.19 billion for the U.S. technology giant. Apple has the highest profit margins in the smartphone industry thanks to a loyal brand following and the ability to price its iPhones at a premium. And the figures come even after Apple reported three straight quarters of iPhone sales declines. Sat a long way behind Apple is China's Huawei which managed to grab 2.4 percent of global operating profit share in the smartphone market, accounting for $200 million, according to Strategy Analytics. Chinese start-up brands Vivo and OPPO are in third and fourth place, both capturing 2.2 percent of global smartphone profit each.",

      "text": "Details \nThe 64GB iPad mini 3 from Apple has a smaller form factor than its big brother, the iPad Air 2. The iPad mini is just 7.5mm thin and weighs less than 1 pound. Its smaller form factor makes it easier to hold in one hand. This iPad mini comes in a space gray finish. \nThe tablet’s 7.9\" Retina Display features a native resolution of 2048 × 1536, showing up to 3.1 million pixels at 326 ppi. The Retina Display’s capacitive touchscreen lets you utilize all the multi-touch gestures of iOS 8. \nRetina Display The Retina Display provides 4 times more pixels and 44% greater color saturation than the iPad 2. Within the 7.9\" LED -backlit touchscreen, the 2048 × 1536 native resolution renders text and images at 326 pixels per inch and a total of over 3.1 million pixels. The display also features a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating to reduce smudges. \nDual-Core A7 Chip Thanks to the A7 chip, apps run fast on the iPad mini 3. It also supports OpenGL ES version 3.0, enabling detailed graphics and visual effects once only possible on desktop computers and game consoles. And the A7 chip features 64-bit architecture, opening the door for even more robust and powerful apps. \nM7 Coprocessor The iPad mini was designed to be on the move. That’s why the M7 coprocessor measures motion from your iPad mini by pulling data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass. This allows your apps to give you a better experience based on the movement of your iPad mini. It’s a task that would normally fall to the A7 chip. But M7 is more efficient at it, which saves on power and opens up the A7 chip to focus on other tasks. \nBattery Life The mini 3 gives you up to 10-hour battery life to surf, play, watch, and chat. That’s because the A7 chip isn’t just more powerful, but utilizes low voltage to be more efficient. \nFeatures & Specifications: Dual-Core Apple A7 CPU with M7 Chip Front 1.2-Megapixel FaceTime HD Camera Rear 5-Megapixel iSight Camera",

(KRON) —Apple may be bringing back an old, but popular style of cell phones with their newest design. \nOn Tuesday, the tech giant was granted the patent to a fold-able, flexible display screen. \nApple’s latest ideas could one day lead to a bendable iPhone much like the old-school flip phone. \nThe patent features a touch-screen smartphone with a design popularized by clam-shell phones, one that opens and closes like a notebook. \nIt’s unknown for sure if there is an iPhone flip phone in the works, but Apple’s patents often provide a glimpse into what the company is thinking for the future.

      "text": "Donald Trump told Tim Cook that Apple is going to ‘build a big plant’ in the U.S. “I think you’re going to do it.” share Drew Angerer / Getty Apple does the bulk of its manufacturing outside of the U.S. During his campaign, Donald Trump said he could change that. Now he says he is setting the wheels in motion, starting with a phone conversation with Tim Cook. Here’s Trump’s description of his call to the Apple CEO, via a transcript of his talk with the New York Times yesterday: “I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’ But we’re going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you’re liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It’s gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can’t, they can’t even start up, they can’t expand, they’re choking.” Since Trump’s proxies have told us to take the things he says seriously but not literally — no jail time for you, Hillary Clinton ! — it’s reasonable not to read too much into this anecdote, or anything else he told the Times.* On the other hand, one of the biggest themes of Trump’s campaign, and the one his advisers say is most meaningful, is the notion that he can force/persuade companies to bring manufacturing jobs back into the U.S. So maybe he thinks this really can happen. On yet another hand, Apple seems quite serious about keeping the bulk of its manufacturing outside the U.S. You can read all about that in a Times story published earlier this week — with Apple’s cooperation — which explains that Apple is happy to employ tens of thousands of American workers, but in roles like tech support or engineering, not assembling phones. * You could pick any section of the Times transcript, read it out loud and find it baffling/amusing/deeply worrisome. Here, for instance, is his stance on windmills: Donald Trump's explains that he doesn't like windmills because \"they kill all the birds\". https://t.co/unjH4PkndN pic.twitter.com/QwkBoM334M — Siraj Datoo (@dats) November 23, 2016 recode_divider",

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Apple (Nasdaq: ( AAPL - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Cisco (Nasdaq: ( CSCO - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Intel (Nasdaq: ( INTC - Free Report ) – Free Report ), NVIDIA (Nasdaq: ( NVDA - Free Report ) – Free Report ) and Facebook (Nasdaq: ( FB - Free Report ) – Free Report ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free . Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog: Tech Stock Roundup: iPhones, A.I., Self-Driving Cars and More Last week was an exciting one with some rumors about Apple’s (Nasdaq: ( AAPL - Free Report ) – Free Report ) iPhone manufacturing in the U.S., Cisco’s (Nasdaq: ( CSCO - Free Report ) – Free Report ) earnings report, Intel’s (Nasdaq: ( INTC - Free Report ) – Free Report ) first AI Day plus lots more. iPhone Manufacturing In The U.S. In June this year, Apple requested its iPhone assemblers Pegatron and Foxconn to evaluate the feasibility of making the devices in the U.S. While Pegatron refused outright on cost considerations, Foxconn has decided to do the job. The study is likely to show that the cost increase, skill mismatch and supply chain problems (the supply chain is largely in Asia) would make this cost prohibitive. This would raise iPhone prices for consumers/squeeze Apple’s margins. But the study will help Apple negotiate with the government, which might agree to fund skill development and/or subsidize U.S.-made phones. If not, Apple could introduce a luxury line of iPhones manufactured in the U.S. and try to set off the super normal profits on those with the increased cost of phones carrying the government import duty. Note that Apple is not the only smartphone maker saddled with the problem. So if all smartphones get more expensive, Apple’s market share may not be affected. Cisco Earnings Report Cisco’s first quarter 2017 results topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the top and bottom lines but the guidance disappointed. Switching remains a sore point for Cisco in a market increasingly favoring SDN networks and leveraging the cloud. So it’s not surprising that this segment declined 7%. The company had greater success in security where both advanced threat (up 100%) and web security (up 60%) were strong. Intel A.I. Day At its first Artificial Intelligence (AI) Day in San Francisco last week, Intel announced bold plans to target the deep learning segment that is currently dominated by NVIDIA (Nasdaq: ( NVDA - Free Report ) – Free Report ) GPUs. Intel silicon is also in the mix, but it doesn’t take part in the real training work. Artificial intelligence comprises two main operations: training and inference with training being the more compute intensive. Inference can be handled by Intel CPUs, Xilinx/Altera FPGAs, NVIDIA GPUs, ASICs like Google TPU and in some cases, DSPs. Now Intel is planning to enter the training side very aggressively and hopefully it can stick with the timeline it has set. Based on its acquisition of startup Nervana last year, Intel is building a new Xeon processor with Nervana integration. FPGAs are generally used as accelerators and we don’t know yet if Intel will be using the FPGA technology it got through Nervana or Altera, which it also picked up recently. At any rate, Intel promises to deliver 100X the training speed current GPUs offer within three years, which industry expert Patrick Moorhead says is aggressive. Intel expects the chips to start testing in mid-2017 and ship by year end. Fake News Drama Facebook (Nasdaq: ( FB - Free Report ) – Free Report ) and Google are being pressured by mainstream media (MSM) for influencing the public in favor of Trump. As ridiculous as this sounds, there is a lot of print devoted to trying to prove them guilty. Google recently started employing artificial intelligence to support its search results that have until now been solely algorithm-based. But as luck would have it, there was a brief period during which time 70news.wordpress.com took the top position, fielding incorrect data on the number of votes earned by Clinton and Trump and claiming to have obtained the information from Twitter. The information was reportedly correct elsewhere on Google but this was enough to earn Google accusations for making money out of “fake news.” So Google has said in a statement, \"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property.\" It is hoped that the inability to generate revenue from fake news will make it harder to produce it. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly said that 99% of the news sites posting on Facebook were authentic and that it didn’t want to get into the position of arbiter of truth. \"We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\" said the Facebook statement (the company has now added the fake news part to pacify parties). Facebook also gave an assurance that it would continue to vet publishers to ensure compliance.

      "text": "Michel Porro | Getty images Tim Cook, CEO of Apple President-elect Donald Trump told The New York Times he got a call from Apple CEO Tim Cook , and they talked about bringing more production back to the U.S.\nHere's what Trump said on Tuesday, according to a transcript from the Times : \n\"I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates , great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.' He said, 'I understand that.' I said: 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.'\" \nWe don't know Cook's side of the conversation, though CNBC has reached out to Apple for comment. In a wide-ranging interview Tuesday, Trump told Times reporters that by cutting regulations, bringing production back to the United States would boost jobs and further America's position in the robotics industry. \nTrump promised during his campaign to lower the business tax rate to 15 percent and allow the one-time repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a tax rate of 10 percent. With a 26 percent tax rate and $216 billion stored offshore, Apple could be the biggest beneficiary in tech of the policies, according to Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. Cook has said he would love to repatriate Apple's cash, if not for the \" unreasonable,\" \"backward\" and \"awful \" tax rate. \n\"I tell you, one thing I would say, so, I'm giving a big tax cut and I'm giving big regulation cuts, and I've seen all of the small business owners over the United States, and all of the big business owners, I've met so many people,\" Trump told the Times . \"They are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut. And I would've never said that's possible, because the tax cut's going to be substantial. You know we have companies leaving our country because the taxes are too high. But they're leaving also because of the regulations.\" \n\nBut Trump has also proposed adding one regulation — tariffs on trade with China — that Deutsche Bank said could hurt Apple more than any other technology company. Apple's supplier dossier lists about 350 addresses in China, and Greater China is the company's third-biggest market, behind Europe and the United States. \nCook has been credited for finding the best suppliers and talent around the world since he arrived at Apple, slashing inventory costs and halving the production time for computers, according to biographer Walter Isaacson. The feat earned him a place as one of Steve Jobs' top deputies, before being named CEO. \nReturning manufacturing to the United States — likely a costly proposition for Apple — might cause jobs to be replaced by robots, Trump said. But those robots would also be American made in the Rust Belt, Trump added in the contentious meeting with the Times . \n\"Right now we don't make the robots,\" Trump said. \"We don't make anything. But we're going to, I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we're going to do that. We're going to have more factories. We can't lose 70,000 factories. Just can't do it. We're going to start making things.\" \nFor the full transcript, read the article at NYTimes.com.",

      "text": "| Follow About | \nEye On Apple covers the latest hot news stories, rumors and illuminating discussions about Apple and its products. Product coverage includes Apple Watch, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Pay, Apple TV. Opinion Will Apple upgrade the iPhone SE in 2017? Rumors suggest that Apple will not update its popular 4-inch iPhone SE in 2017, and that could be a big mistake. Users that prefer the smaller iPhone should have the option to upgrade to a better version of the iPhone SE. CIO | Nov 23, 2016 8:36 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this 10 tablets for under $500 \nWhen Apple first released the iPhone SE there were many naysayers in the media that downplayed the appeal of a new 4-inch phone. Well these nattering nabobs of negativism where proven wrong when the iPhone SE proved to be quite popular with Apple’s customers. \nUnfortunately, it seems increasingly likely that the iPhone SE will not get an update in 2017, according to a recent report on the MacRumors site: \nApple will not refresh the iPhone SE in the first half of 2017, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The lack of refresh comes as Apple attempts to maintain high margins on its high-end iPhone models, Kuo said in a new research note. \nKuo forecasts that total shipment volume of iPhones will decline in the first half of 2017 due to tepid demand in China, slow shipment volume of 4.7-inch iPhones and the lack of an iPhone SE refresh in the second quarter of the year. Kuo argues that shipment volume came in higher in the first half of 2016 due to “upbeat demand for the iPhone SE.” \nApple introduced the iPhone SE in March 2016, packing in many of the iPhone 6s’ features and component into a 4-inch frame similar to that of the iPhone 5s. It’s unclear what kind of upgrade schedule Apple will adopt for the device, but it’s internals are powerful enough to remain a capable phone for a couple of years. \nMore at MacRumors \nAs always I take this kind of rumor with a huge grain of salt, only Apple knows if they will update the iPhone SE in 2017 or not. However, Kuo has been proven right in the past on other predictions so it’s worth taking note of his comments about the iPhone SE. iPhone SE owners deserve an upgrade \nIf Apple does not update the iPhone SE and does not release a 4-inch or 4.3-inch version of the iPhone 8, I think the company will be doing its customers a major disservice and it will no doubt anger some owners of the current iPhone SE. \nDon’t get me wrong here, the hardware in the iPhone SE is by no means bad. Current iPhone SE owners could certainly get by fine for another year, but the fact is that they should have the option to upgrade to a newer model the same way that owners of the larger iPhones are able to do each year. \nOne of the criticisms of the iPhone SE was that it lacked some of the hardware features found in the iPhone 6 and 6s Plus when it was first released. Some reviewers and users were disappointed that 3D Touch and other features found in the larger phones were not available in the iPhone SE. \nThat resentment about having to settle for a slightly lesser model of iPhone is going to grow the longer Apple holds off on updating the iPhone SE. Fans of smaller phones might rightly call into question the fairness of being forced by Apple to lag behind users of larger iPhones. \nWhy should iPhone SE users accept being second class customers? Larger iPhones don’t work for all Apple customers \nLet’s face it, some folks just do not like larger phones. It doesn’t matter if we’re talking about the 4.7-inch screen iPhone or the 5.5-inch screen Plus model. Both of the larger phones simply do not work for customers that want a small phone. \nI thought Apple understood this when they released the iPhone SE, but the company now seems to think it can blithely ignore smaller phone users while releasing what looks to be the biggest overhaul ever of the iPhone next year with the iPhone 8. \nI had hoped that we would see a 4-inch or 4.3-inch version of the iPhone 8 next year that would replace the iPhone SE altogether, but that now seems very unlikely. From everything I’ve read Apple seems to be working on just a regular and plus sized model iPhone 8. \nSo the folks that like small phones will probably be frozen in time for another year with their iPhone SE devices, but the larger iPhones will get a huge upgrade and revised form factor in the iPhone 8. There should be three sizes of the iPhone 8 \nI think it’s time for Apple to accept the fact that they need three sizes for the iPhone 8. One size for the folks that want a small phone, one for those who prefer a mid-size phone, and one for the users that want a big phablet. \nIf the company just offered three sizes of iPhone 8, with mostly the same hardware and features, it would go a long way toward generating good will and great sales of the next iPhone. And the iPhone SE could be retired gracefully without angering the customers that prefer smaller phones since they could just upgrade to the small version of the iPhone 8. \nUnfortunately, I doubt that this will happen. For all we know the iPhone SE could become the next Mac Pro and suffer for years without an update, with no small version of the iPhone 8 becoming available either. \nI don't know what's going on inside Apple these days, but the company better get ready to hear from some angry iPhone SE users if they don't release an updated small phone in 2017. \nDid you miss a post?

      "text": "Either Target is just being lazy and reckless or it’s participating in retail war. The big box chain store has decided to open up Sunday, November 27, and go through Monday with a storewide 15 percent discount, in-store or online. It’s a flat, automatic, couponless discount applied at checkout that tops off whatever discount is already on whatever you buy.\nThere has to be a catch, right? Well, here are the products that don’t fall into this discount.\nGift and prepaid cards Beauty Advent Calendar Elf on the Shelf LEGO Cards Against Humanity (really?) Joking Hazard Vitamix Simple Human Weber DSLR gear Traeger LG TVs Samsung TVs Google products Bose Sonos GoPro Alcohol Dairy milk Tylenol CVS pharmacy Clinic Target Optical Portrait Studio Company Store purchases \nTarget is explicitly offering discounts on “ Apple products ,” though. Just to give you a sampler:\nA pair of Beats Solo3 wireless headphones will cost about $244.99 (regularly $299.99) A 6th-gen iPod Touch will be priced between $135.99 and $203.99 ($159.99-$239.99) A standard Apple Watch Series 2 will cost $314.49 for a 38mm case and $339.99 for a 42mm case ($369.99 and $399.99) An iPad mini 2 with Wi-Fi will cost $229.49 ($269.99) While an iPad Pro 12.9″ with Wi-Fi will cost between $679.99 and $934.99 ($799.99-$1,099.99) A 32GB iPhone 7 for $30.69 per month for two years or $552.49 total ($36.11 per month or $649.99 total) Mind you, other smartphones and mobile technology are available at 15 percent off, too, like the unlocked Moto G4 Play for $127.49 ($149.99) and, believe it or not, a discontinued BlackBerry Classic S for $280.49 ($329.99).\nYou think you’ll want to participate in this madness?\nThe post Target discounts Apple products, all mobile tech for Sunday and Monday appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Join a chat \nReports suggest Apple has at least a passing interest in exploring a manufacturing facility in the United States, apparently going as far as to open a feasibility study about producing the iPhone at a US plant. Foxconn chairman Terry Gou pointed out the obvious: increased costs in production lead to higher costs for consumers. \nWould anyone buy a $1,500-plus iPhone? \nWhile we don’t have concrete cost figures (and Apple will never provide them), analysts predict the iPhone 7 costs approximately $224.80 to make in China. Here’s the part that you can’t overlook: \nThe total cost of the build, according to data from IHS Markit , adds up to $219.80. Once you factor in labor costs, estimated at $5 per phone , the total build runs $224.80 for the base model, 32GB iPhone 7 . The company claims that this is an increase of $36.89 per unit, as opposed to the $187.91 iPhone 6s base model from last year. \nGood luck getting labor down to $5 a unit in the US. \nThat’s not the only problem. Currently, it’s doubtful the US has the skilled labor force capable of matching this kind of output. According to Tim Cook: \nChina put an enormous focus on manufacturing. In what we would call, you and I would call vocational kind of skills. The U.S., over time, began to stop having as many vocational kind of skills. I mean, you can take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably put them in a room that we’re currently sitting in. In China, you would have to have multiple football fields. \nTax cuts for companies willing to move production back to the United States are, in theory, a great idea. As with all things Trump though, the reality is never that simple. \nLuckily, Trump has a backup plan in the form of a 45 percent tariff on imported goods. Again though, it’s a solution that sounds great at the surface, but fails to take into account outside factors that could lead to much bigger problems should it come to fruition. In the real world, there are consequences for solutions like these, and an increase in manufacturing jobs could lead to a temporary boon, and then a major crash as other countries start imposing the same (or worse) tariffs on US-imported goods. \nTariffs, as it turns out, work both ways. \nTrump, who criminally oversimplified solutions to globalization, is now about to meet with the reality of why it can’t be stopped.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nRestoring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the United States’ struggling Rust Belt communities was one of President-Elect Donald Trump’s biggest campaign promises, and at least one major technology company is considering following through. According to the Nikkei Asian Review , iPhone maker Apple has begun exploring the possibility of moving smartphone production to the United States. \nThe report, published on Friday, cites a source familiar with Apple’s plans. The Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S. \nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free \nPegatron reportedly declined, citing logistical concerns. Foxconn agreed to compile report as soon as June, but company chairman Terry Gou warned that it would show drastically higher productions costs. The potential result? An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs. Question: Would you pay $80 more for your next iPhone if you knew it was Made in the USA? \n— Jeremy Kaplan (@SmashDawg) November 18, 2016 \nA thorough report in the MIT Technology Review found that moving iPhone assembly to the U.S. would add $30 to $40 to the cost of an iPhone thanks to “transportation and logistics expenses [that] would arise from shipping parts.” \nMore: Superior silicon: How Apple is beating chipmakers at their own game \nManufacturing the smartphone’s hundreds of components domestically is an even pricier — and vastly more complex — proposition. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told CBS’ 60 Minutes in December 2015 that the U.S. labor pool lacked the skills necessary to carry out iPhone production, and Apple executives have estimated that it would take as long as nine months to recruit the roughly 8,700 industrial engineers that oversee Chinese assembly lines. And that’s before efficiency is taken into account: A 2012 CNN Money report noted that Chinese factories house workers in employee dormitories and “can send hundreds of thousands to the assembly lines at a moment’s notice.” \nThen there’s the U.S.’s lack of natural resources to consider. MIT Technology Review points out that few of the 75 elements required to manufacture the iPhone are available commercially in the U.S. Aluminum, for instance, requires bauxite, and there are no bauxite mines in the U.S. China, on the other hand, produces 85 percent of the world’s rare earth metals. \nMore: Spendy but indispensable: Breaking down the full $650 cost of the iPhone 5 \nFurther complicating matters is Apple’s sprawling supply chain of more than 750 firms in over 20 countries. Taiwan Semiconductor produces crucial iPhone chips; South Korea’s SK Hynix and Japan’s Toshiba produce the handset’s memory modules; and Japan’s Japan Display and Sharp provide the iPhone’s display. “To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,” an industry executive familiar with iPhone production told economics blog NorthCrane . \nBut Apple’s plan isn’t without precedent. In 2013, Motorola Mobility employed more than 3,800 employees to assemble the Moto X, a flagship Android phone, at a factory in Fort Worth, Texas. Just a year later, though, it was forced to shutter production as a result of “exceptionally tough” market conditions, according to Motorola president Rick Osterloh. The company subsequently moved production to China. Apple \nOthers have been more successful. Foxconn established a stateside iMac computer assembly line in 2012. A year later, Singapore-based Flextronics, manufacturer of Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computer, built a production line in Austin, Texas. \nMore: When will the iPhone use an OLED screen? Here are all the rumors \nIn October 2015, Sharp president Tai Jeng-wu suggested that if Apple were to begin producing smartphones in the United States, it would likely follow suit. “We are now building a new [advanced organic light-emitting diode] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” \nNews of Apple’s plan follows Trump’s victory in the presidential election. The president-elect has been a vocal supporter of U.S. companies that build their products in the U.S., and has proposed levying steep tariffs — potentially as high as 45 percent — on competing Chinese importers. \n“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of other countries,” Trump said in a speech in January. “How does it help us when they make it in China?” \nIn an interview with The New York Times published in November, Trump recounted a phone conversation with Tim Cook during which he urged the CEO to move part of Apple’s production line to the U.S.: \n“I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’” \nMore: Apple scales back production of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, expects lower sales in 2016 \nIn an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned of retaliatory measures if such trade restrictions were to go into effect. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” a Global Times article read. \nA move of production by Apple could also threaten the company’s relationship with Chinese leadership. Earlier this year, in what was widely seen as a protectionist move by regulators, Apple’s iBooks and iMovies were temporarily blocked within the country. And in June, China’s Beijing-based intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on a design patent held by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili. \nApple has extended olive branches in recent months. The company invested $1 billion in China-based ridesharing app Didi Chuxing. It’ll open its first research and development facility in the country — a $45 million office within Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park — by the end of this year. And in October, it pledged to build a second facility in China’s Shenzhen province. \nMore: Apple planning a second research and development center in China \nEven if Apple were to move iPhone production to the U.S., it likely wouldn’t be enough to stem the country’s losses. Foxconn employed roughly 690,000 workers in China as of the end of April, down slightly from a peak of 1.3 million in 2012. The Economic Policy Institute, a U.S. think tank, estimated that the U.S. had lost five million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2014. \nBut politics may trump economics in the end. U.S. automaker Ford may prove the precursor of developments to come: On Friday, the company shelved plans to move production of its Lincoln crossover SUV from Kentucky to Mexico. “The Apple supply chain must treat Trump’s campaign pledge seriously and not write it off,” an industry executive told NorthCrane. \nArticle originally published in November 2016.

      "text": "Bigly — Trump says he’s going to get Apple to “build a big plant” in US \"We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.\" Cyrus Farivar - Nov 23, 2016 6:59 pm UTC Enlarge / President-elect Donald Trump walks through the lobby of the New York Times Building following a meeting with editors of the paper on November 22, 2016. Spencer Platt / Getty Images News Trump urges supporters to boycott Apple in wake of encryption brouhaha President-elect Donald Trump told The New York Times in a Tuesday interview that he would incentivize Apple to “build a big plant” in the United States.\nDuring that interview, Trump touched on numerous subjects, changing his tune on several campaign positions. He backed off threats he made during his campaign to prosecute his political rival, Hillary Clinton, over her use of a personal e-mail server while she was Secretary of State. \nHowever, Trump indicated to columnist Thomas Friedman that he is going to double-down on bringing factory jobs back to America, especially in the Rust Belt from Michigan to Pennsylvania. \nFRIEDMAN: Are you worried, though, that those companies will keep their factories here, but the jobs will be replaced by robots? \nTRUMP: They will, and we’ll make the robots, too. [laughter] \nTRUMP: It’s a big thing, we’ll make the robots, too. Right now we don’t make the robots. We don’t make anything. But we’re going to. I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we’re going to do that. We’re going to have more factories. We can’t lose 70,000 factories. Just can’t do it. We’re going to start making things. \nHe continued, saying that he had received a call from Apple CEO Tim Cook. \nAs Trump recounted: \n…and I said, ‘Tim, you know, one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’ But we’re going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you’re liberal or conservative, I mean, I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It’s gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can’t, they can’t even start up, they can’t expand, they’re choking. \nRecently, the Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple's manufacturing contractors, Foxconn and Pegatron have been looking into manufacturing the iPhone in the US. \nApple did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment. Trump did not mention the fact that earlier this year, he called for a boycott of Apple products .

Target, one of the largest retailers in the US, announced that, on November 27 and November 28, it's going to offer \"15 percent off nearly everything online and in stores.\"The 15% discount will be applied at checkout (either online, or in stores). Target specifically says that the deal includes \"all Apple products\", which means you'll be able to buy a brand new iPhone 7 , Apple Watch 2, or iPad Air 2 for 15% off. In addition to Apple devices, Target is selling many Android smartphones, including the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, and we assume that these, too, will be sold at lower prices. Before Cyber Monday, Target will also offer various Black Friday deals . November is such a perfect month for shopping, isn't it?",

Earlier this summer, Mr. Cook hosted a fundraiser for democratic candidate Hillary Clinton; following Mr. Trump's election, Mr. Cook issued a memo to Apple employees about diversity, which many interpreted as a stance against Mr. Trump's controversial policy ideas. \nLikewise, Mr. Trump called for a boycott of Apple earlier this year, after the company refused to hack the iPhone of a San Bernardino, Calif., shooter; Mr. Trump has also criticized Apple, among other companies, for manufacturing hardware outside of the United States. \"We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,\" USA Today reports Mr. Trump told a crowd at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., this past January. \nApple did not return a request for comment, according to USA Today . \nMore articles on health IT:",

      "text": "Josh Edelson | AFP | Getty Images Apple wireless AirPods are tested during a media event at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California on September 07, 2016. With one of the biggest shopping days of the year ahead, Apple's AirPods ship date is still listed as \"currently unavailable\" and \"coming soon\" online. \nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the ship date of its new earbuds. But a Barclays analyst said the $159 AirPods may start production next month, after Apple said they weren't ready to ship in October. \nProduction of the wireless earbuds should start in December but will be at the \"fairly small\" level of 10 million to 15 million to start, Barclays semiconductor analyst Blayne Curtis wrote in a research note. The AirPods had been slated to hit the market in late October, but Apple said they weren't ready to be shipped at that time. \nApple has announced plans for a special shopping event on Black Friday — a key shopping holiday — but hasn't announced any specific discounts on products. \nThe holiday quarter will be key for the iPhone maker, which released the headphone jackless iPhone 7 amid reporting several quarters of year-over-year sales declines. Though reviewers have called the wireless earbuds \" odd ,\" Apple said the early response has been \"incredible.\" \nCurtis wrote about the AirPods after traveling in Asia to meet with mobile manufacturers earlier this month. \nDuring the trip, Curtis said the iPhone 8 design \"didn't sound 100 percent locked down,\" but at least the Plus model appeared to have bezel-less screens that curve around the edges, like those used by Samsung. Apple may also launch new iPads in March, including a refresh of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and a unveiling new 10.9-inch that also has a screen with curved edges, Curtis predicted.",

      "text": "President-elect Trump this week spoke to Tim Cook on the phone, and asked the Apple CEO to bring more of its manufacturing back to the US.\n\" I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here,'\" Trump told journalists from the New York Times yesterday, according to a transcript of the conversation. \nTrump said he promised Cook and other tech companies incentives for manufacturing stateside, including \"a very large tax cut for corporations.\"\nAccording to Trump, Cook responded with \" I understand that.\" \nThe revelation comes after Nikkei last week reported that Apple in June asked Foxconn and another Taiwanese iPhone assembler Pegatron to look into what it would take to make iPhones in the states. \"Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns,\" according to Nikkei . \nIn 2011, Steve Jobs reportedly scoffed at the idea of bringing iPhone production to the US when asked by President Obama what it would take to make that happen. \"Those jobs aren't coming back,\" Jobs said at the time.\nIn 2012, Cook announced plans to bring some parts of Mac production to the US ; Apple reportedly invested more than $100 million as part of that effort. \n\nFor today's Random Access, we're demoing the Logitech Harmony Elite and sharing the latest news on Facebook censorship, lip-reading AI, and Apple. Ask questions!\nPosted by PCMag on Wednesday, November 23, 2016 Trump, meanwhile, made manufacturing a key part of his campaign, vowing to stop US corporations from shipping their jobs overseas. \" We're going to bring jobs back, big league. I've spoken to so many companies already, I say, don't plan on moving your company, 'cause you're not going to be able to move your company and sell us your product,\" Trump told the Times this week. \nOn the campaign trail, Trump called for a boycott of Apple over its encryption fight with the FBI. \" Tim Cook is looking to do a big number, probably to show how liberal he is. But Apple should give up, they should get the security or find other people,\" the president-elect said during a February rally in reference to Apple's refusal to create an iOS backdoor for the FBI. The agency eventually gained access to the iPhone in question on its own. \nIn a post-election memo to staff , Cook did not address manufacturing. Instead, he discussed concerns about Trump's rhetoric. \" Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love,\" he wrote. \nFor now, overseas production seems to be working well for Apple. Strategy Analytics this week reported that Apple captured a record 91 percent share of all smartphone profits worldwide during the third quarter. \" Apple's ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits,\" Linda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics, said in a statement .",

      "text": "22 Hours Ago | 03:05 \nApple fell 1 percent Wednesday and has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 8 percent over the past month — but after poor postelection performance, some say that the tech giant is set to stage a turnaround. \n\"Apple has been a little bit underwhelming, but the truth is they have the time, they have the talent, and they have the cash to kind of keep going until they figure it out. So we really think on any kind of relative valuation basis, this is a great story,\" Max Wolff, market strategist at 55 Capital, said Tuesday on CNBC's \" Trading Nation .\" \nApple's recent performance is indicative of a broader trend in rotation from \"extra excitement about tech and growth\" into assets considered to be safer as the market will become more volatile, he said. \nYet the stock looks to be a relative bargain, according to Wolff. \"If it's overvalued, it's a lot less overvalued than almost anything else, you could probably buy in a marquee name.\" \nIndeed, Gene Munster, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray, wrote in a note last week that he recommends buying large-cap internet stocks at these levels despite the sell-off in the group, and describes this time as a \"rare opportunity to buy pullbacks in companies with clear multiyear revenue earnings trajectories warranting higher valuations.\" \n\"We would be buying the fear priced into internet mega-caps, with concerns of President-Elect Trump's impact on tech companies being largely extrapolated from sound bites that are unlikely to manifest during Trump's presidency, in our view,\" he wrote of Apple, Amazon , Google , Facebook and Netflix . \nTrump has castigated Apple's tendency to manufacture products outside the U.S., doubling down on that critique on Tuesday in a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times . \nMunster holds a bullish $155 price target on Apple. Analysts' average price target is $130, according to FactSet. \nFrom a technical perspective, charts of Apple appear bullish, according to Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer. He would mark Apple as a buy at this point in a sector that he says looks strong across the board. \n\"We recommend Overweight exposure to the Technology sector, and see AAPL as a tactical idea that hasn't run up as much as the rest of the sector,\" Wald wrote to CNBC on Tuesday. \n\"The stock has largely underperformed since peaking in May 2015, now seeing signs of a reversal that bears resemblance to the reversal in shares in 2013,\" he wrote, adding that Apple could \"benefit from some rotation.\" \nThe S&P 500 information technology sector over the last month remains virtually unchanged, making it the third-worst-performing sector in that time frame.",

      "title": "Apple's Frankenstein-Oriented Holiday Ad Is Adorable, Watch It Now",
      "text": "By jessica rawden 24 minutes ago \nWe've yet to stuff ourselves with cornbread and turkey, but thanks to the advent of shopping starting around the Thanksgiving holiday, we've already seen plenty of Christmas ads start hitting the Internet and TV airwaves. One of these is Apple's new ad, and it's an ad that's a whole lot different than the trendy, pop-oriented ads the company often prefers. In fact, it features Mary Shelley's famed creation Frankenstein and a traditional holiday carol. Do give the new ad a watch, below. \nThe nice thing about this particular ad is that it offers a compelling and honestly pretty emotional story. I'm not all that used to Apple ads making me cry, but this one is adorable and even a little sentimental---again not adjectives that I'm normally used to with Apple content. The ad features Frankenstein getting ready for the holidays. He's clearly as misunderstood in this ad as he has been in literature and the movies, but he has a plan this Christmas, buying some goods and heading down for the town's Christmas tree lighting ceremony. \nIn the town square, good 'ol Frankie pulls out red and green lightbulbs to connect to the electric sockets in his neck. He also pulls out an Apple product so he can sing along to \"There's No Place Like Home For The Holidays.\" The town is a little weirded out by the experience at first, but one little girl takes a chance on Frankenstein and helps him to sing along. By the end the whole village is happy because they've \"opened their heart(s)\" on the holiday. \nAs I said, it's pretty sentimental. Then again, around this time of year, overemotional often works. \nLast year, for instance, we got that horrifically sad commercial about the old man who celebrated Christmas alone for years and then went to lengths to fake his death to get his kids home for the holidays. Yes, that's a real ad and it's still devastating a year later. There was also the one about the lonely man on the moon and the little girl who saw him. If you want to go back a little farther to 2014, there was that other John Lewis ad about Monty The Penguin that was also wildly emotional. It's not like Apple is doing something new here, but it's still pretty artful. \nHeading into the holiday season, expect a lot of ads to be thrown your way. Hopefully, some of these will cut through all the noise. Subscribe To Topics You're Interested In close \nSubscribe To Topics You're Interested In I've already subscribed",

      "text": "Tip : Use comma (,) to separate multiple quotes. Learn more... \nWed, Nov 23, 2016, 19:50 GMT - UK Markets closed Apple's mysteriously delayed AirPods may trickle back into production in December, analyst says By Anita Balakrishnan | CNBC – 43 minutes ago 111.23 -0.57 With one of the biggest shopping days of the year ahead, Apple's AirPods ship date is still listed as \"currently unavailable\" and \"coming soon\" online. \nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the ship date of its new earbuds. But a Barclays analyst said the $159 AirPods may start production next month, after Apple said they weren't ready to ship in October. \nProduction of the wireless earbuds should start in December but will be at the \"fairly small\" level of 10 million to 15 million to start, Barclays semiconductor analyst Blayne Curtis wrote in a research note. The AirPods had been slated to hit the market in late October, but Apple said they weren't ready to be shipped at that time. \nApple has announced plans for a special shopping event on Black Friday — a key shopping holiday — but hasn't announced any specific discounts on products. \nThe holiday quarter will be key for the iPhone maker, which released the headphone jackless iPhone 7 amid reporting several quarters of year-over-year sales declines. Though reviewers have called the wireless earbuds \" odd ,\" Apple said the early response has been \"incredible.\" \nCurtis wrote about the AirPods after traveling in Asia to meet with mobile manufacturers earlier this month. \nDuring the trip, Curtis said the iPhone 8 design \"didn't sound 100 percent locked down,\" but at least the Plus model appeared to have bezel-less screens that curve around the edges, like those used by Samsung. Apple may also launch new iPads in March, including a refresh of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and a unveiling new 10.9-inch that also has a screen with curved edges, Curtis predicted.

      "text": "iPhone diehards swarmed when Apple announced its new Jet Black color -- they plain sold out . Samsung may have picked up the trend that \"shiny black is the new black\" and could be planning to reveal a Glossy Black version of the Galaxy S7 .\nKorean news site The Investor first reported that the S7 would get new shade on Monday, but photos posted by a Chinese Samsung Weibo account also show the S7 Edge in the glossy hue. Although we have yet to see official renderings of the two devices side by side, this may be our best look yet at the new finish.\nEnlarge Image Photo by Shaokingchina/Weibo Enlarge Image Photo by Shaokangchina/Weibo Enlarge Image Photo by Shaokangchina/Weibo The Glossy Black version bears a resemblance to the old Onyx Black color, with the main difference being the shiny black back plate. If it's anything like the iPhone 7 in Jet Black, the glossy sheen may be a magnet for fingerprints and smudges, which we can see in some of the pictures. I also worry it could pick up scratches, like the Jet Black iPhone 7 , so the Glossy Black Galaxy may have the same issue.\nEarlier this month, Samsung released the Galaxy S7 Edge in Coral Blue , and according to The Investor it has been selling 15,000 units a day on average. \nAccording to the rumor, we could see a Glossy Black S7 as early as December. Samsung hasn't announced the shade, and told CNET it won't comment on rumors.\n ",

      "text": "  Recipes and Cooking Tips / Pear, Apple, and Cranberry Crisp with Marshmallow Pear, Apple, and Cranberry Crisp with Marshmallow November 23, 2016 by D Durand Leave a Comment \nPut a new twist on traditional apple crisp with this Pear, Apple, and Cranberry Crisp with Marshmallow recipe. It’s a delicious holiday dessert! \nFall and winter are perfect for baked goods and nothing spells cold weather desserts like a just out of the oven apple crisp. But if you think regular old apple crisp is a hoot then you may just lose your mind after you get a load of this Pear, Apple, and Cranberry Crisp with Marshmallow . \nI know, I know it’s a lot to wrap one’s mind around, but our new twist on this classic dessert is actually “a thing” worth hunting and gathering the ingredients for. You’ll need a few baking pears, a Granny Smith apple, and another baking apple. I used a honey crisp. Plus, cranberries. Pear, Apple, and Cranberry Crisp with Marshmallow Recipe Ingredients: 1 1/2 teaspoon orange zest 1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice 1 1/2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 1/2 tablespoon granulated sugar 1/3 cup + 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoon apple pie spice Topping: 1 1/2 cups + 2 tsp all-purpose flour 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1 cup light brown sugar 1/2 tsp sea salt 1 1/4 cup whole rolled oats 2 sticks unsalted butter, grated 3-4 cups of marshmallow creme \nDirections: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Peel and core pears and apples. In a mixing bowl combine pears, apples, cranberries, orange zest, lemon juice, apple pie spice, and granulated sugar. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, add rolled whole oats, all-purpose flour, sea salt, light brown sugar, granulated sugar, and 2 sticks of grated unsalted butter. Mix on low until ingredients combine and start to form into pea shapes. Spoon pear, apple and cranberry mixture into a baking dish and top liberally with the oatmeal topping. Place Pear, Apple, and Cranberry Crisp on the center rack in the oven and bake for forty-five minutes to an hour. Remove crisp from the oven and slater on three to four cups of marshmallow creme. Turn oven to the high broil setting. Place the crisp back in the oven and toasted the marshmallow until it is a golden brown. Remove the crisp from the oven and allow it to stand for fifteen minutes. Serve. \nHere is the finished product and if I had to describe it in a single word, I would say, “OMGEE! OMGEE! “OMGEE!” I cannot even begin to tell you what difference a lil’ bit of toasted marshmallow creme makes. The toasted marshmallow gives this apple recipe LIFE!

      "text": "Related Content View Photo Could Donald Trump really get Apple to 'build a big plant' in the US?\nConvincing Apple to make its products in the US will be a ‘real achievement’ says Trump, but skepticism remains about whether it could ever happen\nDonald Trump says he promised Apple CEO Tim Cook ‘incentives’ such as tax breaks to get the company to bring its manufacturing home. Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images Donald Trump told Apple CEO Tim Cook that he is going to “get” the company to start manufacturing its products in the United States, the president-elect told the New York Times on Tuesday. \nTrump revealed that he had received a post-election phone call from Cook during which he said, “Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States.” \nAccording to Trump’s account, Cook responded, “I understand that,” and Trump went on to promise incentives through tax breaks and reduced regulations.\nRelated: Strong-arm Apple and tax China bigly: a guide to Trump's possible tech policies \n“I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it,” Trump said he said. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation of Trump’s characterization of the call, nor did it respond to a request for comment on the content of Trump’s remarks. \nThough Apple markets its high-end products as being “designed by Apple in California”, the electronics are assembled at factories in China from components produced primarily in China, Japan and Taiwan, according to the MIT Technology Review . The company says that its suppliers employ more than 1.6 million people . \nForcing American companies to bring jobs back to the US was one of the key themes of Trump’s presidential campaign, despite his own business’s decision to manufacture apparel in China or Bangladesh . \n“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,” the then-candidate told supporters in Virginia on 18 January. \nTrump later called for a boycott of the company’s products unless it acceded to the FBI’s demand that it unlock one of the San Bernardino shooters’ iPhones, a request Apple had strenuously resisted. \nApple markets its products as ‘designed in California’ but assembles them in Chinese factories from components produced in China, Japan and Taiwan. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA But most experts agree that building iPhones from scratch in the US is impractical and economically unfeasible, largely because the company relies on a complex and very large supply chain and manufacturing infrastructure already established around Shenzhen, China. \n“Geography matters,” said Seungjin Whang, a Stanford Business School professor who studies supply chain management. “In Shenzhen, if you need a part (how scarce it might be), you can find at least 10 suppliers within a day.”\n“Right now the supply chain to make consumer electronics in volume does not exist in the US,” said Tim Wilson, a partner in venture capital firm Artiman. “You might tax [importing] so it costs more, but to reposition and get people to rebuild that supply chain in the US is not something that I would predict in the next few years.”\nIf Apple were to invest in establishing a new supply base in the US, Whang predicts that the delay would give its competitors – largely Korean and Chinese companies – time “to catch up and eat its lunch”. \nJason Dedrick, a professor at Syracuse University’s School of Information Studies, analyzed Apple’s supply chain for the MIT Technology Review and found that assembling iPhones in the US would add between $30 to $40 to the product’s cost, largely due to labor costs and the additional cost of shipping components to the US. \nDedrick’s estimate did not include the capital cost outlay of building factories, which could be substantial. \nRelated: Apple flips out with clamshell iPhone patent \n“It’s quite feasible for Apple to do limited volume assembly of some products in the US,” Dedrick said, proposing iMacs as a possibility. “I don’t think it’s possible to move production of hundreds of millions of iPhones to the US, at least not at a competitive cost.” \nOne possibility, Greg Linden of the Institute for Business Innovation at UC Berkeley said, would be for Apple to have “the parts kitted in China and shipped to the existing factory of one its assemblers here and voilà – you’ve got a US-assembled iPhone with one extra process step plus some extra shipping and labor.”\nThat strategy could cost as little as $10 to $20 per iPhone, he said, but is limited to the capacity of those already existing factories. \nAs to whether Apple will attempt something like that, Linden said, “I guess it depends on how badly Tim Cook wants a win.”",

      "text": "Donald Trump told Apple CEO Tim Cook that he is going to “get” the company to start manufacturing its products in the United States, the president-elect told the New York Times on Tuesday. \nTrump revealed that he had received a post-election phone call from Cook during which he said, “Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States.”\nAccording to Trump’s account, Cook responded, “I understand that,” and Trump went on to promise incentives through tax breaks and reduced regulations.\nStrong-arm Apple and tax China bigly: a guide to Trump's possible tech policies Read more \n“I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it,” Trump said he said. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation of Trump’s characterization of the call, nor did it respond to a request for comment on the content of Trump’s remarks. \nThough Apple markets its high-end products as being “designed by Apple in California”, the electronics are assembled at factories in China from components produced primarily in China, Japan and Taiwan, according to the MIT Technology Review . The company says that its suppliers employ more than 1.6 million people . \nForcing American companies to bring jobs back to the US was one of the key themes of Trump’s presidential campaign, despite his own business’s decision to manufacture apparel in China or Bangladesh . \n“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,” the then-candidate told supporters in Virginia on 18 January. \nTrump later called for a boycott of the company’s products unless it acceded to the FBI’s demand that it unlock one of the San Bernardino shooters’ iPhones, a request Apple had strenuously resisted. \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Apple markets its products as ‘designed in California’ but assembles them in Chinese factories from components produced in China, Japan and Taiwan. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA \nBut most experts agree that building iPhones from scratch in the US is impractical and economically unfeasible, largely because the company relies on a complex and very large supply chain and manufacturing infrastructure already established around Shenzhen, China. \n“Geography matters,” said Seungjin Whang, a Stanford Business School professor who studies supply chain management. “In Shenzhen, if you need a part (how scarce it might be), you can find at least 10 suppliers within a day.”\n“Right now the supply chain to make consumer electronics in volume does not exist in the US,” said Tim Wilson, a partner in venture capital firm Artiman. “You might tax [importing] so it costs more, but to reposition and get people to rebuild that supply chain in the US is not something that I would predict in the next few years.”\nIf Apple were to invest in establishing a new supply base in the US, Whang predicts that the delay would give its competitors – largely Korean and Chinese companies – time “to catch up and eat its lunch”. \nJason Dedrick, a professor at Syracuse University’s School of Information Studies, analyzed Apple’s supply chain for the MIT Technology Review and found that assembling iPhones in the US would add between $30 to $40 to the product’s cost, largely due to labor costs and the additional cost of shipping components to the US. \nDedrick’s estimate did not include the capital cost outlay of building factories, which could be substantial. \nApple flips out with clamshell iPhone patent Read more \n“It’s quite feasible for Apple to do limited volume assembly of some products in the US,” Dedrick said, proposing iMacs as a possibility. “I don’t think it’s possible to move production of hundreds of millions of iPhones to the US, at least not at a competitive cost.” \nOne possibility, Greg Linden of the Institute for Business Innovation at UC Berkeley said, would be for Apple to have “the parts kitted in China and shipped to the existing factory of one its assemblers here and voilà – you’ve got a US-assembled iPhone with one extra process step plus some extra shipping and labor.”\nThat strategy could cost as little as $10 to $20 per iPhone, he said, but is limited to the capacity of those already existing factories. \nAs to whether Apple will attempt something like that, Linden said, “I guess it depends on how badly Tim Cook wants a win.”",

      "text": "With Apple providing a rather mundane update through the iPhone 7 recently, whispers that an overhaul is coming in 2017 are growing louder. Whether that includes an OLED display, a bezel-less screen or an all-glass design remains to be seen, but it turns out the Cupertino giant could be looking to change the smartphone game even further. Much like the many similar examples we've seen from rival Samsung, Apple has been awarded a patent which appears to show off a flexible iPhone. The design was spotted by AppleInsider, which showed off the images below from the simply titled \"flexible display devices\" and also revealed details of the hinged handset. Related: iPhone 8 release date, rumours, news, specs and price But how would it all work? Well, although Apple doesn't outline all the details, we can see how an upper and lower section could house processors, sensors and cameras that could all communicate in the same way as a current smartphone does. This, of course, allows the phone to achieve a retro look while still potentially bringing advanced tech to the table. As with all patents, there's a slim chance this ever makes it to production, but a gimmicky refresh could be a welcome side addition to a lineup that has become painfully predictable in recent times. With Samsung seemingly eager to release a bendy alternative sooner rather than later, let's see whether Apple looks to jump the queue and steal our easily-captured hearts. entertainment and tech news? @digitalspy Twitter account and you're all set.",

      "text": "– A + Apple, TSMC reportedly ramping up 10nm chip mass production for use in future iPhones By Mike Wuerthele \nWednesday, November 23, 2016, 11:59 am PT (02:59 pm ET) \nReports from China suggest that the major chip fabricators are all readying mass production of 10nm process processors, including Apple's manufacturing partner TSMC for multiple companies.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to supply chain reports from DigiTimes besides just for Apple's future A-series processors, TSMC will supply the Helio X30 and X35 for MediaTek, between the end of 2016 and 2017. \n\nTSMC is also expected to provide chips for HiSilicon, which will ultimately find its way into Android-based Huawei flagship phones.\n\nApple's A10 Fusion chip as found in the iPhone 7 family utilizes TSMC's 16nm FinFET process. Apple's A9 in the iPhone 6S family and iPhone SE, and A9X processors found in the 12.9-inch iPad Pro use the same size die.\n\nTwo otherwise identical chips with different die sizes have less the current used on the chip manufactured with the smaller die. As a result, in most cases the generated heat is less, and the power demanded by the smaller die size chip is lower as well.\n\nQualcomm has also recently announced its 10nm mobile chips will be fabricated by Samsung, with shipment of the Snapdragon 835 in commercial devices in the first half of 2017. Samsung's as-yet unrevealed Exynos evolution is also expected in the first half of 2017.\n\nSmaller die sizes are in development at this point. IBM has built the first functional chips with 7nm technology , with consumer products with the technology likely at some point in 2019.",

      "text": "Intel Secret Revealed In Apple's MacBook Pro Nov.23.16 \nApple's new MacBook Pro has not been well-received. \nThis appears to be the result of unexplained delays in Intel's 3D XPoint memory. \nA tear-down of the product reveals a peek into the future. Most of us have seen the complaints by now. BGR.com summarized this nicely in a recent piece entitled \"You probably shouldn't buy a new MacBook Pro right now\" . A quote: \nWhile new product announcements from Apple ( AAPL ) are typically greeted with a certain amount of fanfare, the company's recently unveiled MacBook Pro hasn't exactly engendered a positive response. On the contrary, Apple's new MacBook Pro models have been blasted from all angles, with the overarching theme being that Apple has completely abandoned its core base of creative professionals. More specifically, Apple's new laptops have been criticized for being overpriced and for limiting the amount of RAM to 16GB. Essentially, Apple's new MacBook Pro is only impressive by 2015 standards when all of the other Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) Skylake products were released. The product is essentially a year late to the game and its announcement comes on the heels of Skylake's successor - Kaby Lake . Other manufacturers like HP (NYSE: HPQ ) are already shipping Kaby Lake so it is not outwardly clear why Apple chose to ship the stale processor in its shiny new object. Click to enlarge As always, I believe that there's a simple explanation. Prepare for an alien autopsy because, once again, I'm about to go Fox Mulder. You see, the MacBook's criticism is largely hinged on its 16GB memory limitation. One of Apple's more intrepid customers actually emailed the company and received a response from the marketing chief Phil Schiller. A quote (where \"MBP\" stands for \"MacBook Pro\"): \nQuestion from customer: The lack of a 32GB [build to order] option for the new MBPs raised some eyebrows and caused some concerns (me included). Does ~3GBps bandwidth to the SSD make this a moot issue? I.e. memory paging on a 16GB system is so fast that 32GB is not a significant improvement? \nSchiller's answer: Thank you for the email. It is a good question. To put more than 16GB of fast RAM into a notebook design at this time would require a memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn't be efficient enough for a notebook. I hope you check out this new generation MacBook Pro, it really is an incredible system. But a thread on Reddit elucidates the root cause more directly: \nThe true reason behind the lack of 32gb or ddr4 is Intel. Skylake does not support LPDDR4 (LP for low power) ram. Kaby Lake is set to include support, but only for the U category of chips. So no LPDDR4 support for mobile until 2018 I think. This poster then calls upon Apple to switch its laptops to ARM because \"Intel is incompetent at delivering proper mobile chipsets\". Lenovo is accumulating a lot of would-be MacBook Pro users by sacrificing energy efficiency and installing regular desktop-based DDR4 in some variants of its high-power laptops. But this sort of fragmentation is decidedly against Apple's vision. The $64,000 Question With all of the chatter, nobody asked the important question: if LPDDR4 has been around for years now , why don't modern Intel processors support the technology? If my $300 smartphone has the technology so why can't the industry-leading CPU manufacturer support it? My opinion is the same as it ever was: 3D XPoint (\"XP\" or \"Intel Optane\") was supposed to ship a long time ago but has been delayed by cloudiness surrounding the intellectual property rights surrounding the ECD bankruptcy proceedings, which have been curiously delayed time after time. Over the past year alone, the ECD bankruptcy has been delayed as follows: Delayed to February 15th, 2017 Although not nearly as sloppy, the MacBook Pro event was almost as rushed as the 2015 3D XPoint announcement - very little notice was provided to the press. I believe that Intel and Apple were hopeful that the ECD bankruptcy was going to stay closed and an Optane-based main memory system would finally fix the memory limitation on Intel's mobile processors. After four years without a major update and more than 20 delays in the ECD bankruptcy, it is probable that Apple finally implemented a contingency plan: design for the best case - an Optane-based MacBook Pro. But also create an LPDDR3 board that could be swapped in if required. And it leveraged Skylake because that was the only thing that was available when this played out. If my speculation is accurate, then we might be able to read into the crystal ball using clues from the LPDDR3 consolation prize. Fortunately, Apple products always receive the tear-down treatment the instant that they become available. In this case, iFixIt.com provided a beautiful set of photos from its inspection (with requisite republishing rights). Immediately, we see that the SSD sticks out like a sore thumb: Click to enlarge What is special here? For starters, this is a proprietary interface - I was expecting to see an industry-standard interface (in its previous product, it used SATA although the current state of the art is M.2 NVMe ). Why is Apple using a propriety interface? Closer inspection reveals that this Apple SSD has more connections (56 per side versus 34 for an M.2 connector). More importantly, each of the pins are much wider than industry standard. For reference, a Samsung SSD that uses the regular M.2 NVMe interface is pictured below: Click to enlarge On Apple's proprietary design, the increased pin width and count require a dramatic change resulting in a substantial reduction in flexibility. The M.2 form factor was created to accommodate a variety of different lengths , for example. Apple's proprietary design really reduces that sort of flexibility. Well, Apple can still extend the length but I have to wonder if that use case will ever present itself if it is able to cram 2TB onto this short module. But why would Apple increase pin width and count? There is only one logical conclusion for each of these: increased power and bandwidth requirements, respectively. In terms of bandwidth, this MacBook Pro SSD is among the best performers in the world - but it still isn't yet pushing the limit of the M.2 NVMe standard, which maintains a substantial number of pins that are reserved for future use, including the \"Future Memory Interface\". The reviews of today's fastest SSDs elicit a recurring theme: synthetic benchmarks are often the only thing that is able to test the limits of these devices. Why would Apple invest substantially in going-it-alone on a proprietary SSD interface? The answer hit me the other day when I wrote some gigabytes of data to a high-speed USB flash disk. At just 50 megabytes per second, the drive got extremely hot because the write process is power intensive. Intel has already demonstrated Optane at 2 gigabytes per second, which I presume is going to be the low-end of the speed range, given the portable nature of the storage device in question. I don't need to do the math: power consumption is going to be a factor. Is Apple's new SSD interface accommodating for this by way of wider pins? My guess is obviously in the affirmative. Related Intel patent applications already consider the restriction of bandwidth based on power and thermal constraints. Leave Britney Alone! Obviously, the MacBook Pro flop isn't Apple's fault beyond that of choosing to use Intel CPUs in its laptops. And who could blame them? With all of the extra information that was provided to Apple management behind Intel's closed doors, I'm certain that the decision was easy. What is this extra information? I'm glad that you ask because I've been spouting it for years. For those who haven't already consumed it, my previous article \"Intel Soon to Drop Weapon of Mass DRAM Destruction\" outlines the issue well, if I do say so myself. Go back to my June of 2015 article \"Purple Swan\" if you'd like the full story. The abbreviated version is that Intel promised Apple - and many others - that they'd be shipping Optane by now. That is, Intel never intended to support LPDDR4 because it were to entirely obsolesce the need for it by way of Optane. Most recently, Intel has been promising the first Optane shipments by the end of this year: Click to enlarge If my hypothesis is correct, we will not see real Optane until after the ECD loose end is resolved. Why? There is some insight in a recent (June 22, 2016) Intel cross-point memory patent application, which outlines a method to write to cross-point phase change memory (\"PCM\") in just 10 nanoseconds. This is where you should feel the ground shaking! If it is able to write a PCM memory cell in 10 nanoseconds, this implies that the cross-point selection device - an Ovonic Threshold Switch (\"OTS\") - the Magic Part of the technology that eliminates the need for transistors and enables 3D fabrication - is performing with extremely high performance. Give Me Some Rope In August, Stanford published some fundamental research on PCM technology. Now, humankind still doesn't know for certain how Ovonic switching works - we just know that it does. There's a big opportunity here for someone to learn something that nobody else knows about - potentially a huge competitive advantage. \nStanford-led experiments point toward memory chips 1,000 times faster than today's \nIn the presence of a sophisticated detection system, the Stanford researchers jolted a small sample of amorphous material with an electrical field comparable in strength to a lightning strike. Their instrumentation detected that the amorphous-on state - initiating the flip from zero to one - occurred less than a picosecond after they applied the jolt. \nTo comprehend the brevity of a picosecond, it's roughly the time it would take for a beam of light, traveling at 186,000 miles per second, to pass through two pieces of paper. \nShowing that phase-change materials can be transformed from zero to one by a picosecond excitation suggests that this emerging technology could store data many times faster than silicon RAM for tasks that require memory and processors to work together to perform computations. \nSpace is always a consideration in design, and previous experiments have shown that phase-change technology has the potential to pack more data in less space, giving it a favorable storage density. \nTaking energy into account, researchers say the electrical field that triggered the phase change was of such a brief duration that it points toward a storage process that could become more efficient than today's silicon-based technologies . There is something curious here. After amassing the tremendous expense required in order to measure PCM behavior on a femtosecond scale, they did not publish anything relating to actual phase-change mechanics - only the initial Ovonic switching behavior (this is only the stuff that happens just prior to writing data into the memory cell). They are most definitely hiding information to this end because it would have proven trivial to see what happens in the instant after the initial Ovonic switching. How fast could the cell be set and reset in a non-volatile manner? I am certain that they have this answer but, for some reason, opted not to publish it. I believe that Intel and Micron (NASDAQ: MU ) will refrain from shipping XP in DIMM form because it will expose just how fast it really is - faster than DRAM and SRAM. This won't happen until Intel acquires Micron which, again, hinges on ECD . In the meantime, Micron put a bandaid on it . Conclusion Once again, I am back to my previous conclusion that 3D XPoint won't ship until the ECD intellectual property loose-end is wrapped up. This is because 3D XPoint leverages something that will expose Intel's intentions to obsolesce both transistors as well as silicon using something that is much, much better and cheaper. Fortunately, a court filing reveals that ECD is now aware of the potential situation: \nThe Trustee is continuing activities focused on realizing value from certain assets which may afford a greater recovery for the Debtors' estate. The Trustee has documented the Trust's 95% ownership in Ovonic Cognitive Computer, Inc. (\"OCC\") and OCC's rights to over 200 patents relating to chalcogenide materials (phase-change materials), and their wide-ranging use in computers and computer-like devices pursuant to a perpetual, non-exclusive license under an agreement with Ovonyx, Inc. Efforts to engage potential buyers for the Trustee's ownership of OCC, and effectively OCC's rights to these technologies, is expected to continue into 2017. I believe that things will now move quickly - there's no hoping by Intel and Micron that it will just go away anymore. Ten years ago when ECD explained its new Ovonic Cognitive Computing subsidiary and neuromorphic computing to its shareholders (which included myself), the concepts seemed like vaporware - something that would never be attained. But now, the stuff is everywhere. Most notably, Intel announced that it is going to beat Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) in this market by a hundred fold. Mysteriously, it did not explain how it is going to do this. Even Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) recently showed off that they're using neuromorphic branch prediction in its latest processors. Because this cognitive stuff is now unavoidable in the context of modern computing, ECD's license - which is only effective in the context of a cognitive/neuromorphic computer - is essentially a blanket 3D XPoint license. Obviously, if this is true, then Intel and/or Micron really need to secure this loose end so I can imagine that it has already sent in its anonymous goons. When General Motors (NYSE: GM ) wanted to buy the Detroit skyline from Ford (NYSE: F ) back in 1996, they knew that the price would go way up if they walked in directly. So they sent in a Texas real estate group to make the initial purchase and then simply bought it from them afterwards. But they are going to be bidding against plenty of others. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) is already nearing perfection on PCM-based cognitive computing so I can expect that they'll be first in line at ECD. Western Digital's (NYSE: WD ) HGST subsidiary has also been demonstrating some interesting PCM technology. AMD (NYSE: AMD ) also threw its hat into the ring as well. While Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are most definitely going to be lined up for the license's \"computer-like devices\" language, I have a feeling that there's a more obvious buyer: Apple. In the tear down of the SSD in the new MacBook Pro, iFixIt discovered the fruits of Apple's late 2011 half a billion dollar acquisition of Anobit , a storage controller designer. I believe that this acquisition revealed Apple's real intentions: it is going all-in on its end-to-end design and manufacture strategy. I don't know how this will manifest but I do believe that this is why Apple has been hoarding cash. Will it buy Micron? Was Softbank ( OTCPK:SFTBY ) a straw buyer of ARM? I think that we're going to see this play out imminently. But I don't believe that we'll see 3D XPoint until it does. Disclosure: I am/we are long MU, INTC.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Research firm Strategy Analytics this afternoon reports that Apple ( AAPL ) during Q3 garnered an “all-time high” share of profits in the mobile market, at 91%, or $8.52 billion, while Chinese brands Huawei , Vivo , and Oppo took the rest.\nXiaomi was in fifth place. All of the top four profited from the decline of Samsung Electronics ( 005930KS ), with its “ Note 7 ” debacle. Samsung had been in second place behind Apple a year earlier, but dropped to ninth place this year with just $10 million in profit dollars.\nThe results are qualitatively similar to a report yesterday by Canaccord Genuity ’s Mike Walkley , in which Walkley estimated Apple profit in smartphones jumped to 106% in the quarter.\nAnalyst Linda Sui is Quote: d as saying that “Apple’s ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits.”\nThe firm’s executive director, Neil Mawston , commented on the strong showing by Chinese brands:\nWe estimate Huawei generated US$0.2 billion of smartphone operating profit worldwide in Q3 2016. Huawei captured 2 percent share of all smartphone profits, taking second spot overall, and becoming the world’s most profitable Android vendor for the first time ever. An efficient supply chain, sleek products and effective marketing have been among the main drivers of Huawei’s robust profitability. Vivo and OPPO followed in third and fourth place and each took 2 percent global profit share. Vivo and OPPO delivered relatively healthy profitability due to disciplined pricing and soaring shipments across Asia.”",

      "text": "Enlarge (credit: Spencer Platt / Getty Images News)\nPresident-elect Donald Trump told The New York Times in a Tuesday interview that he would incentivize Apple to “build a big plant” in the United States.\nDuring that interview, Trump touched on numerous subjects, changing his tune on several campaign positions. He backed off threats he made during his campaign to prosecute his political rival, Hillary Clinton, over her use of a personal e-mail server while she was Secretary of State.\nHowever, Trump indicated to columnist Thomas Friedman that he is going to double-down on bringing factory jobs back to America, especially in the Rust Belt from Michigan to Pennsylvania.\nRead 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "Apple has disbanded its division that develops wireless routers, another move to try to sharpen the company's focus on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue, according to people familiar with the matter.\nApple began shutting down the wireless router team over the past year, dispersing engineers to other product development groups, including the one handling the Apple TV, said the people, who asked not to be named because the decision hasn't been publicly announced.\nMost Popular Company to lay off 65 at LI location LI execs duke it out, raise $80G for charity LI firm helps businesses sell on Amazon Company proposes infusion of green energy Beware: Google.com may not be Google.com Apple hasn't refreshed its routers since 2013 following years of frequent updates to match new standards from the wireless industry. The decision to disband the team indicates the company isn't currently pushing forward with new versions of its routers. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's plans.\nRouters are access points that connect laptops, iPhones and other devices to the web without a cable. Applecurrently sells three wireless routers, the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time capsule. The Time capsule doubles as a backup storage hard drive for Mac computers.\nThe products, which cost $99, $199, and $299, respectively, make up a small slice of Apple's revenue and are part of Apple's \"other products\" category on its financial statements. The category, which includes the AppleWatch and Apple TV, generated $11.1 billion in fiscal 2016, or about 5 percent of total sales.\nExiting the router business could make Apple's product ecosystem less sticky. Some features of the AirPort routers, including wireless music playback, require an Apple device like an iPhone or Mac computer. If the company no longer sells wireless routers, some may have a reason to use other phones and PCs.\nThe core of the technology in routers comes from chipmakers such as Broadcom Ltd. that advance Wi-Fi technology through developing the fundamental components. While router makers can differentiate the design of their products, the number of antennas and the software that controls them, they reliant on advances first made by chipmakers to be able to offer new, higher-performing models.\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nApple's AirPorts have historically lagged behind those of companies such as D-Link Corp., Netgear Inc. and Belkin International Inc., which have rushed to adopt new standards. Apple, which has charged more for its routers, has focused more on integrating control of its devices into its computer operating system and industrial design. The company's decision to leave the business may be a boon for other wireless router makers.\nEarlier this year, Apple stopped making its own external monitors and in October introduced a new strategy by selling new high-resolution screens for professional users with LG Electronics Inc.\nGet the Biz Briefing newsletter!

      "text": "MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar review Apple's latest MacBook Pro is the first one we can't recommend. Here's why The MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is beautiful, but flawed. The MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is beautiful, but flawed. The MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is beautiful, but flawed. Highs Screen is among the best we’ve tested Loud, enjoyable speakers Adapters needed to connect most devices Keyboard is well below average Touch Bar lacks an obvious purpose Battery life takes a step back DT Editors' Rating Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar \nHave you grown bored of seeing your local Starbucks covered in silver mid-sized laptop, all sporting a glowing Apple logo? We don’t blame you. Apple’s MacBook Pro has remained committed to its design over the last four years, counting on engineering excellence to persevere through multiple product cycles. That decision drove Mac fans wild, as many itched for a newer, faster Pro – yet the “new” model looked the same as what they already owned. \nNow, the wait is finally over, and it’s a good thing Mac fans have been left starving for an update – because the new MacBook Pro’s price is hard to swallow. \nThe base 13-inch model without the Touch Bar is $1,500, a $200 upcharge over the old entry-level Pro. If you want the Touch Bar model we reviewed, you’ll have to shell out $1,800, though you at least get a processor upgrade as part of the deal. \n$1,800 is a lot for a MacBook Pro 13 with a Core i5 processor, even by Apple’s standards. The sharp increase in price means you can only obtain a Core i5 MacBook Pro at price points that used to get you a Core i7, and perhaps a RAM upgrade, as well. Can the new model live up to the expectations set by its price? Still the most luxurious laptop \nOne look at the new MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar is all you need to know it’s a Mac. That’s even more impressive now that Apple has decided to take attention away from its branding, ditching the glowing white apple in favor of a slick, subtle gloss logo like what’s on the MacBook, the iPhone, and the iPad. \nAs before, the MacBook Pro 13 features an all-unibody design lacking any visible seams aside from those on the bottom. But the new version is slimmer and trimmer, shaving weight down to 3.02 pounds from 3.48 pounds, while thickness drops from .71 inches to .59 inches. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends \nAnd that’s not all. Apple, like Dell, has aggressively shaved space from the display bezels to reduce the overall footprint. The new MacBook Pro 13 remains slightly larger than the Dell XPS 13 overall, and a couple tenths of a pound heavier. Users with the older Pro model will appreciate the improvement. \nOh, and the new model comes in Space Grey, which hopefully is the beginning of a wider color selection. The 12-inch MacBook comes in Silver, Space Gray, Rose Gold, and Gold. Color choices may seem petty, but they add a touch of personality. \nThere’s no arguing with the new MacBook Pro’s elegance. The beauty of Apple design has always been subtle, which is why the company is sometimes accused of being safe, or boring. The new Pro doesn’t even try to side-step those criticisms. It’s not the smallest 13-inch laptop, or the lightest, and its materials feel much as before. There’s something to be said for design that works, though, even if it’s not innovative, and the new MacBook Pro remains the most luxurious laptop around. Any port you want, as long as it’s USB Type-C \nWhile the MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar has a headphone jack, it makes another connectivity choice that’s just as controversial and, functionally, more important. Apple has decided that USB Type-C / Thunderbolt 3 is the future, and has ditched every other port. \nYes, USB Type-C is all you get. The MacBook Pro 13 with Touch Bar has four of these ports, two on each side. Even the card reader is missing. Crazy as it sounds, the decision has it benefits. The simplicity of the port selection is hard to argue with, and every port is a charging port, so you can plug the wall adapter into whichever is more convenient. The ports are quick, too, so you can hook up multiple displays or use fast external SSDs without worry about connectivity bandwidth. \nYou’re going to need adapters, and you might need lots of them. \nNow, for the bad news – you’re going to need adapters, and you might need lots of them. Do you use an external display? That’s an adapter. External hard drive? Adapter. Wired input of any sort? Adapter. Ethernet? Adapter. SDcard? Adapter. At best, you’ll need to purchase one or two dongles. At worst, you’re going to need a dock solution, which can add another $100 to $200 to the price. \nThe greatest irony? Even Apple’s iPhone can’t plug into any MacBook Pro 13 without purchasing an adapter. \nAt least it can communicate wirelessly. Speaking of which, the new Pro 13 has the usual 802.11ac Wi-Fi adapter paired with Bluetooth 4.2. It’s good to see the latest version of Bluetooth here, as it’ll help connect with a wireless keyboard and mouse. The keyboard of the future isn’t very good \nThe 12-inch MacBook, released last year, debuted an all-new “butterfly” switch that’s much thinner than any used in a laptop keyboard prior. Though Apple touted it as having great feel, we complained that “typing for more than an hour [left our] fingers with a dull ache,” due to the keyboard’s stiff feel and limited travel. \nNow that same keyboard can be found on the MacBook Pro. Well, not exactly the same . The Pro’s keyboard has a “second-generation butterfly mechanism,” with slightly more travel than the first. And it is an improvement. If you’re a writer, the MacBook Pro 13 will serve you better than the MacBook Pro 12. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends \nThat’s not to say it’ll serve you well . While travel has improved, the keyboard continues to suffer a stiff, abrupt bottoming action that can make long typing sessions tiresome. The degree to which this will bother you is a matter of preference. A few Digital Trends writers thought it was perfectly acceptable, and most thought they could learn to live with it. No one said they preferred it over the previous MacBook Pro 13. \nAnd it’s not clear why this sacrifice was made. While the new MacBook Pro 13 is thin, it’s as thick or thicker than many competitors with better keyboards, such as the Acer Swift 7 , HP Spectre , HP Spectre x360 , and Dell XPS 13. Whatever the reason, it’s clear Apple had to make a compromise between size, performance, and keyboard quality, with the latter getting the bad end of the bargain. \nThe keyboard suffers a stiff, abrupt bottoming action that can make long typing sessions tiresome. \nBelow the keyboard is a revised, plus-sized touchpad. Unlike the keyboard, this is an unmitigated plus. The spacious surface improves the ease of using multi-touch gestures, which work consistently well. While the new, larger surface means constant contact between it and your palms, we didn’t notice a single instance of unintended input throughout our testing. \nAnd don’t forget Force Touch. The haptic feedback system, which uses vibration to simulate a click, is so good at emulating real movement that most users never notice a difference. It also offers force sensitivity, which can enable special interface functions – just like the iPhone. The feature isn’t widely embraced, even by Apple’s own software, but it’s great when offered. The Touch Bar searches for purpose \nIn May of 2014, Apple Insider published an article talking about upcoming Macs with “in-key displays,” a rumor that began to snowball in early 2016. After several misses (the rumormills thought it might appear in early 2016, then in summer), it’s finally here in all its OLED glory. \nIf nothing else, the Touch Bar is great to look at it. It boasts Retina-equivalent pixel density, which means icons are rendered with crisp, vibrant graphics. And because it’s OLED, blacks look inky black – so dark it’s often hard to find the Touch Bar’s boundaries. \nAs a conversation starter, then, it holds up. As a functional tool? Less so. Apple tries to integrate the Touch Bar in a way that makes it relevant even in everyday web browser, note-taking, and photo-viewing. Its display changes constantly as new apps are opened, and old ones closed. It performs well, keeping up no matter how quickly apps are switched, or how many are open. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends \nYet there’s rarely much use for it. At best, it provides a quick way to scroll through lists, such as your Photo Stream. It can also be useful if you’d like to scroll through a video – and it’s great at picking up on such content, activating a scroll bar even when browsing YouTube. \nIn other cases, though, it’s clearly a solution searching for a problem. Take typing, for instant. As you input text in Safari, Word, and other apps, the Touch Bar constantly flashes word suggestions. It’s a feature that works well on the iPhone, where typing is often slow and cumbersome. \nMore : Macbook Pro 13-inch with Retina review \nOn a laptop, though, it’s pointless. Type in “office,” for instance, and the Touch Bar will suggest alternatives. Did you mean officers? Or, perhaps, off-season? This happens whether a word is spelled properly or not. Even if you do slip in a typo, it’s hard to imagine why a user would look to the Touch Bar for help when MacOS already presents a correction on-screen and, in most cases, will correct the spelling automatically. \nIf nothing else, the Touch Bar is great to look at it. \nEven where it might be useful, the Touch Bar is limited by its size. It automatically displays open Safari tabs, complete with miniature content previews, a feature that could prove helpful. Yet the previews are so small that it’s often hard to tell the tabs apart, even with just three or four open. If you open six, or eight, or ten tabs, then the previews become smaller still, until they’re so tiny that it’s hard to even tap the right one. Similar problems trouble its photo preview and video preview capabilities. In theory, you can scroll through photo collections. In practice, it’s harder to do than with the touchpad. \nIn short, the Touch Bar isn’t great. But giving the function row over to an OLED display does come with an important perk called Touch ID. Yes, you can now log in with your fingerprint, and it works as seamlessly as it does on iPhone. Fast, secure login authentication methods are a great way to improve security for the average user. And Touch ID integrates with Apple Pay, so you can use it to securely make online purchases – from stores that accept Apple Pay. Display \nA quick look at the specifications could make you think Apple’s new MacBook Pro 13 had an old display. It’s still Retina, which means the resolution is still 2,560 x 1,600. That was stunning in 2012, but today it seems mediocre next to QHD+ (3,200 x 1,800) and 4K screens. \nBut don’t worry, Mac faithful. You can banish any concerns about the display from your mind. It’s fantastic. \nWe measured a maximum brightness of 548 lux. That’s ridiculously brilliant, and complete overkill for use indoors, but it can help make the screen, which is still very glossy, usable in extreme situations. By comparison, the Dell XPS 13 with QHD+ display only hits 278 lux, and the HP Spectre x360 hits 355 lux. Both those systems can have a problem with glare in bright conditions, though Dell gives you the choice to combat that with a matte display option. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends \nBrightness is only important in a bright room. What’ll stun you, no matter where you use the MacBook Pro 13, is its color. The display can achieve 100 percent of the sRGB gamut, as well as 91 percent of AdobeRGB. It also delivered an average color error value of .72 (lower is better). Anything below one is generally unnoticeable to the human eye, and this reading is the lowest we’ve ever recorded from a laptop. The previous record holder, Dell’s XPS 15, boasted an average error value of .78. \nEven the contrast ratio of 1200:1 is excellent. The Pro can deliver dark blacks next to brilliant colors without trouble. \nThe only flaw we found is gamma, which came in at a reading of 2.3. The ideal curve is 2.2, and the MacBook Pro 13’s result indicates it portrays content a bit darker than it should. But this is a very minor fluctuation, and plenty of competitors miss it, too. \nThe Retina display may not be this Pro’s headline feature, but it remains its most attractive trait. \nWhen the numbers are tallied, the new Retina display comes away a winner. It defeats the Dell XPS 13, Acer Swift 7, Asus Zenbook 3, HP Spectre x360, and Lenovo Yoga 910 , beating all of them in color gamut, color accuracy, and contrast ratio. \nThat’s not to say it lacks competition, though. Microsoft’s Surface Book can go toe-to-toe with it. Though our tests found the Surface Book had a narrower contrast ratio of 1010:1, its gamma curve reading was the proper 2.2. \nThere’s also a small handful of Windows systems, like the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga , available with OLED displays. These clobber the MacBook Pro 13’s strong contrast ratio, and deliver an even wider color gamut, all with accurate gamma. But they don’t match the Mac’s out-of-the-box color accuracy. \nNumbers aside, the display on the MacBook Pro 13 is excellent, and looks it in everyday use. Games and movies are crisp and vibrant, and high-quality photos render with such detail that you might think your display was switched with a canvas print. The Retina display may not be this Pro’s headline feature, but it remains its most attractive trait. Pump up the bass \nApple has always shown an affinity for audio quality rarely found elsewhere, and the MacBook Pro is no exception. In fact, its speakers are the best we can recall hearing in a 13-inch system. That’s saying a lot, because a few recent laptops in this category, like the Asus’ Zenbook 3 , have surprised us with their quality. Apple MacBook Pro 13-inch with Touch Bar Compared To",

      "text": "Reddit \nUS President-elect Donald Trump promised Apple incentives to bring manufacturing to America, claiming to have spoken to CEO Tim Cook about the possibility. Restoring America’s position as a manufacturing behemoth was one of Trump’s biggest campaign promises in the run up to the US election, with the outspoken then-candidate promising a resurgence in steel, coal, and other industries. However, it wasn’t just traditional manufacturing Trump had in mind. \nThe former reality TV star had also singled out technology and automotive companies for investing in production in foreign companies, rather than opening plants and facilities in the US. Separately, Apple in particular had been criticized earlier this year, after refusing to give the FBI “backdoor” access to a locked iPhone belonging to a suspected terrorist. At the time, Trump accused Cook of trying to prove his liberal credentials with the position. \nThis week, though, the President-elect has taken a more conciliatory position, at least as he recounts it. Speaking to the New York Times, he claims to have been called by the Apple chief executive – as well as Microsoft founder Bill Gates – and had a conversation about the possibility of US manufacturing. As Trump recounts it, production in America was held up as “a real achievement” for his time in the White House. \nThe call, which Apple is yet to comment publicly on, apparently saw Trump discuss “incentives” and “a very large tax cut for corporations” which, presumably, would be designed to offset the increased costs of domestic production. Exact details of those incentives are yet to be revealed, or indeed the nature of the intended tax policies. Trump also blamed excessive regulation for limiting how much American companies could do. \n“I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’” President-elect Donald Trump \nIt’s not, according to the rumor machine at least, the first time Apple has given thought to the possibility, at least in recent months. A report earlier in November suggested that the Cupertino firm had discussed the idea of doing more manufacturing on its home turf with two of its biggest partners abroad. Foxconn and Pegatron, which are both responsible for the assembly of iPhones, were involved in the talks, sources say. \nNot all of Apple’s production takes place outside of the US; the current Mac Pro is assembled in Austin, Texas, for instance. All the same, the long-overlooked desktop computer sells in a fraction of the numbers that Apple sees for iPhone and iPad sales. It’s also made on a heavily automated line that minimizes human involvement, though elsewhere in the interview President-elect Trump argued that the US would simply make the robots in that case. \nNOW READ: iPhone 7 Review \nWhether there’s any incentive or tax benefit the US government could offer to make manufacturing complex electrical products in the country cost-effective any more remains to be seen. One prediction from Foxconn was that iPhone pricing could effectively double for a US-made handset, versus the current device.",

      "text": "View Photo \nCould Donald Trump really get Apple to 'build a big plant' in the US? Convincing Apple to make its products in the US will be a ‘real achievement’ says Trump, but skepticism remains about whether it could ever happen Donald Trump says he promised Apple CEO Tim Cook ‘incentives’ such as tax breaks to get the company to bring its manufacturing home. Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images \nDonald Trump told Apple CEO Tim Cook that he is going to “get” the company to start manufacturing its products in the United States, the president-elect told the New York Times on Tuesday. \nTrump revealed that he had received a post-election phone call from Cook during which he said, “Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States.” \nAccording to Trump’s account, Cook responded, “I understand that,” and Trump went on to promise incentives through tax breaks and reduced regulations. \nRelated: Strong-arm Apple and tax China bigly: a guide to Trump's possible tech policies \n“I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it,” Trump said he said. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation of Trump’s characterization of the call, nor did it respond to a request for comment on the content of Trump’s remarks. \nThough Apple markets its high-end products as being “designed by Apple in California”, the electronics are assembled at factories in China from components produced primarily in China, Japan and Taiwan, according to the MIT Technology Review . The company says that its suppliers employ more than 1.6 million people . \nForcing American companies to bring jobs back to the US was one of the key themes of Trump’s presidential campaign, despite his own business’s decision to manufacture apparel in China or Bangladesh . \n“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,” the then-candidate told supporters in Virginia on 18 January. \nTrump later called for a boycott of the company’s products unless it acceded to the FBI’s demand that it unlock one of the San Bernardino shooters’ iPhones, a request Apple had strenuously resisted. Apple markets its products as ‘designed in California’ but assembles them in Chinese factories from components produced in China, Japan and Taiwan. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA \nBut most experts agree that building iPhones from scratch in the US is impractical and economically unfeasible, largely because the company relies on a complex and very large supply chain and manufacturing infrastructure already established around Shenzhen, China. \n“Geography matters,” said Seungjin Whang, a Stanford Business School professor who studies supply chain management. “In Shenzhen, if you need a part (how scarce it might be), you can find at least 10 suppliers within a day.” \n“Right now the supply chain to make consumer electronics in volume does not exist in the US,” said Tim Wilson, a partner in venture capital firm Artiman. “You might tax [importing] so it costs more, but to reposition and get people to rebuild that supply chain in the US is not something that I would predict in the next few years.” \nIf Apple were to invest in establishing a new supply base in the US, Whang predicts that the delay would give its competitors – largely Korean and Chinese companies – time “to catch up and eat its lunch”. \nJason Dedrick, a professor at Syracuse University’s School of Information Studies, analyzed Apple’s supply chain for the MIT Technology Review and found that assembling iPhones in the US would add between $30 to $40 to the product’s cost, largely due to labor costs and the additional cost of shipping components to the US. \nDedrick’s estimate did not include the capital cost outlay of building factories, which could be substantial. \nRelated: Apple flips out with clamshell iPhone patent \n“It’s quite feasible for Apple to do limited volume assembly of some products in the US,” Dedrick said, proposing iMacs as a possibility. “I don’t think it’s possible to move production of hundreds of millions of iPhones to the US, at least not at a competitive cost.” \nOne possibility, Greg Linden of the Institute for Business Innovation at UC Berkeley said, would be for Apple to have “the parts kitted in China and shipped to the existing factory of one its assemblers here and voilà – you’ve got a US-assembled iPhone with one extra process step plus some extra shipping and labor.” \nThat strategy could cost as little as $10 to $20 per iPhone, he said, but is limited to the capacity of those already existing factories. \nAs to whether Apple will attempt something like that, Linden said, “I guess it depends on how badly Tim Cook wants a win.”",

Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. 7 Perfect Gift Ideas for Apple Watch Owners Our gift guide series shifts focus to Apple's wearable device by Brent Dirks November 23, 2016 \nThe Apple Watch has come a long way in just 18 months. On the software side, watchOS 3 has brought a number of improvements including a much needed boost of speed. And the Series 2 Watch hit the market in September and features a brighter screen, waterproofing in up to 50 meters of water, and built-in GPS. \nWe’re continuing our gift guide with seven great accessories for any fan of the wearable device. Nomad Vulcanized LSR Silicone Strap Nomad Vulcanized LSR Silicone Strap \nOne of our favorite Apple Watch accessory makers has recently introduced an interesting new strap to its lineup. Nomad’s Vulcanized LSR Silicone Strap is made with high-quality and hypoallergenic silicone and completely waterproof. I’ve been using the band with my Series 2 Apple Watch for a few weeks, and have definitely enjoyed it. It’s much more comfortable than Apple’s own Sport Band while providing a more classical look. \nIt’s only available for the 42mm Apple Watch. A version with either black or silver lugs/buckle costs can be ordered from Nomad’s site now . While it usually retails for $39.95, you can grab it for $27.95 until Cyber Monday. That’s a 30 percent savings and makes the strap an even more spectacular choice. Kanex GoPower Watch \nKanex’s GoPower Watch is a small and portable watch charger . \nThe portable battery sports a 4,000mAH cell and can charge an 38mm or 42mm Apple Watch up to six times. Weighing in at almost 5 ounces, it’s about the size of a deck of cards but a nice square shape. \nUsing the battery is easy. After attaching a micro-USB cable, four LEDs on the front will let you know when its completely charged. When on the go, just hit the small button and you can see how much juice is still left in the battery. Each LED equals a 25 percent charge. \nJust like with the official cable, place the back of your watch near the front of the magnetic connector, and the charging cycle begins. The disc is slightly raised off the main body of the battery, making it very easy to find – even in darker rooms. \nAs a nice touch, an extra USB port can also power up another device like an iPhone. Jaybird X3 Wireless In-Ear Headphones \nThe latest version of JayBird’s popular series of wireless in-ear headphones are perfect for rocking out to music stored on your Apple Watch. The X3 features an even smaller design compared to the previous version and can even be comfortably worn under a helmet. The built-in battery can provide up to eight hours of music playback on a single charge. Using the companion MySound app, music fans can customize sounds settings to their exact preferences. That profile is then saved to the headphones and will be used to any device you connect to. \nAlong with being sweatproof, Jaybird offers a number of ways to customize the fit including three different sizes and foam a silicone earbud tips and the ability to wear them under- or over-the-ear. Belkin PowerHouse Charge Dock \nDesigned to charge both your Apple Watch and iPhone at the same time, Belkin’s PowerHouse boasts built-in chargers so there’s no need to provide your own cables. On the iPhone side, a special dial raises and lowers the Lightning connector to fit most available cases on the market. The compact charger is also designed to fit any Apple Watch model. X-Doria Mesh Band \nX-Doria has been a long-time accessory manufacturer focusing on iPhone and iPad cases. But the company has also done a great job with a line of Apple Watch accessories including a number of bands and cases. Its latest is the Mesh Band , a stylish take on the Milanese Loop. \nRetailing for $49.99 , buyers can select from a silver or black version of the band. It’s only available for the 42mm watch and fits all generations of the device. \nIt looks exactly like Apple’s version and is very comfortable to wear. With the magnetic closure system, I can quickly and easily adjust it to get a perfect fit. X-Doria says the band can fit wrists from 130-180mm. \nThe black coating has also faired well and hasn’t chipped or worn off, and I’m definitely tough on my watch bands. \nWhile the lugs are sometimes a problem spot on some third-party bands, X-Doria has done a nice job with those as well. They fit right into the Apple Watch and don’t protrude at all. Twelve South TimePorter Twelve South TimePorter \nMade for travel, Twelve South’s TimePorter is reminiscent of an eyeglass case, but with a small hole in middle. You can select from a version with a black or white leather-like covering. \nGetting everything set up just takes a few minutes. After opening the case, place the Apple Watch charging disc in the center hole and wrap the rest of the cable around the built-in cord management feature. It can fit both a 1-meter and 2-meter cord. \nThe rest of the interior is spacious and can fit the watch’s charging adapter and a few additional watch bands. When you’re ready to charge the watch, the cable’s USB can be unwound and slipped through the small notch on either side of the case. \nThe TimePorter retails for $49.99 and is available in black or white. Clockwork Synergy Leather Band Clockwork Synergy Leather Band \nAn inexpensive way to add some class to your Apple Watch, Clockwork Synergy’s Leather Band is made for the 42mm watch. Our own Abdel Ibrahim recently tried the band out and said the connectors fit perfectly and that the leather is soft and very thick. \nYou can select from three different shades of brown. Each band is $22.99 and sports a stainless steel silver strap and lugs. \nOur complete gift guide series: AppAdvice’s Ultimate Wireless Headphone Gift Guide – Friday, Nov. 25 AppAdvice’s Ultimate Gift Guide for Guys – Monday, November 28 10 Perfect Gift Ideas for iPhone Owners – Friday, Dec. 2 AppAdvice’s Ultimate Gift Guide For Kids – Monday, Dec 5 AppAdvice’s Ultimate Smart Home Gift Guide – Wednesday, Dec. 7 AppAdvice’s Ultimate Gift Guide for Women – Friday, Dec. 9 10 Perfect Gift Ideas for Mac Owners – Monday, Dec. 12 25 Stocking Stuffers $25 and Under for any Apple Fan – Wednesday, Dec. 14 View Comments Copyright 2016 AppAdvice LLC.

      "text": "iPhone diehards swarmed when Apple announced its new jet black color -- they plain sold out . Samsung may have picked up the trend that \"shiny black is the new black\" and could be planning to reveal a glossy black version of the Galaxy S7 .\nKorean news site The Investor first reported that the S7 would get new shade on Monday, but photos posted by a Chinese Samsung Weibo account also show the S7 Edge in the glossy hue. Although we have yet to see official renderings of the two devices side by side, this may be our best look yet at the new finish.\nEnlarge Image Photo by Shaokingchina/Weibo The glossy black version bears a resemblance to the old onyx black color, the main difference being the shiny black back plate. If it's anything like the iPhone 7 in jet black, the glossy sheen may be a magnet for fingerprints and smudges. I also worry it could pick up scratches, like the jet black iPhone 7 , so the glossy black Galaxy may have the same issue.\nEarlier this month, Samsung released the Galaxy S7 Edge in coral blue , and according to The Investor , it has been selling 15,000 units a day on average.\nAccording to the rumor, we could see a glossy black S7 as early as December. Samsung hasn't announced the shade and told CNET it won't comment on rumors.\n ",

      "text": "The iPhone SE release date is finally upon us, with Apple's latest phone now on sale. There's no need to drop a serious amount of cash if you're craving this new 4-inch phone though, the iPhone SE is Apple's most affordable phone ever, and there's plenty of options on where to pick one up. With every network and smartphone vendor offering the iPhone 6S alternative, a mass of great iPhone SE deals are already doing the rounds to make sure you get the most for your money. This is where to buy Apple's new compact smartphone. APPLE For once, buying a new iPhone on a SIM-free basis won't need you to re-mortgage your house or sell a kidney. The iPhone SE is the most affordable new Apple handset to date, and so, if you don't fancy being tied to 24 months of costly contracts, you can snap it up on the respective cheap directly through Apple. It comes in four colours and two storage options. While the 16GB SE will set wannabe owners back just £359, the 64GB model is a little harder on your wallet, having been handed a £439 asking price. EE EE is hitting all the price points with its mass of iPhone SE tariffs. If you want a free phone, the cheapest you can get it is £29.99 per month, with 500 inclusive minutes, unlimited texts, and a lowly 1GB monthly data allowance. At the top end, a 20GB data pack will set you back £44.99. On top of your bundled minutes and internet allowance, those opting for EE's deals will gain access to the fastest network in the UK, as well as complimentary use to the firm's WiFi Calling and VoLTE 4G Calling services. VODAFONE Vodafone is another of the UK's leading networks to confirm plans to stock the new iPhone SE, and you're going to have to pay for the handset - well, a nominal £9 handset fee anyway. On top of this, the 16GB and 64GB models, bundled with unlimited minutes, unlimited texts and a 2GB data allowance, will cost you £34 and £40 respectively. Bigging up its benefits, the high street seller has revealed that consumers opting for its services will also make the most of Vodafone's Data Test Drive for the first two months of their contract. This lets users see how much data they typically use without restriction, before being locked down to a suitable inclusive cap. WiFi calling skills are also being bundled in. THREE Three's iPhone SE deals sit between those offered by EE and Vodafone. Things kick off at £31 per month with a single GB of data, rising to £40 per month with an 8GB monthly internet allowance. That's not where the perks end though. Three has confirmed that all SE adopters will benefit from 4G coverage at no extra cost, a six-month free Deezer subscription and access to the company's brilliant Feel at Home service that lets you use your phone without extra charge in 18 countries, including the US, Australia and Spain - nice. O2 Completing the set of the UK's big four networks, O2 has also confirmed that it will stock the iPhone SE. The bubbly service is being kind to your wallet too, letting you snap up a free iPhone SE for just £29 per month. This is limited to just a 500MB data allowance though. There are then tariffs all the way through the smartphone spectrum, up to the £50 per month deal that's bundled with a massive 30GB of data every 30 days - that's a lot of The Walking Dead streaming. CARPHONE WAREHOUSE It's not just the networks selling the iPhone SE, specialist retailers are getting in on the act too. Carphone is leading the charge here, tying the 16GB SE to a £26 per month, 500MB data incorporating Vodafone contract, and the 64GB model to a £34 per month O2 tariff. It's not limiting the SE to the major networks either. As well as tying the new iPhone to the big brand plans, it has confirmed the handset will also be offered up on its own iD network - expect impressive pricing and data allowances then. MOBILES.CO.UK Bringing a wide array of iPhone SE tariffs tied to all manner of networks, online seller Mobiles.co.uk is serving everyone from the cash-conscious to the data demanding. As well as offering the handset for its traditional SIM-free prices, at the low end of the contract range, Mobiles is tying the SE to O2 with a 500MB data allowance for just £27 per month. Fancy a bit more data without the additional monthly fees? Dropping a £59.99 up-front handset cost, will bundle the SE with 3GB of data on Vodafone for £26 per month.",

While the video plays normally in the iPhone’s video player, the device begins to lock up and freeze several seconds later.\nThe bug reportedly affects devices running iOS 10.1 and beta copies of iOS 10.2.\nIf your device crashes because of this bug, the only way to recover is to perform a hard reset by pressing the power and home buttons at the same time.\nLast year, some iPhone users reported their devices crashing after receiving a certain string of characters via text messages . The bug was quickly fixed by Apple through a software update.\nEarlier this year, an image circulated online tricking iPhone users to change their device’s time and date to January 1, 1970. The hoax led to devices becoming unstable.\n",

      "text": "Reddit \nLG’s UltraFine 5K Display is not yet available for purchase via Apple’s online store, but it’s already beginning to makes the rounds in the press. Popular YouTuber Marques Brownlee just unboxed the MacBook Pro-centric 5K display in a hands-on video. \nThe 27-inch 5K display is notable, because it provides the same on-screen real estate that Thunderbolt Display users have enjoyed for years, but with noticeably increased “Retina” sharpness. The display also features a single Thunderbolt 3 port for connecting directly to the MacBook. Along with providing the display feed, the included Thunderbolt 3 cable is able to charge a 15-inch MacBook Pro at full speed. \nHave a look at MKBHD’s unboxing and hands-on below: \nLG’s UltraFine 4K Display is available for sale now , although online orders are still several weeks out. The 5K version goes on sale sometime next month . Both displays have received considerable limited-time price cuts temporarily in the wake of consumer response from Apple’s transition to USB-C. As such, it would be wise to get in early if you plan on purchasing. \nWe’ll be back soon with a hands-on review of the LG UltraFine 5K Display. Until then, tell us what you think about this monitor. Do you plan on buying one? Guides",
