California, Florida and New York all feature the upgraded take on fast food faire, each with their own touchscreen kiosks for customizing your McGreasy, table service and payments made with Android or Apple Pay . \nIt’s still a McDonald’s, but classier. \nIf you’re not lucky enough to experience one of the upgraded locations, McDonald’s has you covered. A simulation created for Google Cardboard — and Cardboard-like — device owners allows you to experience all that the upgraded locations have to offer. Simply pull the headset over your eyes and enjoy the magical experience of standing in line, customizing your order, and mingling with other guests and McDonald’s employees. \nAnd you thought actually going to a McDonald’s was sad. I’ll stick with eating virtual tacos with Danny Trejo thanks. ",

You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground.\nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe.\n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around.\nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times.\nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city.\n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said.\nRaw Video: \nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video ",

      "title": "You deserve a seat today: McDonald’s expanding table service",
      "text": "NEW YORK — McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. The world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction.\nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodelling and more training for employees.\nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the United States have not increased, the company said.\nChief executive officer Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option.\nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the United States, the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including the United Kingdom.\nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru.\nIn stores that are remodelled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said, it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nMcDonald’s announced a bold plan to roll out its “experience of the future” concept, including kiosk ordering and table service, to restaurants in Chicago and other big U.S. cities in an effort to better compete with “better burger” rivals. \nThe burger chain has nearly 500 redesigned restaurants around the country so far. \nThe world’s largest burger chain will first focus the rollout in its hometown of Chicago and a handful of other big U.S. cities, including Boston and Washington, D.C. But the company says it will eventually unveil the concept, which has already shown significant success in other countries like the U.K. and Australia, in all of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It didn’t offer a timeline or overall cost for the rollout. \n“Food ordering is one of the most enjoyable moments at restaurants, but at McDonald’s that can be one of the most stressful moments,” CEO Steve Easterbrook said. The aim is to eliminate that frustration, while also bringing employees out from behind the counter to interact with customers. With the ability to customize, upgrade and add-on items themselves, customers also tend to spend more per visit, Easterbrook said. \nThe plan to eventually redesign and upgrade all U.S. restaurants signals a significant change in the look and feel of eating at McDonald’s, and it also brings a great deal of risk. The ambitious remodeling effort was announced by Easterbrook and other company executives Thursday morning at a redesigned restaurant in New York City. \nThe redesigns will include the option of ordering at a bank of kiosks, though counter service also will be available for those who are paying with cash or prefer not to use the touch-screen machines. After using a kiosk, a customer takes a Bluetooth-enabled number placard to a table where an employee brings the food. Customers can pay at the kiosks using a credit or debit card, or Apple or Android pay. \n“Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,” Easterbrook said. \nThe changes will be funded in large part by the franchisees that operate McDonald’s restaurants, but the company said it will contribute in some ways as well. It’s not clear exactly how much the remodels will cost, and the price will vary depending on what technology the restaurant currently offers. Ordering kiosks alone can cost $60,000. \nEasterbrook said the new system would mean that workers might have slightly different jobs. \n“We’ve not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them,” he said. \nMcDonald's had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin' Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. \nIncoming McDonald’s U.S. President Chris Kempczinski said that while the plan is significant, he also promised further improvements in food quality and promotions like all-day breakfast, which have been the driver of more than a year of improving sales at the chain. \n“It’s a great start, a significant step forward, but it’s also a sign of things to come,” he said. \nThe New York Times and The Washington Post contributed.

      "text": "SANDUSKY, Ohio– A Facebook user live streamed a very disturbing scene as he pulled up to a McDonald’s in Ohio on Thursday.\nIt’s an incident that police across Northeast Ohio say has become routine.\nPolice were called to the restaurant on River Avenue just before 5 p.m. for two men overdosing in a car.\nWARNING: Some viewers may find this video difficult to watch. \nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video Eddie Wimbley posted the video of the two people passed out. You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground.\nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe.\n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around.\nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times.\nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city.\n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said.\nRaw Video: \nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video ",

Table service is already offered at 2,600 locations worldwide, including Canada, France and China. \nThe company is hoping the changes in the U.S. will improve customers’ experience. Golden Arches executives have acknowledged they have failed to keep up with changing tastes and have lost customers as a result. ",

      "text": "Photo: Mike Mozart via Flickr \nMcDonald’s is going fancy, well, perhaps as fancy the world’s most iconic fast food restaurant can go. The company is testing out new ingredients like maple bacon, guacamole, grilled onions and dijon mustard at some locations. And once guests order them on burgers or sandwiches, their orders will be brought to their table. “The initial stages of [eating at McDonald’s] can be quite stressful,” CEO Steve Easterbrook explains to the Associated Press . \nThe mega chain has been testing out table service and kiosk ordering at 500 or so locations and now plans to roll out that idea to outlets in Boston , Chicago, Seattle, Washington and San Francisco next year. Here’s how it works: Guests order from the counter per usual or from a kiosk and then have a seat. When the food is ready, it is brought to their table. The idea is to elevate the experience at McDonald’s. RELATED McDonald's Is Now Serving a Nutella Burger » \nSo far, customer satisfaction at the test stores has risen, but McDonald’s is struggling to hold on to their share of the market, despite efforts like all-day breakfast , which started earlier this year. Another effort to catch up with the times? The company will be introducing mobile ordering and payment next year.

      "text": "Since taking over as CEO of McDonald’s in March 2015, Steve Easterbrook has set his sights on the company’s food.\nOn his watch the fast food behemoth has committed to serving only cage-free eggs by 2025 , implemented a more stringent antibiotics policy for its chickens, removed high-fructose corn syrup from its buns, and cut out artificial preservatives from its McNuggets. And of course there’s the big one—the launch of All Day Breakfast.\nBut on Thursday Easterbook signaled that he was turning his attention to how diners are served that food, continuing what he called the company’s “commitment to putting customers at the heart of everything we do.”\nMcDonald’s announced that it would roll out digital self-order kiosks and table service in all of its 14,000 U.S. stores. Customers will be able to order at touch screens and then pick up a number with a digital locator, which will allow employees to serve them at their tables. Next year customers will also be able to order and pay on the company’s mobile app, which has 16 million downloads.\nRight now kiosks and table service are available in 500 McDonald’s restaurants in Southern California, New York, and Florida. Next up are Boston, Washington D.C., Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco. Incoming U.S. president Chris Kempczinski said choosing those cities was “very purposeful” since they are “trendsetting” markets.\nWhile McDonald’s MCD has touted its five consecutive quarters of same-store-sales growth—an important industry metric—there are signs that the turnaround has not completely taken hold. Internal emails obtained by Bloomberg last month showed that the company is facing its fourth-straight year of traffic declines in the U.S. This new initiative from McDonald’s is its latest attempt to increase customer visits and change perceptions.\nTable service and kiosks are more in line with how fast casual restaurants—think Panera Bread—have catered to customers. McDonald’s must walk a fine line between trying to capture a new group of diners without alienating its core, which Easterbrook seemed to acknowledge yesterday. “This is not being a different McDonald’s, but a better McDonald’s,” he said.\nThe shift is a massive one for the company, which built a business on speed and efficiency. The new service model is another sign that Easterbrook, who took the helm amid one of the most tumultuous times in the company’s history as revenues, profits, and same-store sales were all slumping, is willing to turn the company on its head to revive the brand. Those shifts are also cultural: He has stripped out layers of management, brought in outsiders, and is moving the company’s headquarters from suburban Oak Brook, Ill., to Chicago.\nDuring a press event in New York Easterbrook said “for the best part of our 60 years we’ve asked customers to fit around our business model.” Now the company is adapting its “business to fit around customers.”\n“We are putting more choice and control in the hands of customers,” Easterbrook said, noting that the changes would impact how its patrons order, what they order, how they pay, and—most significantly—how they’re served.",

      "text": "McDonald's is No Longer Going to Be Fast Food 6 hours ago — SmartBrief Food (@SB_Food) November 18, 2016 \nMcDonald's announced on Thursday that it is rolling out touch-screen kiosk ordering, craft burgers and table service to all of its 14,000 U.S. stores next year. \nCNBC reports that the new system will allow customers to order and pay at a bank of kiosks, though counter service will be available for those who prefer to pay with cash or interact with staff. Afterward, they get a bluetooth-enabled number placard to a table where an employee brings the food. \n\"Food ordering is one of the most enjoyable moments at restaurants, but at McDonald's that can be one of the most stressful moments,\" CEO Steve Easterbrook explains. The aim of the new setup is to eliminate that frustration and make it easier for customers to customize, upgrade and add on items to their orders. \nThe fast-food chain's \"experience of the future\" has already had significant success across Europe, the U.K. and Australia. \nSo do you have to tip? I am a pretty simple guy. I like all the things a normal younger guy likes… Beer, girls, good music, and having a good time. I also really like getting to do what I love, being on the radio!

      "text": "By Tonya Garcia, MarketWatch\nThe changes are a way to redeploy McDonald's labor force and appeal to millennials\nMcDonald's Corp. is taking on the fast-casual restaurant industry with its new restaurant design that includes self-order kiosks, premium menu items and table service.\n\"McDonald's, like a lot of companies, saw the rise of the fast-casual segment over the last 10 to 20 years,\" said Mark Kalinowski, restaurant analyst at Instinet. Nomura transitioned its U.S. Equity Research team to Instinet this week. \"It's a more upscale kind of visit than traditional fast food. Fast food is smart enough to realize it can incorporate some of this into what it offers. Sometimes that's food, sometimes it's look and feel.\"\nSee also: The restaurant recession has arrived (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/analysts-who-warned-this-summer-of-a-restaurant-recession-are-looking-smart-now-2016-11-01)\n(https://w.graphiq.com/w/2yMz9RhmlOR)\nFast-casual restaurant chains include Panera Bread Co. (PNRA) and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG)\nMcDonald's (MCD) said this week that it has 500 restaurants in Southern California, New York City and Florida that incorporate this \"experience of the future,\" which includes technology, food and service upgrades. This revamped restaurant experience will launch in cities like Seattle, Boston and Washington, D.C., in 2017, according to McDonald's.\nAbout 2,600 restaurants around the world have this enhanced experience. In 2017, the fast-food giant will start rolling out mobile ordering and mobile pay in the U.S.\nSee also: McDonald's latest push to attract millennials? The Sriracha Big Mac (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mcdonalds-latest-push-to-attract-millennials-the-sriracha-big-mac-2016-11-15)\nAbout 70% of McDonald's business is in drive thru (http://www.wsj.com/articles/BT-CO-20161118-705873), which is also getting an update with double lanes.\n\"This doesn't change their experience,\" said Kalinowski. \"This is more important for stores that don't have drive thrus,\" which often includes restaurants in urban areas.\nIn its recap of Restaurant Finance Monitor's Restaurant Finance and Development Conference, which took place earlier this week, Instinet said operators talked up the digital advances they're making.\n\"Most of the excitement expressed by operators centered on front-of-the-house engagement with millennials, a generation whose members outspend boomers by roughly two times on restaurants,\" said the Wednesday note. \"More frequent engagement with these consumers will be important, especially in quick-service restaurants as convenience stores pick off market share.\"\nSee also:If you don't have a Taco Bell nearby, you probably will soon (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/if-you-dont-have-a-taco-bell-nearby-you-probably-will-soon-2016-11-04)\nEven though it adds a fast-casual spin on the traditional fast-food chain, Kalinowski believes it's in keeping with the value proposition that many diners expect when they choose to eat at McDonald's.\n\"[McDonald's] view price as part of the value equation but they're smart enough to realize it's not the only part of it,\" said Kalinowski.\nAnother part is making the customers feel good.\n\"There's pressure on the fast-food industry to try and match the strides made by the fast-casual better burger providers,\" said Steven Buckley, chief operating officer of BurgerFi International, a burger chain launched in 2011.\nSee also: McDonald's problem: Just one in five millennials has tried a Big Mac (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mcdonalds-problem-just-one-in-five-millennials-has-tried-a-big-mac-2016-10-07)\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/hFCSZKhIV8x)\nBurgerFi has used technology not only to drive sales, but for labor efficiency purposes, helping to speed up the guest experience and allow workers to spend more time with customers.\n\"You have technology, which people think is impersonal, but it allows you to focus more on guest interaction,\" said Buckley.\nRather than opening up an opportunity to cut staff, Buckley said using technology is a way to \"redeploy labor into the rest of the restaurant.\"\nMcDonald's shares finished the week up 0.5%. The company's stock is up 1.6% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index is up 6.8% for the same period. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 8.5% for 2016 to date.\n-Tonya Garcia; 1711ET\n ",

      "text": " count=\"78\" data-total-count=\"78\">Welcome to McDonald’s! May I take your order — and bring it to your table? McDonald’s on Thursday announced changes that could reshape the diner’s experience, saying that it would expand its digital self-serve ordering stations and table service to all of its 14,000 American restaurants.\nThe company said once people order at one of the stations — sleek, vertical touchscreens — they will get a digital location device and can take a seat. When their burgers and fries are ready, the technology will guide a server to the table to deliver the food with a big smile and a thank you.\n“Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,” Steve Easterbrook, chief executive of McDonald’s, said at an event Thursday in a newly renovated and outfitted McDonald’s on Chambers Street in New York.\nCustomers will still be able to order food the old-fashioned way, at the counter. But the move to self-order systems and table service is one way to address one of the biggest problems the company’s restaurants have faced in recent years: slower food delivery to customers, caused by more items on the menu. The thinking is that customers will be more willing to wait if they are sitting at a table instead of waiting at a counter.\nBut it also raises some questions for the company: What does it mean for workers, and is the chain up for a change this big?\n Mr. Easterbrook said the new system would not reduce costs. But it would mean that workers might have slightly different jobs.\n“We’ve not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them,” he said.\nMcDonald’s has tested the order system in 500 revamped restaurants, or what it calls its “just-for-you experience,” in New York, Florida and Southern California and is now introducing them in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Seattle, Boston and Chicago. Around the globe, the new program is in some 2,600 McDonald’s restaurants.\nMr. Easterbrook and other company executives said some 44,000 customers have been served at tables using the new system in the United States. Families and groups have been the biggest users, but the company expects the screens to attract customers of all kinds as they become more widespread. The self-serve stations, the company says, make it easier to customize an order.\n“This is a huge opportunity for us to personalize and elevate the experience of our customers in the United States,” said Chris Kempczinski, the new president of United States operations.\nMany of the company’s customers, though, do not enter the restaurant. About 60 to 70 percent of sales come from its drive-through lanes.\n“A lot of customers are never going to see this technology,” Dick Adams, a restaurant consultant, said. “It’s just not going to be that big a factor for most franchisees outside big cities.”\nThe company also announced that it would roll out a mobile order-and-pay system that would also change the way customers get their orders, including customers ordering from their cars.\nMuch of what is coming to the United States has already been tried in markets like Canada, Australia and Britain, where roughly one-quarter of transactions are done on in-store screens.\n How quickly the restaurants change remains to be seen. The vast majority of McDonald’s locations are owned by franchisees, and they will be responsible for paying for the changes. Equipment and installation of the eight order screens at the event on Thursday, at a location in the TriBeCa neighborhood of Manhattan, cost $56,000, said Terri Hickey, a spokeswoman for McDonald’s. The costs for a store with lower sales volume would probably be about $28,000.\nFranchisees may be loath to make such investments at a time when restaurant sales are lackluster at best — same-store sales in McDonald’s American restaurants rose a paltry 1.3 percent in the third quarter of this year.\nMany of the company’s stores in Britain have already undergone such a reboot, and in a video, Paul Pomroy, the chief executive of the business in Britain, said the investment was worth it.\n“The customer’s perception of the quality of the food has changed,” Mr. Pomroy said. “A Big Mac tastes better in a reimaged restaurant, it just does.”",

      "text": "\nSANDUSKY, Ohio– A Facebook user live streamed a very disturbing scene as he pulled up to a McDonald’s in Ohio on Thursday. \nIt’s an incident that police across Northeast Ohio say has become routine. \nPolice were called to the restaurant on River Avenue just before 5 p.m. for two men overdosing in a car. \nWARNING: Some viewers may find this video difficult to watch. \nEddie Wimbley posted the video of the two people passed out. You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground. \nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe. \n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around. \nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times. \nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city. \n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said. \nRaw Video: ",

He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around. \nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times. \nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city. \n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said. \nThe conditions of the two men are not known. \nRaw Video: ",

      "text": "Michael Keaton plays McDonald’s founder Roy Kroc in biopic The Founder Vicky Roach, News Corp Australia Network November 19, 2016 10:00pm \nStars: Three and a half stars \nDirector: John Lee Hancock \nStarring: Michael Keaton, Laura Dern, John Carroll Lynch \nRunning time: 115 mins \nVerdict: Slow-cooked performance from Keaton as lord of the fries \nFIRST Birdman , now Macca’s Big Cheese ... Michael Keaton has an affinity for intensely ambitious men. \nThe character he plays in The Founder is neither nice nor sympathetic, but Keaton’s performance is so fascinatingly flawed, it’s almost impossible to turn away. \nDirected by John Lee Hancock ( The Blind Side, Saving Mr Banks ), this clear-eyed 1950s biopic tells the story of Ray Kroc, the unsuccessful travelling salesman who turned McDonald’s into an international, multi-billion dollar corporation. media_camera Ray Kock (Michael Keaton) has his eye on the big prize in The Founder. \nWhen the film opens, Kroc is on the road, doggedly trying to flog his multi mixmaster — which froths half a dozen milkshakes at one time — to uninterested drive-in owners. \nSales have flatlined. So when a company in Southern California orders an express delivery of eight of his unsellable machines, Kroc’s curiosity is piqued. \nThe textbook definition of an opportunist, he travels across country to check out the thriving burger joint run by Mac (played by John Carroll Lynch) and Dick (Nick Offerman) McDonald. \nFast-talking his way into a behind-the-counter tour of the hugely successful establishment, Kroc is impressed by the speedy system the brothers have invented and a vision so complete, it even includes the infamous golden arches. \nFinally Kroc has found a product worthy of his skills as a salesman. \nWhen his passionate, almost evangelical entrepreneurial drive is stymied by the McDonald brothers’ natural conservatism and strict adherence to old-school values such as value-for-money and quality control, Kroc reimagines the playing field with a visionary franchising/real estate deal that sidelines them. media_camera As Ray Kroc, Keaton offers a warts-and-all representation of the American Dream. \nKroc cuts loose his long-suffering wife (Laura Dern) in a similarly swift and unsentimental manner when he outgrows her, replacing her with a younger, more go-getting model (Linda Cardellini). \nAs the titular Founder, Keaton embodies the American dream in all its strengths, shortcomings and contradictions. \nIt’s a nuanced, subtle performance further layered by the intimate association with the iconic fast food chain and all that the golden arches now represent. \nThere’s a good deal more to chew on here than any Quarter Pounder can provide. \nThe Founder opens on Thursday.",

You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground. \nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe. \n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around. \nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times. \nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city. \n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said. \nRaw Video: ",

People in those stores order at the counter or kiosks, then sit and wait for an employee to bring them their food. \nEarly next year, McDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. \nThe push comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.

      "text": "\nSANDUSKY, Ohio — A Facebook user live streamed a very disturbing scene as he pulled up to a McDonald’s in Ohio on Thursday. \nIt’s an incident that police across Northeast Ohio say has become routine. \nPolice were called to the restaurant on River Avenue just before 5 p.m. for two men overdosing in a car. \nWARNING: Some viewers may find this video difficult to watch. \nEddie Wimbley posted the video of the two people passed out. You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground. \nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe. \n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around. \nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times. \nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city. \n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said. \nRaw Video: ",

      "text": "a A Font Size \nDear Mahatma: When you leave the Promenade shopping center just west of McDonald's on Chenal Parkway, there is no sign indicating you are entering a one-way eastbound lane. The westbound lane is mostly hidden by a wide median full of foliage. A driver unfamiliar with the area could easily turn left, west, the wrong way. I know, because I did it, and so did a friend. Help! -- Martha \nDear Martha: That signage should be up fairly soon. The city's traffic engineering manager, Bill Henry, said he has already directed the staff to rustle up a work order to accommodate your request. \nIf only The Mahatma were so efficient. Mostly, he staffs the Procrastination Desk. This is a function of a long career in the newspaper business, where it's considered normal to start writing 15 minutes before deadline. \nDear Mahatma: Almost daily I see a motorist trying to go straight in what becomes a left-turn-only lane while driving south on Shackleford Road as it passes under the new Interstate 630 overpass. The confusion probably arises from the \"straight\" arrows painted in the two lanes prior to reaching the overpass that turn into the left-turn lane as you pass under the traffic signal. Should something change here? -- Confused \nDear Confused: David Nilles, spokesman for the Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department, extends his thanks for the suggestion. He notes this is the second such reader observation. \nThis reminds us of what James Bond was told by Goldfinger. Once, he said, is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. Three times is enemy action. \nRather than wait for a third time, Nilles said, the District 6 engineers are contemplating the installation of in-lane interstate shield markings. Also under consideration is additional signage with the interstate shields next to the corresponding traffic signals. \nDear Analyst of the Asphalt: What happened to the plan to widen U.S. 70 to five lanes from Interstate 30 to Hot Springs? To date it appears nary a twig has been cut. Give me the scoop. -- Weary Traveler \nDear Traveler: The Highway Department said the job will be let to bid in December. Contractor crews should be on location as the old year turns over to the new. \nO Wise One: I saw a strange device on this car. After receiving many crackpot answers from my family, I turn to you. What is this tube? -- Befuddled \nDear Befuddled: Thank you for sending that photo of a Volkswagen Jetta, dark gray, exiting the parking lot at McCain Mall in North Little Rock. It has a vertical exhaust tube attached to the back, coming out of the exhaust pipe down below. \nOur best guess is this is a diesel vehicle. And the driver is making a statement. We suspect sarcasm. \nVW has been stuck in a scandal over diesel emissions. It has admitted it sold 11 million cars worldwide with software to beat environmental testing. \nMahatma@arkansasonline.com Print Headline: Near mall, wrong-way turn tempts ADVERTISEMENT",

      "text": "You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service Associated Press | \nNEW YORK (AP) — McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.",

      "text": "  A mystery man hands out 0 bills to McDonald's employees in Fort Worth, Texas. (Screenshot/CBS Local) \nNobody from the McDonald's branch in Fort Worth, Texas reported to work expecting they will be blessed by a random act of kindness. But that was exactly what happened recently when a customer began handing out $100 bills to the fast food outlet's employees. \nThe incident was captured in a video taken by a customer who was in awe of what happened. The man who handed out the dollar bills did not even order anything from the menu. He got a hug from each of the employees, according to CBS News . \n\"You could tell it blessed their day,\" said spectator Lisa Davila. \"They didn't come in there [to work] thinking that was going to happen that day... and that was the best part about it.\" \nThe man, who chose to remain anonymous, is actually Davila's boss. Davila wanted to share his story because she wanted to spread his love and positivity around. \n\"There was a young lady at McDonald's, who's a regular there and goes and has coffee, and she happened to be crying and it just broke his heart. So, he went over and he asked her what was going on and she was going through some tough times,\" she shared. Advertisement   \nDavila's boss can actually relate because he's going through a rough time himself as well. He was recently diagnosed with cancer. \"He's at the very beginning. So you know, it's going to be a long road for him,\" said Davila. \nInstead of dwelling in sadness and worry, Davila's boss chose to focus on what's good in life. Davila even suspects that her boss would be reduced to tears when he learns just how much his gesture is appreciated by the McDonald's employees. He handed out enough cash that day for 33 employees — even those who weren't working their shifts. \n\"The employees are so incredibly grateful. One called him a living angel,\" she said. But for her boss, it's nothing but a simple act of paying \"it forward. That's the whole idea behind it.\" \nShould Davila's boss decide to return to the McDonald's branch, the employees have already prepared a warm thank you note for him.",

      "text": "JOHANNES EISELE—AFP/Getty Images A group of nuns are protesting McDonald's use of antibiotics in its meat. \"Superbug\" infections caused by these antibiotics kill 23,000 Americans a year \nA group of nuns is fighting McDonald’s to change your Happy Meal. \nThe Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boene, Texas is asking the fast food chain to stop using what it says are dangerous antibiotics in poultry served in restaurants around the world, Reuters reported . The nuns are arguing that the use of these antibiotics on farms—which prevents illness in animals—can cause “superbug” infections in humans, making their bodies resistant to certain antibiotics. \nSuch infections kill at least 23,000 Americans each year, and McDonald’s has already adopted the policy in chicken used in U.S. restaurants. The nuns also asking that the chain set a timeline for switching to pork and beef that’s made without these antibiotics. \nThe sisters—who are part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which is also targeting Sanderson Farms and Yum Brands in similar campaigns—hope to have shareholders vote on their proposal at the corporation’s 2017 annual meeting. \nMcDonald’s says it’s talking to key experts, some of whom are advisors to to the World Health Organization, to see where it can make changes in its supply chain. \n",

      "title": "The Failure of Neoliberalism",
      "text": "Updated on November 18, 2016 Neoliberalism: Brought you by Coca Cola, McDonald's, Shell, General Motors.... \nBack in 1989, Francis Fukuyama wrote a short essay 'The End of History' [i] . Fukuyama argued the fact that with the end of the Cold War with the Soviet Union and the advent of Western Liberal Democracy, the turn of the century was indicating the endpoint of Humanity's Socio-cultural evolution. Democracy, freedom of speech and liberal ideas were now the staples of the free world. The liberal ideas had finally won the cultural wars. And with the fall of Communism, the end of the century proved to many that Neoliberalism and capitalist free market was Humanity’s path to salvation. But of course, History always has a funny way of surprising us. \nThe recent victory of Donald Trump in the U.S elections 2016 signals not only the victory of ultra right wing conservatism but quite possibly the final nail in the coffin of failing neoliberalist ideas since the further disintegration of the Middle East. This was not the failure of the American people but rather, the failure of the Left. They failed to prove themselves worthy of Change to the working class of the U.S. Our impeccable and just ideas of embracing diversity while supporting Laissez Faire economics, contributing in the further destruction of our environment, clearly failed its own diverse and hypocritical politics. And now since 90 years, extreme conservationism is again being embraced by the Western world. And make no mistake, the DNC Neoliberal Democrats share a huge responsibility of Trump’s victory to the White House. \nFor many decades, the Right was always considered to be \"intolerant\", \"juvenile“ and the lack of capacity to integrate a different form of opinion. But in fact, it is now the neoliberalism that inadvertently incorporated those level of intolerances. The so-called \"Social Justice Wars\" in the age of internet were quick to label people \"sexist\", \"racist\" or “misogynist” that slowly over the course of a decade or so, started to lose all meaning. The American neoliberalists and the Obama/ Clinton machine, who sympathized and defended Muslims in the western world but systematically encouraged the ongoing drone strikes by the U.S army in seven different nations of the world. The neo liberalists who vow to protect the planet but readily take \"political donations“ from big corporations that are directly violating United States Environmental Protection laws. [ii] And by the time Trump came around, his genuine words of intolerance, denial of climate change and further destruction of international relations suddenly had almost no effect to the deafened eyes of the low income families of the United States. So for lack of a better word, Trump became the living embodiment of an \"Internet Troll\". \nAfter the defeat of the Democratic Party, the American Left now scrambles and point fingers \" Who is to blame? \". Apparently the Clinton machine blames Comey letters for their election defeat [iii] but of course, there are other reasons for us to indulge into. Misogyny against the first female president? But 53% of white female ratio voted Trump [iv] . Racism? To brand all Trump voters racist is a tactic that the neo liberals so proudly denounce and should be incompatible with their belief system. To break the American Establishment? That could possibly be the case. And unfortunately, Hillary Clinton was not providing a revolution that the majority of the American people were hoping for. For the working class of America, a vote for Clinton meant a vote for further descent into the Abyss. \nEver since the destabilization of the Middle East in the Iraq War started becoming more and more apparent, the Left had the opportunity to move the geo political pendulum towards the left economics, invest in climate change program, destabilize the core infrastructure of capitalism and exploitation of the working class but none of it seem plausible anymore. The Left remained divided amongst themselves over minor issues [v] . They could not agree on the key elements and stick with it. And quite rapidly with the dawn of the refugee crisis of Syria, the conservatism of the West has slowly devolved into ultra right wing politics that attack people on their personal beliefs, skin color, the scape goats of the failing economy of many western nations including Poland (PiS), Hungary (Jobbik) and quite possibly (since the Brexit vote) the future of United Kingdom. Yes, the devolution of the American Right is now engaging in the ultra right politics of George Wallace But the Right is mostly united nonetheless. \nNov 8th 2016 has ushered a new beginning for the American politics. The days of intellectual conservatism of William F. Buckley Jr. and even the Bush era are dead and instead, replaced by radical far right politics of violent discrimination, Nationalism and isolation from the rest of its neighboring nations. Perhaps a recreation of a more divided map before the advent of the first world war, we are now heading towards the world of imperialist nations. \nDonald Trump is the Frankenstein Monster that the Republican Party had been inadvertently creating for decades of hatred towards progressive thinking, denial of any sort racism against colored citizens in the country and conducting unauthorized foreign wars. If anything, Donald Trump could be congratulated on single handedly destroying the Republican Party. \nBut if this spells the failure of Neoliberalism, what other alternative could we look for? Surprisingly, the new Left was already introduced to the main stream America by a senator from Vermont named Bernie Sanders. Self proclaimed socialist, he talked about the implementation of free Health care (which Hilary also struggled for in the 90s), free education, raising minimum wage, taxing the wealthy 1 %, holding Wall Street accountable for the disastrous 2008 Market crash. Sadly, Sanders is probably a little too “socialist” for American at the time and Hillary ended up winning the DNC nomination. But with her embarrassing defeat, the new Left can once again mobilize and follow up to their promises. \nSo what now? Here are two key points we should continuously strive for: \nA) The age of Neoliberalism should be put to rest in the U.S Democratic party and so should Clintonism's pseudo liberal ideas. The biggest reason for this election defeat is that the DNC failed to communicate to the working class Americans. If we are to be convinced of Left ever becoming viable again, we should act upon its ideals. Engage in more open conversations, no political \"campaign donations“ from massive corporations and Wall street (yes, it is possible!), focus on more prominent issues facing the working class like health care, free education, tax reformation, raising minimum wage, fight against imperialist wars etc. \nB) The threat of radicalism of the Right should be taken as an extreme threat to the global economy and human progress. Any form of discrimination should be taken as a hazard to basic human rights. As Thomas Paine famously stated: \n“ Whatever is my right as a man is also the right of another; and it becomes my duty to guarantee as well as to possess.” \n- Thomas Paine, The Rights of Man \nThere should be no comprise on this issue. \nAs one of many who did not support either Hillary or Trump, the outcome was to me a bit surprising but predictable. The future remains uncertain not just for the U.S but the western world in general. But I will say this. The path of this world is still yet to be determined. Whether you sympathize with the Left or conservative Right, the overwhelming majority citizens of the world still believe in equal rights, gender equality and equal opportunities for every person regardless of their race, religion or social class. And until that right is taken away from us, let us exercise it to its full potential and bridge the gap of misconceptions. \nFukuyama's End of History may have been the end of our Socio-cultural evolution in theory but we are still long away from fully implementing it in the world that we live in.",

      "title": "Slow down with fast food: McDonald’s now offering table service",
      "text": "NEW YORK (AP/MEDIA GENERAL) — McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations.\nThe world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction.\nMcDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees.\nThis embed is invalid\nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement – including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu – customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said.\nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.” He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option.\nEven though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom.\nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald’s has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru.\nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.",

      "title": "The 10 most-recognizable brand jingles — From the Intel chimes to 'I'm Lovin' it'",
      "text": "McDonald's For some brands, an audio logo is just as important as a visual one.\nClose your eyes, and you'll know it's an Intel ad from its famous chimes. \"I'm Lovin' It\" is synonymous with McDonald's. And we all know what the \"Green Giant\" sings. \nBut which brands have the best-performing sound marks? \nScroll down to find which brand jingles stand out from the rest amongst consumers in the US. \nMethodology \nVeritonic, a marketing analytics platform for commercial music, surveyed more than 2,600 panelists in October 2016 and asked them to listen to audio logos selected from Interbrand's Best Global Brands ranking, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the S&P. \nPanelists were asked to record their emotions as the logos played and were asked about the feelings the audio evoked. They were then contacted 48 hours later to test recall of audio logos. Panelists' emotions and engagement were also tracked using Veritonic's patent-pending EchoTime technology. \nEach brand's overall 1-100 score in the ranking combines unaided recall, plus emotion categories including: Excited, happy, approachable, authentic, confident, empowering, innovative, likable, reputable, simple, trustworthy, and unique. 10. T-Mobile. Overall score: 77.4. Unaided recall: 82 \nT-Mobile's chimes scored well for evoking happy and excited emotions. \nIt doesn't do so well on the unaided recall front, but the mark is distinctive for people who have heard it before — giving it a high engagement score. \n9. Statefarm. Overall score: 78.9. Unaided recall: 84 \nThe insurer's beepy audio logo places scored well for \"happy\" (84), \"excited\" (74) and \"simple\" (72). \nIt placed in ninth place for unaided recall, but didn't score well on the engagement metric. 8. Folgers. Overall score: 79.5. Unaided recall: 86 \nThe Folgers jingle — \"The best part of waking up, is Folgers in your cup\" — is more than 30-years-old, having first launched in 1984. \nIt scored well for emotions including \"happy\" (82), \"reputable\" (78), \"approachable\" (78), and \"authentic\" (78) — all the types of feelings a coffee company would be hoping to evoke from listeners. \nFolgers was tied in third position for unaided recall. 7. Chevy. Overall score: 79.5. Unaided recall: 88 \nChevy's whistled audio mark is unusual as, unlike many other brands, it sometimes plays at the start of an ad rather than the end (although it plays at the end of the video above). \nThe logo scores well in the \"authentic\" (78), \"confident\" (78), \"approachable\" (76), \"trustworthy\" (76) and \"reputable\" categories. \nHowever, it underperformed in the \"excited\" attribute, scoring just 68. 6. McDonald's. Overall score: 79.6. Unaided recall: 85 \n\"I'm Lovin' It\" launched globally in 2003, sung by Justin Timberlake, and it has been McDonald's ad jingle ever since. \nThe logo scores 84 for \"excited\" and \"82\" for happy. \nIt tied third for unaided recall. 5. Hot Pockets. Overall score: 80.5. Unaided recall: 85 \nFamous for the memorable microwave \"ding,\" the sung Hot Pockets audio mark scored well for unaided recall. \nIt was also a top performer in the \"happy\" (86) and \"excited\" (76) categories. \n4. Green Giant. Overall score: 80.8. Unaided recall: 86 \n\"Ho, ho, ho, Green Giant\" has been in-market since the 1960s, giving the logo a strong unaided recall score. \nIt scored well for \"happy\" (86) and \"authentic\" (78), however, the jingle only scored around average on \"excited\" (76) and lagged behind the other top scorers in terms of engagement. 3. Intel. Overall score: 82.7. Unaided recall: 88 \nProbably the most famous audio logo of the bunch, the Intel chimes are internationally recognized, earning them an unaided recall score of 88. \nIntel ties first for evoking a feeling of \"innovation\" (70) amongst listeners. \nIt was also near the top of the pile on \"excited\" (80) and in the overall engagement metrics. 2. Farmer's Insurance. Overall score: 83.2. Unaided recall: 88 \n\"We are Farmers! Bum ba dum bum bum bum bum.\" \nThe Farmer's Insurance audio mark is a relative newcomer in this top 10, as far as on-air promotion is concerned. \nIt's a top performer in several of the emotion scores including \"trustworthiness\" (74), \"uniqueness\" (74) and was joint top on \"innovative\" (70) and \"empowering\" (74). 1. Nationwide. Overall score: 87.2. Unaided recall: 92 \nNationwide's \"Nationwide is on your side\" jingle has been on air for more than 50 years and is still as relevant today as it ever was, according to this study. \nThe audio logo demonstrably leads the pack when it comes to unaided recall and was in the top decile of performers for engagement. It also scored big on \"happy\" (84), \"excited\" (76), and \"simple\" (74). \n\"The speed and pattern of the responses by panelists to the audio logo demonstrates how deeply planted the audio logo has become in panelists' psyches,\" Veritonic writes in the report.",

      "text": "Farewell, old friend. (Picture: McDonald’s/metro.co.uk) This week we reported on the very important business of McDonald’s unveiling their Christmas menu .\nThis restaurant's response to a moaning customer is brilliant But in all the excitement surrounding Christmas burgers and the announcement of a snazzy new Terry’s Chocolate Orange McFlurry, McDonald’s managed to sneak past a truly devastating menu update.\nThis year, you will not see the Festive Pie you know and love.\nAs pointed out by the Mirror , this year, instead of the classic hot crispy pie filled with mincemeat and custard (it was like a handheld custard drenched mince pie, and it was magical), we’ll have a Chocolatey Banoffee Pie.\n(Picture: McDonald’s) Which sounds delicious, sure. But is ‘Chocolatey Banoffee’ a Christmas flavour? We think not.\nThis is an absolute outrage and we cannot believe that McDonald’s would be so bold as to scrap one of our favourite Christmas traditions and fob us off with a not at all festive alternative. Monsters.\nEating McDonald's festive pie in bed. Yes I know how to party. pic.twitter.com/DuFi92HvCe \n— amber (@missambrose991) November 30, 2015 \n\nAnd yes, we do know that a McDonald’s meal, in itself, is not the most Christmassy option.\nBut if we’re already sinking to the low depths of eating a Christmas burger instead of a proper roast, we at least need some form of a mince pie to up the festivity levels to an acceptable degree.\nThe Festive Pie did the trick. The Festive Pie solved everything.\nAnd now it’s gone and we’re not sure we’ll ever recover, no matter how delicious a Chocolatey Banoffee Pie may or may not be.\nWhere is the festive pie @McDonalds ?\n— Rhoda Redd (@RhodaRedd) November 18, 2016 \n@McDonaldsUK – no festive pie for Christmas…. are you mad that's like a Christmas without pigs in blankets #bringitback #stopmessing \n— Jen (@jen_newcastle) November 19, 2016 \n\nIt’s also worth noting that McDonald’s haven’t brought back the festive chocolate and orange pie, despite the fact that it was one of the most popular pies they offered.\nThis is strange, because a chocolate and orange pie would have created a clear Terry’s Chocolate Orange theme.\n. @McDonaldsUK are you ever gonna bring back the festive chocolate & orange pie??? Asking for a mate x\n— Lucy Joy (@lullabellajoy) October 18, 2016 \n@McDonaldsUK will you ever bring back your chocolate orange festive pie?! I keep looking every year \n— Gina Lock (@Geeorgie10) December 4, 2015 \n\nBut no, McDonald’s decided that Chocolatey Banoffee was the answer.\nMcDonald’s were wrong. Mcdonald’s has ruined Christmas.\nMORE: McDonald’s is now testing out a Sriracha Big Mac \nMORE: McDonald’s Italy has introduced a Nutella burger \nMORE: McDonald’s is introducing smartphone ordering in the UK ",

You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground. \nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe. \n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around. \nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times. \nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city. \n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said. \nRaw Video: ",

They determine both are breathing, but while the driver soon comes to, the man on the ground will not respond. \nOne woman, who Wimbley said is a nurse, takes charge and attends to both men. \nParamedics soon arrived at the scene, followed by police. \nWimbley, who had his four-year-old son in his car, said he was worried the man on the floor was dead. \n'He wasn't moving or responding or anything,' Wimbley told Fox 8 Cleveland.

      "text": "Pinterest \nMcDonald’s restaurants have announced plans to implement automated kiosks, and some of these cities that have already adopted the kiosks have a noteworthy correlation — the fight for a $15/hr minimum wage. \nAlthough McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook told The New York Times that this wouldn’t mean that jobs would get cut, but rather that employees would be “redeployed,” the correlation between the fight for an increased minimum wage and the automation is important. \nThe Daily Caller reported : \nMcDonald’s has announced plans to roll out automated kiosks and mobile pay options at all of its U.S. locations, raising questions about the future of its 1.5 million employees in the country and around the globe. \nRoughly 500 restaurants in Florida, New York and California now have the automated ordering stations, and restaurant in Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., will be outfitted in 2017, according to CNNMoney . \nThe locations that are seeing the first automated kiosks closely correlate with the fight for a $15 minimum wage. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law a new $15 minimum wage for New York state in 2016, and the University of California has proposed to pay its low-wage employees $15. Florida’s minimum wage will rise Jan. 1, 2017 . Seattle raised its minimum wage to $15 in 2014, followed by San Francisco and Los Angeles. \nCustomers place their order at touch screens, and then receive a number with a “digital locator,” which then notifies staff to where the customer is sitting. Once the order is ready to serve, a McDonald’s employee delivers the food to the customers table. \nEasterbrook assured that jobs aren’t going to be lost, but that probably won’t be the case for other businesses that are sure to follow suit over time. \nWhile I would argue that any company that makes that much money should, morally, pay people a decent wage and not make such obscene profits without rewarding the labor of those that make it happen, this is an inevitable consequence of too much government intervention. The government implementing an artificially inflated minimum wage is not the answer to the problem, it just compounds it. \nIt is completely understandable for people to be frustrated since millions of Americans are struggling and can’t find sustainable employment, but increasing the minimum wage like this simply isn’t going to fix the underlying problems. \nWe need to bring back better paying jobs to the country and get the economy humming. Schools need to bring back and encourage vocational training. Once we bring back better paying jobs, Americans need to have access to and be encouraged to pursue training for them. \nNow as far as free market principles go, if a company wanted to implement decent wages, take a smaller profit and promote the fact that they do so, and promote the fact that they do so without gouging consumers, it would be interesting to see how people respond and if they thrive. \nAs we see time and time again, the government getting its hands in and artificially boosting the minimum wage doesn’t work. In order for it to work, they would have to get in and control/regulate even more. More government control/regulation is almost always (if not always…) a bad idea.",

      "text": "OUCH: $15 Min Wage Kills Jobs, But What It Did to Earnings Is Even Bigger News \n“Customers have access to information that gives them much more control over their lives,” McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook said. \nWhile McDonald’s is hailing this as an attempt to give customers “much more control over their lives,” the locations it will be rolling out first are telling. Five-hundred restaurants in Florida, New York and California have the automated machines, and the next targets are Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. \nNew York , Florida , Seattle , Washington D.C. , Boston , Los Angeles and San Francisco have already put into effect legislation that will raise the minimum wage, some to eventually reach the $15 mark. This means that almost every locale seeing these kiosks has decided against elementary economics and is about to find out exactly how that works for them.   \nMcDonald’s is far from the only chain doing this, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. In fact, in addition to killing jobs, these minimum wage laws may also benefit large corporations the most. \nWhile these kiosks save money, few small businesses are going to be able to afford the initial investment in the kind of tech development that companies like McDonald’s or Wendy’s are able to. They’d likely have to either buy the equipment at a huge markup with exorbitant licensing fees for the software, or simply go out of business because they can’t compete with the lower labor costs large corporations can deliver thanks to economies of scale. \nWay to go, “fight for $15.” You started out trying to turn minimum-wage burger-flipping jobs into a living wage. You may end up eliminating burger-flipping jobs entirely.",

You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground. \nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe. \n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around. \nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times. \nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city. \n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said. \nRaw Video: ",

      "text": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: McDonald's, Bank of New York Mellon, 3M, Constellation Brands and Viacom November 16, 2016, 09:30:00 AM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com Shutterstock photo \nFor Immediate Release \nChicago, IL - November 16, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include McDonald's (NYSE: MCD - Free Report ), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE: BK - Free Report ), 3M (NYSE: MMM - Free Report ), Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ - Free Report ) and Viacom (NASDAQ: VIAB - Free Report ). \nToday, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free . \nHere are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog: \nTop Research Reports for Today: MCD, BK, MMM, STZ, VIAB \nToday's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including McDonald's (NYSE: MCD - Free Report ), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE: BK - Free Report ) and 3M (NYSE: MMM - Free Report ). \nBuy-ranked McDonald's ' shares have struggled lately as a result of the tough operating environment for the restaurant space in general; the entire space has been struggling lately. However, the fast food giant reported encouraging third-quarter adjusted earnings on the back of strong comps growth. \nThe analyst likes the manner in which the company is trying to strengthen its position via various sales and digital initiatives like menu innovation and introduction of value meals. However, higher labor costs, along with currency headwinds, might hurt profits. (You can read the full research report on McDonald's here . ) \nBank of New York Mellon' s shares have also struggled recently. The Buy ranked stock's third-quarter earnings easily outpaced expectations. Rise in revenues, lower expenses and benefit from provisions were partially offset by a fall in financing-related fees. \nThe analyst likes the company's dedicated global reach, which, accompanied by a diversified product mix and inorganic growth opportunities will improve profitability going forward. Further, cost-saving initiatives will help sustain earnings momentum. However, pressure on margins owing to the persistent low-rate environment is expected to continue in the near term. (You can read the full research report on Bank of New York Mellon here. ) \n3M 's shares have increased by more than 15% year-to-date but have struggled over the last quarter. Weak revenue growth and intense competition are likely to peg back 3M's profitability to some extent. 3M is facing increased pension expenses as its workforce begins to retire. Nevertheless, 3M managed to beat third-quarter earnings by a cent. \nThe analyst likes the company's focused roadmap on its broad financial objectives for the next five years. 3M is continuing with its portfolio restructuring efforts by divesting non-core assets and making investments in other lucrative markets. 3M expects its restructuring efforts to yield $500-$700 million in annual operational savings by 2020. (You can read the full research report on 3M here . ) \nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ - Free Report ) and Viacom (NASDAQ: VIAB - Free Report ). \nConfidential: Best Trades from Zacks Research Would you like to see a hand-picked \"all-star\" selection of investment ideas from the man who heads up Zacks' trading and investing services?

      "text": "  \nEveryone having a solid weekend? Hope you’re not thinking about pending Cabinet appointments. Is Frank Booth about to be named Oxygen Czar? Hey, at this point, why the hell not? In spite of that whole deal , here’s a little Corporate America Nice Time: McDonald’s will wait on you hand and swollen foot \nAre you hungry but sick of standing in line for a triple cheeseburger? Do you need processed milkshake-textured liquid but also have a tight calf from intermittent pressing of the brake pedal? Then McDonald’s was probably too much effort for you. But now you don’t have be an Olympic athlete to eat like a person who doesn’t move from his recliner for the entire Summer Olympics. \nMcDonald’s will soon offer table service at all of its restaurants . I’m sure the tips will be plentiful for the additional labor. And by “plentiful,” we mean “discouraged.” 2017 will also bring easier mobile ordering and payment options. \nThe new approach may bring in the kind of customers who balk at lines, said Ivan Feinseth, analyst at Tigress Financial Partners. “It will make it look less congested at the point of ordering,” he said. “Then people feel they won’t have to wait that long.” \nWe’ve always said that we could get behind McDonald’s if you didn’t have to wait 90 fucking seconds for 1500 calories. What a time to be alive! Come hither and listen to the story of Donald Trump saving car jobs that he didn’t save \nPresident-elect Donald Trump, singer of “Try a Little Tenderness,” painter of “Starry Night” and writer of Seasons 2 thru 5 of Six Feet Under, achieved further greatness this week when he singlehandedly stopped Corporate Person Ford Motors from moving manufacturing jobs from Kentucky to Mexico.   \nThat’s right. Less than a fortnight after the election, Trump is already molding our shithole of a country into a shining behemoth that even Henry Ford could get behind: Come for the decent manufacturing job. Stay for the overt anti-semitism . \nThere’s just one teeny-tiny problem with this statement (beyond “worked hard” and “the Great” state of Kentucky). \nFord had never said it planned to move its Louisville, Kentucky assembly plant to Mexico. In fact, the automaker pledged last year, in a legally binding contract with the United Auto Workers union, to invest $700 million in Louisville, where it builds the popular Ford Escape. \nOn Thursday, Ford DID indicate it will keep production of the Lincoln MKC at the plant. It had planned to shift production and considered a Mexico plant under construction. However, none of this would have had any effect on the Louisville workers who will benefit from increased production of Ford’s more popular models. \nFord reminded everyone that it added 28,000 American jobs in the last five years. (If only Obama ever did something for the auto industry??? smh) Because of slowing sales, Ford temporarily shut down the plant in October, as is common industry practice. But pursuant to terms of the collective bargaining agreement, workers were paid 80% of their wages. Pesky unions. \nWhile it’s clear that Trump is responsible for Ford’s logistical decision to keep making the Lincoln model truck in Kentucky, it’s totally unclear what he did to influence the decision. But who knows. Maybe Trump will give a hat tip to the United Auto Workers for negotiating an agreement that protects its workers’ jobs. Or maybe he’ll just keep marking gross notches on his gross bedposts for shit that he didn’t do. Like when he wrongly took credit for Ford moving F-Series truck manufacturing jobs to Ohio back in 2015. \nAnd if you were to just glance at headlines on non-fake news sites like Bloomberg or Reuters, you might infer that our next president was able to move a large-scale manufacturing outfit in 10 days by sheer force of will and probably a ton of trucker speed. Gee, watching “even-handed” coverage of this Administration won’t be maddening at all. TAGS",

      "text": "Follow @munchies \nThe next time you’re waiting for your afternoon Egg McMuffin at McDonald’s, instead of standing at the counter, sighing deeply and wondering what’s taking so long, you can take your impatience back to your seat instead. On Thursday, McDonald’s announced that it will be bringing touchscreen ordering and table service to all 14,000 of its restaurants in the United States, starting with locations in Boston, Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. \n“Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,” McDonald’s chief executive Steve Easterbrook poetically explained. \nNow, the staffers and their embroidered golden arches will be “redeployed”, as Easterbrook put it , to deliver cardboard burger cartons and plastic trays directly to the tables. The customers will place their orders on a touchscreen and will then receive a small digital location device that they’ll take to their tables. The McCrew will then locate them—like discovering a hungry little geocache–and deliver the meals. \nThis announcement comes almost exactly a year after McDonald’s announced that it would test table service at 600 restaurants in southern California. Table service, an amenity nobody asked for, is already available in Australia, France, the United Kingdom and, weirdly enough, at its ginormous, 500-seat mega-McD’s in the Frankfurt Airport in Germany. (Last week, McDonald’s spilled that table service is coming to Ireland as well, which will undoubtedly make that Maltesers McFlurry taste even better). \nMcDonald’s is trying to get more diners to actually leave their cars and walk into their restaurants; right now, a supersized 70% of its business actually passes through its drive-thru windows. Table service and those touchscreen ordering kiosks are just two of seven ways that McDonald’s says it plans on improving its customer experience. Some of its other ideas include accepting Apple Pay and Android Pay, giving its restaurant décor an upgrade, and using Sriracha mayonnaise. No, really. But maybe that’s what’ll finally get a millennial to eat a Big Mac .",

You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground. \nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman that Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe. \n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. \nHe had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around. \nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times. \nThis week, Sandusky police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city. \n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said. ",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) NEW YORK (AP/MEDIA GENERAL) — McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. The world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction. McDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. The push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement – including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu – customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. CEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.” He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. Even though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. The kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald’s has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. In stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.

Employment and wages are rising, which should give consumers more money to spend on restaurant meals. But sales and traffic are down at many of the nation's top chains. The reason?

You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground.\nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe.\n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around.\nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times.\nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city.\n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said.\nRaw Video: \nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video ",

But the Norse got 14 points in the first 3:43 after the break, capped by McDonald's 3-pointer to give Northern Kentucky a 34-22 lead with 16:17 remaining. \nDelaware (3-2) pulled to 41-38 midway through the half, but 3-pointers from Cole Murray and Lavone Holland II pushed the lead to nine, and the Blue Hens never seriously threatened from then on. \nHolland II had 12 points, four assists and three steals. McDonald tied a career high with 13 rebounds. The Norse shot 56.7 percent in the second half (17 for 30) after a 25 percent mark in the first. \nCazmon Hayes and Ryan Daly each had 13 points for Delaware. Hayes added eight boards and three blocks. 0",

But the Norse got 14 points in the first 3:43 after the break, capped by McDonald's 3-pointer to give Northern Kentucky a 34-22 lead with 16:17 remaining. \nDelaware (3-2) pulled to 41-38 midway through the half, but 3-pointers from Cole Murray and Lavone Holland II pushed the lead to nine, and the Blue Hens never seriously threatened from then on. \nHolland II had 12 points, four assists and three steals. McDonald tied a career high with 13 rebounds. The Norse shot 56.7 percent in the second half (17 for 30) after a 25 percent mark in the first. \nCazmon Hayes and Ryan Daly each had 13 points for Delaware. Hayes added eight boards and three blocks. Related content",

But the Norse got 14 points in the first 3:43 after the break, capped by McDonald's 3-pointer to give Northern Kentucky a 34-22 lead with 16:17 remaining. \nDelaware (3-2) pulled to 41-38 midway through the half, but 3-pointers from Cole Murray and Lavone Holland II pushed the lead to nine, and the Blue Hens never seriously threatened from then on. \nHolland II had 12 points, four assists and three steals. McDonald tied a career high with 13 rebounds. The Norse shot 56.7 percent in the second half (17 for 30) after a 25 percent mark in the first. \nCazmon Hayes and Ryan Daly each had 13 points for Delaware.

      "title": "Fight for $15? McDonald’s just won that battle at every US location",
      "text": "Ted Goodman, DCNF \nMcDonald’s has announced plans to roll out automated kiosks and mobile pay options at all of its U.S. locations, raising questions about the future of its 1.5 million employees in the country and around the globe. \nRoughly 500 restaurants in Florida, New York and California now have the automated ordering stations, and restaurant in Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., will be outfitted in 2017, according to CNNMoney . \nThe locations that are seeing the first automated kiosks closely correlate with the fight for a $15 minimum wage. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law a new $15 minimum wage for New York state in 2016, and the University of California has proposed to pay its low-wage employees $15. Florida’s minimum wage will rise Jan. 1, 2017. Seattle raised its minimum wage to $15 in 2014, followed by San Francisco and Los Angeles. \nCustomers place their order at touch screens, and then receive a number with a “digital locator,” which then notifies staff to where the customer is sitting. Once the order is ready to serve, a McDonald’s employee delivers the food to the customers table. \nNews of McDonald’s plans to expand its digital self-serve ordering stations and table service to all of its 14,000 American restaurants backs up concerns that the fight for $15 will expedite the growth of automation and robots. Aparna Mathur, Resident Scholar for Economic Policy at the American Enterprise Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that a push for a $15 minimum wage might just be enough for companies to expedite plans to automate industries such as fast food. \n“We know that we don’t really need someone to take an order [fast food], and we will eventually have machines do it. It is risky to fight for something that could put you out of work,” Mathur told TheDCNF. \nInstead of a fight for such a dramatic increase in the minimum wage, training programs and workforce education initiatives would be more beneficial to both employees and the employers, according to Mathur. She suggested that, “the only real solution is to enable these people to acquire a different skill set that does not let their job be wiped out by a machine \nMcDonald’s continues to undergo drastic changes as it looks to keep up with increasing competition and consumer demand for a diverse set of fast food options. The rise of sandwich chains and burrito restaurants, along with a shift towards health-conscious options has led to four straight years of traffic decline for McDonald’s. \nThe drastic change raises questions for its workforce, as Mathur discussed, which McDonald’s chief executive, Steve Easterbrook responded to Thursday. The CEO said that the new system will not reduce costs, but it would mean workers might have different jobs. “We’re not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them,” Easterbrook said, according to the Times . \nIt is unclear as to how the new changes will impact McDonald’s bottom line, but the billion-dollar burger joint is making a big bet on the move. Dick Adams, a restaurant consultant, told the Times that a lot of customers are never going to see the new technology. “It’s just not going to be that big of a factor for most franchisees outside big cities.”",

      "text": "Children's Television Programming Report McDonald's hot 2nd half helps Northern Kentucky top Delaware \nOXFORD, Ohio (AP) - Drew McDonald scored 20 of his career-high 28 points in the second half, leading a late charge to help Northern Kentucky beat Delaware 74-53 on Saturday. \nNorthern Kentucky (2-2) scored just 20 points and trailed by one at halftime. But the Norse got 14 points in the first 3:43 after the break, capped by McDonald's 3-pointer to give Northern Kentucky a 34-22 lead with 16:17 remaining. \nDelaware (3-2) pulled to 41-38 midway through the half, but 3-pointers from Cole Murray and Lavone Holland II pushed the lead to nine, and the Blue Hens never seriously threatened from then on. \nHolland II had 12 points, four assists and three steals. McDonald tied a career high with 13 rebounds. The Norse shot 56.7 percent in the second half (17 for 30) after a 25 percent mark in the first. \nCazmon Hayes and Ryan Daly each had 13 points for Delaware. Hayes added eight boards and three blocks. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.   This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

      "text": "\nSANDUSKY, Ohio– A Facebook user live streamed a very disturbing scene as he pulled up to a McDonald’s in Ohio on Thursday. \nIt’s an incident that police across Northeast Ohio say has become routine. \nPolice were called to the restaurant on River Avenue just before 5 p.m. for two men overdosing in a car. \nWARNING: Some viewers may find this video difficult to watch. \nEddie Wimbley posted the video of the two people passed out. You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground. \nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe. \n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around. \nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times. \nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city. \n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said. \nRaw Video: ",

      "text": "\nSANDUSKY, Ohio– A Facebook user live streamed a very disturbing scene as he pulled up to a McDonald’s in Ohio on Thursday. \nIt’s an incident that police across Northeast Ohio say has become routine. \nPolice were called to the restaurant on River Avenue just before 5 p.m. for two men overdosing in a car. \nWARNING: Some viewers may find this video difficult to watch. \nEddie Wimbley posted the video of the two people passed out. You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground. \nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe. \n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around. \nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times. \nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city. \n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said. \nRaw Video: ",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nWhen a new technology or social media “hot thing” emerges, chances are about 100 percent that the guys in the sales department are going to find a way to use it to sell more tires/shampoo/waffle irons/whatever. Take Twitter, for example. Slap a #hashtag on it, and you’re off to the races. Virtual Reality (VR) is still in its infancy stages — the typical goggles don’t quite lend themselves to walking down the street while looking cool (exhibit 1: Google Glass). But McDonald’s, the biggest burger slinger on the planet, has found a way to incorporate the burgeoning VR platform into its advertising pitches. \nAndroid Headlines notes if you have Google Cardboard or a similar device like Gear VR, HTC Vive, and Daydream View, this 360-degree video will plop you down at one of Mickey D’s new high-tech “Just For You” restaurants that are now showing up in markets like Florida, California, and New York after an overseas roll out. You get a VR view of a new ordering kiosk and can check out a modern dining room that is far removed from what you used to get in the old white buildings with the red stripes. \nMore: Let your friends curate your restaurant bucket list with Truffle \nThere’s a key concept here that is worth considering, though; one that every emerging technology to consider. Is the McDonald’s audience going to embrace this type of approach? The NBA is jumping in with both sneakers , for one. Sure, it’s a fun thing to fiddle with, but is there going to be any type of mass appeal use for VR? \nMcDonald’s is a major mass appeal business, with thousands of stores all around the world. While the younger techy demographic that has grown up on Facebook may find this approach fascinating, the older folks that grew up with Ronald McDonald is more likely to shirk it off. Time will tell if this becomes a viable concept, but for now, it’s fun to take a peek into the McDonald’s of the future that is here, now.",

      "text": "McDonald's \nFor some brands, an audio logo is just as important as a visual one.\nClose your eyes, and you'll know it's an Intel ad from its famous chimes. \"I'm Lovin' It\" is synonymous with McDonald's. And we all know what the \"Green Giant\" sings.\nBut which brands have the best-performing sound marks?\nScroll down to find which brand jingles stand out from the rest amongst consumers in the US.\nMethodology \nVeritonic, a marketing analytics platform for commercial music, surveyed more than 2,600 panelists in October 2016 and asked them to listen to audio logos selected from Interbrand's Best Global Brands ranking, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the S&P.\nPanelists were asked to record their emotions as the logos played and were asked about the feelings the audio evoked. They were then contacted 48 hours later to test recall of audio logos. Panelists' emotions and engagement were also tracked using Veritonic's patent-pending EchoTime technology.\nEach brand's overall 1-100 score in the ranking combines unaided recall, plus emotion categories including: Excited, happy, approachable, authentic, confident, empowering, innovative, likable, reputable, simple, trustworthy, and unique.\n10. T-Mobile. Overall score: 77.4. Unaided recall: 82 \nYoutube Embed:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/bPB-2RwqH0U\nWidth: 560px\nHeight: 315px \nT-Mobile's chimes scored well for evoking happy and excited emotions.\nIt doesn't do so well on the unaided recall front, but the mark is distinctive for people who have heard it before — giving it a high engagement score.\n \n\n\n9. Statefarm. Overall score: 78.9. Unaided recall: 84 \nYoutube Embed:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/O6XXe9OnvBo\nWidth: 560px\nHeight: 315px \nThe insurer's beepy audio logo places scored well for \"happy\" (84), \"excited\" (74) and \"simple\" (72).\nIt placed in ninth place for unaided recall, but didn't score well on the engagement metric.\n\n\n8. Folgers. Overall score: 79.5. Unaided recall: 86 \nYoutube Embed:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/g471Nd6a1Lc\nWidth: 560px\nHeight: 315px \nThe Folgers jingle — \"The best part of waking up, is Folgers in your cup\" — is more than 30-years-old, having first launched in 1984.\nIt scored well for emotions including \"happy\" (82), \"reputable\" (78), \"approachable\" (78), and \"authentic\" (78) — all the types of feelings a coffee company would be hoping to evoke from listeners.\nFolgers was tied in third position for unaided recall.\n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "text": "SANDUSKY, Ohio– A Facebook user live streamed a very disturbing scene as he pulled up to a McDonald’s in Ohio on Thursday. \nIt’s an incident that police across Northeast Ohio say has become routine. \nPolice were called to the restaurant on River Avenue just before 5 p.m. for two men overdosing in a car. \nWARNING: Some viewers may find this video difficult to watch. \nEddie Wimbley posted the video of the two people passed out. You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground. \nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe. \n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around. \nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times. \nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city. \n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said. \nRaw Video:",

      "text": "McDonald's says table service coming to US stores The Associated Press Updated: 11/17/2016 02:32:04 PM EST \nNEW YORK (AP) — McDonald's says it plans to offer table service across its U.S. stores to make the ordering process less stressful, but did not say when the overhaul will be complete. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores have been testing table service and ordering kiosks for people who do not want to wait for the cashier. People in those stores order at the counter or kiosks, then sit and wait for an employee to bring them their food. \nEarly next year, McDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. \nThe push comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.

      "title": "McDonald’s Wins The Fight For $15 In Every State In The US",
      "text": "0 comments \nBe careful what you wish for (or demand in this case), you just might get it. As the Fight for 15! madness sweeps across the US, mandating that employers pay a minimum wage of $15… McDonald’s is bringing ‘change’ to all their restaurants to combat it. All 14,000 restaurants are going to receive automated kiosks with touch screens to make ordering faster, easier and more accurate. They will also be rolling out mobile pay options, which I predict will become the wave of the future in fast food ordering. All of this means that many employees will now become ‘optional’. \nOver the last couple of years, I have written repeatedly on how automation and job displacement was coming. Employers cannot afford the massive hike in the minimum wage, so they will streamline and take a hit up front that will pay off handsomely in the future. Now, you can walk into a McDonald’s and order via a touchscreen. The kiosk will issue you a number and then an employee (still human for now) will bring your food to your table. I think that is a vast improvement over current conditions. \nFrom BizPac Review: \nMcDonald’s has announced plans to roll out automated kiosks and mobile pay options at all of its U.S. locations, raising questions about the future of its 1.5 million employees in the country and around the globe. \nRoughly 500 restaurants in Florida, New York and California now have the automated ordering stations, and restaurant in Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., will be outfitted in 2017, according to CNNMoney . \nThe locations that are seeing the first automated kiosks closely correlate with the fight for a $15 minimum wage. Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law a new $15 minimum wage for New York state in 2016, and the University of California has proposed to pay its low-wage employees $15. Florida’s minimum wage will rise Jan. 1, 2017. Seattle raised its minimum wage to $15 in 2014, followed by San Francisco and Los Angeles. \nCustomers place their order at touch screens, and then receive a number with a “digital locator,” which then notifies staff to where the customer is sitting. Once the order is ready to serve, a McDonald’s employee delivers the food to the customers table. \nThe changes are already starting to show up at locations in Florida, New York and Southern California, where 500 restaurants have been updated. Restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, DC and Seattle will get upgrades in early 2017. McDonald’s is claiming that employees will just be doing different jobs, but you can bet jobs will be cut across the board. They are no longer needed and costs must be cut to fund the upgrades. \nThe move is the company’s latest attempt to win back the customers it has lost to popular fast-casual joints like Shake Shack. Jack-in-the-Box has had kiosks for a while now. Most fast food outlets and many restaurants are now modernizing in this manner. Within a year, it will be common here in the US. It already is in Europe. Most people no longer use cash, so they will use their debit and credit cards at the kiosks. \nAs technology changes the market, people are going to have to learn new skill sets. News of McDonald’s plans to expand its digital self-serve ordering stations and table service to all of its 14,000 American restaurants backs up concerns that the fight for $15 will expedite the growth of automation and robots. Aparna Mathur, Resident Scholar for Economic Policy at the American Enterprise Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that a push for a $15 minimum wage might just be enough for companies to expedite plans to automate industries such as fast food. “We know that we don’t really need someone to take an order [fast food], and we will eventually have machines do it. It is risky to fight for something that could put you out of work,” Mathur told TheDCNF. \nMcDonald’s is making a major bet here that this will succeed. Their profits are already increasing thanks to these moves. This is a bet that they will win and it is how our lives are changing before our very eyes. The minimum wage issue will not be employees’ most significant worry now… finding a job at all and having the skills to do it will be.

      "text": "Can you lose weight while eating McDonald’s fast food? Well, McDonald’s wants you to believe its diet — which has been proven to be full of unhealthy ingredients — contains the daily recommended allowances for carbohydrates, proteins, sugar and fat; and so, it is healthy to eat and does not cause obesity and the other health ailments, as widely claimed. Remember when John Cisna, a high school science teacher from Iowa, lost 56 pounds while eating nothing but McDonald’s in 2013? Just so you know, John went for the McDonald’s-only diet, limited his daily intake to 2,000 calories, and exercised for 45 minutes five times a week.\nAfter six months, he lost a total of 21 inches off his chest, waist and hips; his total cholesterol dropped from 249 to 190; from 38, his body mass index came down to 30; and from 280 pounds, his body weight came down to 224 pounds.\n“ I ate 540 straight meals at McDonald’s . I spent a half a year of my life eating nothing but McDonald’s and I know it works so when I hear the skeptics, it doesn’t disgruntle me. It actually fires me up because those are the people that I have to educate,” John insisted in a documentary McDonald’s pedaled to schools as a tool for teaching kids about healthy eating.\nAs a paid brand ambassador for McDonald’s, he even traveled across the United States promoting the fast food chain to middle and high schoolers, as well as students studying dietetics.\nThe 20-minute documentary, titled 540 Meals: Choices Make The Difference, showed John discrediting the famed documentary Supersize Me and explaining his unconventional weight-loss plan that made him lighter and healthier. While John tried to convince students that McDonald’s fast food is a nutritious, wholesome choice for lunch, McDonald’s swayed them to ignore any negative information about fast food, or McDonald’s, that they may encounter on the Internet. John argued:\n“This experiment wasn’t about McDonald’s, this experiment wasn’t about me. This experiment was about teaching kids to use critical skills in making proper choices.”\nAs expected, experts weren’t impressed. Elisa Zied, a registered dietitian nutritionist in New York and author of Younger Next Week , told TODAY :\n“Much of John’s results have to do with cutting his calorie intake, so it’s not surprising that he lost weight and lowered his cholesterol. But it’s likely his diet was high in sodium, low in fiber and not as rich in vitamins and minerals as it could be because it lacked a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and other nutrient-rich foods.\n“I personally would not recommend this to anyone. Fast food can be part of a healthful, balanced and nutrient-rich diet but it… shouldn’t be a large part. I would advise people trying to lose weight to cook at home more, eat out less, and follow current Dietary Guidelines for Americans .”\nBettina Elias Siegel, a Harvard Law School graduate and renowned advocate on issues related to children and food policy, lambasted the documentary. Siegal claimed it as being a veritable infomercial for the beleaguered fast food chain promoted at high schools and middle schools by local McDonald’s franchisees and paid McDonald’s “Nutrition Consultants.” Siegal went further, explaining how it was in order to woo customers at a young and impressionable age to change its image and profits. She also launched a petition on Change.org asking McDonald’s to stop the program.\nUPDATE:\nFaced with widespread criticism , McDonald’s not only stopped sending John to schools to educate students about nutrition and good habits , the company also stopped supplying related materials, including the 20-minute documentary the critics called a subtle form of fast-food marketing that could imperil kids’ health and understanding of nutrition. Christina Tyler, a McDonald’s spokesperson, said in a statement:\n“John’s currently focused on the opportunities that make the most sense for our brand at this time. Specifically, as our brand ambassador, John is currently focused on internal and local community events, and he is not appearing at schools.”\nIn his response, John told The Washington Post :\n“My focus has always been to encourage people to exercise and make more informed choices about food. Now I’m focused on and enjoying talking to employees and community groups about my story of choice and balance.”\nMcDonald’s New Kale Salad is Less Healthy Than a Big Mac https://t.co/qCbndK7TCx #foodiefriday #mcdonalds pic.twitter.com/xmuxPK2KvO\n— Jetset Lawyer (@jetsetlawyer) October 14, 2016",

      "title": "McDonald’s Lawsuit Revisited: 15 Year Old Sues Virgin Australia After Being Burned By Coffee Inflight",
      "text": "  \nYou may be familiar with — and even outraged by — the famous lawsuit against McDonald’s by Stella Liebeck who was burned by hot coffee. \nThe jury’s $2.7 million award has long been a poster child for tort reform (the judge actually reduced her award to $480,000). What’s often missed is that: \nThe award was medical expenses and two days’ profit from coffee Immediately after the award fast food restaurants started serving coffee at around 158 °F — a temperature where it will take 60 seconds to cause third degree burns (enough time to react to a spill and avoid burns). \nMcDonald’s in Bangkok \nThe plaintiff in the case wasn’t driving. She was the passenger, the car was stopped, and she removed the coffee lid to add cream and sugar. The coffee spill caused extensive burns to her legs and her groin. She needed skin grafts. \nWhat’s more, McDonald’s had received hundreds of documented complaints about the dangerous temperature at which they were serving coffee, and they conceded it was at a temperature where it couldn’t be consumed immediately. So McDonald’s was deemed negligent. \nWe now have a new McDoanld’s case from the skies. A 15 year old flying Los Angeles – Sydney is suing Virgin Australia after getting burned by hot coffee . \nIn the May 2015 incident, \nThe 15-year-old said he placed the cup on a tray table that was uneven, causing the cup to slide off and splash on his lap, burning his groin, stomach and legs. \nVirgin Australia Boarding in Los Angeles \nHis father “described his son’s injuries as horrific and compared it to blisters to the size of 50 cent coins that looked like jellyfish.” \nThey allege that the flight crew refused them cold water to treat the injury after having gone through 12 bottles. \n‘They said that we have got to make sure that we have enough water for the flight, especially in first class. Why even mention that?’ he said. \nThe boy reportedly took 3 months to heal “and during that time he was bullied at school who said he ‘walked like a gorilla’.” \nThey’re suing for damages — and to get airlines to start serving hot beverages with lids. Ronald McDoanld Takes to the Skies! \nI won’t pre-judge the case. I’ll just observe that complaints about tort law are usually that judgments are too punitive against companies, not that they aren’t punitive enough. Lawsuits are often more effective than legislators and regulators, and companies have a harder time lobbying the former than capturing the latter . \nI hope whatever the outcome that hot drinks won’t become less available onboard. I get frustrated with Cathay Pacific as it is when they won’t serve coffee with the seatbelt sign on. I’d be happy to sign a waiver of liability in exchange for my coffee..!

      "text": "NBC’s ‘The Voice’ rankings: We McDonald, Billy Gilman at the top; Ali Caldwell rises   \nThis season of “ The Voice ” is probably the most interesting one of the past past couple of years. While we do think that there are some favorites, at the same time we don’t consider them to be anywhere near as overwhelming as the ones that we had the seasons that Sawyer Fredericks, Jordan Smith, and Alisan Porter won. While there were moments of doubt here and there with those seasons, we think for the majority of them the winner was pretty clear. \nThere are some big shakeups in the rankings in the rankings this week, and that’s brought on by us still getting to know who some of these singers are, how they perform, and what America thinks of them. \n11. Aaron Gibson ( last week : 6) – It was a little bit of a surprise to see Team Miley’s standout in need of the Save, and to be honest, we have to put some of the blame on his coach. Miley needs to think more in terms of what the audience will like for songs rather than what she personally enjoys. You can go obscure, but this recent performance was potentially too obscure for its own good. \n10. Darby Walker (8) – Darby’s extremely talented, but she may be suffering somewhat from the same problem as Aaron in not being commercial enough. Also, her voice may just be a tad too different in that not everyone’s going to like it. We’re not sure what she can do to turn it around. \n9. Christian Cuevas (9) – We do think that there’s a pretty good chance that Christian makes it to the top 9 or whatever the show goes to until we get the massive bloodletting that happens every year before the finale. The issue with him is that we don’t see that extra gear yet where he can really stand out as an artist. \n8. Courtney Harrell (10) – For Courtney, she’s also the mirror image of Christian, except on Team Blake rather than Team Alicia. Given that we tend to find Blake the most popular of the coaches, we’re going to give her the slight edge. \n7. Josh Gallagher (11) – Now, we’re moving forward to what is our Country Trio. We don’t necessarily think that any of them really killed it on iTunes this past week, but it almost doesn’t matter given that country artists do tend to really get a lot of support from Middle America and people who don’t often download their music. \n6. Austin Allsup (4) – We say the same thing here about Austin, but we give him the slight edge over Josh mostly because of the connection he has with Blake. In terms of sensibility, we do think the two are rather similar and can take on much of the same sort of music. \n5. Sundance Head (3) – Sundance has Blake, he already has fans thanks to “American Idol,” and we think that he’s potentially the most folksy of the three country singers. He’s the one you’re not going to forget about. Therefore, he’s worthy of this spot on the list. \n4. Brendan Fletcher (7) – If you’re a singer-songwriter type on the show, the best thing that you can have is a voice that is distinctive from the crowd given that there are so many similar performers in a given season. Brendan has that, he’s done well on iTunes for two straight weeks, and we think that there is nowhere for him to go but up. \n3. Ali Caldwell (6) – The one thing going against her is that she hasn’t been considered a favorite in the eyes of the editors. She’s a little more under-the-radar, but if she continues to perform like she did this past week (where she had in our mind the strongest vocal of the entire show), we see her going nowhere but up as we continue to move further and further along into the season. \n2. We McDonald (2) – A really strong outing from We both in terms of her performance and on iTunes, where she was #1 among the “Voice” artists even if she missed out on the top 10 overall. We’s had a lot of screen time since the very start of the season, and this could be her biggest overall contributing factor to her momentum going into the live shows. \n1. Billy Gilman (1) – As good as We and Ali have been, we do still consider the guy with the biggest pre-show following the one to beat, especially since he’s had two strong outings that include iTunes sales. We do think he’ll need to be a little more current than covering Queen’s “The Show Must Go On,” but if he can do that, he’ll be a lock for at least the finale. \nWho do you think is the strongest right now?

      "text": "Apparent Overdose in McDonald's Parking Lot in OH Captured on Facebook Live 2 overdose victims saved on Facebook Live Alyssa Raymond, WKYC 6:02 PM. EST November 20, 2016 (Photo: Eddie Wimbley's Facebook page) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nSANDUSKY - A desperate search for help from the man seen in a Facebook Live stream who overdosed in a McDonald's Parking lot in Sandusky Thursday evening. \nThe video and the man's story are a powerful reminder of the heroin and opioid epidemic here in Northeast Ohio. The problem is real and so we want to warn you that we wanted to show you a clear picture, which some of you may find hard to watch. \nBut the man on the ground and his family say they are glad this video is out there. \nThis is real life and people are dying. \nThere have been 30 overdoses in 30 days in Sandusky. Four people died. \nThe family of the man you see on the ground wants everyone to share this story and this video. They want the truth about heroin out there. \nIn an eleven and a half minute Facebook Live stream, you see a 27-year-old man gasping for air after overdosing on heroin. That man lying there, seemingly lifeless, is Michael Williams. Like so many, he watched the video over and over again. \n\"I was fighting back the tears,” said Michael Williams. “I got goosebumps and teary eyed. Like I said, I am a strong individual, and it was hard to watch.\" \nHis older sister, Amber Roesch, found it hard to watch too. \n\"Watch that video and share it because that is terrifying,” said Roesch. \nShe hopes users all over the country see what happened to her brother. \n\"I do not want to have to bury him,” said Roesch. “He needs help now.\" \nAmber says a week ago he told her he needed help, and he said it again today. \n\"I definitely have a problem,” said Williams. “If I could get the help right now, I would definitely go. I need it I want it.\" \nMichael's family expected the worse when they received that phone call. But EMS and Narcan saved his life. Amber says they tried to thank everyone including Eddie Wimbley, the man who recorded it all. \n\"I hope it is like a wakeup call,” said Wimbley. “I just do not understand how people can do something knowing that they could possibly die.\" \nMichael says he started using heroin four months ago. Before that, he drank a lot and took pain pills. But when he lost his job, he turned to something cheaper. Michael will tell you, he never thought it would happen to him, but it did. \nYou might be wondering why Williams can't just go out and get the help he needs. He says he recently lost his job so he does not have insurance and he was told a lot of places would not take Medicaid. His family told me it costs around $800 a day for him to go to an inpatient facility, which they say that's what he needs, but cannot afford. \nYou can watch the full video below (app users WATCH HERE ). WARNING: VIDEO CONTAINS GRAPHIC CONTENT: \nWKYC's Alyssa Raymond is in Sandusky today, and spoke to the man who captured the scene on Facebook ( MOBILE USERS : watch here ). \n(© 2016 WKYC) ",
