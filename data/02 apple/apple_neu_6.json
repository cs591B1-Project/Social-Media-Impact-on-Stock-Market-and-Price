      "text": "Written by Charlie \nThe Apple Watch Series 2 has raised the bar for Apple, but what is better for the runner? Read about Garmin vs the Apple Watch Series 2 for some ideas.   \nThis is a post that I have wanted to get to for a while and have been receiving a lot of people visiting at this post and asking questions so I thought I really needed to sit down and get this out! Hopefully, this will help you as you struggle with which watch you should get. Garmin vs the Apple Watch Series 2 \nI am not singling out a specific Garmin watch in this review ( to read reviews on just about every Garmin device available today, check out DC Rainmaker’s awesome site )but will instead be lumping in the latest Garmin watches since most of them provide smart notifications and can be used as a semi-smartwatch. Yes, you might have thought of Garmin before as just a running watch but they have very much become a company that turns out watches that you can wear each and every day, even to meetings. I personally have the Garmin Fenix 3 and really love it ( though I was completely open to switching to the Apple Watch Series 2! ). \nBackground \nI spent some time with the original Apple Watch last year and even took it on my 6 marathon / 6 continent / 5 day trip to see how helpful it would prove on it over my Garmin for everyday tasks. It actually spent the entire trip in the bottom of my backpack because it was not that helpful – because the battery did not last much past the first run! I had a lot to think about and take care of during each flight to the next running continent and did not want to add charging the Apple Watch as a task after each run! \nBut, I knew the Apple Watch certainly had a place and I also knew that Apple would release one with GPS which should make it much friendlier for runners. Enter the Apple Watch Series 2, released in September of this year. The New Apple Watch Series 2 The Apple Watch Nike+ | From Apple \nIf you are searching for reviews, you likely already know a lot about the Apple Watch Series 2. To avoid throwing specs at you, I will simply highlight some of the big changes that made the Apple Watch Series 2 a contender to the running crowd: integrated GPS water resistance up to 50 meters better battery life a running specific model with running complications ( an Apple term for aspects of the display ) and a more running appropriate band ( and Nike specific ) \nThere are actually two kinds of Apple Watch Series 2 models – and they are both at the same price points ( $369 for the 38mm and $399 for the 42mm ). One is the regular Apple Watch Series 2 and the other is the Apple Watch Nike+ Running model. The Nike+ brings a Nike-branded watch face option and band while also delivering its running app already installed on the watch. Other than that, it is the same watch. \nWith watchOS 3, the watch has really become a much speedier device – it has even helped the original Apple Watch. So, if you used an old Apple Watch, expect a better user experience when pulling up your apps. The battery life has definitely been helped with a healthy increase. 3 Things I Love about the New Apple Watch Series 2 \nNow, I know, there are already dozens ( maybe hundreds?? ) of Apple Watch reviews on the internet. I am certainly not going to be doing an in-depth review on all aspects of the Apple Watch Series 2 as I believe there are some excellent sites that have already done that. I do want to focus on the running part and what makes the Apple Watch Series 2 something to consider for running. \nThe Battery Life \nAs I mentioned, the battery life has certainly improved! I could get over a day out of the watch with running activities only bringing the battery percentage down a bit instead of in chunks. For most of my runs, I noticed about a 10% increase in battery life per hour of my running workout. With the original Apple Watch, it was more like 20% or so. \nMany Running Apps Having GPS lets you leave your phone at home and use your favorite running app \nThe Apple Watch has a healthy catalog of running-specific apps that can help you keep track of your workout. Using the built-in optical heart rate monitor helps these apps to provide even a bit more information to you when you are out on your run – and after. \nI used a couple of running apps on my Apple Watch Series 2 and there is certainly going to be something for just about everyone! I found that GPS on the watch when using it directly from the iPhone ( just like a non-GPS Apple Watch would ) was actually speedier and more accurate than the first generation. Not sure if that is simply a communication issue or if the software has been improved. \nAs for the GPS onboard, I found that it also worked fairly well. There were some times that it varied more than .1 or .2 of a mile from my Garmin but most of the time, it was under .2 mile variation. My Garmin would find GPS faster than the Apple Watch on most occasions. \nEasy Access to Apps \nThis is certainly going to be a user-specific thing, but I like being able to access other parts of the watch without stopping to step through things or having to pull out my phone. For example, there are some songs that I want to hear again or maybe skip during a workout. With the Apple Watch Series 2, a simple swipe and I can start messing with my playlist. I can also back out of the workout and have it running the background while I use a different app. \nI know, why would I be messing with apps when I am running? There are just some times that I need to pull something up or glance at an e-mail on the run and it is nice to be able to quickly and easily access that data. 3 Things I Love About Garmin Watches \nThey Just Work Garmin watches are easy to start and go with \nTechnology is great but sometimes devices that do a lot can be compromised ( and sometimes heavily compromised ) devices. With Garmin running watches, they do one thing really well – track your running workout and metrics. The notifications are like a nice touch that takes the watch from being just a workout device to a potential all-day wearable. \nBut, I love being able to go outside for a run, hit the start button, and start running in a matter of seconds after it gets a solid GPS signal. There is really nothing to mess with. A couple of button presses and I can take off and check things like my pace, distance, time, elevation, lap pace, sunset/sunrise, temperature, calories burned, ascent, descent, and others with a quick glance at my watch – no having to maybe lift the wrist another time to get the display to come on ( like I had to do with the Apple Watch a couple of times ). \nMetrics \nThis is certainly not something that everyone needs but I love the metrics my Garmin watches provide to me. When paired with a HRM-Run strap and module ( heart rate monitor, a special one by Garmin for tracking ), I can check such things as my vertical oscillation ( how high do I go after landing ), ground contact time ( how much time are my feet spending on the ground ), stride length, and cadence. Garmin can provide many metrics about your workout \nKnowing your stride length and cadence can give you some ideas of things you can work on to improve your speed ( 180 steps per minute is optimal so if you are around 170, improving your stride length while maintaining your cadence will help to increase speed ). Of course, you can track your improved performance with pace and time but if you are really wanting to dig down into the numbers, some of these things can be helpful. \nBattery Life \nYes, I have battery life under Garmin as well as Apple Watch – and they are completely different! My love for the Apple Watch battery life is the improvement over the first generation. But, my love for Garmin battery life is that you can get some pretty incredible times between charges. \nMy Garmin Fenix 3 can easily go at least a week without a run before it needs charging and can go for about 16 hours for GPS use. That means a Garmin watch like this or the triathlon models ( like the 910XT, 920XT among others ) can easily last you for many different ultra marathon distances, if that is something you like. Good luck trying to get through an ultra with the Apple Watch – unless you are a world-class runner! So, Garmin or Apple Watch Series 2? \nI really, really wanted to believe that the Apple Watch Series 2 could replace my Garmin Fenix 3. After all, I love the great 2 way interaction that the Apple Watch provides with notifications as well as the ability to do so much more with it throughout the day. \nBut, after using it for a month, I realized that the Garmin Fenix 3 is really smart enough for me right now ( as are many of the later Garmin models ) and that I would sacrifice the emojis on my watch for quality run tracking performance. The Garmin gives me the information and durability that I need for training and racing while I personally did not find that the Apple Watch is quite there yet. \nMy suggestion is that for the casual runner, the Apple Watch Series 2 would be perfect. With Apple’s fitness push and apps like the Nike Running Companion to help pus your workouts, it can be a great tool. \nBut, for most running enthusiasts/racers/marathoners, I feel that the Garmin watches still provide the better running tools . Between the simplicity that they provide, the battery life, and the information, I decided to stick with my Garmin Fenix 3 . \nApple Watch:",

      "text": "Everywhere you look this November, Black Friday is happening. There's no regard for the fact this one-day event is actually being stretched out over the course of around two weeks, with customers simply eager to pick up bargains and slay their Christmas to-do list early. Well, get excited, because after skipping the event in a hipster-like move last year, Apple is back and ready to hand down some tasty savings in 2016. The Cupertino giant announced its return to the action with the teaser below, something which will bring a sigh of relief to the many customers who haven't recently won the lottery in order to keep up with Apple's inflation. Related: Want to pick up an iPhone 7? Look no further than this Black Friday deal \"Friday can't come soon enough,\" the graphic reads. Now, of course, we're all asking the same question here: just what the bloody hell is going to hit the sale pile, Apple? Well, it's all currently up in the air. However, with some reckless speculation and devious deduction, we can take some wild stabs at what might be offered. Okay, so the easiest clue here is obviously the huge Apple Watch (it could be telling that it's an aluminium Sport variant) included in the teaser. With the Apple Watch Series 2 recently hitting the masses, a price cut for its predecessor would appear very likely. And who knows, maybe Tim Cook and his merry band of Apple consigliere will even let us save a bit of cash on the new variant, too. Related: Apple Watch Series 2 review Aside from that, it all gets pretty sketchy. However, the note also reads: \"Our one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to tick everyone off your list.\" Everyone off a list, you say, Apple? Well, as you can see here and in the image below, the company has their own list of recommended items to choose from, with the iPhone 7 apparently topping \"everyone's\". Curious. Related: iPhone 8 release date, rumours, news, specs and price Still, if Apple were to actually discount the latest iPhone, or even its fresh MacBook line, it would be a pretty significant surprise. After all, in 2014, when it last offered discounts, US customers were only provided a $100 iTunes gift card when purchasing a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro or iMac with 5K Retina Display.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nApple wants to bring Apple Music to as many places as possible, and to help reach that goal, the company has buddied up with Indian ride-hailing service Ola, which will now offer music to passengers as part of the ridesharing experience. \nUnder the new partnership, Apple Music will be available to passengers through a new service called Ola Play, according to a report from the Los Angeles Times . \nMore: Apple reportedly invests in Omnifone staff and technology to beef up Apple Music \nApple isn’t the only new partner for Ola — the company also partnered with the likes of Sony, Qualcomm, Fynd, and Audio Compass to help beef up its in-car audio offerings. \nSo how will the system work? According to Ola, passengers will have access to a tablet that will offer a range of infotainment systems, including Apple Music. Alternatively, users can download the Ola Play app and control the infotainment straight from their smartphone. \n“Cars were initially built for the driver,” said Ola CEO Bhavish Agarwal at a news conference, according to the Los Angeles Times report. “But with ridesharing, the control needs to be there for the passenger, and Ola Play works along that.” \nNot only is Ola making other partnerships but this is also Apple’s second deal with a ridesharing service. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a hefty $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese company. According to Cook, the partnership will Apple get some insight into the Chinese market. \nIt’s largely thought that Apple itself is hoping to make inroads into the automotive industry. While most rumors indicate that the company has ditched plans to release a car of its own, the company may still be working on the underlying self-driving technology that could help cars drive on their own.

      "text": "apple music ola partnership phone More Apple wants to bring Apple Music to as many places as possible, and to help reach that goal, the company has buddied up with Indian ride-hailing service Ola, which will now offer music to passengers as part of the ridesharing experience.\nUnder the new partnership, Apple Music will be available to passengers through a new service called Ola Play, according to a report from the Los Angeles Times .\nMore: Apple reportedly invests in Omnifone staff and technology to beef up Apple Music\nApple isn’t the only new partner for Ola — the company also partnered with the likes of Sony, Qualcomm, Fynd, and Audio Compass to help beef up its in-car audio offerings.\nSo how will the system work? According to Ola, passengers will have access to a tablet that will offer a range of infotainment systems, including Apple Music. Alternatively, users can download the Ola Play app and control the infotainment straight from their smartphone.\n“Cars were initially built for the driver,” said Ola CEO Bhavish Agarwal at a news conference, according to the Los Angeles Times report. “But with ridesharing, the control needs to be there for the passenger, and Ola Play works along that.”\nNot only is Ola making other partnerships but this is also Apple’s second deal with a ridesharing service. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a hefty $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese company. According to Cook, the partnership will Apple get some insight into the Chinese market.\nIt’s largely thought that Apple itself is hoping to make inroads into the automotive industry. While most rumors indicate that the company has ditched plans to release a car of its own, the company may still be working on the underlying self-driving technology that could help cars drive on their own.\nApple may be preparing to lower the price of Apple Music plans, report says iPlaylist: Apple Music is using your iTunes history to make playlists for you Apple calls on James Corden for comical Apple Music ad",

      "text": "Will Shoppers Bite Into Apple's Black Friday Deals? (AAPL) By Richard Saintvilus | November 22, 2016 — 7:18 AM EST \nApple, Inc. ( AAPL ) is reportedly back on the Black Friday deals bandwagon after opting out of the event last year, despite it being one of the busiest days of the shopping season. \nLast night, the Cupertino-based tech giant launched a webpage displaying the phrase \"Friday can't come soon enough.\" The page doesn't provide any specific details about the deals. It only says, \"Our one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to check everyone off your list.\" Nonetheless, this tells us Apple may offer discounts and deals related to Black Friday. \nUnlike with other retailers, however, don't expect drastic reductions in Apple product prices here. The company is not known to resort to aggressive discounts at the expense of its profit margins. Apple Insider, a site devoted to Apple news which first reported on the new webpage, noted that Apple's prior participation in Black Friday Deals was by extending \"conservative sale prices\" on select products, including iPads and Macs. In 2013, the company resorted to bundling gift cards as a way to scale back. Apple skipped the event entirely in 2015. (See also, How Will Trump's Policies on China Impact U.S. Business? ) \nThe iPhone and iPad-maker, which consistently ranks as one of the most valuable brand in the world, has the luxury of knowing that its products sell themselves, even at high markups. As to why it has opted back into Black Friday this year? This could be a way to boost sales at its Apple Store app and introduce new shoppers to its services. In the past, Apple has touted its app store as the \"fastest way to shop our one-day event.\" \nWhat's more, Apple has unveiled several new products this year. In addition to the new Apple Watch, Apple has refreshed its entire line of MacBook computers, iPhone 7, Air Pods and a host of accessories. Apple may decide to use this year's Black Friday Deals as a way to unload existing inventory of prior-generation products. And if it can generate revenue and profits without resorting to write-downs, it's a win-win all around.

Samsung’s foldable phone concepts have been around for years at trade shows, so we already knew the South Korean giant has been working on such devices — in fact, Samsung is currently deciding whether to go forward with a 2017 launch for a folding smartphone. Apple’s similar plans, however, are much more secretive. \nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nArtist turns old Macs into awesome plant pots You can now catch Ditto in Pokemon Go T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen ",

Photo: Reuters \nBeijing: Two years ago, Oppo and Vivo couldn’t crack the top five in China’s smartphone market. Now they’re on top after elbowing Apple aside, thanks to people like Cheng Xiaoning. \nCheng runs a thriving electronics store in the rural town of Miaoxia, tapping into her WeChat social media account to promote the brands that pay the biggest commission, and in her case that’s Oppo and Vivo. While such payments start at about 40 yuan ($6), they escalate for more expensive handsets and reach almost 200 yuan for Oppo’s high-end smartphones. \n“That’s why I like to introduce the Oppo R9 Plus to potential customers,” she said. “Business has been perfect, actually never been better.” \nCheng and tens of thousands of like-minded boosters form the vanguard of the pair’s charge against Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Working with the local stores that dominate sales in China’s far-flung provinces, Oppo and Vivo came out of nowhere to upend the industry order and squeeze out former local darling Xiaomi Corp. Their labels graced one out of every three smartphones sold within China in the third quarter, while the iPhone’s market share at 7% stood at its lowest in almost three years. \nOppo and Vivo trace their origins to reclusive billionaire Duan Yong Ping and employ similar strategies. That includes harnessing the spending power of rural customers away from top-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. It’s where Apple’s vulnerable given the iPhone’s lofty price tag. They eschewed e-commerce to instead court the stores where three-quarters of smartphone sales take place. Apple has been more reluctant to relinquish the retail experience to local free-agents, who sometimes charge brands for in-store displays and posters. \n“Oppo and Vivo are willing to share their profit with local sales. The reward was an extremely active and loyal nationwide sales network,” said Jin Di, an IDC analyst based in Beijing. While they declined to detail their subsidy program, she estimates the two were the top spenders in the past year. “They’re doing something different -- they do local marketing.” \nChina had for years driven Apple’s and Samsung’s growth. The US company generated almost $59 billion of sales from the region in fiscal 2015, which was more than double the level just two years earlier. During that time its shares surged more than 60%. At its peak, Greater China yielded almost 30% of its revenue and Apple was neck-and-neck with Xiaomi for the mantle of market leader as users clamoured for the larger iPhone 6 models. Even as the domestic economy began to sputter, chief executive officer Tim Cook spent a good chunk of an earnings call last year talking up the country’s promise, saying Apple’s investing there “for the decades ahead.” \nThen the country’s slowdown and regulatory tangles took their toll. Authorities intervened, blocking iTunes Movies and iBooks, ending a period of near-unimpeded growth in the country. But perhaps most crucial was the ascendancy of cheaper but just-as-good local alternatives. Oppo and Vivo’s gains have come mainly at the expense of lower-tier names thus far, but if they climb further into the premium segment, the US company will need an answer. Some think the 10th-anniversary iPhone due in 2017 could deliver. \n“Apple needs to offer something cutting-edge to appeal to maturing Chinese smartphone users,” Counterpoint Research director Neil Shah writes. Oppo and Vivo can use the time until then to cement their positions, he said. \nTogether Oppo and Vivo shipped about 40 million smartphones in the third quarter, about 34% of devices sold in the world’s biggest market, according to IDC. In 2012, their combined share was about 2.5%. IPhone shipments plunged more than a third to 8.2 million during the period—less than half of Vivo’s. Samsung, which once led the market, now settles for roughly 5 percent, according to Counterpoint. \nAs Apple has faltered in China, Cook has stepped up his courtship of decision-makers. He visited the country several times this year, unveiled plans for research centers in Beijing and Shenzhen, and invested $1 billion in Uber rival Didi Chuxing. Cook said on his last earnings call he remains confident of a return to growth this quarter. \nSamsung declined to comment for this story, while Apple didn’t respond to requests for comment. \nIt’s unclear how Apple can reclaim lost ground in the interim. Previous attempts to drift down-market -- with the iPhone 5c and SE, for instance -- fizzled as local users shunned seemingly inferior devices. Apple doesn’t run a vibrant online social community for users the way some of its local rivals do. And competing on price will jeopardize the industry’s fattest profit margins. \nOppo and Vivo pack high-end specs into a phone that sells for a fraction of its rival’s in China, where iPhone 7s start at 5,388 ($784). Consider the Oppo R9 plus: for 2,999 yuan, buyers get an aluminum body, 6-inch display, 16-megapixel camera and a battery that claims 19 hours of calls, photo and web browsing. Vivo’s high-end Xplay6, with a price tag of 4,498 yuan, also undercuts Apple. \n“Both companies invested heavily in marketing,” said Nicole Peng, Asia Pacific research director at consultancy Canalys. Oppo and Vivo have a strong grip on the middle market for phones from $200 to $500, she said. “Their offline channel strategy paid off.” \nThe man who’s clobbering Apple started out low on the tech spectrum. Duan made his fortune selling DVD players, telephones and game consoles similar to Nintendo’s. Bubugao Communication Equipment Co. Ltd., the parent of Vivo, emerged from a restructuring in 1999 that split his company. The billionaire later teamed with long-time colleague Tony Chen and others to found what came to be known as Guangdong Oppo Electronics Co. \nWhile Duan has kept a low profile since moving to the US in 2001, he occasionally makes his way into the spotlight. In 2006, he bid a then-record $620,100 to have lunch with Warren Buffett. Oppo’s first smartphone came in 2011, when it unveiled a device with a BlackBerry-like keyboard. The same year, Bubugao created the business that would become Vivo. \nToday, Vivo touts its cameras and Oppo focuses on rapid-charging and battery life. But their offline strategies remain the same: mobilizing tens of thousands of private shop owners. Oppo said it sells its products through roughly 240,000 privately owned stores as of June -- six times the global count of McDonald’s. Vivo manages about half that, said Jin. Oppo, which doesn’t disclose sales figures, said about 90 percent of its phones were sold offline. \nWhile Xiaomi shot to international prominence with flash online promotions, that success has been concentrated in densely packed cities. That doesn’t work so well in the countryside, where novice buyers want advice and demonstrations. By cultivating a physical network, Oppo and Vivo are building a platform difficult to replicate in the short run. \nApple, in contrast, has fewer than 40 stores across the country, most of which are in large cities. While its retail network is lauded for helping weave an aura of exclusivity and chic around its higher-priced gadgets, Chinese consumers—particularly in smaller, poorer cities—value access to someone local who can work out kinks. That sort of after-sales support is in itself a powerful marketing tool, IDC’s Jin said. \nFor now, neither Oppo nor Vivo appear overly concerned with the world’s most valuable company. Their executives say they’ll stick to their winning strategies, while exploring ways to keep pushing the smartphone envelope. \n“We have to keep our minds clear in the fast-changing market,” said Allen Wu, Oppo’s vice-president in charge of sales. “All we need to do is to keep our heads down and make the correct moves.” \nTo Vivo, that means targeting younger users with higher-performance devices. “Camera and music will be our key focuses in the future. We are seeing greater customer expectations out of these two areas,” company vice-president Ni Xudong said. \nThat message resonates with the likes of Chen Siyu, an accountant who uses her Vivo phone at least four hours a day to chat with friends, watch videos and apply for jobs. \n“I chose Vivo because of its design and photographing capability,” said the 26-year-old who lives in the town of Pu’tian in Fujian. “It is not expensive and doesn’t slow down after longtime use like many Android phones do.” Bloomberg",

      "text": "UC Berkeley alumnus and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak speaks at Berkeley startup institute Timothy Dawson/Staff First annual Silicon Valley Comic Con celebrates fandom \nUC Berkeley alumnus and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak returned to Berkeley on Monday to speak of his personal philosophies as an engineer , a startup founder and a liberal . \nDuring the event, Wozniak met with more than 300 student s, hackers and entrepreneurs at The House, a startup institute located across the street from campus on Bancroft Way, which aims to support students by turning their ideas into businesses through f unding and work space . \n“(Wozniak) has been incredibly generous with his time tonight … He really wanted to come back because it’s Berkeley,” said Cameron Baradar, co-founder of The House , at the event. “It’s people like Woz and other Cal alums who … help the next generation — which is all of us here — be successful.” \nDespite The House’s mission though, Wozniak said he had decided early on in life never to be a founder, as he was not fond of commanding others . He noted, however, that he was lucky and privileged to achieve a level of excellence in designing computers –– something that he hadn’t thought he would have a job in. \n“Me, I just want to be recognized by engineers as doing things so clever that no other engineers did them that way,” Wozniak said at the event. \nHe cited in particular an anecdote of a TV disruption device he had built during his college years in order to trick fellow students into fixing a dormitory television as he alternately jammed the TV signal. \n“Fun, fun, fun –– always incorporate fun with work was my big model,” Wozniak said at the event. \nTo aspiring startup founders, Wozniak said that instead of trying to understand what “people out there” want in a product, they should create products that are perfect for themselves. The Tesla automobile and iPhone are examples of products that have succeeded using this philosophy, he said. While ideas occur everywhere in the world, Wozniak emphasized that a successful startup consists of those who actually sit down and turn ideas into reality. \nWozniak also spoke of his endorsement of liberalism, saying that he loves Berkeley as a liberal-minded campus where thinking is free and unlimited. \nAccording to Wozniak, he had been a self-proclaimed liberal at the time Apple first went public . A gainst “anything money,” he had opposed the pooling of wealth around the company’s three co-founders. \n“I said, wait a minute, we were founders but there’s all these little guys … giving me encouragement at a computer club before Steve Jobs even knew computers existed,” Wozniak said at the event, “Why aren’t they called founders? Because they didn’t get their names on a certain piece of paper .” \nWozniak, as a result, claimed that he had given away $20 million worth of stocks in today’s value to five people, and another $20 million to 80 people at Apple “ so that they can each get a house out of the deal.” \nFei Wade , campus freshman said that she relates with the innovative thinking of Wozniak. As an Environmental Economics and Policy major , she said that the only way to move forward in creating more sustainable business practices is to adopt this kind of innovative thinking. \nSimilarly, campus sophomore Amit Talreja said he, like Wozniak, aspires to create for the sake of creation — just to explore and learn new things. \n“(Designing computers) was my love in life,” Wozniak said at the event. “Something you do when you don’t get anything for it.” Contact Charlene Jin   @CharleneJin0327  ",

      "text": "Apple may be all about diversity on the surface, but the numbers show that the company hasn’t made strides in becoming more diverse over the last year — its leadership is still overwhelmingly comprised of white men.\nApple has released new data showing that the company’s high-ranking employees are made up of a higher percentage of white men than the rest of the company. Only 20 of Apple’s 107 executives are women, and only 5 of those executives are members of a minority group. Those numbers are pretty much unchanged from a year ago.\nMore: Microsoft to begin rewarding executives for diversity hiring\nOne layer down, things get a little better — but not by much. While women made up 27 percent of management, 65 percent of those managers are white, 23 percent Asian, and 11 percent from other minority groups. This data comes from a form called the EEO-1, which companies must file with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\nApple, along with a number of other companies, has pledged to boost diversity, and has said in the past that increased diversity isn’t just good for society, but also makes sense from a business perspective. While these numbers aren’t that great, Apple says that the data on them does not reflect how the company breaks down its workforce internally, nor how it measures its diversity.\nApple does seem to be moving in the right direction, even if its changes are small — the company’s new hires were 37 percent women and 27 percent underrepresented minorities. Microsoft, on the other hand, seems to be moving in the wrong direction — the company’s latest reports showed that the number of women at Microsoft has declined for the second year in a row. Microsoft blames layoffs in its phone division.\nMicrosoft to begin rewarding executives for diversity hiring Apple Car rumor roundup: Here’s all you need to know about ‘Project Titan’ Some of the biggest names in tech just signed the Equal Pay Pledge",

      "text": "Segment leader Apple has a 43.6% share of the U.S. smartphone market . Android has hit nearly 90% market share globally . Where does Microsoft fit into this equation? Flickr \nMicrosoft (NSDQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NSDQ:GOOGL) are the two companies that burnt their fingers big time in trying to go the Apple way to become hardware+software companies, but by taking the acquisition route. As a result, both companies were forced to write off billions of dollars after their Nokia and Motorola acquisitions, respectively, did nothing to cement their respective positions in the smartphone world. But despite the setbacks, both the companies have been extremely reluctant to throw in the towel when it comes to hardware. So how will Microsoft's journey here be? And why an investor of Microsoft stock should know about it. Here's why. Google and Microsoft in the Smartphone Fray \nAlphabet, Google’s parent company, recently launched Google Pixel, its first ever self-branded smartphone, in the high-end luxury smartphone category to square off with iPhone. The Pixel’s price point is a good indication of which segment the company wants to target. \nSource: Tomsguide \nOn the other side, Microsoft has slowly been building its Surface device portfolio in the last few years and has lot of plans for the future as well. \nBut why would Microsoft and Google, after losing money and face in the smartphone battle, refuse to let go of their hardware ambitions? The one-word answer to that is Apple. As long as Apple remains as the one company that can successfully create software and match it with even better hardware, it will be extremely hard to stop them. Despite the state of the smartphone market, Apple remains on top of the smartphone heap in the core market of the United States. \nSource: comScore \nThat might change when more data comes out next January, but neither Google nor Microsoft will have a place on that list for at least the next couple of years. \nAlso Read: MSFT Stock: Can A Rejuvenated Microsoft Corporation(MSFT) Match Apple Inc.(AAPL) The Challenge ahead of Google \nThe problem for Google right now are the third party smartphone manufacturers who are carrying the weight of Android on their shoulders. The software is an excellent piece of work, and if they want, companies can customize it for their own need - it's free and there is no other competitor in the marketplace that comes near it. Android is fast approaching a penetration of more than 90% of smartphones in the world, and it is only bound to grow from here as emerging market smartphone sales zoom upward in the next few years. \nBut what happens if somebody like Samsung builds its own mobile OS, keep improving it for the next five years and suddenly decides to give it to other manufacturers as well. Being a mobile phone manufacturer, it might seem like a farfetched idea but you never know for sure, as there are other benefits that can come along its way if the company takes that route. It’s a hypothetical example, but not something that’s impossible to imagine. Samsung has already made a start with Tizen OS and, even though they haven’t seen the kind of traction they would like with that operating system, let’s not forget that it is, after all, an open-source application. Besides, as of last year, they’ve already overtaken BlackBerry as the fourth largest OS platform in the world. \n“ According to the latest published report from our Wireless Smartphone Strategies (WSS) services: Global Smartphone OS Market Share by Region : Q3 2015 , Android registered a slight year-on-year increase in market share, while Apple gained traction, driven by strong demand for new iPhone models. Microsoft, BlackBerry and Firefox drifted down, while Tizen posted tangible growth and overtook BlackBerry being the fourth largest OS platform for the first time ever.” Apple’s Immunity in the Smartphone Market \nBut no matter who does what, Apple and its iPhone sales will keep chugging along like a freight train. Yes, they may have lost the maglev-train-like speed they had in the past, but they are going to keep pulling full steam ahead for many years to come - even if only because they have to do it until they build up their services portfolio and revenues to keep them on top. Regardless, disruption of their sales channel is not as easy as disrupting Android’s stranglehold. \nAlso Read: Microsoft Corporation: Wait For A Pullback To Go Long Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Focusing on Microsoft’s Mobile Push \nThe reasons are more or less the same for Microsoft, but it’s more of a future game of survival. PC sales have gone down the tubes and may never recover to glory days, which means good times are more or less over for its multi-billion-dollar earner Windows as well as the mobile version, which has an extremely small presence in the mobile phone segment. The one shot they have to get Windows back into the mobility game is if they can keep improving their numbers in the smartphone market and, if that is not possible, at least in the tablet segment. \nThe real problem for Microsoft is that if they stop making hardware now, they will be back to square one. It’s going to be very difficult for them to convince phone makers to adopt Windows 10 the way Alcatel has done . They’re encouraging Lumia users currently on Windows 8.1 Denim to upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, but that’s a very small segment of the market. An Investor’s POV \nFor Microsoft, it is an extremely long road ahead - and one that may never yield results - but the company isn’t going to give up that easily. Their Surface line of products is picking up pace, and there are even rumors of a Surface Phone soon to hit the market. If they can push this agenda consistently for the next several years, they may finally be able to eat into iOS and Android market share. How long will that take? Maybe ten years, maybe twenty. But it looks like they’re ready to ride it out no matter how long it takes. \nAs an investor, you’re definitely looking at one of the longest shots possible. However, Microsoft has given us a lot of reasons to invest in their future - the least of which is their possible future success in the smartphone market. Their cloud infrastructure is growing at a rapid pace, as you saw in my coverage of their most recent quarterly earnings , and overall growth has once again started at Microsoft. \nYou’re not going to find Microsoft’s mobile push as a reason to invest in the company, at least not for the next several years. But the question is, do you really need it to be? \nInvesting in tech stocks? Check out Amigobulls' top stock picks from the technology sector, which have beaten the NASDAQ by over 112%.

      "text": "It turns out that Samsung isn’t the only company working on a foldable smartphone, as Apple is also toying with that idea. Samsung’s foldable phone concepts have been around for years at trade shows, so we already knew the South Korean giant has been working on such devices — in fact, Samsung is currently deciding whether to go forward with a 2017 launch for a folding smartphone. Apple’s similar plans, however, are much more secretive.\nDON’T MISS: HTC just unveiled one of the best Android phones of 2016, but you can’t have one\nApple applied for a patent on Flexible display devices all the way back in mid-July 2014. On Tuesday, the USPTO finally awarded that patent to the iPhone maker (that’s US Patent No. 9,504,170, first discovered by Apple Insider ).\nView photos\napple-foldable-iphone-patent-1 More The document describes exactly what you’d expect: mobile devices that have flexible displays. Apple’s work explains how the two parts of a foldable device would be coupled, the proposed hinge technologies, and the flexible OLED display that would be needed for such a smartphone. In an interesting twist, the user of such a product would even be able to attach it to his or her clothing.\nApple imagined a modern flip phone that can operate both in candybar and clamshell mode.\nView photos\napple-foldable-iphone-patent-2 More Each side of the flip phone would contain specific internal components, including cameras, speakers, light sensors, and display controllers for the upper half, while the bottom part would house the CPU, GPU, vibration motor, microphones, and other parts.\nView photos\napple-foldable-iphone-patent-3 More The two sides would communicate with the help of flexible printed circuit boards and a hinge mechanism would let the user rotate the sides to the desired position. Two-hinge designs are also described in the patent.\nInterestingly, the device could fold both to hide the display and protect it from external elements, but also to show part of the display so that the user could interact with it.\nView photos\napple-foldable-iphone-patent-4 More A foldable iPhone probably isn’t coming anytime soon, of course. Apple is working on an iPhone redesign for next year that will mark the beginning of Apple’s move to OLED smartphone displays. This foldable display patent is more evidence of Apple’s long-time interest in OLED technology.\nAlso of note, the patent suggests that Apple is exploring this particular type of technology for other Apple devices, including the iPad and even the MacBook.\nTrending right now:\nArtist turns old Macs into awesome plant pots You can now catch Ditto in Pokemon Go T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Every time someone asks Apple CEO Tim Cook when the company’s next new products are coming, Cook assures them they’re just around the corner. It’s just that Apple, to maintain its competitive edge, refuses to tip its hand.\nWhen Apple announced its quarterly earnings last month, one analyst asked whether the company was in “a gap period” in which new products aren’t quite ready. “We have the strongest pipeline that we’ve ever had, and we’re really confident about the things in it,” Cook replied. “But as usual, we’re not going to talk about what’s ahead.” Another asked why the Cupertino, Calif. firm’s research and development spending had more than doubled in three years, growing much more quickly than revenue. Cook would only say that some of that spending would go to products in development.\nFor some, Cook’s discreet act is starting to look old. Apple released the iPod in 2001, the iPhone six years later and the iPad three years after that. All three have defined or redefined their markets in ways that the Apple Watch or Apple TV haven’t. It’s coming up on seven years since the iPad was unveiled, and Apple doesn’t seem to have its next big hit ready for showtime.\nFor investors, this is leading to impatience — and worry. Apple recently posted its first annual revenue decline in 15 years. Its stock is down 6% over the past year, despite paying investors $12 billion in dividends and $29 billion in stock buybacks. By contrast, the Nasdaq Composite is up 5%. And Apple’s longtime rival Microsoft is up an even more impressive 13%.\nFindTheCompany | Graphiq Under Steve Jobs, Apple became the corporate equivalent of Hank Aaron, a champion slugger. Five years into the Tim Cook era, Apple has managed some decent base hits, but it’s coming up short on homers. The company is far from broken, posting quarterly revenue of $46.9 billion in the most recent period. But that figure, impressive in a vacuum, marked a nearly 10% drop year-over year. And the iPhone, which makes up nearly two thirds of Apple’s revenue, saw revenue decline by 12% last fiscal year. The company synonymous with Silicon Valley innovation is now in need of a major hit.\n“The cracks are showing in the Apple wall of invulnerability,” Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Andrew Uerkwitz wrote in a research note this week. He predicts the iPhone’s next release will offer “one last ‘growth’ hurrah.” And then? “Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise,” Uerkwitz said, arguing that Apple lacks the courage to lead in growth areas like artificial intelligence (AI) and the cloud.\nRead more: Review: Apple finally brings touch to the MacBook Pro \nOther analysts have expressed similar worries, though few of them so bluntly. Still others jumped to Apple’s defense. “I think they’re making a big mistake,” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said of Apple’s doubters. Technology analyst Horace Dediu, speaking at an investment conference, said that Apple has been de-emphasizing the notion it’s a hit-driven business, an expectation that has overshadowed its success in other areas.\nApple’s defenders can make a strong case. Revenue from services such as music streaming and Apple’s mobile app store grew by 22% in its last fiscal year, more than doubling the growth rate of fiscal 2015. Apple’s Other Products category, which includes the Apple Watch, Apple TV and Beats audio products, grew by 11%. Products that saw revenue decline, like the iPhone and MacBooks, recently received significant upgrades that will likely boost revenue in coming quarters.\nThere are also signs that Apple could unveil new products over the next year or so that could bring in new sources of revenue, if not replicate the iPhone’s smashing success. Apple is reportedly working on digital glasses that connect to an iPhone and display images through augmented reality. Some technology leaders, including Apple’s Cook , believe augmented reality will be bigger than virtual reality.\nHealth care is another area of potential growth for Apple. By building on its health apps and devices like the Apple Watch and iPhone, “Apple is on the cusp of playing a larger role in the healthcare industry,” Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a research note. That would put Apple in a unique position “to better monitor their health and interact with medical professionals in a seamless way relative to current methods.”\nBut there are also recent moves that support the Apple skeptics. The first MacBook Pro redesign in four years received lukewarm reviews, with some calling it “a step forward and a step back” and others concluding Apple was “shooting for a future it can’t quite reach.” Apple is also delaying shipments of its wireless AirPods and backing out of making products like routers and monitors . And it’s scaled back its automotive ambitions, too.\nCook has told investors Apple’s innovation pipeline is as healthy as its ever been. If so, the bigger questions are when new products will arrive, and how impressive they’ll be. The spirit of skepticism embraced by many on Wall Street is lowering the bar of expectations. If and when Cook does deliver a home run, it will catch many by surprise.",

      "text": "| Topic: Hardware \nPresident-elect Donald Trump pledged that he would \"get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China,\" and now he's put this to Apple CEO Tim Cook. See also: Could Trump be the catalyst for an all-American iPhone? \nAccording to a transcript in the New York Times , Trump had this to say: \"Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here.\" \nCook offered an abrupt response: \"I understand that.\" \nTrump went on to discuss possible tax incentives that might be in the pipeline: \"I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about.\" \nAccording to Jason Dedrick, a professor at the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University, shifting the assembly to the US would add $30 to $40 to the overall cost, partly down to increased labor costs, but also because of increased transportation and logistics overheads.",

      "text": "Read Comments \nApple may well have cultivated a reputation for being one of the companies most committed to user privacy, but that doesn't mean there aren't a few cracks in its security efforts. \nAs first reported by The Intercept , Russian security firm Elcomsoft has revealed that Apple's handsets automatically store users' call history to the firm's iCloud servers, if iCloud is enabled. \nHowever, it seems the information goes to the servers without the user being notified in many cases, with a list of calls made and received, call duration, phone numbers, and dates and times all being stored on the cloud servers for up to four months. \nRelated: iPhone 7 review \nWhat's more, Elcomsoft says that FaceTime calls, whether audio or video, are also logged to iCloud automatically, \nThe security firm believes the storage of both standard and Facetime calls dates back to at least iOS 8.2, launched in March last year. \nThose who have upgraded to iOS 10, released earlier this year, will also have data from third-party apps stored on the cloud, including Voice over IP apps such as Skype and WhatsApp. \nApple told iMore that it supports “call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. \n\"...Device data is encrypted with a user's passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user's Apple ID and password.\" \nRelated: Best Black Friday deals uk \nEarlier this year the company was involved in a high-profile dispute with the FBI, which wanted Apple to provide access to the San Bernardino shooter's iPhone. \nApple, which doesn't maintain a system for accessing individual users' phones, refused to comply with the request, citing security concerns over the creation of a key or backdoor that could be used for nefarious purposed should it fall into the wrong hands. \nIn the case of the iCloud call logs, law enforcement agencies could gain access through the use of a court order , though, as The Intercept notes, they would still need a tool to 'extract and parse' the data. \nElcomsoft has updated its Phone Breaker software to enable extraction of the iCloud call logs as long as the user's individual account details are available. \nThe firm is used by law enforcement agencies and leases some of its extraction code to Cellebrite – a company used by the FBI to access seized phones. \nRelated: Best Amazon Black Friday deals UK \nThose with access to Elcomsoft's software could potentially access the call history of any iPhone user, even if the account details are unavailable as an authentication token also enables extraction of the data. \nFollowing the 2014 leak of nude celebrity photos, which hackers reportedly stole from the celebrities' iCloud accounts, concerns over cloud storage security have been at an all-time high. \nIn the case of call history storage, the issue arises from the fact that users aren't notified about their data being stored to the cloud. \nSome may well opt for the service if they had the choice, but at this point there doesn't seem to be any way for iPhone owners to turn the automatic cloud storage off, short of shutting down their iCloud service altogether. \nApple doesn't mention the the storage of call history data on its iCloud security and privacy overview , though it is mentioned in its security white paper from May of this year – but most users are unlikely to have read that document. \nFor now, if you don't want your call history to be logged on the cloud, your only choice is to shut off iCloud altogether. Hopefully Apple will soonissue an update to iOS 10 that allows for granular control of the feature. \nWATCH: iPhone 7 review \nLet us know your thoughts on the news in the comments. 0 shares",

      "text": "Is your iPhone 6S randomly shutting down? Apple may owe you a new battery.\nThe company said this week in a post on its website that some iPhone 6S owners are eligible for a free battery replacement because their phones unexpectedly cut their power even when they have enough charge. Apple did not offer many details on why the phones are shutting down, except to say that the problem is “not a safety issue” and that it affects a “very small number” of phones.\nA look at Apple’s support forums suggests that people have been reporting similar problems since at least 2015; users said their phones shut off and could not be restarted until they were plugged in again.\nThe replacement program was announced shortly after a state-approved consumer-protection group in China — a key market for Apple — asked the iPhone maker to address reports that some phones shut off even when their indicators said the phones were charged more than halfway. The Chinese Consumers Association said the issue affected the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6S, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nOnly iPhone 6S phones made between September and October 2015 are included in the program. Smartphone owners who have been having this problem should take their phones to an Apple Store or authorized repair shops to get the official replacement.",

      "text": "Apple makes deal to bring Apple Music to Indian ride-hailing company’s cars By Dan Pye ● 24 minutes ago \nApple has partnered with Indian ride-hailing company Ola to provide Apple Music as “part of the in-car experience,” The Los Angeles Times reports. The service will be integrated with the company’s Ola Play platform, which also features options from Sony, Qualcomm and Audio Compass. Spotify has had a similar deal in place with Uber since 2014, allowing passengers to control music in the car through the app on their smartphone. The Ola deal is Apple’s second foray into the ride-hailing world, following a $1 billion investment in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing earlier this year.",

      "text": "Apple announces it will take part in this year's Black Friday The company sat out last year's event on Nov 23, 2016, 9:30 AM TechSpot \nBlack Friday hasn’t been a big deal for Apple these last couple of years. The best it could offer in 2014 was free iTunes gift cards when purchasing certain products, and last year the company sat out the event altogether. But in two days time, it will return to the famous annual sale. \nA new page on the company's website teases the upcoming deals with the message: “Friday can’t come soon enough.” It invites people to \"come back this Friday to check everyone off your list.\" \nThere are no details about what might be on offer, but the fact the ad features an Apple Watch means Apple’s wearables range could see some discounts. There are also promotions for the company’s free two-day delivery on items ordered before 5 pm, the Apple Store app, and the “find a store” feature so customers can check their local outlet’s extended opening times. \nFurther down the new page is a section that directs visitors to holiday gift collections from Apple, including music gifts, photography gifts, games and toys, and Apple gifts, which contain products such as the iPad Pro and MacBook. There’s also a link for people to buy Apple Store gift cards . \nExplaining the company's decision not to take part in last year's Black Friday, Apple’s SVP of Retail and Online Stores, Angela Ahrendts, said: “Being good to your employees will always be good for business.” \nIf you do plan on heading out to an Apple Store for the shopping event, you’ll probably want to set off early; expect them to be even busier than most places on the day. Hopefully, Apple will have some deep discounts available that make enduring the crowds worthwhile. Related Reads",

      "text": "0 iPhone smartphones are no longer enough: Which ideas Apple could follow to continue grow year-on-year? REUTERS/Thomas Peter \nWhich is the future of Apple? After the Cupertino tech company announced its first annual decline in profits from 2001, this question is floating on analysts and experts' minds. Fourteen years of growth but the time has come: Apple must find another cash cow to milk, otherwise its revenues will continue to go down. \nBut Apple is already preparing the field for the post-iPhone era, when its flagship phone sales will no longer be enough. And this future won’t be hardware-only : Software will be fundamental for Apple in the years ahead, in a market where it’s increasingly difficult to sell smartphones, tablets and computers in huge volumes. \nSERVICES ALREADY VALUED MORE THAN IPAD TABLETS AND MAC PCS \nThe last financial statement highlighted an important fact: Apple’s services represents 13% of total revenues or $6.3 billion. This number is more than what iPad or Mac generated individually, respectively 9% and 12% during last quarter. This category includes services like Apple Music and iCloud. But it’s still a small effort, especially considering Microsoft and Amazon services business. “Intelligent Cloud” Microsoft division, for example, generated $6.4 billion during last quarter thanks in most part to Azure, its cloud service for enterprises. \nOne example of what Apple could do next is related to autonomous vehicles. According to Bloomberg , Apple has put aside the development of a self-driving car but didn’t abandon this ambition: “Dozens” of engineers have been moved to work on the software autonomous car are based on . Many are engineers that worked on BlackBerry’s QNX. \nAccording to what has been reported, one of the projects Apple is working on is a heads-up display that could be implemented in future cars. This interface could then be voice-controlled using Siri, the well-know iOS and macOS digital assistant. \nTim Cook, Apple CEO. His hardest challenge is to make Apple less iPhone-dependent REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nAlso, Apple is apparently testing driving simulation software using a virtual and mixed reality device . Both are field that the Cupertino company is interested in: Self-driving vehicles and virtual and augmented reality. \nThe latter will probably be Apple’s choice. Many companies see mixed reality as a huge opportunity to improve productivity while virtual reality is still a home entertainment affair. In September, Apple CEO Tim Cook told about AR : “My own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far” because “[it] gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present, talking to each other, but also have other things - visually - for both of us to see”. A point of view shared by other companies, such as Microsoft, that during its October 26th event presented again its HoloLens headset, based on Windows 10. \nRecently, there have been talks about AR features in iOS Camera app coming next year. The app could use Snapchat-like filter, automatically recognize people faces and provide on-screen information about nearby restaurant and other commercial activities (pubs, shops, malls) when pointing the camera to the street. \nTHE HUGE OPPORTUNITY OF HEALTHCARE \nA field in which Apple is already investing a lot is healthcare. Everybody who used an iPad, iPod or iPhone in the last few years knows that the Health app is one of the most complex and personal health database you can have on a smartphone or tablet. It is not as user-friendly as Google Fit or FitBit app, but you can put any kind of data: the last time you had sex (and if you’re female, it will tell you the day of your next period), what you eat, your weekly workout routine, your oxygen saturation, your heartbeat, your electrodermal activity and so on. \nApple Watch has been a huge step into the healthcare business: A device that keeps monitorig yout heartbeat REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach \nYou can have your personal medical record on your smartphone everywhere you go. Apple Watch was the first big step in this direction. The watch monitors your heartbeat every moment and can literally save lives: In August 2015 a man from Alberta, Canada wasn’t feeling well. He checked its Apple Watch screen: His pulse escalated to 210. He was on the verge of having an heart attack but was able to call an ambulance just in time. \nA year later, he told The Sun : “They told me that if I had gone home and gone to bed - as many people do - I would likely have had another, more serious bout in the middle of the night. Those second attacks are the ones that kill. That is a common problem”. A smartwatch have saved his life. It could also have been another watch: Samsung Gear S2 or Huawei Watch. \nBut Apple has been working for years on this field . Since when it launched Health app, during every presentation, Apple talks about HealthKit , a platform developers can use to integrate their health apps in Apple’s own app. The Cupertino company is already developing and supporting an ecosystem of health apps that any iOS or watchOS supported device could run. Apple promotes ResearchKit too that it describes as an “an open source framework that enables your iOS app to become a powerful tool for medical research”. It’s open source and it can help health studies and researchers. \nAt the begin of 2016, Apple bought Gliimpse , a technology company that works in healthcare business that developed a platform where everyone can upload and share its health data. A data-tracking tool Apple can use to evolve its health ecosystem of services and products. \nWhich is the extent of the healthcare business? Telemedicine, for example, is expected to reach a value of $36.2 billion in 2020 according to the Physician 2016 Report . The number of patients using telemedicine services will grow from 350,000 in 2013 to 7 million in 2018. And Apple devices could be the source of all the data you need for your visit. It is a huge opportunity. Even a small stake in this market for the company could mean big bucks without leaving its current core business: Hardware and software will integrate in a bigger health platform. \nHARDWARE WILL STILL BE FUNDAMENTAL \nApple has no intention to abandon the business that, since its foundation, has made it popular and the most-valued company in the world. The last rumors are clear: iPhone 8, due in 2017, will be a revolutionary project. This time the company wants to prevent leaks ((but it probably won’t) that could anticipate too much about the device features and specifications. For this to happen, it’s working on the next iPhone in a R&D centre in Israel according to Business Insider . \nA japanese girl tries the new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in an Apple Store in Tokyo REUTERS/Issei Kato \nAn anonymous worker said that Apple will not use “iPhone 7s” name to better highlight the generation leap . Some of expected iPhone 8 specifications are: OLED edge-to-edge screen and glass rear panel but just for the \"Plus\" model. Also, it could use a 5.8\" display, larger than the current 5.5\" inch. The \"standard\" model could also accomodate a larger display: from 4.7\" to 5\" according to the rumors . \nOther signs that Apple is not going to abandon its hardware business are related to MacBook laptops. In 2018, the physical keyboard could see a huge redesign: It could use Sonder Design e-ink technology. Thanks to this digital mechanism, the most part of the keys could change according to the apps on screen (similar to the MacBook Pro 2016 Touch Bar); it could change its layout if the user is writing in another language, for example, or show emoji if he is chatting on a social network. \nApple can consider many options for its future. Self-driving cars, augmented and virtual reality and healthcare are good ideas to diversify its business, trying to stay on top. iPhone phones could no longer be a solid business like they were years ago, but Apple is far from being out of the game .",

      "text": "By Debbie Lord Cox Media Group National Content Desk \nIn a move that has surprised some, Apple has announced they will be offering Black Friday deals on its iPhone 7. \nWhile Apple has not been one to go in for Black Friday gimmicks in the past, this year shoppers are likely to see bargains on a range of the company’s products. Apple announced on its website that for a limited time on Black Friday it would be offering deals on various Apple products. \nRetailers have some special deals on iPhone 7, in particular. At Target, you can buy an iPhone 7 with no money out-of-pocket when you activate the phone with Sprint, Verizon or AT&T installment or leasing plans. \nBest Buy , Target , and Walmart are all offering up to $250 in gift cards when you purchase an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus on an eligible device payment plan, according to Macrumors.com. \nT-Mobile is reviving its trade-in offer where you can trade in an older iPhone to get a free or discounted iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. According to the T-Mobile website, if you trade in an iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, or iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, or Note 5, customers can get a 32GB iPhone 7 for free. \nWith the trade-in of those phones, a 32GB iPhone 7 Plus costs $100, with the exception of a Galaxy S7 Edge or an iPhone 7 Plus trade-in, which drops the price to zero. T-Mobile's Black Friday deals will start on Thursday at 12:01 a.m. (PT) – 3:01 a.m. (ET) – and will run through Sunday at 11:59 p.m. (PT) – 2:59 a.m. (ET). \nAt Walmart, there are no discounts on iPhones, but you do get a $250 gift card with a purchase on an eligible iPhone. They are also offering the iPhoe 5s for $99, but you must purchase a Straight Talk wireless plan to get that price. \n ",

      "text": "Mike Murphy 1 hour ago \nAfter years of waiting, Apple has finally released a new MacBook Pro model, just in time for the holidays. But if you’re thinking of getting one or planning to give one as a gift, there’s just one more thing that you’ll probably have to consider. \nApple’s newest laptops, the somewhat underwhelming MacBook Pro and MacBook, eschew any inputs that aren’t USB-C ports or headphone jacks. That means every laptop accessory you have—printer, external monitor, ethernet connection, external hard drive, etc.—probably won’t work with a new Mac. You’ll need an adapter. \nPerhaps Apple appreciates that it’s making customers buy so many adapters: The company recently lowered the price on all of them. But even if you’re willing to spend hundreds of dollars stocking up on every adapter available (probably overkill?), you’d be left with a bundle of cables that have to go wherever you and your laptop do. \nThere’s a simpler solution: Get a USB-C hub. There are many available options that include multiple regular USB ports, HDMI ports, and SD-card readers, and they’ll save you the hassle of having to carry around a snake’s nest of cables. Which one? It can be difficult to choose a brand, so I asked the internet. The Wirecutter ‘s Nick Guy offered up two recommendations : \nFor a hub that has USB and HDMI ports: The Satechi slim multi-port adapter . The hub comes in the same colors as Apple’s new laptops, and includes two USB ports, one USB-C port, and an HDMI port that supports 4K video output. It’ll set you back $60 , but will free up so much space in your bag. Satechi also makes an $80 version that has an ethernet port, in case you still use one of those to connect to the internet. \nFor a hub with USB ports and an SD card reader: The HooToo Shuttle hub . If you’re not using an external monitor, or are more concerned with transferring lots of photos from your camera to your computer, this $30 hub might be the choice for you. \nThere are other hubs out there that can plug just about anything into a new MacBook. Among them, The Verge’s Micah Singleton says the Arc Hub “may be the USB-C hub we’ve been waiting for.” It has seven ports: two USB-C ports, two regular USB ports, an HDMI port, a Mini DisplayPort (Apple’s older audio-visual connection), and an SD card reader. It costs a whopping $105 , but you’ll be able to use everything at once, while charging an iPhone. You’ll be the life of the holiday party. Read full story",

According to the Nikkei Asian Review , iPhone maker Apple has begun exploring the possibility of moving smartphone production to the United States. \nThe report, published on Friday, cites a source familiar with Apple’s plans. The Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S. \nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free \nPegatron reportedly declined, citing logistical concerns. Foxconn agreed to compile report as soon as June, but company chairman Terry Gou warned that it would show drastically higher productions costs. The potential result? An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs.

An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs. \nA thorough report in the MIT Technology Review found that moving iPhone assembly to the U.S. would add $30 to $40 to the cost of an iPhone thanks to “transportation and logistics expenses [that] would arise from shipping parts.\" \nMore: Superior silicon: How Apple is beating chipmakers at their own game \nManufacturing the smartphone’s hundreds of components domestically is an even pricier — and vastly more complex — proposition. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told CBS’ 60 Minutes in December 2015 that the U.S. labor pool lacked the skills necessary to carry out iPhone production, and Apple executives have estimated that it would take as long as nine months to recruit the roughly 8,700 industrial engineers that oversee Chinese assembly lines. And that’s before efficiency is taken into account: A 2012 CNN Money report noted that Chinese factories house workers in employee dormitories and “can send hundreds of thousands to the assembly lines at a moment’s notice.” \nThen there’s the U.S.’s lack of natural resources to consider. MIT Technology Review points out that few of the 75 elements required to manufacture the iPhone are available commercially in the U.S. Aluminum, for instance, requires bauxite, and there are no bauxite mines in the U.S. China, on the other hand, produces 85 percent of the world’s rare earth metals. \nMore: Spendy but indispensable: Breaking down the full $650 cost of the iPhone 5 \nFurther complicating matters is Apple’s sprawling supply chain of more than 750 firms in over 20 countries. Taiwan Semiconductor produces crucial iPhone chips; South Korea’s SK Hynix and Japan’s Toshiba produce the handset’s memory modules; and Japan’s Japan Display and Sharp provide the iPhone’s display. “To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,” an industry executive familiar with iPhone production told economics blog NorthCrane . \nBut Apple’s plan isn’t without precedent. In 2013, Motorola Mobility employed more than 3,800 employees to assemble the Moto X, a flagship Android phone, at a factory in Fort Worth, Texas. Just a year later, though, it was forced to shutter production as a result of “exceptionally tough” market conditions, according to Motorola president Rick Osterloh. The company subsequently moved production to China. \nOthers have been more successful. Foxconn established a stateside iMac computer assembly line in 2012. A year later, Singapore-based Flextronics, manufacturer of Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computer, built a production line in Austin, Texas. \nMore: When will the iPhone use an OLED screen? Here are all the rumors \nIn October 2015, Sharp president Tai Jeng-wu suggested that if Apple were to begin producing smartphones in the United States, it would likely follow suit. “We are now building a new [advanced organic light-emitting diode] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” \nNews of Apple’s plan follows Trump’s victory in the presidential election. The president-elect has been a vocal supporter of U.S. companies that build their products in the U.S., and has proposed levying steep tariffs — potentially as high as 45 percent — on competing Chinese importers. \n\\“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of other countries,” Trump said in a speech in January. “How does it help us when they make it in China?” \nIn an interview with The New York Times published in November, Trump recounted a phone conversation with Tim Cook during which he urged the CEO to move part of Apple’s production line to the U.S.: \n“I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’” \nMore: Apple scales back production of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, expects lower sales in 2016 \nIn an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned of retaliatory measures if such trade restrictions were to go into effect. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” a Global Times article read. \nA move of production by Apple could also threaten the company’s relationship with Chinese leadership. Earlier this year, in what was widely seen as a protectionist move by regulators, Apple’s iBooks and iMovies were temporarily blocked within the country. And in June, China’s Beijing-based intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on a design patent held by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili. \nApple has extended olive branches in recent months.

The nation's aviation agency came across a video of the stunt, and didn't much like the pilot's flying practices. \nBy Kyle Wiggers \nProvided by Restoring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the United States’ struggling Rust Belt communities was one of President-Elect Donald Trump’s biggest campaign promises, and at least one major technology company is considering following through. According to the Nikkei Asian Review , iPhone maker Apple has begun exploring the possibility of moving smartphone production to the United States. \nThe report, published on Friday, cites a source familiar with Apple’s plans. The Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S. \nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free \nPegatron reportedly declined, citing logistical concerns. Foxconn agreed to compile report as soon as June, but company chairman Terry Gou warned that it would show drastically higher productions costs. The potential result? An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs.

The Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S. \nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free \nPegatron reportedly declined, citing logistical concerns.

An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs. \nA thorough report in the MIT Technology Review found that moving iPhone assembly to the U.S. would add $30 to $40 to the cost of an iPhone thanks to “transportation and logistics expenses [that] would arise from shipping parts.\" \nMore: Superior silicon: How Apple is beating chipmakers at their own game \nManufacturing the smartphone’s hundreds of components domestically is an even pricier — and vastly more complex — proposition. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told CBS’ 60 Minutes in December 2015 that the U.S. labor pool lacked the skills necessary to carry out iPhone production, and Apple executives have estimated that it would take as long as nine months to recruit the roughly 8,700 industrial engineers that oversee Chinese assembly lines. And that’s before efficiency is taken into account: A 2012 CNN Money report noted that Chinese factories house workers in employee dormitories and “can send hundreds of thousands to the assembly lines at a moment’s notice.” \nThen there’s the U.S.’s lack of natural resources to consider. MIT Technology Review points out that few of the 75 elements required to manufacture the iPhone are available commercially in the U.S. Aluminum, for instance, requires bauxite, and there are no bauxite mines in the U.S. China, on the other hand, produces 85 percent of the world’s rare earth metals. \nMore: Spendy but indispensable: Breaking down the full $650 cost of the iPhone 5 \nFurther complicating matters is Apple’s sprawling supply chain of more than 750 firms in over 20 countries. Taiwan Semiconductor produces crucial iPhone chips; South Korea’s SK Hynix and Japan’s Toshiba produce the handset’s memory modules; and Japan’s Japan Display and Sharp provide the iPhone’s display. “To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,” an industry executive familiar with iPhone production told economics blog NorthCrane . \nBut Apple’s plan isn’t without precedent. In 2013, Motorola Mobility employed more than 3,800 employees to assemble the Moto X, a flagship Android phone, at a factory in Fort Worth, Texas. Just a year later, though, it was forced to shutter production as a result of “exceptionally tough” market conditions, according to Motorola president Rick Osterloh. The company subsequently moved production to China. \nOthers have been more successful. Foxconn established a stateside iMac computer assembly line in 2012. A year later, Singapore-based Flextronics, manufacturer of Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computer, built a production line in Austin, Texas. \nMore: When will the iPhone use an OLED screen? Here are all the rumors \nIn October 2015, Sharp president Tai Jeng-wu suggested that if Apple were to begin producing smartphones in the United States, it would likely follow suit. “We are now building a new [advanced organic light-emitting diode] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” \nNews of Apple’s plan follows Trump’s victory in the presidential election. The president-elect has been a vocal supporter of U.S. companies that build their products in the U.S., and has proposed levying steep tariffs — potentially as high as 45 percent — on competing Chinese importers. \n\\“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of other countries,” Trump said in a speech in January. “How does it help us when they make it in China?” \nIn an interview with The New York Times published in November, Trump recounted a phone conversation with Tim Cook during which he urged the CEO to move part of Apple’s production line to the U.S.: \n“I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’” \nMore: Apple scales back production of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, expects lower sales in 2016 \nIn an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned of retaliatory measures if such trade restrictions were to go into effect. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” a Global Times article read. \nA move of production by Apple could also threaten the company’s relationship with Chinese leadership. Earlier this year, in what was widely seen as a protectionist move by regulators, Apple’s iBooks and iMovies were temporarily blocked within the country. And in June, China’s Beijing-based intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on a design patent held by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili. \nApple has extended olive branches in recent months. The company invested $1 billion in China-based ridesharing app Didi Chuxing. It’ll open its first research and development facility in the country — a $45 million office within Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park — by the end of this year. And in October, it pledged to build a second facility in China’s Shenzhen province. \nMore: Apple planning a second research and development center in China \nEven if Apple were to move iPhone production to the U.S., it likely wouldn’t be enough to stem the country’s losses. Foxconn employed roughly 690,000 workers in China as of the end of April, down slightly from a peak of 1.3 million in 2012.

The details surrounding Marina Ruelas' arrest, and that of her fellow social sellers, is even more fascinating than her crime. \nBy Kyle Wiggers \nProvided by Restoring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the United States’ struggling Rust Belt communities was one of President-Elect Donald Trump’s biggest campaign promises, and at least one major technology company is considering following through. According to the Nikkei Asian Review , iPhone maker Apple has begun exploring the possibility of moving smartphone production to the United States. \nThe report, published on Friday, cites a source familiar with Apple’s plans. The Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S. \nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free \nPegatron reportedly declined, citing logistical concerns. Foxconn agreed to compile report as soon as June, but company chairman Terry Gou warned that it would show drastically higher productions costs. The potential result? An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs. Restoring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the United States’ struggling Rust Belt communities was one of President-Elect Donald Trump’s biggest campaign promises, and at least one major technology company is considering following through.

The Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S. \nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free \nPegatron reportedly declined, citing logistical concerns.

An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs. \nA thorough report in the MIT Technology Review found that moving iPhone assembly to the U.S. would add $30 to $40 to the cost of an iPhone thanks to “transportation and logistics expenses [that] would arise from shipping parts.\" \nMore: Superior silicon: How Apple is beating chipmakers at their own game \nManufacturing the smartphone’s hundreds of components domestically is an even pricier — and vastly more complex — proposition. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told CBS’ 60 Minutes in December 2015 that the U.S. labor pool lacked the skills necessary to carry out iPhone production, and Apple executives have estimated that it would take as long as nine months to recruit the roughly 8,700 industrial engineers that oversee Chinese assembly lines. And that’s before efficiency is taken into account: A 2012 CNN Money report noted that Chinese factories house workers in employee dormitories and “can send hundreds of thousands to the assembly lines at a moment’s notice.” \nThen there’s the U.S.’s lack of natural resources to consider. MIT Technology Review points out that few of the 75 elements required to manufacture the iPhone are available commercially in the U.S. Aluminum, for instance, requires bauxite, and there are no bauxite mines in the U.S. China, on the other hand, produces 85 percent of the world’s rare earth metals. \nMore: Spendy but indispensable: Breaking down the full $650 cost of the iPhone 5 \nFurther complicating matters is Apple’s sprawling supply chain of more than 750 firms in over 20 countries. Taiwan Semiconductor produces crucial iPhone chips; South Korea’s SK Hynix and Japan’s Toshiba produce the handset’s memory modules; and Japan’s Japan Display and Sharp provide the iPhone’s display. “To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,” an industry executive familiar with iPhone production told economics blog NorthCrane . \nBut Apple’s plan isn’t without precedent. In 2013, Motorola Mobility employed more than 3,800 employees to assemble the Moto X, a flagship Android phone, at a factory in Fort Worth, Texas. Just a year later, though, it was forced to shutter production as a result of “exceptionally tough” market conditions, according to Motorola president Rick Osterloh. The company subsequently moved production to China. \nOthers have been more successful. Foxconn established a stateside iMac computer assembly line in 2012. A year later, Singapore-based Flextronics, manufacturer of Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computer, built a production line in Austin, Texas. \nMore: When will the iPhone use an OLED screen? Here are all the rumors \nIn October 2015, Sharp president Tai Jeng-wu suggested that if Apple were to begin producing smartphones in the United States, it would likely follow suit. “We are now building a new [advanced organic light-emitting diode] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” \nNews of Apple’s plan follows Trump’s victory in the presidential election. The president-elect has been a vocal supporter of U.S. companies that build their products in the U.S., and has proposed levying steep tariffs — potentially as high as 45 percent — on competing Chinese importers. \n\\“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of other countries,” Trump said in a speech in January. “How does it help us when they make it in China?” \nIn an interview with The New York Times published in November, Trump recounted a phone conversation with Tim Cook during which he urged the CEO to move part of Apple’s production line to the U.S.: \n“I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’” \nMore: Apple scales back production of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, expects lower sales in 2016 \nIn an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned of retaliatory measures if such trade restrictions were to go into effect. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” a Global Times article read. \nA move of production by Apple could also threaten the company’s relationship with Chinese leadership. Earlier this year, in what was widely seen as a protectionist move by regulators, Apple’s iBooks and iMovies were temporarily blocked within the country. And in June, China’s Beijing-based intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on a design patent held by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili. \nApple has extended olive branches in recent months. The company invested $1 billion in China-based ridesharing app Didi Chuxing. It’ll open its first research and development facility in the country — a $45 million office within Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park — by the end of this year. And in October, it pledged to build a second facility in China’s Shenzhen province. \nMore: Apple planning a second research and development center in China \nEven if Apple were to move iPhone production to the U.S., it likely wouldn’t be enough to stem the country’s losses. Foxconn employed roughly 690,000 workers in China as of the end of April, down slightly from a peak of 1.3 million in 2012. The Economic Policy Institute, a U.S. think tank, estimated that the U.S. had lost five million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2014. \nBut politics may trump economics in the end. U.S. automaker Ford may prove the precursor of developments to come: On Friday, the company shelved plans to move production of its Lincoln crossover SUV from Kentucky to Mexico. “The Apple supply chain must treat Trump’s campaign pledge seriously and not write it off,” an industry executive told NorthCrane. \nArticle originally published in November 2016.

The nation's aviation agency came across a video of the stunt, and didn't much like the pilot's flying practices. \nBy Kyle Wiggers \nProvided by Restoring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the United States’ struggling Rust Belt communities was one of President-Elect Donald Trump’s biggest campaign promises, and at least one major technology company is considering following through. According to the Nikkei Asian Review , iPhone maker Apple has begun exploring the possibility of moving smartphone production to the United States. \nThe report, published on Friday, cites a source familiar with Apple’s plans. The Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S. \nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free \nPegatron reportedly declined, citing logistical concerns. Foxconn agreed to compile report as soon as June, but company chairman Terry Gou warned that it would show drastically higher productions costs. The potential result? An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs. Restoring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the United States’ struggling Rust Belt communities was one of President-Elect Donald Trump’s biggest campaign promises, and at least one major technology company is considering following through.

An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs. \nA thorough report in the MIT Technology Review found that moving iPhone assembly to the U.S. would add $30 to $40 to the cost of an iPhone thanks to “transportation and logistics expenses [that] would arise from shipping parts.\" \nMore: Superior silicon: How Apple is beating chipmakers at their own game \nManufacturing the smartphone’s hundreds of components domestically is an even pricier — and vastly more complex — proposition. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told CBS’ 60 Minutes in December 2015 that the U.S. labor pool lacked the skills necessary to carry out iPhone production, and Apple executives have estimated that it would take as long as nine months to recruit the roughly 8,700 industrial engineers that oversee Chinese assembly lines. And that’s before efficiency is taken into account: A 2012 CNN Money report noted that Chinese factories house workers in employee dormitories and “can send hundreds of thousands to the assembly lines at a moment’s notice.” \nThen there’s the U.S.’s lack of natural resources to consider. MIT Technology Review points out that few of the 75 elements required to manufacture the iPhone are available commercially in the U.S. Aluminum, for instance, requires bauxite, and there are no bauxite mines in the U.S. China, on the other hand, produces 85 percent of the world’s rare earth metals. \nMore: Spendy but indispensable: Breaking down the full $650 cost of the iPhone 5 \nFurther complicating matters is Apple’s sprawling supply chain of more than 750 firms in over 20 countries. Taiwan Semiconductor produces crucial iPhone chips; South Korea’s SK Hynix and Japan’s Toshiba produce the handset’s memory modules; and Japan’s Japan Display and Sharp provide the iPhone’s display. “To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,” an industry executive familiar with iPhone production told economics blog NorthCrane . \nBut Apple’s plan isn’t without precedent. In 2013, Motorola Mobility employed more than 3,800 employees to assemble the Moto X, a flagship Android phone, at a factory in Fort Worth, Texas. Just a year later, though, it was forced to shutter production as a result of “exceptionally tough” market conditions, according to Motorola president Rick Osterloh. The company subsequently moved production to China. \nOthers have been more successful. Foxconn established a stateside iMac computer assembly line in 2012. A year later, Singapore-based Flextronics, manufacturer of Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computer, built a production line in Austin, Texas. \nMore: When will the iPhone use an OLED screen? Here are all the rumors \nIn October 2015, Sharp president Tai Jeng-wu suggested that if Apple were to begin producing smartphones in the United States, it would likely follow suit. “We are now building a new [advanced organic light-emitting diode] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” \nNews of Apple’s plan follows Trump’s victory in the presidential election. The president-elect has been a vocal supporter of U.S. companies that build their products in the U.S., and has proposed levying steep tariffs — potentially as high as 45 percent — on competing Chinese importers. \n\\“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of other countries,” Trump said in a speech in January. “How does it help us when they make it in China?” \nIn an interview with The New York Times published in November, Trump recounted a phone conversation with Tim Cook during which he urged the CEO to move part of Apple’s production line to the U.S.: \n“I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’” \nMore: Apple scales back production of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, expects lower sales in 2016 \nIn an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned of retaliatory measures if such trade restrictions were to go into effect. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” a Global Times article read. \nA move of production by Apple could also threaten the company’s relationship with Chinese leadership. Earlier this year, in what was widely seen as a protectionist move by regulators, Apple’s iBooks and iMovies were temporarily blocked within the country. And in June, China’s Beijing-based intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on a design patent held by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili. \nApple has extended olive branches in recent months. The company invested $1 billion in China-based ridesharing app Didi Chuxing. It’ll open its first research and development facility in the country — a $45 million office within Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park — by the end of this year. And in October, it pledged to build a second facility in China’s Shenzhen province. \nMore: Apple planning a second research and development center in China \nEven if Apple were to move iPhone production to the U.S., it likely wouldn’t be enough to stem the country’s losses. Foxconn employed roughly 690,000 workers in China as of the end of April, down slightly from a peak of 1.3 million in 2012. The Economic Policy Institute, a U.S. think tank, estimated that the U.S. had lost five million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2014. \nBut politics may trump economics in the end. U.S. automaker Ford may prove the precursor of developments to come: On Friday, the company shelved plans to move production of its Lincoln crossover SUV from Kentucky to Mexico. “The Apple supply chain must treat Trump’s campaign pledge seriously and not write it off,” an industry executive told NorthCrane. \nArticle originally published in November 2016.

The details surrounding Marina Ruelas' arrest, and that of her fellow social sellers, is even more fascinating than her crime. \nBy Kyle Wiggers \nProvided by Restoring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the United States’ struggling Rust Belt communities was one of President-Elect Donald Trump’s biggest campaign promises, and at least one major technology company is considering following through. According to the Nikkei Asian Review , iPhone maker Apple has begun exploring the possibility of moving smartphone production to the United States. \nThe report, published on Friday, cites a source familiar with Apple’s plans. The Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S. \nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free \nPegatron reportedly declined, citing logistical concerns. Foxconn agreed to compile report as soon as June, but company chairman Terry Gou warned that it would show drastically higher productions costs. The potential result? An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs. Restoring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the United States’ struggling Rust Belt communities was one of President-Elect Donald Trump’s biggest campaign promises, and at least one major technology company is considering following through.

The Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S. \nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free \nPegatron reportedly declined, citing logistical concerns.

An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs. \nA thorough report in the MIT Technology Review found that moving iPhone assembly to the U.S. would add $30 to $40 to the cost of an iPhone thanks to “transportation and logistics expenses [that] would arise from shipping parts.\" \nMore: Superior silicon: How Apple is beating chipmakers at their own game \nManufacturing the smartphone’s hundreds of components domestically is an even pricier — and vastly more complex — proposition. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told CBS’ 60 Minutes in December 2015 that the U.S. labor pool lacked the skills necessary to carry out iPhone production, and Apple executives have estimated that it would take as long as nine months to recruit the roughly 8,700 industrial engineers that oversee Chinese assembly lines. And that’s before efficiency is taken into account: A 2012 CNN Money report noted that Chinese factories house workers in employee dormitories and “can send hundreds of thousands to the assembly lines at a moment’s notice.” \nThen there’s the U.S.’s lack of natural resources to consider. MIT Technology Review points out that few of the 75 elements required to manufacture the iPhone are available commercially in the U.S. Aluminum, for instance, requires bauxite, and there are no bauxite mines in the U.S. China, on the other hand, produces 85 percent of the world’s rare earth metals. \nMore: Spendy but indispensable: Breaking down the full $650 cost of the iPhone 5 \nFurther complicating matters is Apple’s sprawling supply chain of more than 750 firms in over 20 countries. Taiwan Semiconductor produces crucial iPhone chips; South Korea’s SK Hynix and Japan’s Toshiba produce the handset’s memory modules; and Japan’s Japan Display and Sharp provide the iPhone’s display. “To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,” an industry executive familiar with iPhone production told economics blog NorthCrane . \nBut Apple’s plan isn’t without precedent. In 2013, Motorola Mobility employed more than 3,800 employees to assemble the Moto X, a flagship Android phone, at a factory in Fort Worth, Texas. Just a year later, though, it was forced to shutter production as a result of “exceptionally tough” market conditions, according to Motorola president Rick Osterloh. The company subsequently moved production to China. \nOthers have been more successful. Foxconn established a stateside iMac computer assembly line in 2012. A year later, Singapore-based Flextronics, manufacturer of Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computer, built a production line in Austin, Texas. \nMore: When will the iPhone use an OLED screen? Here are all the rumors \nIn October 2015, Sharp president Tai Jeng-wu suggested that if Apple were to begin producing smartphones in the United States, it would likely follow suit. “We are now building a new [advanced organic light-emitting diode] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” \nNews of Apple’s plan follows Trump’s victory in the presidential election. The president-elect has been a vocal supporter of U.S. companies that build their products in the U.S., and has proposed levying steep tariffs — potentially as high as 45 percent — on competing Chinese importers. \n\\“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of other countries,” Trump said in a speech in January. “How does it help us when they make it in China?” \nIn an interview with The New York Times published in November, Trump recounted a phone conversation with Tim Cook during which he urged the CEO to move part of Apple’s production line to the U.S.: \n“I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’” \nMore: Apple scales back production of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, expects lower sales in 2016 \nIn an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned of retaliatory measures if such trade restrictions were to go into effect. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” a Global Times article read. \nA move of production by Apple could also threaten the company’s relationship with Chinese leadership. Earlier this year, in what was widely seen as a protectionist move by regulators, Apple’s iBooks and iMovies were temporarily blocked within the country. And in June, China’s Beijing-based intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on a design patent held by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili. \nApple has extended olive branches in recent months. The company invested $1 billion in China-based ridesharing app Didi Chuxing. It’ll open its first research and development facility in the country — a $45 million office within Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park — by the end of this year. And in October, it pledged to build a second facility in China’s Shenzhen province. \nMore: Apple planning a second research and development center in China \nEven if Apple were to move iPhone production to the U.S., it likely wouldn’t be enough to stem the country’s losses. Foxconn employed roughly 690,000 workers in China as of the end of April, down slightly from a peak of 1.3 million in 2012. The Economic Policy Institute, a U.S. think tank, estimated that the U.S. had lost five million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2014. \nBut politics may trump economics in the end. U.S. automaker Ford may prove the precursor of developments to come: On Friday, the company shelved plans to move production of its Lincoln crossover SUV from Kentucky to Mexico. “The Apple supply chain must treat Trump’s campaign pledge seriously and not write it off,” an industry executive told NorthCrane. \nArticle originally published in November 2016.

      "text": "\nRumor has it that Apple is working on augmented reality glasses that may debut in 2018.\nBy then Microsoft's high-profile, untethered, AR wearable computer, HoloLens , will be three years old. Microsoft's earlier arrival to the market, however, is no guarantee that Redmond's answer to AR will win over Cupertino's much later arrival .\nMicrosoft was first to tablets and smartphones after all, and we know how that turned out. Still, Redmond seems to have learned a lesson or two from its former lax approach to hardware that resulted in the company being beaten at its own game on more than one occasion.\nMicrosoft beating Apple to AR doesn't guarantee a win.\nWith HoloLens Microsoft has taken a strategically calculated approach to the market by introducing it to specific industries and for specific use cases . This tailored approach has garnered passionate developer support for Windows Holographic. Moreover, Microsoft's nurturing of partner relationships to bring HoloLens-like hardware to market will further help Microsoft's ecosystem become the industry's platform for mix-reality (the continuum from augmented to virtual reality ).\n",

The nation's aviation agency came across a video of the stunt, and didn't much like the pilot's flying practices. \nBy Kyle Wiggers \nProvided by Restoring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the United States’ struggling Rust Belt communities was one of President-Elect Donald Trump’s biggest campaign promises, and at least one major technology company is considering following through. According to the Nikkei Asian Review , iPhone maker Apple has begun exploring the possibility of moving smartphone production to the United States. \nThe report, published on Friday, cites a source familiar with Apple’s plans. The Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S. \nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free \nPegatron reportedly declined, citing logistical concerns. Foxconn agreed to compile report as soon as June, but company chairman Terry Gou warned that it would show drastically higher productions costs. The potential result? An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs. Restoring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the United States’ struggling Rust Belt communities was one of President-Elect Donald Trump’s biggest campaign promises, and at least one major technology company is considering following through.

An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs. \nA thorough report in the MIT Technology Review found that moving iPhone assembly to the U.S. would add $30 to $40 to the cost of an iPhone thanks to “transportation and logistics expenses [that] would arise from shipping parts.\" \nMore: Superior silicon: How Apple is beating chipmakers at their own game \nManufacturing the smartphone’s hundreds of components domestically is an even pricier — and vastly more complex — proposition. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told CBS’ 60 Minutes in December 2015 that the U.S. labor pool lacked the skills necessary to carry out iPhone production, and Apple executives have estimated that it would take as long as nine months to recruit the roughly 8,700 industrial engineers that oversee Chinese assembly lines. And that’s before efficiency is taken into account: A 2012 CNN Money report noted that Chinese factories house workers in employee dormitories and “can send hundreds of thousands to the assembly lines at a moment’s notice.” \nThen there’s the U.S.’s lack of natural resources to consider. MIT Technology Review points out that few of the 75 elements required to manufacture the iPhone are available commercially in the U.S. Aluminum, for instance, requires bauxite, and there are no bauxite mines in the U.S. China, on the other hand, produces 85 percent of the world’s rare earth metals. \nMore: Spendy but indispensable: Breaking down the full $650 cost of the iPhone 5 \nFurther complicating matters is Apple’s sprawling supply chain of more than 750 firms in over 20 countries. Taiwan Semiconductor produces crucial iPhone chips; South Korea’s SK Hynix and Japan’s Toshiba produce the handset’s memory modules; and Japan’s Japan Display and Sharp provide the iPhone’s display. “To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,” an industry executive familiar with iPhone production told economics blog NorthCrane . \nBut Apple’s plan isn’t without precedent. In 2013, Motorola Mobility employed more than 3,800 employees to assemble the Moto X, a flagship Android phone, at a factory in Fort Worth, Texas. Just a year later, though, it was forced to shutter production as a result of “exceptionally tough” market conditions, according to Motorola president Rick Osterloh. The company subsequently moved production to China. \nOthers have been more successful. Foxconn established a stateside iMac computer assembly line in 2012. A year later, Singapore-based Flextronics, manufacturer of Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computer, built a production line in Austin, Texas. \nMore: When will the iPhone use an OLED screen? Here are all the rumors \nIn October 2015, Sharp president Tai Jeng-wu suggested that if Apple were to begin producing smartphones in the United States, it would likely follow suit. “We are now building a new [advanced organic light-emitting diode] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” \nNews of Apple’s plan follows Trump’s victory in the presidential election. The president-elect has been a vocal supporter of U.S. companies that build their products in the U.S., and has proposed levying steep tariffs — potentially as high as 45 percent — on competing Chinese importers. \n\\“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of other countries,” Trump said in a speech in January. “How does it help us when they make it in China?” \nIn an interview with The New York Times published in November, Trump recounted a phone conversation with Tim Cook during which he urged the CEO to move part of Apple’s production line to the U.S.: \n“I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’” \nMore: Apple scales back production of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, expects lower sales in 2016 \nIn an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned of retaliatory measures if such trade restrictions were to go into effect. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” a Global Times article read. \nA move of production by Apple could also threaten the company’s relationship with Chinese leadership. Earlier this year, in what was widely seen as a protectionist move by regulators, Apple’s iBooks and iMovies were temporarily blocked within the country. And in June, China’s Beijing-based intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on a design patent held by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili. \nApple has extended olive branches in recent months. The company invested $1 billion in China-based ridesharing app Didi Chuxing. It’ll open its first research and development facility in the country — a $45 million office within Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park — by the end of this year. And in October, it pledged to build a second facility in China’s Shenzhen province. \nMore: Apple planning a second research and development center in China \nEven if Apple were to move iPhone production to the U.S., it likely wouldn’t be enough to stem the country’s losses. Foxconn employed roughly 690,000 workers in China as of the end of April, down slightly from a peak of 1.3 million in 2012. The Economic Policy Institute, a U.S. think tank, estimated that the U.S. had lost five million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2014. \nBut politics may trump economics in the end. U.S. automaker Ford may prove the precursor of developments to come: On Friday, the company shelved plans to move production of its Lincoln crossover SUV from Kentucky to Mexico. “The Apple supply chain must treat Trump’s campaign pledge seriously and not write it off,” an industry executive told NorthCrane. \nArticle originally published in November 2016.

      "text": "Apple to offer deals on Black Friday Submitted by Frank Macey on November 23, 2016 - 12:16pm \nApple fans may have been disappointed last year, since the company did not run its annual Black Friday event. Now it appears Apple is poised to offer special 2016 holiday discounts on its products for one day only. With the tag line \"Friday can't come soon enough,\" Apple features an Apple Watch showing November 25 on its storefront. \nThe official holiday shopping page says that Apple's \"one-day shopping event\" will arrive on Friday, however there are no specifics on what that means. In the past, Black Friday promotions have meant discounts on some of Apple's most popular products such as the iPad, or $100 gift cards with the purchase of a new Mac. In 2013 the company offered specials on bundled gift cards. \nApple's holiday store offers free two-day shipping on most items, and includes special holiday gift collections. The collections help simplify online shopping and include these categories: Apple gifts Photography gifts Games & Toys \nIn addition there is a special section devoted to gift cards. Apple is also promoting its free Apple Store app for iOS devices and Apple Watch. The company describes the Apple Store app as the \"fastest way to to shop our one-day event\". \nFor those who prefer to shop in person on Black Friday, some Apple retail stores are offering extended shopping hours on November 25th. Those looking for larger discounts on Apple products should be sure to shop around, as some third-party retailers offer better pricing than Apple on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. tags:",

According to the Nikkei Asian Review , iPhone maker Apple has begun exploring the possibility of moving smartphone production to the United States. \nThe report, published on Friday, cites a source familiar with Apple’s plans. The Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S. \nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free \nPegatron reportedly declined, citing logistical concerns. Foxconn agreed to compile report as soon as June, but company chairman Terry Gou warned that it would show drastically higher productions costs. The potential result? An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs.

Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told CBS’ 60 Minutes in December 2015 that the U.S. labor pool lacked the skills necessary to carry out iPhone production, and Apple executives have estimated that it would take as long as nine months to recruit the roughly 8,700 industrial engineers that oversee Chinese assembly lines. And that’s before efficiency is taken into account: A 2012 CNN Money report noted that Chinese factories house workers in employee dormitories and “can send hundreds of thousands to the assembly lines at a moment’s notice.” \nThen there’s the U.S.’s lack of natural resources to consider. MIT Technology Review points out that few of the 75 elements required to manufacture the iPhone are available commercially in the U.S. Aluminum, for instance, requires bauxite, and there are no bauxite mines in the U.S. China, on the other hand, produces 85 percent of the world’s rare earth metals. \nMore: Spendy but indispensable: Breaking down the full $650 cost of the iPhone 5 \nFurther complicating matters is Apple’s sprawling supply chain of more than 750 firms in over 20 countries. Taiwan Semiconductor produces crucial iPhone chips; South Korea’s SK Hynix and Japan’s Toshiba produce the handset’s memory modules; and Japan’s Japan Display and Sharp provide the iPhone’s display. “To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,” an industry executive familiar with iPhone production told economics blog NorthCrane . \nBut Apple’s plan isn’t without precedent. In 2013, Motorola Mobility employed more than 3,800 employees to assemble the Moto X, a flagship Android phone, at a factory in Fort Worth, Texas. Just a year later, though, it was forced to shutter production as a result of “exceptionally tough” market conditions, according to Motorola president Rick Osterloh. The company subsequently moved production to China. \nOthers have been more successful. Foxconn established a stateside iMac computer assembly line in 2012. A year later, Singapore-based Flextronics, manufacturer of Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computer, built a production line in Austin, Texas. \nMore: When will the iPhone use an OLED screen? Here are all the rumors \nIn October 2015, Sharp president Tai Jeng-wu suggested that if Apple were to begin producing smartphones in the United States, it would likely follow suit. “We are now building a new [advanced organic light-emitting diode] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” \nNews of Apple’s plan follows Trump’s victory in the presidential election. The president-elect has been a vocal supporter of U.S. companies that build their products in the U.S., and has proposed levying steep tariffs — potentially as high as 45 percent — on competing Chinese importers. \n\\“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of other countries,” Trump said in a speech in January. “How does it help us when they make it in China?” \nIn an interview with The New York Times published in November, Trump recounted a phone conversation with Tim Cook during which he urged the CEO to move part of Apple’s production line to the U.S.: \n“I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’” \nMore: Apple scales back production of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, expects lower sales in 2016 \nIn an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned of retaliatory measures if such trade restrictions were to go into effect. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” a Global Times article read. \nA move of production by Apple could also threaten the company’s relationship with Chinese leadership. Earlier this year, in what was widely seen as a protectionist move by regulators, Apple’s iBooks and iMovies were temporarily blocked within the country. And in June, China’s Beijing-based intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on a design patent held by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili. \nApple has extended olive branches in recent months. The company invested $1 billion in China-based ridesharing app Didi Chuxing. It’ll open its first research and development facility in the country — a $45 million office within Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park — by the end of this year. And in October, it pledged to build a second facility in China’s Shenzhen province. \nMore: Apple planning a second research and development center in China \nEven if Apple were to move iPhone production to the U.S., it likely wouldn’t be enough to stem the country’s losses. Foxconn employed roughly 690,000 workers in China as of the end of April, down slightly from a peak of 1.3 million in 2012. The Economic Policy Institute, a U.S. think tank, estimated that the U.S. had lost five million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2014. \nBut politics may trump economics in the end. U.S. automaker Ford may prove the precursor of developments to come: On Friday, the company shelved plans to move production of its Lincoln crossover SUV from Kentucky to Mexico. “The Apple supply chain must treat Trump’s campaign pledge seriously and not write it off,” an industry executive told NorthCrane. \nArticle originally published in November 2016.

The details surrounding Marina Ruelas' arrest, and that of her fellow social sellers, is even more fascinating than her crime. \nBy Kyle Wiggers \nProvided by Restoring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the United States’ struggling Rust Belt communities was one of President-Elect Donald Trump’s biggest campaign promises, and at least one major technology company is considering following through. According to the Nikkei Asian Review , iPhone maker Apple has begun exploring the possibility of moving smartphone production to the United States. \nThe report, published on Friday, cites a source familiar with Apple’s plans. The Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S. \nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free \nPegatron reportedly declined, citing logistical concerns. Foxconn agreed to compile report as soon as June, but company chairman Terry Gou warned that it would show drastically higher productions costs. The potential result? An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs.

An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs. \nA thorough report in the MIT Technology Review found that moving iPhone assembly to the U.S. would add $30 to $40 to the cost of an iPhone thanks to “transportation and logistics expenses [that] would arise from shipping parts.\" \nMore: Superior silicon: How Apple is beating chipmakers at their own game \nManufacturing the smartphone’s hundreds of components domestically is an even pricier — and vastly more complex — proposition. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told CBS’ 60 Minutes in December 2015 that the U.S. labor pool lacked the skills necessary to carry out iPhone production, and Apple executives have estimated that it would take as long as nine months to recruit the roughly 8,700 industrial engineers that oversee Chinese assembly lines. And that’s before efficiency is taken into account: A 2012 CNN Money report noted that Chinese factories house workers in employee dormitories and “can send hundreds of thousands to the assembly lines at a moment’s notice.” \nThen there’s the U.S.’s lack of natural resources to consider. MIT Technology Review points out that few of the 75 elements required to manufacture the iPhone are available commercially in the U.S. Aluminum, for instance, requires bauxite, and there are no bauxite mines in the U.S. China, on the other hand, produces 85 percent of the world’s rare earth metals. \nMore: Spendy but indispensable: Breaking down the full $650 cost of the iPhone 5 \nFurther complicating matters is Apple’s sprawling supply chain of more than 750 firms in over 20 countries. Taiwan Semiconductor produces crucial iPhone chips; South Korea’s SK Hynix and Japan’s Toshiba produce the handset’s memory modules; and Japan’s Japan Display and Sharp provide the iPhone’s display. “To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,” an industry executive familiar with iPhone production told economics blog NorthCrane . \nBut Apple’s plan isn’t without precedent. In 2013, Motorola Mobility employed more than 3,800 employees to assemble the Moto X, a flagship Android phone, at a factory in Fort Worth, Texas. Just a year later, though, it was forced to shutter production as a result of “exceptionally tough” market conditions, according to Motorola president Rick Osterloh. The company subsequently moved production to China. \nOthers have been more successful. Foxconn established a stateside iMac computer assembly line in 2012. A year later, Singapore-based Flextronics, manufacturer of Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computer, built a production line in Austin, Texas. \nMore: When will the iPhone use an OLED screen? Here are all the rumors \nIn October 2015, Sharp president Tai Jeng-wu suggested that if Apple were to begin producing smartphones in the United States, it would likely follow suit. “We are now building a new [advanced organic light-emitting diode] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” \nNews of Apple’s plan follows Trump’s victory in the presidential election. The president-elect has been a vocal supporter of U.S. companies that build their products in the U.S., and has proposed levying steep tariffs — potentially as high as 45 percent — on competing Chinese importers. \n\\“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of other countries,” Trump said in a speech in January. “How does it help us when they make it in China?” \nIn an interview with The New York Times published in November, Trump recounted a phone conversation with Tim Cook during which he urged the CEO to move part of Apple’s production line to the U.S.: \n“I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’” \nMore: Apple scales back production of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, expects lower sales in 2016 \nIn an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned of retaliatory measures if such trade restrictions were to go into effect. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” a Global Times article read. \nA move of production by Apple could also threaten the company’s relationship with Chinese leadership. Earlier this year, in what was widely seen as a protectionist move by regulators, Apple’s iBooks and iMovies were temporarily blocked within the country. And in June, China’s Beijing-based intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on a design patent held by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili. \nApple has extended olive branches in recent months. The company invested $1 billion in China-based ridesharing app Didi Chuxing. It’ll open its first research and development facility in the country — a $45 million office within Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park — by the end of this year. And in October, it pledged to build a second facility in China’s Shenzhen province. \nMore: Apple planning a second research and development center in China \nEven if Apple were to move iPhone production to the U.S., it likely wouldn’t be enough to stem the country’s losses. Foxconn employed roughly 690,000 workers in China as of the end of April, down slightly from a peak of 1.3 million in 2012. The Economic Policy Institute, a U.S. think tank, estimated that the U.S. had lost five million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2014. \nBut politics may trump economics in the end. U.S. automaker Ford may prove the precursor of developments to come: On Friday, the company shelved plans to move production of its Lincoln crossover SUV from Kentucky to Mexico. “The Apple supply chain must treat Trump’s campaign pledge seriously and not write it off,” an industry executive told NorthCrane. \nArticle originally published in November 2016.

      "text": "In a move that has surprised some, Apple has announced they will be offering Black Friday deals on its iPhone 7.\nWhile Apple has not been one to go in for Black Friday gimmicks in the past, this year shoppers are likely to see bargains on a range of the company’s products. Apple announced on its website that for a limited time on Black Friday it would be offering deals on various Apple products.\nRetailers have some special deals on iPhone 7, in particular. At Target, you can buy an iPhone 7 with no money out-of-pocket when you activate the phone with Sprint, Verizon or AT&T installment or leasing plans.\nBest Buy , Target , and Walmart are all offering up to $250 in gift cards when you purchase an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus on an eligible device payment plan, according to Macrumors.com.\nT-Mobile is reviving its trade-in offer where you can trade in an older iPhone to get a free or discounted iPhone 7 or 7 Plus. According to the T-Mobile website, if you trade in an iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, or iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, or Note 5, customers can get a 32GB iPhone 7 for free.\nWith the trade-in of those phones, a 32GB iPhone 7 Plus costs $100, with the exception of a Galaxy S7 Edge or an iPhone 7 Plus trade-in, which drops the price to zero. T-Mobile's Black Friday deals will start on Thursday at 12:01 a.m. (PT) – 3:01 a.m. (ET) – and will run through Sunday at 11:59 p.m. (PT) – 2:59 a.m. (ET).\nAt Walmart, there are no discounts on iPhones, but you do get a $250 gift card with a purchase on an eligible iPhone. They are also offering the iPhoe 5s for $99, but you must purchase a Straight Talk wireless plan to get that price.",

According to the Nikkei Asian Review , iPhone maker Apple has begun exploring the possibility of moving smartphone production to the United States. \nThe report, published on Friday, cites a source familiar with Apple’s plans. The Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S. \nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free \nPegatron reportedly declined, citing logistical concerns. Foxconn agreed to compile report as soon as June, but company chairman Terry Gou warned that it would show drastically higher productions costs. The potential result? An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs.

An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei. \nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs. \nA thorough report in the MIT Technology Review found that moving iPhone assembly to the U.S. would add $30 to $40 to the cost of an iPhone thanks to “transportation and logistics expenses [that] would arise from shipping parts.\" \nMore: Superior silicon: How Apple is beating chipmakers at their own game \nManufacturing the smartphone’s hundreds of components domestically is an even pricier — and vastly more complex — proposition. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told CBS’ 60 Minutes in December 2015 that the U.S. labor pool lacked the skills necessary to carry out iPhone production, and Apple executives have estimated that it would take as long as nine months to recruit the roughly 8,700 industrial engineers that oversee Chinese assembly lines. And that’s before efficiency is taken into account: A 2012 CNN Money report noted that Chinese factories house workers in employee dormitories and “can send hundreds of thousands to the assembly lines at a moment’s notice.” \nThen there’s the U.S.’s lack of natural resources to consider. MIT Technology Review points out that few of the 75 elements required to manufacture the iPhone are available commercially in the U.S. Aluminum, for instance, requires bauxite, and there are no bauxite mines in the U.S. China, on the other hand, produces 85 percent of the world’s rare earth metals. \nMore: Spendy but indispensable: Breaking down the full $650 cost of the iPhone 5 \nFurther complicating matters is Apple’s sprawling supply chain of more than 750 firms in over 20 countries. Taiwan Semiconductor produces crucial iPhone chips; South Korea’s SK Hynix and Japan’s Toshiba produce the handset’s memory modules; and Japan’s Japan Display and Sharp provide the iPhone’s display. “To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,” an industry executive familiar with iPhone production told economics blog NorthCrane . \nBut Apple’s plan isn’t without precedent. In 2013, Motorola Mobility employed more than 3,800 employees to assemble the Moto X, a flagship Android phone, at a factory in Fort Worth, Texas. Just a year later, though, it was forced to shutter production as a result of “exceptionally tough” market conditions, according to Motorola president Rick Osterloh. The company subsequently moved production to China. \nOthers have been more successful. Foxconn established a stateside iMac computer assembly line in 2012. A year later, Singapore-based Flextronics, manufacturer of Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computer, built a production line in Austin, Texas. \nMore: When will the iPhone use an OLED screen? Here are all the rumors \nIn October 2015, Sharp president Tai Jeng-wu suggested that if Apple were to begin producing smartphones in the United States, it would likely follow suit. “We are now building a new [advanced organic light-emitting diode] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?” \nNews of Apple’s plan follows Trump’s victory in the presidential election. The president-elect has been a vocal supporter of U.S. companies that build their products in the U.S., and has proposed levying steep tariffs — potentially as high as 45 percent — on competing Chinese importers. \n\\“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of other countries,” Trump said in a speech in January. “How does it help us when they make it in China?” \nIn an interview with The New York Times published in November, Trump recounted a phone conversation with Tim Cook during which he urged the CEO to move part of Apple’s production line to the U.S.: \n“I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’” \nMore: Apple scales back production of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, expects lower sales in 2016 \nIn an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned of retaliatory measures if such trade restrictions were to go into effect. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” a Global Times article read. \nA move of production by Apple could also threaten the company’s relationship with Chinese leadership. Earlier this year, in what was widely seen as a protectionist move by regulators, Apple’s iBooks and iMovies were temporarily blocked within the country. And in June, China’s Beijing-based intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on a design patent held by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili. \nApple has extended olive branches in recent months. The company invested $1 billion in China-based ridesharing app Didi Chuxing. It’ll open its first research and development facility in the country — a $45 million office within Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park — by the end of this year. And in October, it pledged to build a second facility in China’s Shenzhen province. \nMore: Apple planning a second research and development center in China \nEven if Apple were to move iPhone production to the U.S., it likely wouldn’t be enough to stem the country’s losses. Foxconn employed roughly 690,000 workers in China as of the end of April, down slightly from a peak of 1.3 million in 2012. The Economic Policy Institute, a U.S. think tank, estimated that the U.S. had lost five million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2014. \nBut politics may trump economics in the end. U.S. automaker Ford may prove the precursor of developments to come: On Friday, the company shelved plans to move production of its Lincoln crossover SUV from Kentucky to Mexico. “The Apple supply chain must treat Trump’s campaign pledge seriously and not write it off,” an industry executive told NorthCrane. \nArticle originally published in November 2016.

      "text": "Trump tells Cook that he'll give Apple incentives to move iPhone production to the U.S. Trump tells Cook that he'll give Apple incentives to move iPhone production to the U.S. Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + During Tuesday's sit down with the New York Times , President-Elect Donald Trump mentioned a conversation he had after the election with Apple CEO Tim Cook. After the election, Cook reached out to Trump to congratulate him, according to the President-Elect. Trump also relayed part of the conversation that dealt with moving iPhone production to the U.S.Humility not being one of his prominent traits, Trump steered the conversation to himself by saying that it would be a real feather in his hat if he could get Apple to build a factory in the U.S. instead of China or Vietnam. Trump continued by saying that he would offer incentives to Apple that Trump believes will end up with a spanking new Apple plant being built in the U.S. The President-Elect also reportedly told Cook that his administration is planning on submitting to Congress a huge business tax cut that Cook will be happy about.We must say that Apple might have seen which way the wind was blowing before others did. A recent report out of Japan stated that back in June, Apple had asked Foxconn and Pegatron, two of the contract manufacturers that assemble the iPhone in Asia, about creating a plan to build the device in the U.S. According to the report, Foxconn agreed to look into it while Pegatron cited the prohibitive cost of such a move to turn down Apple.While building the iPhone in the U.S. would be positive for Trump's hyper-sensitive ego, and bring more jobs to the U.S., it would also result in a huge price jump for the iPhone as Apple would have to pay more for components and labor. And if Apple can't raise the price of the device to cover its higher costs, its margins will shrink. \"I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’ But we’re going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you’re liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It’s gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can’t, they can’t even start up, they can’t expand, they’re choking.\"-President-Elect Donald Trump during N.Y. Times interview It's still way too early to predict what will happen when Trump takes over. After all, his new tone with Apple is a far cry from the Boycott Apple stance he took during the campaign . Back then, he was upset with Apple for not unlocking the iPhone that belonged to a deceased terrorist. PhoneArena is on Instagram .

      "text": "Apple’s Frankenstein Holiday Ad Is All About Acceptance This Holiday   \nHappy holidays from Apple. Their new ad, featuring Frankenstein’s monster, is a touching way of including an outsider into festivities. Brad Garrett plays a lovable turn as the iconic horror novel and film creature, and his adventure is both charming and fresh. The monster gets a delivery in the mail, then goes to the village before a giant Christmas tree to open his package: a red and green lightbulb, which he affixes in the sockets on his neck to light up before he starts singing “(There’s No Place Like) Home For The Holidays”. Enjoy the spot, called “Frankie’s Holiday,” below.",

      "text": "November 22, 2016 \nWHOA. Apple just made a major announcement about Black Friday! \nOn November 25, Apple will finally offer special deals during the popular one-day shopping event. This is a big deal because Apple hasn’t offered Black Friday discounts on their products for the last two years. \nOne thing we do know, however, is that in-stock products ordered by 7:00 p.m. local time will qualify for free next-day delivery to the Borderlinx U.K. hub. Important Reminder \nKeep in mind that your Borderlinx USA address cannot be used to make purchases on the Apple U.S. website, but you can take advantage of Apple Black Friday sales on Apple’s U.K. website. \nHere’s how to order goodies from Apple U.K. on Friday with Borderlinx for international shipping. Ordering from Apple U.K. With Borderlinx \nStep 1 If you haven’t already, sign up for a free account with Borderlinx . You’ll instantly get your own forwarding address in the U.K. \nStep 2 At the checkout page from Apple’s website, enter your Borderlinx U.K. address as your delivery address. \nStep 3 When your Apple products are delivered to the Borderlinx U.K. hub, you can sign in to your account to pay for shipping, taxes & duties, and release your package to your home. \nStep 4 Depending on the delivery method you choose, your Apple products will be at your doorstep in two to five days. \nFor more information about Borderlinx, visit us at www.borderlinx.com . \nGood luck this Friday!",

      "title": "The European Commission this summer ordered Ireland to colle",
      "text": "The European Commission this summer ordered Ireland to collect from Apple $14.5 billion in “illegal tax benefits” that the country had granted the company over the course of a decade.\nIreland, the commission said, had allowed Apple to pay annual tax rates of between 0.005% and 1% on its European profits, far below Ireland’s 12.5% corporate tax rate. The commission ruled that Ireland’s tax arrangements with Apple were discriminatory.\nIt’s no secret that the global corporate tax world is twisted and corrupt, where the strong dominate. The more global a company is, the stronger it is and the less tax it pays. Apple is just one extreme example. It was revealed in 2012 that Google reported $10 billion in profits, some 80% of the total, in Bermuda.\nNo one of course suspects that the tiny Caribbean island earned Google such enormous profits. They were clearly diverted to the Caribbean tax shelter, presumably from Europe, using lenient tax mechanisms that countries such as Ireland and the Netherlands make available to multinationals.\nThe clash between the FBI and Apple has rekindled the public debate on the balance between privacy and protection. Reuters What is infuriating about these stories is not only the enormous scope of this corporate tax evasion, but also the fact that it is done openly. An individual who tried the same thing would no doubt be flagged by tax authorities and prosecuted.\nBut when Google and Apple do it, it is not tax evasion but rather tax planning. In other words, tax evasion is done under legal cover, and so it is perceived as legitimate. At least in the eyes of the legislators and multinational CEOs, tax diversion is legitimate, allowing them to increase their profits even more, to pay more dividends to satisfied investors and to fill the CEOs’ bank accounts with huge bonuses.\nCorporate tax planning is tax evasion \nEveryone is pleased with the method, save for those who pay for it — the middle class in liberal democracies. The middle class sees its jobs being sent abroad (where employers pay less tax), its government services reduced (as a result of the drop in tax collection) and its tax rates increase (for the same reason) while the bank accounts of the multinationals’ CEOs go into eight digits and they preach to others.\nCook told the Washington Post in August that what Apple is doing is legal. “It is the current tax law,” he said. “It’s not a matter of being patriotic or not patriotic. It doesn’t go that the more you pay, the more patriotic you are.”\nIn the same interview, Cook said Apple, which holds $180 billion in overseas tax havens, would be willing to return and to pay taxes in the United States, on condition the rate was “fair.” Need we mention that corporate tax rates around the world are lower than for wages?\nCorporate tax planning is clearly the center of global corruption today. The fact that a company like Apple can pay zero taxes in effect — legally — can only be considered an ethical failure on a global scale.\nThe problem is that everyone enjoys this failure — the multinationals, the capitalists who control them and the politicians who were elected with the help of the capitalists’ donations.\nAt some point, the middle class became fed up with being the only sucker who pays, and the result is Brexit, Donald Trump’s election, instability in the euro bloc and the growing likelihood that Marine La Pen will be elected president of France. All these developments are the outcome of a playing field that is tilted in favor of the strong.\nThe only question is whether the world will heed the warning lights. The European Commission’s precedent-setting ruling on Apple appears to be the first significant attempt to rein in the greed of global corporations, but the ruling related only to Ireland’s discriminatory conduct and not the root of the problem.\nThat root is Ireland’s extraordinary low 12.5% corporate tax rate, designed to attract capitalists, in this case the capital of multinationals, to Ireland. The basic discrimination, between taxing capital and taxing work, became so widespread that no one even fights it anymore.\nUndermining the social contract \nIt took a female leader, and a conservative one at that, to focus the spotlight on this fundamental inequality. British Prime Minister Theresa May, who entered office in the wake of the turmoil caused by the referendum vote to exit the European Union, called on Monday for changes to prove to the public that “capitalism can deliver them a better future.”\nMay called on British businesspeople to cooperate with the government in a fairer distribution of the fruits of capitalism, first and foremost through paying a fair tax but also through fairer corporate management. May was also critical of excessively high executive wages.\n“If we support free markets, value capitalism and back business — and we do — we must do everything we can to keep faith with them,” May said at a major business conference in Britain.\nAnd in the wake of the Brexit vote, she called to “change the way our country works — and the people for whom it works — forever.”\nMay’s interpretation was that Brexit was in fact a vote for fairer economics — not to eliminate the free economy but rather to return to an economy that advances freedom and equality for all.\nMay, who believes in the free economy, warned that if this economy won’t return to balance, it is liable to lead in the end to a much more extremist reaction.\nTo put it simply, May believes that a free, balanced economy is good for all, and first and foremost for business, only that businesses need to play the free market game freely to achieve this, and that means first of all paying their burden of the tax pie.\nFrench economist Thomas Piketty shook up the world two years ago when he forecasted that the free world was moving toward extreme inequality and economic imbalance and proposed that only a 70% tax on wealth is likely to balance the free economy. A moment before reaching the 70% tax rate, we can start with stopping the tax evasion by the wealthy.\nWe must recognize that tax planning is tax evasion, and only because of a political lobby is the former legal and the latter a criminal an offense. We need to admit that neither tax evasion nor tax planning is legitimate, and that they undermine the social contract of the liberal welfare state. We must realize that this situation does not change, then Brexit and Trump will be only the beginning of a very bumpy ride to come. And wealth will be hurt by this the most.\nMeirav Arlosoroff\nHaaretz Contributor \nMeirav Arlosoroff   Meirav Arlosoroff   Meirav Arlosoroff\n  NEW!

      "text": "• @MelissaCHolt \nNo joke: This may actually be my favorite feature of the new version of Apple’s mobile operating system. With Apple Maps in iOS 10 , users can now specifically indicate that we’d like to avoid toll roads, and…well…I may need a moment to collect myself here, because this has been a long time coming. I’m not saying that I asked Siri to navigate me somewhere under iOS 9 only to have it take me right along a pretty expensive toll road, oh no. That never happened . And that certainly never happened twice . No sir. Um, anyway, here’s how to avoid toll roads when navigating with Apple Maps ! \nTo manage how Maps deals with toll roads in iOS 10, head to the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad. From there, select Maps . \nFrom the Maps Settings page, find and tap on Driving & Navigation . \nAt the top of this page, you’ll see two types of roads which Maps can be configured to “avoid” when calculating directions: Tolls and Highways . By default, both options will be disabled. To instruct the Maps app to avoid either one, in our case that’s Tolls , just tap the corresponding toggle switch to enable it. \nWith Maps configured to avoid Tolls, your future driving directions will be updated to do just that, keeping you away from toll roads at the expense of potentially longer routes. Just in case you forget about this option, each set of driving directions will have a small note, as shown in the screenshot below, if “Avoid Tolls” is enabled. This lets you decide on the fly if paying the toll is worth it for a quicker trip. \nFinally, it’s important to note that when it comes to both tolls and highways, Maps will do its best to avoid these types of roads if possible . There may be some routes in which taking a toll road or highway is necessary, in which case the app will notify you when calculating the directions. \nSo with Maps in iOS 10, you now have a bit more flexibility to take the routes you prefer, and hopefully save some money, too. Drive safe out there! \n ",

      "title": "Appleâs iPhone 8 to feature wireless charging: Analyst",
      "text": "From the time Apple announced the making of iPhone 8, rumours and speculations about the phone is floating all around at a rapid pace. The latest rumour backs the previous claims of wireless charging feature. Ming-Chi Kuo, a noted KGI analyst has reiterated that the much talked about iPhone 8 will feature wireless support facility.\nThe analyst was noted saying that wireless charging adapters will be available only in the premium iPhone 8 models. Base model buyers need to buy the wireless charger as a separate accessory. The iPhone 8 is also speculated to come with a glass back in order to ensure fast wireless charging speed with minimum disruption.\nThis is not the first time that rumours related to iPhone 8’s wireless charging is floating in the air. An early leak also claimed that the wireless charging feature will enable upcoming iPhones to get charged from a distance of around 15 feet. This means that users need not have to use a wireless charging plate like the previous wireless technology has been.\nThe iPhone 8 is also rumoured to have curved, bezel-free displays next year. According to Barclays Research analysts, the 5-inch and 5.8-inch bezel-free iPhones with borderless design will allow for the new iPhones to be the same overall size as current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models, MacRumors.com reported.\n\"Larger and bezel-less iPhone 8 design did not sound 100 percent locked down but we believe the move is to a bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges in the original envelope,\" the report quoted analysts as saying. \nThere are reports that a bezel-free design by Apple will be achieved by removing the iconic Home button on the next iPhone.\nBarclays expects that the screen will extend vertically as well as horizontally.",

      "text": "Reddit \nA brief report in The Korea Economic Daily claims that Apple is working with LG on a new dual camera module ‘which enables 3D photographing.’ LG already supplies the dual-camera module used in the iPhone 7 Plus. \nThe LG Innotek system is said to be destined for one or more of next year’s iPhone models, but the report is unclear what 3D applications Apple might have in mind. Apple has patents for 3D object and gesture recognition going back many years. \nHowever, it is likely nothing more than the next generation of Portrait Mode , which uses parallax effect to create a 3D model of a scene in order to identify foreground and background in what is captured by the twin cameras. \nApple may be aiming to bring Portrait Mode to all iPhone models next year, which would require a more compact dual-camera module.

      "text": "\nQuick. Can you name the designer of the Porsche 911? How about the Rolex Submariner? The original Macintosh?\n\nMichael Gartenberg has covered the personal technology beat for more than two decades at places like Gartner, Jupiter Research and Altimeter Group. Most recently, he spent a few years at Apple as Sr. Director of Worldwide Product Marketing.\nLast week on The Talk Show , John Gruber and Jason Snell were discussing the new Designed by Apple in California book when the subject turned to Jony Ive. Off the cuff, Gruber said:\nI've heard that he has lately been checked out or not as directly involved with product design and that he's been largely focused on architecture, meaning the spaceship campus and the new stores. And that maybe the other top-level executive who's been working the most with Ive is Angela Arhendts.\nJohn (disclaimer, he's a friend of mine) clarified his remarks on Daring Fireball , but the rumors were already running rampant. It's what happens in the tech world. Ask Marco Arment. Or Rene Ritchie.\nBut back to Jony Ive.\nJony Ive is not Apple design Have you ever been inside Apple's design lab? Ever seen the design team? Probably not. There are a lot of folks on the design team. There are a lot of folks who work for people on the design team, and even more folks who work for the people that work for the people on the design team. See where I'm going? Jony Ive is a brilliant person that I've had the privilege to interact with during my time at Apple. He's awesome, both as the designer we know, and as a person to talk to. But he's not Apple design.\nOne of the things Apple has prized itself on, driven by the late Steve Jobs, is the idea of surprise and delight. Part of the allure is the allure. That's why Apple keynotes were so masterfully crafted.\nIt takes more than two people to make a great design If you ever sat in on a keynote when Steve was still alive, you probably felt, as I did, that he had been working all night in his garage on some amazing device or piece of software, only finishing in the darkness of the early morning, and then immediately drove up to Moscone in San Francisco in his Mercedes SL to share it with you. Just you.\nLikewise, there was a Jony Ive video where he would tell us just how special the design was of whatever the thing was that we all wanted. That was pretty much it. Even senior execs like Phil Schiller were relegated to serving as Ed McMahon to Steve's Johny Carson. It was a two man show, and that worked well for a very long time. Now, it's working against Apple.\nIf Jony Ive has plans to spend the rest of his career designing Christmas trees with no ornaments, it doesn't really matter. There is a lot more to Apple than Mr. Ive. There is a lot more to Apple than even Steve Jobs.\nWill Sir Ive take a step back? Was the Apple book truly a final celebration of his work? Seriously ... Who cares?\nThe legacy is everyone There's so much more to Apple than any one person. So much more than any one designer. The legacy of Steve Jobs, perhaps the eventual legacy of Jony Ive, is about the teams and people they have put in place. They are the unsung multitudes that have always been a crucial part of Apple's success.\nOne day, be it soon or in the far flung future, we'll hear the last of Jony Ive's tales of how an Apple product came to be. Either way, the work will keep going on.\n",

Every watch Apple has manufactured up until September 2016 falls under this designation.\nWhat models fall under Series 0? 38mm & 42mm Sport: Silver, Space Grey, Gold, and Rose Gold aluminum 38mm & 42mm Watch: Silver and Space Black steel 38mm & 42mm Edition: Gold and Rose Gold 16k gold 38mm & 42mm Hermes: Single Tour, Double Tour (38mm only), and Cuff (42mm only) What are the dimensions of the 38mm and 42mm cases? 38mm: 38.6mm x 33.3mm x 10.5mm (height x width x depth) 42mm: 42mm x 35.9mm x 10.5mm What are the features of Series 0? An aluminum, steel, or 16k gold case S1 single-core system-on-a-chip IP7 water resistance, or \"splash-proof\" Ion-X glass or Sapphire crystal display and composite or ceramic back OLED Retina Display (450 nits* brightness) Up to 18 hours battery life Runs watchOS 3 *Nit = Unit of measurement that measures the light from a single candle. Thanks, Apple !\nWhat's it missing? Series 0 watches are different from Series 1 and 2 like so:\nThey run on a single core processor They don't have a GPS antenna They're not \"swim-proof\" (resistant up to 50m/150 feet) No direct fire speaker (a speaker that ejects water after you've been swimming) Sport watches don't have ceramic backs (composite only) Retina display isn't as bright (450 nits vs 1000 nits) Will I be able to run all my apps on a Series 0 watch? There's currently nothing in watchOS 3 or the developer documentation that would bar you from running an app on a Series 0, 1, or 2 watch. It may run more sluggishly on a Series 0 wearable, but you should still be able to launch it without problems.\nAnything else? Series 0 models have been discontinued from sale, so if you own an original Apple Watch, you now own a limited-edition piece of the company's history. If you have an Hermes Cuff watch, this is doubly so: Both the Cuff and the Cuff version of the watch have been discontinued in Series 2.\nEverything you need to know about Series 1 \nRather than keep Series 0 watches around as entry-level models, Apple has revamped the processor and released a new version of its original design.\nWhat models fall under Series 1? As Series 1 is designed solely as an entry-level option, the only casings available are the low-cost Sport aluminum designs. If you want a steel casing, you'll have to pick up a Series 2 watch.\n38mm & 42mm Sport Silver Aluminum with White Sport Band 38mm & 42mm Sport Space Gray Aluminum with Black Sport Band 38mm Sport Gold Aluminum with Concrete Sport Band 42mm Sport Gold Aluminum with Cocoa Sport Band 38mm Sport Rose Gold Aluminum with Pink Sand Sport Band 42mm Sport Rose Gold Aluminum with Midnight Blue Sport Band How much does a Series 1 Apple Watch cost? 38mm watches are $269, while the 42mm version is $299.\nWhat are the dimensions of the 38mm and 42mm cases? 38mm: 38.6mm x 33.3mm x 10.5mm (height x width x depth), weighing 25g 42mm: 42.5mm x 36.4mm x 10.5mm, weighing 30g What are the features of Series 1? An aluminum Sport casing S1P dual-core system-on-a-chip IP7 water resistance, or \"splash-proof\" Ion-X glass display and composite back OLED Retina Display (450 nits brightness) Up to 18 hours battery life Runs watchOS 3 What's it missing? Series 1 watches are different from Series 0 and 2 like so:\nThey run on the same dual-core processor as Series 2 They use the S1P system on a chip because they don't have a GPS antenna They're not \"swim-proof\" (resistant up to 50m/150 feet) No direct fire speaker (a speaker that ejects water after you've been swimming) They don't have ceramic backs (composite only) Retina display isn't as bright (450 nits vs 1000 nits) They're a tad bit thinner and lighter (10.5mm vs 11.4mm for Series 2), with 25g weight for the 38mm Series 1 Sport vs 28.2g for the Series 2 Sport. When are they available? You can pre-order a Series 1 Apple Watch on September 9, or pick one up outright on September 16.\nShould you buy a Series 1 Apple Watch? If you have a Series 0 Apple Watch, the main reason to upgrade to Series 1 would be to get the dual-core processor; until we've done more thorough testing on what kind of speed and battery benefits you'll receive, I can't definitively recommend upgrading.\nIf you have no Apple Watch and are debating between a Series 1 or Series 2, the question is whether GPS, swim resistance, and a ceramic back is worth a $100 increase in price. If you want to dip your toe into the Apple Watch ecosystem and don't plan to do much run-tracking or swimming, you can easily grab a Series 1 watch and enjoy the same internal performance improvements.\nIf money is no object, keep in mind that Series 1 is limited to the Sport aluminum casing; if you want a steel or ceramic casing, Hermes edition, or Nike+ edition, you'll want to invest in a Series 2 watch.\nEverything you need to know about Series 2 \nSeries 2 is the latest and greatest in Apple Watch, and encompasses the current Sport, Steel, Hermes, Edition, and Nike+ versions of the watch.\nWhat models fall under Series 2? 38mm & 42mm Sport: Silver, Space Grey, Gold, and Rose Gold aluminum 38mm & 42mm Nike+: Silver and Space Grey aluminum with custom Sport bands 38mm & 42mm Watch: Silver and Space Black steel 38mm & 42mm Edition: Ceramic with Cloud Sport band 38mm & 42mm Hermes: Single Tour, Double Buckle Cuff (38mm only), Double Tour (38mm only), and Single Tour Deployment Buckle (42mm only) How much does a Series 2 Apple Watch cost? These are the base prices for each model; specialized bands or anodizations will bump up the price.\nSport: $369 for 38mm, $399 for 42mm Watch: $549+ for 38mm, $599+ for 42mm Edition: $1249 for 38mm, $1299 for 42mm Nike+: $369 for 38mm, $399 for 42mm Hermes: $1149+ for 38mm, $1199+ for 42mm What bands/accessories can you pair with the watch on purchase? Sport \nSport band Woven Nylon Steel \nSport band Leather bands (Classic Buckle, Modern Buckle) Link bracelet Edition \nCloud Sport band + Magnetic Charging Dock Nike+ \nCustom Nike Sport band with perforations (not sold separately) Hermes \nSingle Tour Single Tour Deployment Buckle (42mm only) Double Tour (38mm only) Double Cuff (38mm only) All Hermes watches additionally come with a custom Orange Hermes Sport band.\nWhat are the dimensions of the 38mm and 42mm cases? Sport \n38mm: 38.6mm x 33.3mm x 11.4mm, weighing 28.2g 42mm: 42.5mm x 36.4mm x 11.4mm, weighing 34.2g Steel/Hermes \n38mm: 38.6mm x 33.3mm x 11.4mm, weighing 41.9g 42mm: 42.5mm x 36.4mm x 11.4mm, weighing 52.4g Ceramic \n38mm: 39.2mm x 34mm x 11.8mm, weighing 39.6g 42mm: 42.6mm x 36.5mm x 11.4mm, weighing 46.5g What are the features of Series 2? An aluminum, steel, or ceramic casing S2 dual-core system-on-a-chip GPS antenna Water resistance to 50m/150 feet, or \"swim-proof\" Direct fire speaker that ejects water after a swim Ion-X glass (Sport or Nike+) or sapphire crystal display (Steel, Ceramic, Hermes) and ceramic back (all models) OLED Retina Display (1000 nits brightness) Up to 18 hours battery life Runs watchOS 3 What's different? Series 2 watches are different from Series 0 and 1 like so:\nThey sport a dual-core processor (50% faster than the single core and 2x as fast for graphics) They use the S2 system-on-a-chip, which includes a GPS antenna They're swim-proof They have a direct fire speaker (which ejects water after you've been swimming) All models have ceramic backs Retina display is more than twice as bright as other models (1000 nits vs 450 nits) They're bigger and heavier (11.4mm depth vs 10.5mm for Series 0/1), and weights range from 28.2g on the 38mm Sport to 46.5g on the 42mm Ceramic. (In contrast, the Series 1 38mm Sport weighs 25g.) When are they available? You can pre-order a Series 2 Apple Watch Sport, steel Watch, or ceramic Edition on September 9, or pick one up outright on September 16.\nThe Apple Watch Hermes will be available for pre-order on September 9, and in stores late September, while Nike+ will be available in late October.\nShould you buy a Series 2 Apple Watch? If you have a Series 0 Apple Watch, there are a few reasons to upgrade to a Series 2 model, including the faster chip, GPS, and higher water resistance. If you care about either of the latter two, the watch is a pretty great upgrade; if you're only in it for speed and battery benefits, I can't definitively recommend upgrading until we've done more thorough testing on what kind of speed and battery benefits you'll receive vs Series 0.\nIf you have no Apple Watch and are debating between a Series 1 or Series 2, the question is whether GPS, swim resistance, and a ceramic back is worth a $100 increase in price. If so, the Series 2 is a no-brainer: Starting at $369, it's the best version of Apple's smartwatch yet, and with new apps like Pokemon Go and Sky Guide set to further expand its abilities, it's a great model with which to enter the Apple Watch ecosystem.\nSeries 2 is also your only option for special versions of the watch, like the Nike+, Hermes, or Ceramic Edition models.\nQuestions? Still have questions about how Series 0, Series 1, and Series 2 of the Apple Watch differ? Let me know below.\n",

      "text": "Sure, it may be essentially a full year until Apple drops its next iPhone upgrade, but that doesn't mean we can't all get overly excited for it. And thankfully, thanks to the whispers filling the corridors of the internet, a picture of the tentatively named iPhone 8 is already being building up. It already appears to be pretty certain the next handset will switch to an OLED display, but well-know Apple leaker Ming-Chi Kuo has also delivered another report about the upcoming model. In a fresh research note obtained by MacRumors, Kuo indicates that the Cupertino giant will drop an all-glass device in 2017 in order to enable support for wireless charging. Oh, and because it's really pretty, probably. This switch will sweep aside any wireless charging issues which can arise with a metal body, and of course return the company to the familiar design of the iPhone 4, which featured a glass rear. Related: Apple CONFIRMS it's back in the Black Friday game As Kuo writes in his note: \"In order to ensure a superior performance, we believe it is most appropriate for EMS suppliers to develop and make the wireless charger because then a comprehensive test can be conducted. \"As Hon Hai needs to deploy most resources to develop and produce [an] OLED iPhone, we expect Pegatron will be the exclusive supplier of the wireless charger.\" This isn't the first time we've heard such rumours, with another report recently indicating Apple will look to take wireless charging to the next level and allow you to avoid being tethered to a dock. Kuo also hinted that the wireless charger could come packaged alongside the iPhone 8, though even he isn't entirely confident in that. Of course, despite his impressive record, there's no guarantee that Kuo's information is accurate. With such a long time to go before anything becomes official, plans are also still subject to change. In other words: add a pinch of salt to any report you hear while simultaneously dreaming of a glass design and wireless charging. ",

      "title": "Here's what Donald Trump said to Apple's Tim Cook",
      "text": "With just under two months until the President-elect is inaugurated, you can imagine the phone at Trump Tower is ringing off a non-existent hook. Just how The Donald recognises and works with the technology industry is, like a lot of things, completely up in the air right now. Thankfully, though, when he sat down with some of the editors of The New York Times this week, Trump admitted that he's already spoken with Apple CEO Tim Cook. Cook, of course, was on Hillary Clinton's list of potential VP candidates, while Trump has previously called for a boycott on Apple products. What could go wrong? Well, in Trump's description of the conversation (via The New York Times' transcript of the same), it all seemed eerily smooth. \"I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here,'\" he said (while inevitably adding China-drop). Trump added: \"He said, 'I understand that.' I said, 'I think we'll create the incentives for you, and I think you're going to do it. We're going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you'll be happy about'.\" If you can picture Tim Cook in his Cupertino office with a gawped expression, that probably isn't too far from the truth. After all, the incentive or motivation for Apple to do what Trump is proposing just doesn't exist. Even if a tax break does come, bear in mind that Apple already keeps most of its cash overseas anyway. Labour is also more reliable and cheaper outside the US, as well infrastructure already being in place on a wide scale and supply chains already being established. So, yeah, the conversation probably left Tim Cook in mind of current internet meme 'Who What Where', which comes from the song below. It raises a good point: how *did* we get right here? ",

      "text": "Apple has dominated and captured a crushing record 91 percent share of all smartphone profits worldwide. Strategy Analytics, a research firm, has published its latest research which shows global smartphone profits reached US $9 billion during the third quarter of 2016. Apple has dominated and captured a crushing record 91 percent share of all smartphone profits worldwide.\nDirector of Strategy Analytics, Linda Sui, stated, “We estimate the global smartphone industry realized total operating profits of US $9.4 billion during Q3 2016. Apple dominated and captured a record 91 percent share of all smartphone profits worldwide. Apple’s ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits. Huawei, Vivo and OPPO are the next three most profitable smartphone vendors globally this quarter, but they are still a long way behind Apple.”\nExecutive Director at Strategy Analytics, Neil Mawston, added, “We estimate Huawei generated US $0.2 billion of smartphone operating profit worldwide in Q3 2016. Huawei captured 2 percent share of all smartphone profits, taking second spot overall, and becoming the world’s most profitable Android vendor for the first time ever. An efficient supply chain, sleek products and effective marketing have been among the main drivers of Huawei’s robust profitability.”\nMawston further added, “Vivo and OPPO followed in third and fourth place and each took 2 percent global profit share. Vivo and OPPO delivered relatively healthy profitability due to disciplined pricing and soaring shipments across Asia.”\nLinda Sui added, “Three of the world’s top four most profitable smartphone vendors are currently Chinese. Huawei, Vivo and OPPO have not only improved their smartphone product lineups this year, they have also enhanced their operational abilities and kept a tight lid on expanding distribution costs.”",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThere has been plenty of jeering aimed at Apple’s as-yet unreleased AirPods — the fully wireless Bluetooth earphones announced at the iPhone 7 event — but you can bet plenty of iPhone owners will be eager to get their hands on them, whether their iPhone has a headphone jack or not. When Apple makes a move, everyone takes notice, and that includes entrepreneurs like Jack Kim. He is banking on wireless earbuds being the next big thing. \nKim reckons that Apple is bringing the fully wireless earbud category into the mainstream, and he may be right. There are already piles of fully wireless earbuds making their way to market this year, including many from crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo. They may have a fighting chance, too. \nThe AirPods are tiny, and thanks to the lack of a tether, they’ll be pretty easy to lose. They will also need to be stored in a charging container, which will need to be charged after every 24 hours of use, and the AirPods themselves after every five hours of use. They are not expected to sound significantly better than Apple’s regular EarPods, or at least, Apple has not made any claims that they will. And they will cost a cool $159. This adds up to a big opportunity for anyone who can provide a good alternative. \nAccording to Kim, now is the perfect time to try to capitalize on this momentum with a competitive product that places a heavy emphasis on brand. His solution is his $89 AirPod competitor, the Aero Flux . \nThe Aero Flux may be half the price of Apple’s AirPods, but will potential buyers actually compare these two products? \nKim’s confidence is somewhat audacious given that he freely admits to having no experience with hardware products prior to his short-lived experiment selling used PC laptops as ready-to-run Hackintoshes . But hardware experience isn’t necessarily a requirement when you’re buying off-the-shelf components from China and reselling them under your own brand. “It’s genuinely hard to start a hardware business from scratch,” he explained, noting that to do so requires a lot of money he doesn’t have. Instead, he intends to follow many other companies using the so-called OEM (original equipment manufacturer) strategy, sourcing his product from other manufacturers with “the simple belief that if I sell the equal quality (perceived for genuine) for half the price, people will buy.” \nThe Aero Flux may be half the price of Apple’s AirPods, but will potential buyers actually compare these two products? A quick search through Amazon for “ wireless earbuds ” reveals at least a dozen similar products with prices that range between $25 – $199, including a $99 product called Jabees BTwins that is identical to the Flux. So identical in fact, you can make out where Kim has tried to remove the Jabees brand from his lead product image and replace it with his own Aero logo. Kim will be one of countless entrepreneurs pitching AirPods competitors. In fact, U.K. reviewer Craig Bradshaw made the comparison when he tested the BTwins , asking if they’re an “AirPods Killer?” \nThe good news for Kim and his prospective Flux customers is that Bradshaw liked the Jabees earbuds, though he noted dropped Bluetooth signals and call quality were issues: “Making and receiving calls on these earbuds is almost a no go,” he wrote. \n“The thing that I’m selling is the experience, the design, and the customer support,” Kim said. Customer support, as it turns out, amounts to a hassle-free returns policy. If you don’t like your Aero Flux earbuds, just send them back for a full refund. Kim’s cost on the Flux is so low, he said he might be willing to let unhappy customers keep the Flux and not bother shipping them back, something which would just cost Kim more money. “It comes with insurance,” he said. \nActual technical support will likely be hard to come by if you buy the Aero Flux. After all, Kim is not a hardware guy, something which became very clear when we pressed him on the Flux’s full tech specs, and whether or not it supports Bluetooth codecs like Qualcomm’s aptX , which promises to offer near-CD resolution wireless sound for compatible devices. “That’s the first I’ve heard of it,” he said, despite the fact that aptX is rapidly becoming standard in the wireless headphone space. \nHe described the Flux’s sound quality as “pretty good,” but then added a qualifier: “Sound isn’t as good as a Bose earphone,” pointing to the pair of Bose in-ear units he was using for our Skype session. “Compared to these, it lacks a lot.” What does the Aero Flux offer? Four hours of playback or talk time, which can be extended to 16 hours via the charging case’s battery, a water-resistant design, and something the pre-order page refers to as “AeroBoost,” which claims to give the Flux two times more bass boost than other earphones, though that claim is tough to qualify. \nKim is nothing if not fully transparent about his hopes for the Aero brand, and told us that the strategy is to sell as many of these earbuds as possible, ruthlessly competing on price if that’s what it takes to get massive amounts of sales: “I’m prepared to make just a dollar per piece to undercut everyone and get critical mass.” \nUltimately, he hopes this will give him the financial leeway to stop slapping the Aero brand on existing OEM products and start working on ODM (original design manufacturer) relationships to build products according to his own specs. \nIf you’re feeling skittish about dropping $89 for a product that has no reviews, from a brand that didn’t exist until a few weeks ago, Kim thinks you should consider that most of the other Chinese-made products that sell really well on Amazon started the same way. \nMaybe Kim’s onto something — perhaps all it takes to sell your product is a differentiated brand around which customers can develop an affinity. Writing for Entreprenuer.com, Jim Joseph said, “ We don’t fall in love with products — we fall in love with brands .” If he’s successful, Kim will join the ranks of Amazon, Monoprice, and Costco , all of whom sell products that are virtually identical to others on the market, under their own brand, often for less money. Until then, Kim said he’ll keep selling high-quality OEM products under the Aero brand. “It’s not that I want to, I have to.” Also watch: Looking for a place to park?

      "text": "| News \nApple’s Black Friday deals in Australia are in, and they’re free gift cards with a purchase. This is very likely to be what Apple is doing in the U.S. and other countries further behind the date line. The company is offering AUS$35 gift cards with an Apple Watch, up to $70 with an iPhone, up to $140 with an iPad, and a $200 gift card with a Mac. \nThe gift cards work out to a 5-14% discount, depending on the device you get, with most falling in the 10-12% range. Or, looked at another way, you can get a free Apple Pencil (AUS$145)   an iPad Pro (9.7-inch). Black Friday Green Banner Replaced with Red Banner \n\nI popped through the store, and on categories defined as “up to,” one must, of course, buy the more expensive devices to get the maximum gift card. For instance, iPhone SE comes with a $35 gift card, while iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come with a $70 gift card. \nAll Apple Watches come with a $35 gift card and all qualifying Macs come with a $200 gift card. Load Her Up \nI also found that gift cards were included with every device I added to my cart, as shown below, rather than being limited to one-per-transaction. Sample Shopping Cart with Multiple Devices \nMy best guess is that U.S. gift cards will be roughly 25% less face value. Say, US$20-$25 with an Apple Watch, $50-$60 for an iPad, and maybe $150 with a new Mac. We’ll know in a few hours. Share this:",

(Pic: Reuters) \nDonald Trump has not always been an Apple Inc. fan, especially while running for the President of the United States. However, the President-elect has said that he spoke to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates after the win. In an interaction with The New York Times, Trump talked about the content of the calls, of which the newspaper has put out a transcript. During the infamous battle between Apple and FBI regarding data security, Trump had tweeted and spoken against the company calling for a boycott of its products. Funnily enough, the boycott calls were made using his Apple iPhone. He had also said that he will make Apple make its ‘damned computers’ in the USA and not in China. Amidst all the fights, Apple CEO Tim Cook was said to have called Trump after the election results. NYT quoted Trump as saying, “I was honoured yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation. I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple.” \nTrump revealed that he told Apple CEO, Tim Cook, to build plants and products in the US. He said, “Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.” Meanwhile, Tim Cook said he understands that, and Trump said that the company would be given incentives in the form of ‘very large tax cuts’. Trump had said, “But we’re going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you’re liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It’s gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can’t, they can’t even start up, they can’t expand, they are choking.” \nAlso read | Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Donald Trump \nAccording to Japanese website Nikkei Asian Review, Foxconn, the manufacturing partner for Apple was studying the probability of moving production of the iPhones to the US. But it will not be an easy task to move the labour and well-settled supply chains from China and Vietnam. Tim Cook had earlier reportedly said that China is a preferable manufacturing place because of the ‘skill’ not ‘wages’. This makes the thought of such a drastic change a bit of a stretch even with new political pressures.  ",

And judging from a recent patent, Apple might already have the glass body for the next iPhone, and it could even give up on metal entirely. Discovered by CultofMac, the patent called “Glass enclosure” seems to define a completely new category of products, and not just the iPhone. The same “glass enclosure” could be used on iPhones, iPods, and iPads, as it allows different form factors, sizes, an...",

      "text": "Tweet \nAfter years of avoiding getting in on the Black Friday action, 2016 sees Apple finally letting its hair down and joining in with everyone else. Earlier in the week we learned that there were some treats in store , and today we can reveal what they are. \nIf you were hoping to save some money on a new MacBook Pro (2016) or to bag yourself a cheap iPhone, you're going to be disappointed. Apple is not offering any Black Friday discounts whatsoever; instead the company is giving away gift cards worth up to $150 with every order placed. So here's the lowdown. \nUnsurprisingly, to qualify for a $150 gift card, you're going to need to part with a decent chunk of cash in the first place. In fact, you'll need to buy a MacBook, a MacBook Pro, a MacBook Air, and iMac or a Mac Pro -- meaning spending at least $999. \nIf you buy an iPad, you can earn yourself up to $100 worth of gift cards while select iPhones come with a $50 gift card. $25 gift cards are also bundled with Apple Watch Series 1 purchases, and Apple TV. \nWhile it's great to see Apple taking part in Black Friday, it's hard to imagine that people won’t be a little disappointed with the 'one day shopping event' . If you were already in the market for any of the devices included in the offer, it’s a good time to buy -- if you were going to buy a MacBook Pro anyway, a $150 gift card thrown in is not to be sniffed at! -- but most people probably would have preferred to see a bit of money shaved off the selling price instead. \nHit the Apple Store to find out more.",

Earlier in the week we learned that there were some treats in store, and today we can reveal what they are. If you were hoping to save some money on a new MacBook Pro (2016) or to bag yourself a cheap iPhone, you're going to be disappointed.

      "text": "Apple Already Designed a Glass Body for the iPhone 8 GO Patent reveals glass enclosure that could be used next year Nov 25, 2016 08:38 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Rumor has it that the iPhone 8 is likely to come with a glass front and back and a metal frame, as Apple is looking into a design that reminds of the iPhone 4. And judging from a recent patent, Apple might already have the glass body for the next iPhone, and it could even give up on metal entirely. Discovered by CultofMac , the patent called “ Glass enclosure ” seems to define a completely new category of products, and not just the iPhone. The same “glass enclosure” could be used on iPhones, iPods, and iPads, as it allows different form factors, sizes, and shapes. According to the patent, the technology that Apple developed is a “handheld computing device that includes an enclosure having structural walls formed from a glass material that can be radio-transparent. The enclosure can be formed from a hollow glass tube or two glass members bonded together. A laser frit bonding process may be used to hermetically seal the two glass members together to create a water resistant electronic device.” Water resistance and no antenna lines This abstract section of the patent tells pretty much everything about how this could work, including why glass is a much better choice than metal. Basically, a glass construction improves radio signals as well, so an iPhone that would adopt this glass enclosure would no longer need antenna bands. Furthermore, such an approach could continue Apple’s investments in water-resistant devices, so the sealing the company would use can make the iPhone fully waterproof. Of course, a patent is by no means confirmation that an iPhone made entirely of glass is on its way, but at least it provides us with a glimpse into how Apple sees the future of its “computing devices.” The iPhone 8 is projected to launch in the fall of 2018, and it will mark the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. This is one of the reasons Apple is trying to roll out a major overhaul, including what’s likely to be a bezel-less approach that would have the display incorporating all front-facing parts, including the camera and the Home button.",

      "text": "Apple: Open your heart to everyone Apple: Open your heart to everyone Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + In the hours leading up to what will probably be the biggest and busiest shopping event ever , Apple has taken a moment to remind us about the truly important things in life. Instead of a loud holiday sale call to action, the iPhone maker has a different kind of message for us today.In an eerie new video titled \"Frankie's Holiday\", we see Frankenstein as an embodiment of those who we perceive as different, strange, alien, perhaps even a bit creepy. And just like society tends to react with distress whenever such elements enter our world, so do the people in the video, who've gathered to celebrate in the center of a tiny town, become anxious as Frankenstein appears to join the other folk in the festivities. OPEN YOUR HEART TO EVERYONE But as it so often turns out, the mature voices of reason can often get weathered, or troubled, by life and its many burdens. This video is also a reminder to not lose touch with the quieter, yet divinely benevolent voice within, like the voices of those who're yet to be exposed to the worldly matters. The point here is utterly clear: there is no innate harm in being different, or accepting the different; we can all be a little more inclusive, and a little more tolerant.We know this lesson well, but we can't deny it has this peculiar habit of fading somewhat as time goes by, and as we keep ourselves distracted with our daily affairs. Perhaps this is precisely where the most magical time of the year comes in â to give us a gentle, friendly nudge to remember.",

So as we noted yesterday, you’re basically being offered a reward of up to $150 on products you probably already bought or don’t want to buy. \nHere’s what’s on offer: $25 on Apple Watch series 1 $25 on Apple TV $50 on iPhone SE/6s/6s Plus $100 on iPad Pro (both sizes)/Air 2/mini 4 $150 on the older Macs shown below \nThe eligible Macs are: 13-inch MacBook Pro (old model only) 15-inch MacBook Pro (old model only) MacBook Air iMac Mac Pro \nNote too that you can’t apply the gift card value to the purchase itself, so it’s only useful if you plan other purchases from Apple. \nWhile the new Touch Bar MacBook Pro models are in too high a demand for deals, you can find better deals on everything else on Amazon and 9to5Toys .

      "text": "During the infamous battle between Apple and FBI regarding data security, Donald Trump had tweeted and spoken against the company calling for a boycott of its products. Funnily enough, the boycott calls were made using his Apple iPhone. (Pic: Reuters) Donald Trump has not always been an Apple Inc. fan, especially while running for the President of the United States. However, the President-elect has said that he spoke to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates after the win. In an interaction with The New York Times, Trump talked about the content of the calls, of which the newspaper has put out a transcript. During the infamous battle between Apple and FBI regarding data security, Trump had tweeted and spoken against the company calling for a boycott of its products. Funnily enough, the boycott calls were made using his Apple iPhone. He had also said that he will make Apple make its ‘damned computers’ in the USA and not in China. Amidst all the fights, Apple CEO Tim Cook was said to have called Trump after the election results. NYT Quote: d Trump as saying, “I was honoured yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation. I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple.”\nTrump revealed that he told Apple CEO, Tim Cook, to build plants and products in the US. He said, “Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.” Meanwhile, Tim Cook said he understands that, and Trump said that the company would be given incentives in the form of ‘very large tax cuts’. Trump had said, “But we’re going for big tax cuts, we have to get rid of regulations, regulations are making it impossible. Whether you’re liberal or conservative, I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. It’s gotten to be a free-for-all. And companies can’t, they can’t even start up, they can’t expand, they are choking.”\nAlso read | Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Donald Trump\nAccording to Japanese website Nikkei Asian Review, Foxconn, the manufacturing partner for Apple was studying the probability of moving production of the iPhones to the US. But it will not be an easy task to move the labour and well-settled supply chains from China and Vietnam. Tim Cook had earlier reportedly said that China is a preferable manufacturing place because of the ‘skill’ not ‘wages’. This makes the thought of such a drastic change a bit of a stretch even with new political pressures.",

      "text": "Apple’s desktop and mobile operating systems provide a full suite of applications that allow you to do most of what you want without downloading any additional apps. You can browse the web, send and receive email, manage calendars and contacts, and much more, all with the stock apps included in macOS and iOS.\n\nBut on macOS, you have the choice to not use those apps. Say you want to use Microsoft Outlook instead of Apple Mail; you can make this change, and when you click a link to send an email, Outlook will open. Or if you want to use Chrome instead of Safari, the same thing will happen: URLs you click will open in Google’s browser.\n\nIn macOS Sierra, change the default web browser in the General pane of System Preferences. To change the default email client, go to Mail’s General preferences.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "Apple's special Black Friday shopping event is now live in the United States and Canada, offering customers free Apple Store gift cards worth up to $150 or CA$200 with the purchase of selected Apple products today only.\nThe offers are available through Apple's website and retail stores in both countries. Each customer is limited to two gift cards per product category. Refurbished products and educational store purchases do not qualify.\n\nU.S. rebate amounts include:\n- *Macs $150*: iMac, Mac Pro, MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro (excluding late 2016 models)\n- *iPad Pro $100*\n- *iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4 $50*\n- * iPhone 6s and 6s Plus $50*\n- *iPhone SE $25*\n- *Apple Watch Series 1 $25*\n- *Apple TV $25*\n\nThe one-day promotion is also ongoing in the United Kingdom (up to £120) and elsewhere in Europe, including Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany , Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe event runs for a little longer in Australia and New Zealand, where Apple is offering gift cards worth up to AU$200 or NZ$215.\n\nApple's offers are rather lackluster considering better Black Friday deals are available on select iPhones, iPads, and Macs from authorized resellers such as B&H Photo Video and MacMall. Moreover, many of Apple's newest products such as the iPhone 7 and MacBook Pro with Touch Bar are not eligible for the gift card promotion.\nRelated Roundup: Black Friday\nTag: Apple retail\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "text": "It’s expensive being an Apple fanboy. Not only do you typically pay a premium for Cupertino’s latest hardware, but Apple’s accessories can often also cause sticker shock. Fortunately, when it comes to shopping for accessories, the Apple Store isn’t your only source.\nMore: All the best Black Friday deals\nWhether you’re looking to pair your newly minted iPhone with wireless headphones or simply need to restock on a few Lightning cables, we’ve rounded up some awesome accessory deals for everything from your iPhone to your MacBook. We will add to these over time and swap out deals, plus several are for Black Friday only, so make sure you’re quick if you want to get the best prices.\nNyloon Apple Watch Straps nyloon More We featured Nyloon’s strap in our roundup of the best available for the Apple Watch , and continue to enjoy wearing one. The company has a deal for Black Friday where if you buy two, you get a third free, complete with free shipping. Normally, this package would cost $120, but this deal gets you the three straps for $80. Choose your straps from the online store , add them to your basket, and use the code BlackFriday2016 to get the discount.\nPad & Quill cases and straps padquill More Pad & Quill regularly appear in our best-of lists regarding Apple iPhone cases and Apple Watch straps , and Black Friday is your chance to pick up your choice of accessory with 15-percent off. The deal is available until Cyber Monday, and is the company’s only sale of the year, so it’s worth getting in quick. We particularly like the Field Strap for the Apple Watch, currently at $85 rather than $100, and the Bella Fino leather folio case for the iPhone 7 Plus, down to $68 from $80. When you’ve chosen, make sure to use the code BF2016 for an additional 5-percent discount on the above prices.\nApple Pencil for iPad Pro View photos\n13696634_xxlg_0 More Your iPad Pro isn’t just another tablet, so don’t get just another stylus for it.

That includes the iMac and Mac Pro desktops, as well as the 12-inch MacBook, the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro. However, the deal doesn't seem to apply to the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models. \nApple Black Friday Deals Shop Now Apple \n\nBuying an unlocked iPhone SE, iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus will net you a $50 gift card — there's no deal for the new iPhone 7 , unfortunately. You'll get a $100 gift card for buying an iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 4. Finally, buying either an Apple TV or various Apple Watch models will net you a $25 credit. \nOverall, Apple's Black Friday deals don't seem hugely compelling, particularly since they don't apply to some of the company's best and newest pieces of hardware. However, if you planned on buying an iPad, Apple TV or any other of the above gadgets anyway, that free gift card could prove invaluable during your holiday shopping. \nSee Also : 15 Hottest Gadget Gifts of the Year \nHere's the Best Black Friday Phone Deals from Each Carrier How to Get the Best TV Deals on Black Friday Smartphone Buying Guide About the author Michael Andronico @MikeAndronico Mike Andronico is an associate editor at Tom's Guide.

      "text": "Getty \nIt's Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year. \nAnd Apple's AirPods, the new wireless headphones that were supposed to launch a month ago, are nowhere to be found. \nApple originally said the $159 AirPods would launch in October, but it announced a delay with only a few days left in the month . \n\" We don't believe in shipping a product before it's ready, and we need a little more time before AirPods are ready for our customers,\" Apple said in a statement at the time. \nThe delay is well deserved. While the AirPods are a clever concept, I've experienced some glitches and odd use cases for them with the pre-production model Apple let me borrow. My biggest complaint is that there's no easy way to control volume and music playback. \nFor example, if you want to raise the volume, you have to double tap one of the AirPods, which activates Siri and pauses your music. Then you have to tell Siri to raise the volume. Then your music starts playing again. It's an awkward solution at best, especially when the wired EarPods that come with the iPhone have those handy buttons for audio controls. \nI've also experienced some various issues with the AirPods' Bluetooth connection. Sometimes the audio cuts out or the microphone doesn't work when I'm trying to answer a call. (Again, I've been testing pre-production units, and Apple has said it won't release a product before it's ready, so I feel pretty confident these issues are being ironed out now.) \nThere's no headphone jack on the iPhone 7, so you have to use Lightning headphones or wireless headphones. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider \nStill, the AirPods delay is a rare setback for Apple. After making the controversial decision to eliminate the headphone jack in the iPhone 7, it pitched AirPods and other wireless headsets as the future of audio. But that doesn't do anyone much good if customers have to wait indefinitely for the AirPods to launch. \nApple hasn't given a firm launch date for the AirPods, but some analysts have spoken to the company's components suppliers and believe the headsets will go into full production in December , just in time for Christmas.",

The source also added that the 9.7-inch iPad might be too small for the segment, with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro being seen as too expensive a purchase – necessitating for the new iPad size. \nIt is believed that the 10.5-inch version of the iPad will be shipping with Apple’s A10X CPU, which also powers the iPad Pro. Shipments of the new iPad version will be reaching two million units in Q1 2017, with 5-6 million total units being shipped in a years period, the source said, according to the Digitimes report. \nApple is also expected to launch a lower-priced version of the 9.7-inch iPad that will help the company compete with more reasonably priced Android tablets. \nAn earlier report by MacRumours quoting an Asia supply chain source said that Apple will be launching a 10.9-inch version in 2017 with a bezel-less design. According to the report, the 10.9-inch iPad with its bezel-less design will have the same footprint as the current 9.7-inch model, and might not feature the home button on the front of the tablet. \nRead: Apple maintains top spot in shrinking tablet market: Report \nJapanese blog Macotakara has said that the iPad Pro 2017 will have a 12MP camera with a dual-tone flash along with a P3 display resolution. The new iPad Pro series will come equipped with quad-microphones, and will still be shipping with the 3.5mm headphone jack. \nA Barclays report says that a new 9.7-inch iPad Pro might also be on the cards as a low-cost version. Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with KGI Securities expects big changes (like an OLED display) to only feature in the iPad series in 2018. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:",

      "text": "Twitter \nFor the first time in several years, Apple has refreshed the MacBook Pro line Apple Unveils New Touchy-Feely MacBook Pro Apple Unveils New Touchy-Feely MacBook Pro Apple has taken the wraps off of its brand new MacBook Pro. It's a beautifully designed piece of hardware, with several innovative touches and some annoying caveats potential buyers will have to beware. Read More . The newest model’s headline feature is the Touch Bar, a small touch-screen strip at the top of the keyboard that replaces the function keys. Since this strip is context-sensitive for the app you’re working with, it has potential to be a new way of interacting with your computer. \nHowever, there’s a massive price barrier to trying the new Touch Bar. The cheapest model, at $1,500, doesn’t even include the new feature. You’re looking at $1,800 just for the base model with the Touch Bar, and that doesn’t include all the money you’ll be spending on dongles Apple Is Forced to Make USB-C Dongles Cheaper Apple Is Forced to Make USB-C Dongles Cheaper Apple has cut the price of its USB-C adapters. Because it turns out people still use USB-A and HDMI, and don't want to pay top dollar to use their own peripherals. Read More since the new machine only has USB-C ports. \nThankfully, skillful developers have stepped in and provided a way for you to try out the Touch Bar for free. Their Touch Bar Demo App is a free download that lets you use the Touch Bar on-screen on any MacBook or desktop Mac. If you don’t mind spending a bit of time on the setup, you can also get it running on your iPad. \nFollow the demo instructions to get the app running on your Mac. You’ll need to make sure that you’re running the latest version of macOS, which has Touch Bar support. Then download the ZIP file from the release page. \nThis contains TouchBarServer.zip , which enables you to run the Touch Bar demo on your Mac. Simply drag it to your Applications folder like you’d install any other software The Best Mac Apps The Best Mac Apps From email clients to system utilities, time savers to productivity boons; on this page you'll find the best Mac software used by MakeUseOf staff and readers alike. Read More , and press the Fn key to toggle the Bar. To get the iPad app running, continue to follow the developer’s instructions and you should have everything up in just a few minutes. \nAre you interested in the Touch Bar, or is the new MacBook Pro too expensive for your tastes? Let us know what you think of the demo! \nImage Credit: Hadrian via Shutterstock",
