Terry McAuliffe announced that the tech company’s expansion of a data center in Mecklenburg County will create 44 new jobs. \nMicrosoft’s total investment in the site now tops $2 billion since 2010. \nMcAuliffe approved a $500,000 grant for the expansion. The state’s tobacco fund approved nearly $1 million for the project. The governor’s office said it competed with other potential sites for the expansion. \n ",

      "text": "Microsoft’s CEO Playing It Safe with President-Elect Donald Trump GO Satya Nadella publishes statement after US elections Nov 10, 2016 08:28   Donald Trump is the new President of the United States, and as we told you yesterday, this isn’t exactly the best news for technology companies , as the Republican candidate pledged for changes that do not entirely align with what the likes of Microsoft and Apple want to do in the future. While Apple has always been more vocal, mostly because of its direct dispute with the FBI over the San Bernardino iPhone that the government wanted the company to hack, Microsoft tried to remain as neutral at possible, despite its own lawsuit with the US over search warrants for information stored overseas. Satya Nadella himself wanted Microsoft to be friends with everyone, and that’s exactly his position after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. Looking forward to working with president-elect In a statement released today, Nadella congratulates Donald Trump in a statement that says very little about how Microsoft sees the next four years with the new President at the helm of the country. Furthermore, Nadella is playing it safe and says the Softies “look forward to working” with the newly elected candidates. “Yesterday we witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US. The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees. We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday,” he says. “Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture. With that in mind and looking to the future, Brad Smith today outlined in a blog Microsoft’s thoughts and recommendations for the new Administration and Congress.” At the first glance, Satya Nadella is doing the right thing, as Microsoft needs to be in good terms with the United States government, especially now when Donald Trump becomes the President. And the statement provided today comes in line with what Nadella has said in the past, adopting the same gentleman approach that the CEO of the company is so appreciated for. But at the same time, Microsoft might also be settings itself apart from other companies who aren’t the biggest supporters of Donald Trump, as it’s the case of Apple. Both Microsoft and Apple fought for the same goals several times in the past, and going forward together is the thing that tech firms need to do right now, so it’ll be interesting to see how all companies react to Donald Trump’s winning of the presidential race.",

Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture,” Nadella added. According to The Verge , “Nadella may be congratulating President-elect, but he’s also crossing his fingers that Trump doesn’t follow through on some of his tech-adverse campaign promises.”\nThe statement was extremely carefully worded to ensure that it did nod offend any political side during a time when the dependence and relationship between the Technology industry and White House is straining. These strains are the result of constant debates and court battles on important issues like encryption and user privacy. It is evident that Microsoft like all other tech companies is worried by this straining relationship and instead wants to work with the White House to continue the ties.\nWith inputs from IANS \n \nThe post Satya Nadella congratulates Donald Trump on becoming the 45th US president appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "title": "Microsoft rolls out another firmware update to fix new Surface Pro 3 battery glitches",
      "text": "siMicrosoft has effectively (and quietly) discontinued the summer 2014-released Surface Pro 3 while you were expecting a fifth iteration of the moderately successful 2-in-1 detachable tablet that never came . But of course, just because the old Haswell-based 12-incher is listed as out of stock at Redmond’s e-store for quite some time now, it doesn’t mean there aren’t alternate ways of procuring it.\nAt pretty great prices, no less, from $500 or so as far as the entry-level configuration is concerned to around $650 on Amazon right now with a 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM, and Intel Core i5 processor in tow.\nEven if no new takers show interest in the classical Windows 10 powerhouse, Microsoft has an obligation to a relatively large and vocal existing user base to continue supporting their software demands and fixing firmware shortcomings.\nA little while back, a very serious battery flaw was ironed out after a long wait, but it only took a few weeks for an eerily similar glitch to be reported on a different batch of Surface Pro 3 units. Thankfully, all problems should finally be behind owners of convertibles with both Simplo and LG Chem cells inside now, as a second system firmware update arrives to ensure “battery capacity is accurately reported.”\nNo more draining all your energy in a couple of hours or having to always use the third-gen Surface Pro plugged in. At least theoretically, once you perform your routine manual “Check for updates” in Settings – Update & security – Windows Update. Let’s hope this is truly the end of nagging firmware mishaps. For good.\nThe post Microsoft rolls out another firmware update to fix new Surface Pro 3 battery glitches appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

Terry McAuliffe announced that the tech company's expansion of a data center in Mecklenburg County will create 44 new jobs.\nMicrosoft's total investment in the site now tops $2 billion since 2010.\nMcAuliffe approved a $500,000 grant for the expansion. The state's tobacco fund approved nearly $1 million for the project. The governor's office said it competed with other potential sites for the expansion.",

      "text": "Microsoft’s Bing prediction engine has been mostly flawless until now, as it correctly “guessed” the outcome of several events, sports games and movie awards, so it wasn’t so surprising to see the service predicting the winner of the US presidential race . What was more surprising, however, was that Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, even though Bing Predicts gave him just 10 percent chances to win the race. Although this is clearly a big fail of its prediction engine, Microsoft has an excuse that pretty much makes sense. The company says that Bing Predicts is based on online trends, so it’s hard to always be accurate, especially in the case of the US presidential elections where charts appear to have changed at the last minute. “Bing Predicts uses several sources including search, web, social data, third-parties and more to inform predictions. True to the nature of all predictions, we can never guarantee 100% accuracy,” the company was quoted...",

      "text": "Microsoft has released its new Windows 10 Creators test version which can let a user control external monitors from tablets without attaching a mouse. “Use it just like you would a physical touchpad to control content on the connected screen,” software engineer Dona Sarkar said in a blog. A user can press and hold on the taskbar and select “show touchpad button” to enable the feature. According to Mary Jo Foley, who watches Microsoft for CNET sister site ZDNet, there are very few new features in the test build. Foley noted “Sticky Note” updates, including support for “Insights” in more languages.",

      "title": "Microsoft files a patent enabling Surface Pen wireless charging via accessories",
      "text": "This appears to be a week of published patents as news of a single Microsoft invention has surfaced among a sea of recently published inventions by Apple. Microsoft’s latest patent, “ Inductive Peripheral Retention Device ,” was filed in September and details accessories for the company’s Surface Pen that not only keeps the tool strapped to a Windows 10 device, but recharges it in the process.\nThe first batch of images provided in the patent illustrates a rounded accessory with a USB connector. As shown below, the design is rather simple, showing the Surface Pen seated within the accessory’s rounded portion and docked alongside a Windows 10 device. However, the patent also shows the pen/accessory combo plugged into the USB port of a desktop monitor so the Surface Pen is easily accessible without cluttering the desktop space.\nMicrosoft Patent Image 1 More Microsoft’s patent is based on inductive (wireless) charging. The loop portion of the accessory consists of an inductive element that is bent to form a flexible loop. This element includes perforations and traces, the latter of which carry an electrical current. It is housed within fabric so the Surface Pen has a comfortable fit, and connects to the USB jack’s circuit board inside what Microsoft describes as the “peripheral securing portion.”\n“The plug is securable to and removable from the device using one or more hands of a user,” the abstract states. “The apparatus also includes a peripheral securing portion connected to the plug and configured to removably engage a peripheral device via an inductive element formed as a flexible loop and configured to form a communicative coupling between the peripheral device and the device, which may be used to support charging of the apparatus.”\nMicrosoft Patent Image 2 More The patent also goes on to illustrate a detachable keyboard with a flexible hinge for Surface devices. As illustrated above, this peripheral includes a mid-spine section between the keyboard area and the computing device connection portion that consists of three inductive coils. Thus, the user could simply place the Surface Pen down into this narrow region for a wireless recharge. The Surface Pen could also receive a charge if placed in a pen clip that is secured to the flexible hinge.\n“This may be utilized to charge the stylus, transfer data (e.g., to authenticate the peripheral device), and so on,” the patent states. “Further, flux flow lines may also support a rotationally invariant shape such that the flexible hinge may move yet still support the communicative coupling.”\nRead More More: Microsoft patent hints at AR/VR combination headset\nThe authors behind Microsoft’s filed patent include Timothy Allen Jakoboski, Shiu Sang Ng, and William H. Standing. Microsoft Technology Licensing is listed as the assignee.\nGiven that this patent is merely in the filing stage, its current state does not mean Microsoft is not working hard to bring this invention into the hands of customers. However, right now, the new patent serves as a glimpse of the avenues Microsoft is taking to provide a great computing experience to customers with the least number of physical cords.\nApple’s patent for a VR headset looks a lot like Samsung’s Gear VR The newest Surface driver update hopes to fix battery life, touch, pen, and more Wireless charging is the iPhone's future, if Apple's patent filings are to be believed",

      "text": "Microsoft Reassures That Office Will Work On Chrome OS  25 PST \nEarlier this week there were reports that made it sound like Microsoft was blocking access to its Office apps on Chrome OS computers. To be more specific, there were owners of the Asus Flip and Acer R11 Chromebooks who were reporting that they were getting error messages like, “unsupported on this device” when they tried to run the app. \nNaturally this led to speculation that Microsoft did not want their Office apps to be compatible on Chrome OS devices. However the good news is that for whatever reason that caused the error message, Microsoft has since issued a statement to reassure users that Office apps will continue to work on Chrome OS devices. \nThe statement reads, “Our strategy has not changed. Office for Android is supported on Chrome OS devices via the Google Play Store. While Google Play on Chrome OS is in beta, we are partnering with Google to deliver the best experience for Chromebook users and plan to make the apps available on all compatible devices by general availability.” \nIn case you might have forgotten, Chrome OS will now support Android apps. Microsoft’s Office apps are on Android which means that in turn, they should work on Chrome OS as well. However as Microsoft points out, Google Play on Chrome OS is still in its beta stage meaning that there are kinks that need to be worked out, but otherwise it’s business as usual.",

      "text": "Microsoft Prediction Tool Gave Donald Trump 10% Chances to Win Presidential Race GO Bing Predicts projected an easy win for Hillary Clinton Nov 10, 2016 09:54 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft’s Bing prediction engine has been mostly flawless until now, as it correctly “guessed” the outcome of several events, sports games and movie awards, so it wasn’t so surprising to see the service predicting the winner of the US presidential race. What was more surprising, however, was that Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, even though Bing Predicts gave him just 10 percent chances to win the race. Although this is clearly a big fail of its prediction engine, Microsoft has an excuse that pretty much makes sense. The company says that Bing Predicts is based on online trends, so it’s hard to always be accurate, especially in the case of the US presidential elections where charts appear to have changed at the last minute. “Bing Predicts uses several sources including search, web, social data, third-parties and more to inform predictions. True to the nature of all predictions, we can never guarantee 100% accuracy,” the company was quoted as saying. Donald Trump, only 10 percent chances to be elected President As WinBeta notes, Bing Predicts considered Hillary Clinton as the next US President from the very beginning, and at some point, the service gave Donald Trump only 10 percent chances of winning the race. Of course, there are many possible reasons why the prediction engine failed so badly, and one could be the fact that it relies mostly on online sources. A similar thing happened with voting polls in the United States as well, as most predicted Hillary Clinton to be elected President, so Bing Predicts might have fallen into the same trap as the others. There are people out there who believe that Trump supporters either didn’t express their opinions before the vote or if they did, they misled the pollsters by expressing support for Clinton. Of course, these are just suppositions, but it’s another living proof that prediction services cannot be entirely accurate, at least not just yet. And Microsoft’s makes no exception.",

      "text": "Read Comments \nMicrosoft has sent out a firmware update for the Surface Pro 3 that it says fixes the battery life and charging issues that have plagued the device. \nThe release is dated November 7 and \"corrects the firmware component that functions as a 'fuel gauge' so that the battery capacity is accurately reported,\" according to the company. \nBack in August, Surface Pro 3 owners began reporting a range of battery issues with the high-end hybrid, including complaints that the device was unusable unless plugged in. \nIt was initially thought that the problems related to a batch of the devices that shipped with Simplo batteries, although it was subsequently discovered that Surface Pro 3's with LGC cells were also affected. \nFull release notes can be found on Microsoft's Surface Pro 3 update history page , where the company writes: \n\"On a limited number of Surface Pro 3 devices, an error condition occurs that causes the full charge capacity of the battery to be misreported to the operating system and device firmware. When this condition occurs, the system no longer charges the battery to its full actual capacity, and the Surface is unable to function on battery power. \n\"Once this fix is applied to a Surface Pro 3, the reported full charge capacity will self-correct over the next several charge and discharge cycles. Surface Pro 3 devices that previously experienced the problem can now operate on battery power, and the issue won’t occur on devices that haven't experienced the issue.\" \nTo install the update, simply navigate to Start > Settings > Update & security > Windows Update on your Surface Pro 3, then click Check for Updates. \nYou'll then see the option to install a new System Firmware Update, dated November 7. \nMicrosoft notes that users should only initiate the update when plugged into AC power, and not unplug their device while the installation is in progress. \nNews of the update follows Microsoft's October 2016 event, where it unveiled a new member of its Surface family, the Surface Studio . \nWATCH: Microsoft October event highlights \nHave you experienced battery issues with the Surface Pro 3?

      "text": "In March, we heard about what sounded like a dramatic plot from a movie with words like secret meeting, isolated island and assorted billionaires strewn around. Add to that Republican senators, biggest tech companies and Donald trump, and it could get all the more interesting. The meeting reportedly included Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google co-founder Larry Page, Sean Parker, and Elon Musk, among others. The closed meeting reportedly had dignitaries discuss how to stop Donald Trump from getting nominated. We soon heard about the open letter in which over 100 tech entrepreneurs had made their intentions quite clear on how they stand against Donald Trump’s divisive candidacy calling him a disaster to innovations .\nIn the past one year during the run-up for US presidential elections, one thing we know for sure is that Silicon Valley doesn’t want to see Trump in office. Now, a day after the presidential elections, with Trump being elected as the President, here’s what tech companies have to say.\nLet’s begin with Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg who was called out by Trump for pushing for more H1-B visas. He has penned down a post post elections that says how everyone needs to work harder towards ‘curing all disease, improving education, connecting everyone and promoting equal opportunity’.\n\nIt was in the Obama era that we saw some serious technological advancements and growth, with smartphone and social media becoming important as other lucrative fields such as automobiles. And, many are uncertain yet hopeful that things could better. Microsoft’s Indian-born CEO Satya Nadella has also said that he looks forward to working with all those elected.\nIn a post on LinkedIN, Nadella said, “We witnessed the democratic process in action here in the US. The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees. We congratulate the president-elect and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.”\nThe Verge , points out “Nadella may be congratulating President-elect, but he’s also crossing his fingers that Trump doesn’t follow through on some of his tech-adverse campaign promises.”\nPeter Thiel, Silicon Valley investor and one of the very few voices supporting Trump said “Congratulations to President-elect Donald Trump. He has an awesomely difficult task, since it is long past time for us to face up to our country’s problems. We’re going to need all hands on deck. A page in the book of history has turned, and there is an opening to think about some of our problems from a new perspective. I’ll try to help the president in any way I can.”\nSalesforce CEO tweeted out congratulatory message that reads, “Congratulations President Trump. This is what makes America great—our democracy. Now is the time for us to come together as one country.”\nCongratulations President Trump. This is what makes America great—our democracy. Now is the time for us to come together as one country.\n— Marc Benioff (@Benioff) November 9, 2016 \n\nAOL co-founder Steve Case has clearly voiced his disappointment on the win.\nI am surprised & disappointed. But now that the people have spoken, we should accept the result & work together to move the country forward.\n— Steve Case (@SteveCase) November 9, 2016 \n\nJack Dorsey seems to be one of the most outspoken.\nI commit to using the privilege I currently have to always speak this truth to power, and to ensure the common good leads everything we do.\n— 🚶🏽jack (@jack) November 10, 2016 \n\nHowever, Tim Cook did pen down a letter to Apple employees on ‘moving forward together’. “We have a very diverse team of employees, including supporters of each of the candidates. Regardless of which candidate each of us supported as individuals, the only way to move forward is to move forward together,” he wrote in the letter.\n“While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed. Our products connect people everywhere, and they provide the tools for our customers to do great things to improve their lives and the world at large. Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love,” the letter further reads.\nTrump had once called to boycott Apple products , while he spoke off anti-trust problems with Amazon. There has no word from like Tesla, Amazon yet.\nThe post President Trump: What Microsoft, Facebook and other tech CEOs said appeared first on Tech2 .",

The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees,” Nadella said in a statement posted on Microsoft-owned LinkedIn on Wednesday. \n“We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture,” Nadella added. \nAccording to The Verge, “Nadella may be congratulating president-elect but he’s also crossing his fingers that Trump doesn’t follow through on some of his tech-adverse campaign promises.” \nIANS",

Microsoft Edge running on Windows 10 x64 Red Stone 1.\nQihoo 360, a China-based security firm was the first to hack Edge on Windows 10. Followed by them, South Korean security researcher JungHoon Lee, aka “lokihardt” hacked Edge after only 18 seconds. Microsoft is offering them $120,000 basic reward and $20,000 extra reward for gaining system-level code execution on Edge.\nAccording to The Register, Qihoo reworked their Edge bug in about 30 hours after Microsoft fixed three of their four vulnerabilities in its Patch Tuesday update just before the event.\nMicrosoft will get the details about the exploits and they will fix them in the future updates to protect its customers.",

      "text": "Corporate giants Microsoft Ventures, a unit of China’s HNA, India’s Tata, GE Ventures and Qualcomm Ventures will join forces with Tel Aviv University and Israel’s Pitango Venture Capital to set up a new $20 million fund to invest in Israeli startups that are developing Internet of Things (IOT) technologies, the university said. The new consortium will be called Israel IoT Innovations – i3 Equity Partners (“i3”). It was set up by the five corporations together with Pitango and the Tel Aviv University, via its RAMOT technology transfer company. The aim is to invest in early-stage Israeli ventures and help them develop into entities playing in the global arena, the statement said. Tapping into the know-how of the Israeli tech industry will also help the consortium members grow their business in IoT, which is already penetrating and changing many areas of human life, according to the statement.\nThe new initiative “will be the first stop for IoT-related startups looking to access the main global players in the IoT space,” said i3 managing partner Noga Kap. “With our unique and proprietary network we will look for entrepreneurs who are adapting to changing markets in the IoT domain, and creating products that matter. Leveraging our partners’ strategic experience and extensive IoT industry connections, we will provide our portfolio companies with the resources they need to build great businesses.”\nIllustrative photo of the Tel Aviv University campus. (Andrew Tobin)\nThe i3 collaboration plans to fund three to five high-potential seed and pre-seed startups annually with a financial investment of up to $1 million each. Selected companies will also benefit from technology, tools, mentoring, business development and other services, the statement said.\nThe companies will also benefit from the support of the multinational corporations for technology validation, design, proof-of-concept, later-stage investments, and ultimately the purchase of mature technologies and their distribution in high-potential markets – including China and India.\nThe i3 venture will be located at Tel Aviv University, enabling startups to be close to the campus with its multiple research and service centers.\nThe Internet of Things industry – which injects connectivity and software into objects and appliances, is poised to see nearly $3.7 billion in funding globally this year, New York data company CB Insights said in an October report, compared to $1.4 billion in 2012 and $3.5 billion in 2015. Corporate investors as well as VC funds have piled money into startups, with GE Ventures among the top investors in the field.\nHNA Eco-Tech, a subsidiary of China’s HNA, is a high-tech holding group which specializes in cloud, big data and IoT technologies. India’s Tata is a global multi-industry enterprise including over 100 companies.\n“This one-of-a-kind collaboration of some of the world’s largest corporations with Israel’s leading academic institution and largest venture capital fund is a testament to their trust in the ability of Israeli entrepreneurs to come up with the next big thing that will transform our world,” said i3 chairman Shlomo Nimrodi, who is also the CEO of RAMOT.\n ",

      "text": "ANALYSIS: \nAs the dust began to settle on Donald Trump’s momentous election victory, leaders from across the technology industry gave their verdicts , which ranged from despair to defiance to acceptance. Microsoft is the latest company to issue a formal response to the election, with president and chief legal officer Brad Smith noting that “this is a time for the nation to come together.”\nIt’s clearly not in any company’s interests to criticize the outcome of the election — there is little it or anyone else can do about the result. “Every president-elect deserves our congratulations, best wishes and support for the country as a whole,” said Smith, in a blog post . “The peaceful transition of power has been an enduring and vital part of our democracy for over two centuries, and it remains so today. As a company, Microsoft joins many others in congratulating President-elect Donald J. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence.”\nSmith outlined four issues that the company believes are key above all else in terms of how the U.S. government will address information technology moving forward.\nOne was about being more inclusive, and addressing the “plight of those who feel left out and left behind,” meaning helping those without a college education use technology to gain new skills and connect with new jobs. Tying in with this, Smith pointed to the need for new labor laws, benefits, and a “stronger safety net” for those working part-time or working for themselves as part of the so-called gig economy. “While the problem is clear, potential solutions are manifold and more than anything, we need to come together to pursue them,” he said.\nSmith also referred to improving infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, which can be improved with the help of big data analytics . But one of the more telling statements, one that was specific to Trump’s previous musings on immigration, was that more than a third of Microsoft’s engineers have come to the U.S. from almost 157 countries. “We have employees from every race, ethnic background and religion,” said Smith. “If there’s a language spoken on the planet, there’s a good chance that it’s spoken by an employee at Microsoft. And we’re committed to promoting not just diversity among all the men and women who work here, but the type of inclusive culture that will enable people to do their best work and pursue rewarding careers.”\nSmith also addressed the need to strike a “balance” between privacy and safety. “It will remain important for those in government and the tech sector to continue to work together to strike a balance that protects privacy and public safety in what remains a dangerous time,” he said. “As this election demonstrated, technology now plays a ubiquitous role in our daily lives. But people will not use technology they do not trust.”\n“Coming together” Technology played a key role in shaping the election — both Facebook and Twitter both faced criticism for the way in which misinformation was spread on social media. But Trump hasn’t spoken all that much about technology itself, so it’s not clear what his presidency will mean for the big players such as Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. Trump has criticized Amazon in the past over a “huge anti-trust problem,” there are concerns about Trump’s attitude to surveillance and encryption, and he has also suggested a one-time 10 percent tax on American money held abroad to encourage companies to repatriate earnings held outside the U.S. But the bottom line is we don’t really know what impact a Trump presidency will have, either on the technology industry, or the country as a whole.\nSome prominent figures in the technology realm were abrasive and downbeat with their reaction to the election result yesterday, with Hyperloop One cofounder Shervin Pisheva calling for independence for California, while Googler and investor Adam Singer noted that the “party is probably over for Silicon Valley” given that a Trump presidency could lead to a recession. But broadly speaking, there is a common thread emerging across the board: cohesion and collaboration will get everyone through.\nThe notion of “coming together” is a sentiment that was shared by other tech leaders, with Apple CEO Time cook saying that “the only way to move forward is to move forward together,” while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked about “finding new ways for all of us to work together.” Elsewhere, AOL founder said that “we should accept the result and work together to move the country forward,” and tech investment banker Frank Quattrone added: “we’re a resilient, creative, collaborative nation.”\nRegardless of what outcomes the Trump presidency will herald, companies and citizens have to run with it and fight whatever battles they encounter along the way. “While we all need to do more to support those who haven’t moved forward in recent years, we share the conviction that this is a time to bring the entire nation together,” said Smith. “And that means everyone, with an appreciation for the spirit of generosity and mutual respect that has often represented the best of the American spirit.”\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "Microsoft closes zero-day exploit in November Patch Tuesday by Tom Walat Site Editor Microsoft's November Patch Tuesday seals a zero-day vulnerability, while Windows administrators seem to be taking October's debut of the new rollup servicing model in stride. This Article Covers Share this item with your network: Related Content Monthly Windows rollup: Simplification or loss of ... – SearchSecurity \nServer administrators should give particular attention to several of the 14 security bulletins in Microsoft's November Patch Tuesday, including a rare SQL Server patch and the well-publicized zero-day exploit. Last month's major change in how administrators apply updates, however, has not wrought the havoc that some had feared. \n\"I talked with a few people and there was interestingly not much reaction either way, either good or bad,\" said Amol Sarwate, director of vulnerability labs for Qualys Inc., in Redwood City, Calif. There may be more of an uproar in the future, he added, if a rollup causes serious compatibility issues that affect a wide number of users. \nMicrosoft introduced a \"rollup\" patching system last month for several operating systems, including Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016 -- which was released to general availability on Oct. 25. \nBefore the October changes, administrators could add and remove individual patches if problems arose. The rollup model removes this flexibility by putting all security and non-security updates into a single package, similar to the cumulative update model used for the Windows 10 client operating system. Microsoft said the rollup model should reduce issues from \"fragmentation,\" where systems can have different updates that could lead to problems such as increased scan times and dependency errors. \nDepending on the severity of the issue with a system after applying a rollup, the administrator can wait for Microsoft -- or a third-party vendor -- to deliver a fix or the uninstall the update themselves. Three updates for Windows Server administrators \nFor this month's fixes, server administrators should be aware of six vulnerabilities in several SQL Server components that Microsoft addressed in bulletin MS16-136, Sarwate said. On an unpatched system, an attacker could take advantage of a vulnerability to gain elevated privileges, then manipulate data or create a new account. While not a critical update, this warrants special attention due to the rarity of patches for this particular product. \n\"SQL Server doesn't get patched very often,\" maybe once or twice a year, but \"it does have some vulnerabilities,\" Sarwate said. \nMicrosoft closed a zero-day vulnerability with security bulletin MS16-135. The update closes a hole in kernel-mode drivers in all supported releases of Windows. While only rated important by Microsoft, the bulletin caught Sarwate's interest because it has been actively exploited in the wild. The vulnerability got widespread attention after Google publicized it in a blog on Oct. 31. \n\"It affects the kernel, and there had been no patches for it so far. I think it is an important patch for servers as well as desktops,\" Sarwate said. \nThe final patch worth consideration of server administrators is MS16-130, which is a critical bulletin affecting all supported releases of Windows. The update closes exploits in several core Windows components, such as the Task Scheduler and how Windows loads dynamic-link libraries. Sarwate said most administrators know they should not open image files, which could trigger the exploit on an unpatched server operating system, but should apply the patch to be safe. New servicing model comes with new terminology \nIn addition to the technical changes, Microsoft has changed the terminology of the patching schedules. The second Tuesday of the month -- commonly known as Patch Tuesday -- Microsoft now calls its \"B week\" update. Microsoft refers to the third Tuesday of the month as the \"C week\" update when administrators can get a \"preview rollup\" of non-security fixes coming in the next \"B week\" update. Theoretically, this preview will allow IT to apply this update to systems in a testing environment to check for potential issues. \nThere are two rollups issued during \"B week\": a \"security-only quality update\" consisting of new security fixes for the month and a \"security monthly quality rollup\" that includes the security fixes for the current month and all previous monthly rollups. \nFor more information about the remaining security bulletins for November Patch Tuesday, visit the Microsoft's Security TechCenter site . \nTom Walat is the site editor for SearchWindowsServer.com .

      "title": "Windows 10 is getting a virtual touchpad for external displays",
      "text": "Microsoft built Windows 10 with touchscreens in mind, but there are times when you want to use an external monitor with a touchscreen device. You will soon be able to do that without having to use a mouse thanks to Windows 10’s new virtual touchpad.\nIf you have a touchscreen Windows 10 device — like a Surface Pro tablet — plugging it into an external monitor gives you more room to be productive. The only problem is, you need to add a mouse and keyboard if you want that monitor to extend your desktop and not just mirror it.\nSoon, you won’t actually need a physical mouse. Windows 10 build 14965, which is available now to registered Insiders, adds a virtual touchpad that lets you control content on an external display from your touchscreen device.\n“Use it just like you would a physical touchpad to control content on the connected screen,” Microsoft explains.\n“To enable it, press and hold on the taskbar and select “Show touchpad button”. A touchpad icon will now appear in the notification area (just like Windows Ink Workspace does), and tapping on it will bring it up the virtual touchpad.”\nNot just for external displays The touchpad won’t just be useful for external displays, either. There are times when you need the precision of a mouse on a touchscreen device, and the touchpad allows you to get that when all you have to interact with your Windows 10 device is your fingertips.\nIn addition to the touchpad, build 14965 brings an improved Sticky Notes app, Windows Ink Workplace enhancements, a better address bar in the Registry Editor, and more. You can get your hands on it now if you’re a Windows Insider.\n\n\nSource : Microsoft ",

      "text": "Microsoft Pen Certification Awarded to Consumer Market Laptop Computer with UniPixel Touchscreen Sensors   08:00   SANTA CLARA, Calif. , Nov.   UniPixel, Inc. (NASDAQ: UNXL ), a provider of Performance Engineered Films™ to the touchscreen and flexible electronics markets, today announced a consumer market laptop device with a UniPixel touchscreen sensor was awarded Microsoft Pen Digitizer Certification ensuring that the application and device are compatible with Windows and will run reliably on the Windows 10 operating system and Windows Server 2016. After passing certain tests, the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program allows device manufacturers to use the Windows logo as part of their marketing. End-users trust the Windows logo as a sign of compatibility. Enterprise and government customers also look for the logo, or consult the Microsoft Certified Products list or the server catalog to see what systems, components and peripherals have been tested to ensure interoperability and reliability. Jalil Shaikh , chief operating officer of UniPixel, commented, \"We are encouraged that a leading systems integrator submitted a product, which included a UniPixel touchscreen sensor, for Windows Pen Digitizer Certification, and was granted the certification. The stylus protocol in this device is similar to the stylus protocol employed in the Microsoft Surface device. This was the first time that a new device featuring a UniPixel metal mesh touchscreen sensor was submitted for certification.\" Mr. Shaikh continued, \"It is an important development because the accelerating popularity of the Microsoft Surface platform and the active stylus protocol built into the Windows 10 operating system are major drivers of new touch penetration into 2-in-1 conventional laptop device categories. We expect other systems integrators and computer manufacturers to increasingly seek this certification to promote the stylus capabilities built into their next generation products. This certification demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our XTouch sensors to support the Microsoft Pen Protocol.\" About UniPixel UniPixel, Inc. (NASDAQ: UNXL ) develops and markets Performance Engineered Films for the touchscreen and flexible electronics markets. The Company's roll-to-roll electronics manufacturing process patterns fine line conductive elements on thin films. The company markets its technologies for touch panel sensor, cover glass replacement, and protective cover film applications under the XTouch™ and Diamond Guard™ brands.

      "text": " UniPixel, Inc.\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. UniPixel, Inc. (NASDAQ: UNXL), a provider of Performance Engineered Films™ to the touchscreen and flexible electronics markets, today announced a consumer market laptop device with a UniPixel touchscreen sensor was awarded Microsoft Pen Digitizer Certification ensuring that the application and device are compatible with Windows and will run reliably on the Windows 10 operating system and Windows Server 2016.\nAfter passing certain tests, the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program allows device manufacturers to use the Windows logo as part of their marketing. End-users trust the Windows logo as a sign of compatibility. Enterprise and government customers also look for the logo, or consult the Microsoft Certified Products list or the server catalog to see what systems, components and peripherals have been tested to ensure interoperability and reliability.\nJalil Shaikh , chief operating officer of UniPixel, commented, \"We are encouraged that a leading systems integrator submitted a product, which included a UniPixel touchscreen sensor, for Windows Pen Digitizer Certification, and was granted the certification. The stylus protocol in this device is similar to the stylus protocol employed in the Microsoft Surface device. This was the first time that a new device featuring a UniPixel metal mesh touchscreen sensor was submitted for certification.\"\nMr. Shaikh continued, \"It is an important development because the accelerating popularity of the Microsoft Surface platform and the active stylus protocol built into the Windows 10 operating system are major drivers of new touch penetration into 2-in-1 conventional laptop device categories. We expect other systems integrators and computer manufacturers to increasingly seek this certification to promote the stylus capabilities built into their next generation products. This certification demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our XTouch sensors to support the Microsoft Pen Protocol.\"\nAbout UniPixel\nUniPixel, Inc. (NASDAQ: UNXL) develops and markets Performance Engineered Films for the touchscreen and flexible electronics markets. The Company's roll-to-roll electronics manufacturing process patterns fine line conductive elements on thin films. The company markets its technologies for touch panel sensor, cover glass replacement, and protective cover film applications under the XTouch™ and Diamond Guard™ brands.

      "title": "Microsoft fixes Surface Pro 3 battery problems, again",
      "text": "The Surface Pro 3 has had a series of issues around its battery life. There are two brands of battery used inside Microsoft's tablets: Simplo and LG. A bug meant that Simplo-equipped systems were seeing their battery life reduced to a handful of minutes , and this was fixed with a firmware update in August . But that fix appeared to be causing problems for systems with the LG batteries, rendering the devices unable to charge.\nA new firmware update has been released (first spotted by Neowin ) that purports to remedy this problem. Fingers crossed it won't cause any further issues for Simplo systems.\nMicrosoft's release notes suggest that in both cases, the problems appear to be with the way the battery management reports the available battery life to the system. Batteries were being reported as full, even when they were empty. This prevented the system from being able to fully charge the batteries. With each successive charge, the \"full\" indication would be sent more and more prematurely, making the battery life fall further and further.\nJust as with the Simplo fix, Microsoft says that it may take a couple of discharge and recharge cycles to fully restore the battery capacity to what it ought to be.",

      "title": "New Surface Book and Surface Dial go on sale today | Microsoft Devices Blog",
      "text": "A year ago, we announced Surface Book for customers who sought the versatility of a 2:1 device but yearned for a more familiar laptop form factor. The reception this product received was nothing short of amazing. While the existing product is perfect for most people, there is a subset of individuals – developers, engineers, designers, gamers – who want even more. More rendering power, faster framerates, and additional battery life.\nAs a team, we relentlessly push to deliver what our customers ask for. Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of a new Surface Book that was specifically designed for those people who want more. The Surface Book with Performance Base is now available at Microsoft Stores and select Best Buy locations in the US and Canada.\nMost Powerful Surface Book Yet We redesigned the Surface Book from the inside out to deliver twice the graphics processing power and 16 hours of battery life into the same sleek form factor – that’s 60% more battery life than the new MacBook Pro 13”.\nNo comparable laptop has this much computation power, this many pixels and this much battery life, in this light of a form factor.\nTo push this kind of power through the device we overhauled the thermal system and added advanced cooling features to optimize the 6th Generation Intel Core i7 processors and an NVIDIA GeForce GPU. No comparable laptop has this much computation power, this many pixels and this much battery life, in this light of a form factor.\nI love the tech behind our products; but what truly inspires me is how people use these devices.\nPeople like Hollie Figueroa who uses Surface Book to create games. She takes screenshots of her work and uses the Surface Pen to easily annotate those images on the detached PixelSense display for feedback and bug submissions. She needs the performance of the discrete GPU to run professional-grade software like Unity Editor. Hollie is excited for Surface Book with Performance Base because it brings twice as much graphics performance and longer battery life. She mentioned she was happy to see it still included the ESC and Function keys she relies on for ultimate productivity.\nOr Joel Henry, an ex NASA engineer who now leads a mechanical engineering team at a consulting company. Joel loves his Surface Book because it can run CAD software like Solid Works, but is light and portable enough to do his work from anywhere. Of course, as an engineer he is always looking for even more performance. For him, the Surface Book with Performance Base will allow him to render 3D files faster and smoother.\nThese customers, and millions of others are doing things on Surface that you just can’t do on a MacBook. A couple weeks ago we announced an offer to invite current Mac users to trade-up to a Surface Book or Surface Pro 4. We’ve had such a great response to the offer that we’ve decided to extend it through November 23rd . If you’ve been waiting to get a Surface, there has never been a better time to buy.\nFor businesses interested in providing their employees with the best, Surface Book with Performance Base shipments start today. A full list of Surface Authorized Resellers and details on how to order are available here .\nDial up your creativity Today, we are also announcing the availability of the Surface Dial in the US. This product is so much more than an accessory. As soon as you get your hands on the Surface Dial you will immediately realize it can be a powerful tool to aid and augment your creative process.\nThe Dial integrates with Windows 10 Global Controls & delivers a set of unique experiences such as app-specific, contextually aware toolbars. The best way to understand the Dial is to see it in action. Check out the video clip below to see how some of our partner’s area using the Dial.\nAs you can see we already have a robust group of partners working to create customized experiences for the Dial in apps such as Bluebeam Revu, Drawboard PDF, Sketchable, Mental Canvas Player, Moho 12, Siemans NX, Spotify, StaffPad, Office and more.\nThis is just the beginning. We have seen a ton of interest in Dial and are continuing to bring on new partners every day. We are also working with Adobe, Affinity Photo and Designer, Corel Corporation, the makers of CorelDRAW and many others to continue to deliver new experiences with Surface Dial and Surface Studio.\nWe’ve been inspired and energized by the excitement we are already seeing for Surface Studio and Surface Dial. Due to strong demand, we have sold out of our initial inventory and are temporarily out of stock of Surface Studio and Surface Dial. We are continuing to take pre-orders for Dial for delivery later this year and for Surface Studio for delivery in early 2017. We will prioritize inventory for both Surface Dial and Surface Studio for people who pre-order. I encourage you to reserve your device now through Microsoft Stores, microsoftstore.com or bestbuy.com .\nI truly believe that products are a reflection of the people who make them and the people who use them. With our latest generation of Surface products, we set out to not just give you more of what they asked for, but to capture your imagination in new ways and to inspire the creator in all of us. I can’t wait to see what you will create with these new devices.",

      "title": "Review: Microsoft’s New Top-End Surface Book Is Bigger in Every Way",
      "text": "\nEarlier this month, when Microsoft held its Windows event in NYC, much of the attention was given to the Surface Studio. However, also announced at that event was an update to the Surface Book. The updated device features new internals inside the base but a nearly-identical exterior.\nMicrosoft pitches the devices as a Surface Book with a performance base. The base, which is a bit different than the base that ships with the older Books, has more batteries and an updated GPU; NVIDIA GTX 965M 2GB GPU and claims of 16 hours of battery life.\nThe laptop has a starting price of $2,399, which is not cheap, but this device is positioned to be the workhorse of the Surface Book family and has the most horsepower under the hood along with the longest battery life. Microsoft’s Surface Book family starts at $1,499 for those that like the form factor, features, and build quality but don’t need to max out performance and battery life.\nTo pack in the new GPU and batteries, the base had to grow in both weight (3.63 pounds compared to 3.48 pounds) and height; the additional weight is minimal but if you hold the new and old bases at the same time, you can tell the new one is heavier.\nAs you can see in the image below, the base is a bit thicker (right) when compared to a non-performance base (left) which does raise your hands up slightly and change your typing position. Unless you are switching between performance and non-performance base frequently, this will not be an issue at all as you quickly adjust to the new wrist height.\n\nThe rest of the device remains the same. There are no changes in the tablet portion of the Surface Book and the pen is the same as the version that is shipping today.\nThe Surface Book has faced many different issues in its lifetime but know that the majority of the kinks have been worked out and with each new firmware release, the device inches closer to perfect. But, there are a still a few oddities, such as the keyboard being unresponsive when turning it on, forcing you to undock and dock the display, as well as the fan spinning up randomly and running for about 5 seconds at max speed before spinning down.\nAnyone who has a Surface Book has experienced these issues, and although they are less frequent, they still do show up on occasion. That being said, the other issues such as instability of the operating system with Skylake and Wi-Fi issues have been ironed out, and for the most part, the device is a capable laptop to use on a daily basis (I have been using it for about a week with no major complaints).\nWhen it comes to performance, there is little question that this device is more powerful than the previous high-end Surface Book. When comparing the two, the new device outshines the older Book in every way.\nI ran the recommended 3D Mark test (as suggested by the app), which is the Sky Diver scenario and the performance base returned as score of 10,984 and the older Surface Book with the dGPU had a score of 6345. It should be noted that these devices both have the same CPU and RAM configurations.\n\nOne of the “‘iconic” features of the Surface book is the hinge. Because the base is thicker, it makes it look like the gap between the base and the display is smaller, but at the critical point, the hinge, the spacing is still the same.\nBattery life with the performance base is averaging around 10 hours with three complete cycles of the battery. Microsoft does promote 16 hours of battery life, but I am not getting near that; however, this is under heavy use, which includes video editing, podcasting, watching video on the web, and similar intensive activities. If I scaled down my use of the device and kept it to simpler items such as web browsing and email, I suspect I could get much closer to the promised capacity. With that being said, 10 hours is much better than I was getting on the older Surface Book, so there is definitely an improvement with the new device.\n\nFrom a business perspective, the Surface Book ticks a lot of the boxes that are required in the enterprise space. Everything from portability and long battery life to Windows Hello (biometric authentication) make it an ideal option for companies looking to add a bit of character and quality to the PCs they hand out to employees. The device does come with Windows 10, so if you are still using Windows 7, you either need to think about upgrading your environment or run a mixed scenario of having both Windows 10 and Windows 7 on your network; I absolutely do not recommend trying to force Windows 7 onto the Surface Book. \n\nHere’s what you need to know about the new Surface Book. It’s bigger in every way — physically and in terms of performance, too. Most of the issues that plagued the launch of the Surface Books last year have been fixed, and the new performance base model will give you enough horsepower to tackle nearly any task you would with a desktop, but with a portable device.\nIf you are looking for a new high-end laptop for either home or the office, the Surface Book should be on your short list. Microsoft built this device to show off the true potential of Windows and the newest Surface Book does this beautifully.\nThe post Review: Microsoft’s New Top-End Surface Book Is Bigger in Every Way appeared first on Petri .\n",

Credit Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Google disputed on Thursday claims made by Europe’s antitrust officials that it had used Android, the company’s dominant mobile operating system, to unfairly promote its own services like online search and its smartphone application store over those of rivals. The Silicon Valley company said that customers and cellphone makers could easily switch to competitors’ services and use rival smartphone applications, though rivals have balked at such suggestions. “The Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers and mobile network operators,” Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel, said in a blog post on Thursday. “Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it.” If the charges (and denials) sound familiar, it’s because they are. For years, the European authorities investigated Microsoft over whether the company had abused its dominance to promote its own services. Microsoft eventually — some say reluctantly — agreed to give rivals greater access. As in the Google case, Europe’s antitrust officials put themselves at the center of how people, both in the region and farther afield, used digital services. European officials have said the two companies’ practices not only stopped rivals from competing directly, but also limited consumer choice and, in the case of Google, hindered innovation in the fast-expanding mobile world. \nAdvertisement The cases against Google and Microsoft, however, are not identical. The Basics Microsoft: In 2009, the European Commission , the executive arm of the European Union, charged Microsoft with unfairly bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows software, a move that officials said reduced consumer choice. The claims came on the heels of a separate antitrust investigation into whether Microsoft broke European competition rules by unfairly promoting its Windows Media Player over alternatives offered by rivals. The biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with — pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world. Google: In April, the Europe competition authorities charged the search giant with unfairly using Android, which holds a roughly 75 percent share of the region’s smartphone market, to promote its own digital services over those of rivals. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s antitrust chief, said Google had required some cellphone manufacturers to preinstall the company’s services, including its Google Play smartphone application store, and had given them unfair financial incentives to favor Google’s services on their mobile devices. The Context Microsoft: At the time of the 2009 charges, Microsoft was trying — unsuccessfully — to cement its place in the world of internet services. That included automatically including Internet Explorer with every version of Windows, which was then used on about 90 percent of all computers worldwide. Internet Explorer held more than a 50 percent share of Europe’s browser market when the charges were filed. Google: Google hopes Android will give it an edge over rivals like Facebook in the mobile market. The question is whether the company hindered competition by requiring cellphone makers to use services like online search and the mobile version of Chrome, if they wanted to use other products like Google Play. Google says that people can easily download rival services and that it does not restrict them from using competitors’ applications. The company says its relationships with cellphone manufacturers are voluntary and it does not receive direct payments for these companies’ use of its Android software. \nAdvertisement   The (Potential) Fines Microsoft: To settle the Internet Explorer case, Microsoft created an online portal in 2009 that allowed people to choose freely between a number of browsers. Google’s Antitrust Battles It dropped the feature, however, from some of its Windows software in 2011 and was hit with a further $730 million punishment in 2013 for failing to respect the original antitrust settlement. In all, it has paid $3.4 billion in fines to the European Commission for its antitrust abuses. Google: If found to have broken Europe’s tough competition rules, Google could be fined up to $7.5 billion, or 10 percent of its annual revenue, though European officials have typically levied much smaller penalties in previous cases. The Consequences Microsoft: After it opened itself up to greater competition, Microsoft soon began to lose ground to rivals, particularly Google’s Chrome browser. Chrome is now the region’s main internet browser, and Internet Explorer holds about a 10 percent market share. These changes, though, were not caused solely by Europe’s competition investigation. Microsoft also did not keep pace with rivals like Google and Facebook, failed to shift gears successfully toward mobile (including the disastrous purchase , and subsequent write-down, of Nokia’s mobile handset and services unit in 2014) and became mired in lengthy antitrust litigation in both the United States and Europe. Google: This is still up in the air. Much will depend on the result of the Android antitrust case and any likely appeal by Google. An initial decision is expected sometime late next year, at the earliest (the company also faces two separate competition charges linked to some of its online search activities). If it is found to have broken European rules, the company could face financial penalties, calls to alter its mobile operating system or both. There is a lot at stake for Google. It has pegged much of its future growth on mobile, with Android at the heart of most of these activities. Other American technology companies like Facebook and Amazon are also fighting to win people’s attention on smartphones. So any restrictions on Google’s mobile ambitions, either in Europe or outside the region, are likely to raise concerns about the company’s growth plans. \nFollow Mark Scott on Twitter @markscott82 .",

      "title": "Surface Book with Performance Base review: Microsoft’s new laptop kicks ass",
      "text": "Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo Share \nMicrosoft announced its most powerful laptop last month during a press event in New York City. We had the good fortune of being in the audience to see, feel and try Microsoft’s new Surface Book. It packs a more powerful graphics processing unit (GPU), a slightly redesigned body and promises extra-long battery life. \nMicrosoft didn’t really dive head-first into the hardware market. Ex-CEO Steve Ballmer had tried, as a recent interview with Bloomberg revealed, but there were those among the company, even Bill Gates, who thought the Surface was a bad idea. I’m glad that the current CEO, Satya Nadella, continued to push forward with Microsoft’s hardware vision and the Surface product family. \nWe’ve spent the last week using the new Surface Book with Performance Base as our primary computer. Yep, we tossed the MacBook aside, hooked up a dock and used the Surface Book with Performance base for every last thing, from running the business to editing video. \nThe Surface Book with Performance base, in case you forgot, ups the hardware inside the original Surface Book (as well as the price, it starts at around $3,000). It is, in our opinion, the cream of the crop. If you can afford it, you’ll love what the Surface Book with Performance base offers. There are some areas where we feel it lacks, though, so we’ll touch on that, too. \nLet’s get started, shall we? Hardware \nI admit, I wasn’t wild about the Surface Book hardware last year. Maybe it just took me time to get adjusted to it. The gap, for example, between the display and the keyboard just seemed too wide, like a missed opportunity to create closed lines. Microsoft fixed that a hair with the new Surface Book with Performance Base. The bottom half is now slightly thicker, closing the opening between the screen and the keyboard a bit more when the laptop is folded closed. \nThere are other small changes, too. The keyboard is slightly recessed instead of sitting flush with the base. We didn’t notice much of a difference in typing, and the keyboard was just as comfortable as before. We have one little nitpicky thing with the keyboard, though. With the 3-stage backlight on, and at certain angles, it’s actually hard to see the keys at times. Weird, I know. But that’s minor. \nOther things that stuck around, like the Windows Hello front-facing camera that makes logging in a breeze, are amazing. This is a feature in Windows 10, not specific to the Surface Book, but we love having it and it’s something that helps Microsoft’s products, either developed in-house or by partners, stand out against what Apple offers. \nThe touchpad offers your fingers plenty of space to play in while navigating. It’s wide and smooth, allowing you to quickly scroll through websites, photo galleries and more. This matters a lot, because a crappy touchpad can easily make or break an entire keyboard experience. It also has a great clicky feel and supports a variety of multitouch functions from viewing open apps to visiting other virtual desktops. \nThere are plenty of ports, including two full-size USB 3.0 ports, a full-size SD card reader (take that, Apple), a headset jack and a mini DisplayPort. We tested all of them, with the DisplayPort easily adding a second monitor. As frequent photo and video editors, we love the SD slot, and we’re glad Microsoft isn’t so quick to move in the same direction as Apple. \nStill, we wish Microsoft did adopt some new technologies. A single USB-C Thunderbolt 3 port would have been appreciated, for example, particularly for the multitude of uses that Thunderbolt enables. \nThe 13.5-inch PixelSense Display sports a 3,000 x 2,000 ratio, giving you 267 pixels-per-inch. As we noted with the first version, it’s gorgeous, and we dig the full 10-point multitouch for use when the computer is in tablet mode. \nSpeaking of tablet mode, the Surface Book with Performance base includes the support to detach the entire display. It works much quicker than we remember from last year’s Surface Book (though software updates have fixed that machine, too.) We didn’t use the device in tablet mode so much as we did to flip it around to prop the screen for watching movies. \nThe elephant in the room, of course, is the actual design. In many ways, the Surface Book feels to me like the Windows 10 MacBook Pro, but better. I love the versatility, I love the metal design, the fancy hinge and the premium build. I love magnetic side for attaching the included Surface Pen. I don’t like that the top tablet-piece still bounces a bit if you tap it, though, which is kind of a bummer. \nMy general point is that Microsoft took an already fantastic product and made it even better. That’s what I like to see. Why fix what isn’t broken? \nI don’t want to dive into the software too much because we’ve already talked about Windows 10 and the Windows 10 Anniversary update in detail. I’m a huge fan of Windows 10, that’s no secret, and I love what Microsoft did by adding Cortana, virtual desktops, a whole slew of screenwriting apps and more. \nWhile we have plenty of artists in the office who are magical with what they can do with video, Jon and I aren’t very good at drawing. We didn’t use the Surface Pen much for that sort of stuff, but appreciated having it around for hand-written notes in meetings and, especially, for signing documents like embargo agreements. It just makes things so much easier, and we appreciate the added software like Drawboard PDF that enables that function right out of the box. \nOther bits of software have improved, too. The last time we checked out the Microsoft Book, apps like Mail weren’t that great and felt unfinished. Now, we’re easily able to add our Google accounts, and really enjoy using it. Performance \nThis is where things really matter, since the Surface Book with Performance Dock is supposed to, well, improve performance. You can now configure the machine with up to 16GB of RAM, an Intel Core i7 processor and a 1TB hard drive. That’ll burn a hole in your wallet, no doubt, with a $3,300 price tag. The good news is this becomes a very portable powerhouse for editing video and photos, which we love given that’s what we’re primarily doing with our computers 99% of the time in the office. (Well, and writing.) \nThe NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M performed admirably for video editing, but we can’t help but wish Microsoft stepped it up just a hair more with a 10-Series GeForce. 2GB of GDDR5 RAM is fine, too, but why not more? At the price the machine costs, we do kind of wish Microsoft crammed a tad more muscle, but we’re happy with what we got, which is probably all Microsoft wants anyway. \nWe found that, while running read and write tests on the new 1TB SSD, the read speeds were pretty darn fat, capping at about 1,651MB/ second. Write speeds were a hair slower, at about 1,244MB/s. Of course this slows down if you’re moving larger files, so 4K video transfers clocked in with slower read speeds (28 MB/s) but faster write speeds (79 MB/s) in our CrystalDiskMark tests. \nOne area we did have issue, however, is with a set of Bluetooth headphones we tried to connect to the Surface Book with Performance Base. A pair of QC35 Bose headphones couldn’t reliably play music, with skipping and static becoming a problem during playback. This was also an issue on an older Surface Book, but would sometimes correct itself. The Bose QC35 headphones (we tried two units) worked with all other devices. \nAnd if you’re wondering, sure, the dedicated graphics chip is going to get you better gaming performance than integrated graphics, but this isn’t a machine that’s meant to compete with the gaming notebooks sold by the likes of Alienware, ASUS, MSI and others. Don’t expect to play much, though you’ll definitely be able to cruise around in titles like Overwatch with playable framerates at lower resolutions. \nBattery life is really solid on the Surface Book with Performance Base. We were able to milk out about 11-11.5 hours of battery life with the display brightness around 80 percent. Again, this is using the machine for everyday computing tasks, and you’ll find the battery life dips if you’re doing more intensive tasks, like editing videos and really putting the GPU to work. Also, this is below what Microsoft advertises; it says you should get up to 16 hours, but that’s only doing video playback. Without the base attached, you’re looking at a couple of hours of battery life. Rating: Buy \nI need to go somewhere that I know might stir up some controversy, but I’m just being honest. The new MacBook Pro, without going into too much detail, doesn’t seem like it’s targeting actual “professionals” any more. It sacrifices too much too early, before we’re ready. The Surface Book doesn’t. Save for the sky-high $3,300 price, you’re getting an incredible machine, one that’s easily capable of handling all of the real professional tasks you throw at it. \nNeed to sign a document? Boom, Surface Pen. Edit a video? The new GPU handles that with breeze. You’ll get more than enough battery life to get you through a work day, ports for adding extra displays, full-size USB 3.0 ports for data transfers and, yes, an SD card slot. Want to kick back and watch a movie? Detach the display or flip it around. \nWindows 10 kicks ass and now we have the machine to match the operating system of Microsoft’s dreams. There are no sacrifices here, only promises, and Microsoft keeps all of them. If you can afford it, the Surface Book with Performance Base is the best laptop you can buy. \nPros",

      "title": "Surface Book with Performance Base Review",
      "text": "Performance Base not sold separately No Thunderbolt 3 \nThe Surface Book was one of Microsoft’s best-kept secrets last year, but the company isn’t holding back when it comes to talking up its Performance Base upgrade. Landing in time for the holidays, the new model is actually only 50-percent changed: while the screen-turned-tablet is the same as before, the keyboard section has been squeezed full of extra graphics potency and more battery life. That doesn’t come cheap, mind, with this newest model starting at $2,399. \nYou’d be hard pressed to spot the difference between the original Surface Book and this refresh. For the most part that’s no bad thing, mind; even more than a year past the form-factor’s surprise reveal in late 2015, it’s still one of the most distinctive notebooks out there. Its snake-like hinge and party trick with the detachable screen still get attention. \nMicrosoft’s attention to detail and quality construction certainly don’t hurt, either. The brushed magnesium and crisp edges still look and feel fresh; the “Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge” still has a firm and reassuring mechanism to go with its ridiculous name. Microsoft’s 13.5-inch PixelSense display, with its unusual 3:2 aspect ratio and 3,000 x 2,000 resolution remains bright, with great colors and contrast. \nOf course, the flip side is that the few complaints I had about the original hold true about this version. The Surface Pen, which clings to the edge of the display magnetically, is still too easy to knock loose in a bag; the unusual hinge remains a source of concern should something sharp fall down and potentially scratch the touchscreen. I wish the hinge pushed back a little further, too. \nWhere Apple has gone full-futurist with the ports on the new MacBook Pro, Microsoft sticks with some tried-and-true connectors. Two USB 3.0, an SD card reader, headset jack, and Mini DisplayPort are all present, along with the company’s version of MagSafe magnetic power plug. Those who have slammed Apple for the zeal of its USB Type-C adoption will undoubtedly be pleased, but I find myself wishing Microsoft had thrown at least one Thunderbolt 3 in there. \nStill, this is a new spec option not a refresh, and so we’ll have to temper our hopes until the inevitable Surface Book 2. The internal hardware is much the same as it was before, too. You get WiFi a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.0, a 5-megapixel front camera and a Windows Hello camera, along with an 8-megapixel rear camera with autofocus. Stereo speakers and a pair of microphones are included, along with an ambient light sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. \nUnsurprisingly, processor performance is effectively unchanged over last year’s flagship. I’ve been using the Core i7-6600U version running at 2.6 GHz, with 16GB of memory and NVIDIA’s GeForce GTX 965M GPU with 2GB of its own, dedicated memory. Running Geekbench 3, a synthetic test of processor and memory performance, the late-2016 Surface Book scored 3564 in the single-core test, and 7377 in the multi-core test. \nLast year’s machine, also with a Core i7-6600U and 16GB of memory, scored 3,577 in the single-core test and 7401 in the multi-core test. In short, you shouldn’t expect a noticeable change in anything processor-intensive. Still, the Surface Book still performs admirably among its notebook cohort. \nThe changes are all in the keyboard section. Now dubbed the “Performance Base”, as before it’s where you find not only an extra battery but the discrete GPU. Used as a tablet only, the Surface Book makes do with its Intel HD Graphics 520; connect the keyboard, and you get the full potency of the GeForce GTX 965M. \nMicrosoft hasn’t been shy in making bold claims about just what sort of improvement Surface Book buyers can expect, either. More than twice the GPU processing power is the promise, compared to the custom NVIDIA chip in the first version of the hybrid 2-in-1. \nI ran the same 3DMark tests – Fire Strike and Sky Diver – as last year with the original Surface Book to see whether those promises panned out in practice. Sure enough, where the 2015 Surface Book with the Core i7 and NVIDIA graphics scored 1,934 and 6,197 respectively in the two tests, the 2016 version scored 4,226 and 10,513 respectively. That’s 1.7x – 2.2x the performance from the newer GPU. \nThe other improvement this time around is battery life. Microsoft rated the original Surface Book as delivering up to 12 hours of video playback on a single charge. The new model is rated for up to 16 hours. \nAs before, the battery capacity is split between the two halves of the notebook. The screen alone should run for around 3 hours of video playback, Microsoft estimates, with the remaining juice in the Performance Base. By design, the latter won’t recharge the former, though the Surface Book will use the keyboard’s power before it resorts to the tablet’s. \nJust as was the case last year, actual runtimes varied considerably depending on activity. With my own mixed use, avoiding video, the screen section alone ran for about two hours. Docked, and with a variety of tasks including some browsing over WiFi, music playback, and editing documents, the notebook ran for between 10-12 hours. As you might expect, tapping into the extra potency of the new GPU took an axe to battery life, knocking hours from the total runtime. \nShould you spend your hard-earned cash on this or the new MacBook Pro? I can’t tell you how the AMD GPU in Apple’s 15-inch notebook performs just yet, but it’s worth noting that neither machine can be had with more than 16GB of memory. Nor is either especially affordable: this particular Surface Book configuration comes in at $3,299, for instance, though the cheapest model with the Performance Base is $900 less. \nI can’t fault the Surface Book with Performance Base for its graphics improvement. The design, display, and fiendishly clever 2-in-1 mechanism are still top-notch. Surface Pen is accurate and easy to use; Windows Hello on Windows 10 arguably bests Touch ID in the “delight” stakes, even if Apple’s fingerprint sensor claws things back when it comes to payments and such. \nAll the same, I doubt I’m alone in thinking that a flagship notebook in (almost) 2017 should have at least one Thunderbolt 3 port. As it stands, the fastest data connection you have is USB 3.0; that means a (theoretical) 5 Gbps limit, a quarter of what Thunderbolt 3 can deliver. It’s also worth noting you have a little extra heft in your bag, with the 3.63 pound 2016 Surface Book adding 0.15 pounds over the old version. Wrap-Up \nNOW READ: Microsoft’s Surface Studio is a stunning AIO \nSadly, while existing Surface Book owners could dock their screen into the new Performance Base and get all the benefits of the new GPU, Microsoft won’t be selling the keyboard section separately. Even if they did, this isn’t the do-everything gaming setup we might’ve hoped for. If you’re a virtual reality fan, for instance, the GeForce GTX 965M in the Performance Base doesn’t quite live up to Oculus’ minimum Rift specifications, a good rule of thumb for desktop VR. \nThat’s not to say there’s not a lot to like here. Those doing video editing or other heavy-duty graphics work on the move will find plenty to like in Microsoft’s new darling, and the 2-in-1 form factor is still one of the most usable in the Windows 10 ecosystem. All the same, we’ll have to wait for the Surface Book 2 for some of the lingering complaints to be addressed.",

      "title": "The Microsoft Surface Book is still the best Windows laptop you can buy",
      "text": "It isn’t easy to review Microsoft’s least interesting product release of the fall.\nA few weeks ago, Microsoft pulled another October surprise, unveiling the big-screen, all-in-one Surface Studio . It’s a stunner few of us can wait to get our hands on.\nSEE ALSO: The secrets behind the Surface Studio design\nIn the interim, Microsoft handed us the minimally updated Surface Book with Performance Base. At a glance, it looks just like the excellent laptop/tablet hybrid Microsoft introduced a year ago. I lauded that one for its design, unique and unusual dynamic fulcrum hinge, excellent touchscreen (which detaches to become a clipboard-like tablet) and well-designed keyboard.\nThe state of the laptop race If one were to compare Microsoft to Apple at this laptop juncture, you might say that Apple is compressing while Microsoft is staying static or expanding just a bit. There is no shedding of legacy ports for the Redmond-based Windows parent. Microsoft’s updated Surface Book kept the SD card slot, two USB-3 ports and Display Port.\nAnd while the Surface Book with Performance Base is virtually the same size as the last model — 12.3 x 9.14 x 0.9 inches — the new laptop is slightly heavier than the old one. The first Surface Book weighed 3.48 pounds with a Core i7 CPU. The new Core i7 system I tested weighs 3.63 pounds. By contrast, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro weighs 3 pounds (a half-pound lighter than the last MacBook Pro).\nIf you've seen the first Surface Book, this new one will look very familiar.\nImage: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE\nThe new Surface Book with slightly redesigned Performance Base still features an excellent keyboard and touch pad.\nImage: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE\nOne of the reasons I still carry the Surface Pro 4 instead of a Surface Book is the weight — a mere 2.37 pounds. Adding heft to the Surface Book is not making it more attractive to me as a portable.\nDon’t misunderstand me. I still love this laptop. It’s smartly designed with solid, magnesium chassis and an excellent, high-resolution (3,000 x 2,000), 13.5-inch touchscreen that is up for anything. It’s big enough for multi-window work (Twitter in Chrome or Microsoft Edge and Word) and a great drawing canvas with 1,024 levels of pressure sensitivity. I love that I can pull off the screen (there’s a dedicated keyboard button), flip it around, reattach it and use it to watch movies or as an angled drawing surface.\nWhat the Performance Base adds, though, is something that pro users were craving: better graphics performance and longer battery life.\nYou see, the Surface Book has always been like one-and-a-half computers in one. The tablet/clipboard is a standalone touch computer with the Core i7 chip and integrated Intel HD graphics. The base houses a big GPU upgrade — now the Nvidia GTX 965M — and a lot more battery power. The last Surface Book boasted 12 hours of battery life. The Performance Base can, according to Microsoft, get you up to 16.\nObviously, battery life varies widely based on activity. You may get 16 hours if all you do is watch videos. But with a mix of productivity work, drawing and gaming, between 10 and 12 is far more likely. My battery life usually ran between 9 and 14 hours. I got 9 when I played Forza for a couple of hours. Also, the system did get a little hot on the base during those gameplay sessions.\nNow the keyboard is raised up a bit near the screen. Also, take note of those legacy ports that survived this update.\nImage: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE\nThis is the reasons that keyboard is a little higher in the back: bigger.\nImage: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE\nBefore I dive into performance, though, there’s the matter of Microsoft’s ever-so-subtle redesign of the base. To accommodate the more powerful GPU, Microsoft reengineered the thermals in the base. The outward expression of that is a noticeably more raised keyboard and larger-system-wide vent right behind it.\nThe original Surface Book keyboard also rose up a bit at the back edge, nearest the hinge, but now hump is more pronounced. Fortunately, because of the dynamic fulcrum hinge design, there was always a pinky-width gap along that inside edge when you closed the laptop. Now it’s filled up just a bit more with the keyboard. That new keyboard angle has no impact on typing ease or quality (I remain a terrible typist on both Surface Books, and all MacBook Pros, too).\nBig screen big dreams As I noted above, Microsoft replaced the previous NVidia GPU in the original Surface Book base with a peppier Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M. In my Geekbench 4 tests, it got a robust 64,355 OpenCL score. The Intel HD graphics chip in the Clipboard got 18,440, which is still better than the Intel HD graphics OpenCL score I got on the original Core i5 Surface Book: 17,389.\nWith the Performance Base attached, the Surface Book proves a capable gaming PC. I played Recore , Infinity Runner HD and Forza Motorsport 6: Apex, and for each I was impressed with the graphics, frame rates and overall response. While all the games detected the Nvidia GPU, none of them would automatically turn the graphics levels up to their max settings. For kicks, I turned all of Forza’s setting up to Ultra. The game quickly informed me that — even with 2GB of video RAM — I was running in “low video memory” mode. The frame rate dropped from 28 at medium video quality to 16.5 fps.\nGaming on the Surface Book with Performance Base? Absolutely.\nImage: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE\nIt's still a great pen system.\nImage: LILI SAMS/MASHABLE\nObviously, the Surface Book with Performance Base is still not a gaming rig, but it can do in a pinch.\nThis is the first Surface Book to ship with Windows 10 Anniversary Edition, which means it now has even better Pen integration, a nice update for a system where pen input is so integral. You now gain instant access to pen features through the Windows Ink icon in the task tray. You can also access them by pressing the eraser button on the Surface Pen.\nFor Windows fans, the Surface Book remains one of the best and most interesting Windows laptops on the market. It can be a tablet (though you’ll almost never use it without the keyboard), it can be a workhorse productivity system, it can be an entertainment device (a great big screen for Netflix) and it can even be a gamer’s delight.\nThe 16GB, Core i7 system with a terabyte of storage and Performance Base will run you $3,299, a list price that makes even the high-end MacBook Pro look like a bargain. However, a similarly configured MacBook Pro (16GB, 1TB storage and Core i7) will run you $2,889 and that’s without discrete graphics and a full touchscreen (you get the nifty Touch Bar).\nIf you already own a Surface Book, I see little reason to upgrade to this device. But if you are in the market for a versatile, pro-level Windows portable, the Surface Book with Performance Base should be at the top of your list.\nMicrosoft Surface Book with Performance Base The Good Didn’t mess with a good design • Strong performance across a wide range of tasks • Good battery life • Can handle real PC games\nThe Bad Pricey\nThe Bottom Line This is an excellent pro-level Windows 10 computer that is so much more than just a laptop.",

      "text": "Microsoft Corp. signage outside the Microsoft Visitor Center in Redmond, Wash. Microsoft announces fifth expansion to data center in Mecklenburg County, creating 44 jobs From staff reports \nMicrosoft Corp. signage outside the Microsoft Visitor Center in Redmond, Wash. \nMicrosoft Corp. plans to invest $251.6 million to expand its data center in Mecklenburg County. \nThe expansion is expected to create 44 jobs and increase capacity at the data center, state officials said Wednesday. \nIt is the fifth expansion at the site since Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft opened the center with a $499 million investment in 2010. Don't miss out! Sign up today for the free Work It, Lynchburg business news email. \nWith this latest expansion, Microsoft has invested $1.99 billion and created more than 250 jobs since 2010. \nIn 2011, the company invested an additional $150 million to expand the site, and in 2013 announced a $348 million expansion. Microsoft invested another $346.7 million, creating 90 new jobs, in June 2014. The company expanded for a fourth time in November 2015, investing $402.4 million and creating 42 jobs. \nVirginia competed against other unnamed sites or states in the U.S. for the project, Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s office said. \n“With five expansions in six years, this company’s success continues to be a testament to Southern Virginia’s talented workforce and strong IT infrastructure,” McAuliffe said in a statement. “The commonwealth is emerging as a leader in the data center industry.” \nChristian Belady, general manager of Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure operations, said demand for cloud services continues to grow globally. “We will continue to invest in growing our capacity to meet the expanding demand of our customers in close collaboration with the commonwealth of Virginia and the county of Mecklenburg.” \nMcAuliffe approved a $500,000 grant from the Commonwealth’s Opportunity Fund to assist Mecklenburg with the project. The Virginia Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission approved $970,000 in Tobacco Region Opportunity Funds for the project. Tags",

      "text": "Xbox Holiday Update Released By Microsoft (video) 2:10 pm By Julian Horsey \nMicrosoft has today released it’s new and highly anticipated Xbox Holiday Update which brings with it Clubs, Looking for Group, Achievement Rarity, Group Messaging and more. \nAll of which will be available to access via the Xbox One and the Xbox app on Windows 10, iOS, and Android devices. Watch the Xbox Holiday Update release video below, for a walk-through of all the new features you can expect to enjoy once installed. \nMicrosoft explains a little more ; \nWith this holiday update, Xbox Live becomes even more social as we unite gamers across devices, giving you access to more people to play with that share your interests and more choice in how you play. The update also builds upon our vision to foster a welcoming experience on Xbox Live where everyone is included, respected, and supported. The updates start to hit Xbox One consoles and the Xbox app starting today. Haven’t downloaded or used the Xbox app yet? Windows 10 PC and mobile owners, just look in your apps. Android owners get it here; iOS owners get it here. \nThese new features have been in Preview alongside Arena on Xbox Live. We plan to keep Arena in Preview through the holidays to ensure it’s great when we launch it more broadly. Big thanks to Preview members that have competed in daily Killer Instinct tournaments over the past few weeks – we’ve gotten great feedback. We’re excited about the potential of Arena, and continuing to work with developers to deliver a great experience for our fans. We’ll have more to share as we expand the feature and get closer to its launch. \nFor full details on all the new features, enhancements and tweaks that will be rolled out by Microsoft in the latest Xbox Holiday Update jump over to the official Major Nelson website via the link below.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan How to turn off Microsoft's newest Office 365 pop-up ads Microsoft is targeting Office 365 users who aren't using locally installed Office 2016 apps with a new pop-up ad. Here's how to turn off that notification. | Topic: Cloud \nMicrosoft hasn't been shy about using pop-up ads to try to push Windows 10 and Office 365 . \nBut over the past few weeks, the Office team has been targeting a new group of users with new pop-up ads: Office 365 subscribers who aren't using the Office 2016 locally-installable apps. \nI've heard from a few readers about this and have been the target of these myself. The pop-up message, a screen capture of which I've embedded in this post, tells users \"Your upgrade to Office 2016 is ready. Free with your Office 365 subscription.\" The options listed are \"See what's new,\" \"Upgrade\" and \"Later.\" \nThis ad is problematic for a few reasons, beyond the fact that it's nagware. \nSome of us have found this pop-up difficult to dismiss. Clicking on any of those options often results in no action. \nSecondly, it's misleading. While I am an Office 365 subscriber on the Windows 7 desktop PC where this appeared, I subscribed to the Office 365 Business Essentials plan , which does not entitle me to the locally installable Office 2016 apps, but does provide me with Exchange. \nI'm cheap. I find the free online versions of the Office apps to meet my occasional-use needs. I guess I might install the Office 2016 apps if Microsoft actually were to give them to me for free with Business Essentials. As it stands now, if I did manage to get \"Upgrade\" to work on this pop-up, my upgrade would not be free. \nI asked Microsoft what's going on here. A spokesperson provided the following statement: \"The notification is meant to provide existing Office 365 subscribers who are using an older version of Office an easy way to upgrade to Office 2016. The team is actively working to identify the right frequency and are also evaluating ways to make adjusting the notification simple based on customer feedback. In the meantime, customers can turn off the notification by first clicking here . Then, in the File Download dialog box, click Run or Open, and follow the steps in the fix wizard.\" \nI applied this fix myself yesterday and so far, no more popups. Fingers crossed. \nFor those wondering how long they can continue to use older, locally installed versions of Microsoft's Office app s and still get security fixes from Microsoft for them for free (under Extended Support), Office 2007 with Service Pack 3 is supported until October 2017; Office 2010 with Service Pack 2 is supported until October 2020; and Office 2013 is supported until April 2023.",

Time of Publication: 9:00 am. 9:00 am Review: Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base Microsoft \nFor years, consumer hardware has increasingly differentiated with design. And while Microsoft’s latest Surface Book hybrid features the premium materials, sleek looks, and lighter and thinner body you’d expect, it’s all about incredible engineering at its core. \nThis is the second version of the unique detachable device Microsoft first released a year ago , and outwardly the mechanics are largely the same. When the Surface Book’s 13.5-inch touchscreen docks in its mechanical-and-magnetic grip, it’s a powerful laptop with a comfortably spaced keyboard. recommends 2016 Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base 8/10 Learn How We Rate Wired It's a lean performance hybrid with an awesome keyboard. The sharp touchscreen has a sweet aspect ratio for hard-core doc-jockeying. Laptop mode offers the graphics performance of a decent gaming laptop. It does hybrid right. Tired Battery life is solid, but falls short of the 16 hours claimed. Sometimes you will forget where the power button is. It's expensive, but you're essentially getting two computers in one. 1/10 A complete failure in every way 2/10 Sad, really 3/10 Serious flaws; proceed with caution 4/10 Downsides outweigh upsides 7/10 Very good, but not quite great 8/10 Excellent, with room to kvetch 9/10 Nearly flawless 10/10 Metaphysical perfection \nBut then you hold down a button for a second, hear an electromechanical “thunk,” and lift the display right off. That’s the “muscle wire lock” working as designed, a special mechanism that keeps the screen on tight in laptop mode, and lets it loose when you want a big-screened tablet PC instead—complete with its own three-hour battery and mobile processor. When it comes time to re-dock, go ahead and put the screen on backwards; the system still works and sips from the main battery, giving you a gently sloped surface to write on with the included Surface Pen stylus. \nAll of which makes Surface Book a unique entry in the portable PC field, even a year later. And while this year’s model—the Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base—doesn’t reinvent the hinge, it does offer a dual-core Intel Core i7 CPU, up to 16 gigs of RAM, and dedicated graphics processors for more gaming and graphics oomph . Not that you can tell from the outside; the new machine looks just like last year’s Surface Book. \nThe new model sticks with the same a 13.5-inch, 3000 x 2000 touchscreen display, and its 3:2 aspect ratio leaves ample vertical real estate for rockin’ Word docs. It has same signature bendy-straw hinge as its predecessor, the same surprisingly good speakers, the same contoured magnesium-alloy body with chiseled details, and the same MacBook-silver coloration. \nThere are differences, though, all of them hidden inside. As a result, the newer Surface Book is a little bit heavier, weighing in at around 3.7 pounds versus the previous model’s 3.5-pound frame. Those extra ounces are no big deal, as it remains a light load in your laptop bag. Interior Upgrades \nThe most notable change is an upgraded graphics processing unit, which makes the Surface Book with Performance Base more attractive for gamers, video editors, or CAD whizzes who found last year’s internals too wimpy. The Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M GPU tucked inside now is an upgrade from the Nvidia 940M-range GPU found in last year’s models, and there’s also double the memory devoted to it (2GB of GDDR5 RAM). \nThe upgrade pays off; the 2016 Surface Book is super-powerful for such a slim, light, and versatile machine. For the majority of mixed-use cases during testing—streaming a bunch of video, writing this review, surfing the web, and listening to music—the Surface Book had no trouble multitasking without a hiccup. It really zips. That’s to be expected out of the top configuration I tested, a $3,300 rig with a top-shelf Core i7 with 16GB RAM and a 1TB SSD. Still, it lives up to very lofty performance expectations. \nI ran it through 3DMark’s Cloud Gate benchmark test for all-purpose laptops, and the Surface Pro with Performance Base churned out a score of 8,803, which was significantly better than most 2013 gaming laptops and any general-purpose portable PC. On the more intense Sky Diver test, it held its own as well, netting a score that also put it above older gaming laptops and all-purpose portables. No, it’s not on par with newer gaming laptops—it won’t handle Oculus VR, for example—but it’s especially impressive when you factor in its size, weight, and versatility. \nOne perk that the new Surface Book didn’t live up to was its listed 16 hours of battery life in laptop mode. I tested the laptop through three complete charge and recharge cycles, with normal heavy use, and it gave me between six and seven hours of juice at a time. Microsoft suggested downloading the latest Windows update, which did improve power management quite a bit, boosting me to around nine to 10 hours per charge. Another caveat: Microsoft’s battery life spec is based on video playback, not mixed use. The upshot is that you get solid mileage, but don’t expect to make from sunup to sundown with everyday use, unless you live in the Arctic. \nOutside of the fresh new engine and bulked-up battery life, the experience of using the new Surface Book is exactly the same as using last year’s model. That’s largely a long list of pluses: I am a huge fan of its keyboard, which has wider keys, better ergonomics for bigger hands, and more pleasant key travel than the 13-inch MacBook Pro I normally use. The input options are decent, with two USB 3.0 ports and an SD reader along its right edge, and a mini DisplayPort jack on the right edge. \nThe Surface Book’s detached-screen experience is best described as “tablet PC” rather than “tablet.” When it’s freed from its dock, the big ol’ slate runs full Windows 10 programs and is more like a desktop experience than the app-filled iPad. Microsoft calls it “Clipboard Mode,” which is apt; its size and shape really do make it feel like a clipboard in your hands. In other words, it’s bulkier than your average iPad. For most casual users, “Clipboard Mode” will primarily be a nice-to-have feature for reading and watching movies on a plane. \nCasual users probably aren’t ponying up this much for a laptop, though. And while I’m certainly not the target audience for drawing on its touchscreen all that much, Microsoft nailed the feel of writing with the Surface Pen. It feels like a cross between the world’s smoothest ballpoint and jotting on a slick whiteboard. Just as importantly, stowing the Surface Pen is as simple as sticking it on the edge of the Surface Book’s display with its super-strong magnetic innards. For artists, it’s certainly worth at least a test sketch to see if it fits your needs. \nThere are tiny complaints with the new Surface Book here and there. The placement of the power button and the headphone jack will never feel quite right; to accommodate its standalone tablet mode, the Book’s power button is on the top of the display and the headphone jack is on the top right edge. Cords be danglin’. Due to the unique hinge design, there’s also a small loopy gap between the screen and the keyboard when the Book is closed. It didn’t bother me at all, but it bears mentioning. \nJust like the first version of the machine , Surface Book with Performance Base is certainly a laptop first—a damn good laptop first, with a great keyboard, superb performance, and a sharp display that gains more than you’d think from its aspect ratio. The new graphics-boosted configurations represent steps up in performance, with the same clever engineering elements that make them such unique portables. But they’re certainly pricey, and if you can do without the tablet mode—and if you truly want a tablet, not a slate PC, you probably can—you can find a similarly powerful machine for the same price or less. \nIt just won’t be as cool.",

      "text": "by Paul Lilly — Thursday, November 10, 2016 Microsoft Refunds Surface Pro 3 Owners That Paid For Out Of Warranty Battery Swaps All is well that ends well for Surface Pro 3 owners, it just took a little bit of time to get there. Various battery issues have plagued the tablet for several months, and with its latest firmware release, Microsoft thinks it has finally solved the problem for good. Microsoft also made the decision to refund users the cost of a replacement battery if they purchased one for the Surface Pro 3 beyond its warranty period. \"We’ve gathered additional details about which customers were affected and are committed to making sure that the people who experienced this issue are taken care of. We have reached out to those customers and all refunds were processed in October 2016,\" Microsoft stated in an FAQ on the topic.Anyone who is eligible should have already received an email from Microsoft notifying them that their refund is being processed. Microsoft says it should take around two to three billing cycles to process the refund, assuming it is able to process it directly to the user's credit card. In other cases, Microsoft will cut a check, though it didn't say how long that would take.For anyone that feels they are eligible but never received an email, Microsoft advises contacting customer support for Surface. The agent will ask for the user's Microsoft account and the service request number from the original out-of-warranty Surface Pro 3 battery swap.As to the underlying issue that caused the latest round of battery woes for Surface Pro 3 owners, Microsoft says there was an \"error condition\" that caused the full charge status to be misreported to the operating system and BIOS. When that happens, the battery is unable to be fully charged and the Surface Pro 3 won't even function on battery power.There is an update available now to fix the issue. Microsoft suggests applying it even if no symptoms are present. To do so, go to Start > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update > Check for updates. Install the \"System Firmware Update - 11/7/2016\" patch and restart the Surface Pro 3 (don't shut it down). Once it has been applied and boots into Windows, Microsoft says users will need to perform one final restart for the new battery logic to take effect.",

The Good Improved speed, graphics and battery life in a similar design; detachable tablet comes included, as does the Surface Pen; crisp design; has USB ports and SD card slot The Bad It's also slightly thicker and heavier than last year's version, and retains the odd gap on the folding hinge.

      "title": "Surface Book i7 Review: One for the pros",
      "text": "Igor Bonifacic \nNovember 10, 2016 9:00am \nGoing into Microsoft’s fall Windows 10 event in New York City on October 26th, the company was not expected to announce a new Surface Book or Surface Pro. However, in something of a surprise announcement, Panos Panay, corporate vice president of devices at Microsoft and head of the Surface team, unveiled the Surface Book i7, a new high-end version of the company’s existing Surface Book two-in-one. \nOn the surface (ahem), the new laptop, available in Canada starting today, looks exactly like the Surface Book Microsoft announced more than a year ago. Inside, however, it features a number of improvements over its predecessor. Most notably, it adds a sixth generation Intel Skylake Core i7 processor, discrete Nvidia Geforce GTX 965M GPU, up to 1TB of internal storage, a higher capacity battery and a more efficient cooling system. \nMicrosoft sent MobileSyrup a Surface Book i7 to review. Given that we’ve had our review unit for less than a week and the fact that the Surface Book i7 represents, at best, a minor refresh of the Surface Book lineup, we thought it best to keep our thoughts on the device brief. We’ll have a lot more to say when Microsoft releases the Surface Book 2 and Surface Pro 5. Specs Sixth generation Intel Core i7 processor 256GB, 512GB or 1TB SSD 8GB or 16GB of RAM 13.5-inch PixelSense Display, 3000 x 2000 resolution Nvidia GeForce 965M GPU with 2GB of GDDR5 RAM 802.11ac Wi-Fi wireless Two full-size USB 3.0 ports, as well as a SD card reader and headset jack Surface Pen included \nWhen the usually charismatic Panos Panay unveiled the Surface Book i7 , he was more sarcastic than his usual self. Speaking to the two-in-one’s more capable Nvidia GPU, he said, “Gamers, they want more frame rates… I don’t really get it, but they want it.” Later, talking about mechanical engineers and their needs, he stated, “Engineers, they want to spin more parts in CAD and they don’t want any lag. I don’t get that either, but they do.” \nIn hindsight, I think he was trying to say Surface Book i7 has far more computing hardware than the average person will ever need. \nPanay called Surface Book i7 “the most performative” 2-in-1 on the market, and while I haven’t had an opportunity to test it against the field, I can say it’s overkill for most computing tasks — though it’s overkill in the best way possible. \nSurface Book i7 makes using apps like Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom a pleasure. It’s also able to play modern games like Overwatch with relative ease — though given the amount of heat generated by the computer when playing said games, it’s probably best to look to a desktop solution for more serious gaming. \nAll that performance comes at a significant cost, however. \nIn Canada, the Surface Book i7 starts at $3,129. The most expensive model, which comes with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, costs a staggering $4,379. Moreover, despite their expensive price tag, Surface Book i7 models do not come Intel’s new Kaby Lake processors nor one of Nvidia’s 1000 series GPUs. \nBoth these components are a significant improvement over their predecessors. Nvidia’s new graphics cards, in particular, deliver the best price-per-performance ratio of any 3D cards on the market. Taken together, it feels like the Surface Book i7 is a something of missed opportunity in this respect. \nIt’s also a disappointment in terms of battery life. Microsoft boasted about the computer’s improved battery life, touting up to 16 hours of up time. While it may be possible to get 16 hours of battery life out of the Surface Book i7 by aggressively managing its power consumption, at best I was able to get four to five hours of battery life while doing things like surfing the web, listening to music on Spotify and editing photos in Lightroom. \nThat said, its less than stellar battery life performance is at least understandable given its many high-end components. \nOne other issue I will note — and its a minor one at that — is that while the Surface Book i7 possess an excellent display, with brilliant colour reproduction, its 60Hz refresh rate can be a bit jarring. Surface Book i7 is a powerful machine and yet switching between virtual desktops and windows can feel sluggish. That said, I’m attuned to these difference because I own and use a 144Hz monitor at home. Most consumers, having not used a 120Hz or 144Hz monitor before, will be happy with the Surface Book i7’s display. \nPerformance aside, this is the same laptop Microsoft released more than a year ago. While nowhere near as divisive as Apple’s new MacBook Pro lineup, the Surface Book does have its detractors, thanks to its unique hinge mechanism. \nMicrosoft didn’t mention this during its keynote, but the Surface design team was able to narrow the gap between the top of the device and its base. It’s still there, but based on what I’ve seen with my unit, the Surface Book i7 should be better at keeping dust and dirt away while closed. \nSurface Book i7 on top; 2015 Surface Book on the bottom. Notice the thicker base of the Surface Book i7. \nLook closely and you’ll also notice that the Surface Book i7 features a slightly thicker base than the 2015 Surface Book. The former is also heavier than the latter: 3.63 pounds compared to the original’s 3.48 pounds. \nExpensive price tag and minor issues aside, the Surface Book i7 is a phenomenal computer. \nIf you find yourself in its target market and are in desperate need of a new machine, then you could do far worse than the Surface Book i7. However, if you can wait about a year, then it’s probably you bide your time. Given just how much the Surface Pro has improved in the short time it’s been on the market, I imagine the Surface Book 2 will improve upon the Surface Book in a number of significant ways. \nIndeed, for everyone else this computer is most exciting for the engineering feat it represents. Using almost exactly the same frame as the 2015 Surface Book, the Surface team was able to cram several new components. It’s likely that experience will help inform the team’s future products, devices that will be more affordable to the average consumer. Pros",

      "text": "November 9, 2016 1:15pm \nIt looks like Dell and Intel have a new vision for Microsoft’s Windows 10 ecosystem. \nAccording to often reliable tipster Evan Blass, the two companies have started work on a project internally known as Dell Stack that focuses on a 6.4-inch tablet with the ability to power a desktop or tablet. \nThe concept behind the project is to combine all of your devices into one, with the power source being the mini-tablet, removing the need to move between multiple platforms or uploading files to the cloud. The device would be powered by Windows 10’s fascinating but underutilized Continuum feature, which allows Windows 10 Mobile devices to connect to a screen in order to offer a simplified version of Windows. \nWhat makes Stack different from other devices that support Continuum is that it’s reportedly able to deliver a full desktop experience when docked thanks to its powerful x86 Kaby Lake Y-series processor. The device would also come equipped with either 4GB or 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of solid state storage, along with microSD expansion slot. \nBuild wise the Stack will reportedly measure in at just 9mm thick. It’s unclear when the project will come to fruition and at least so far there have been no official announcements from either Dell or Intel, though some reports indicate that these leaked Surface Phone images are actually of Dell’s Stack. Source Venture Beat Marc Palumbo \nDefinitely would be interesting and original, but I still worry about the battery. If one cannot get a full day of phone use, then don’t release it. Fodder0f4 \nIt would be SO nice to have one device to rule them all but I’m not sure it’s feasible. \nI have an old i7 laptop that does my grunt work (and will until it dies…then I’ll get a Surface Book), a Tab A for note taking (it’s nice having the digitization go right to OneNote..does anyone know if OneNote does OCR of PDFs attached to it? something I could try out), and a S7 edge to be the mobile gap between the two when both are tucked away in my laptop bag. Mr Dog \nExactly my thoughts as well. It seems like a great idea but it is just not feasible at this point in time. Especially since the software is not there yet either, Will Maitner \nInteresting idea, until you talked about the Samsung devices and the Surface Book. Give me a real laptop instead of that Surface and an iPad/iPhone combo and I’m game. Graham Fluet \nI hope it has a cellular radio and can make phone calls, otherwise I’d have no reason to carry it around. The Iceman Cometh \nDell makes crap so matter what they release here I’ll take a pass Will Maitner \nBetter than Lenovo or HP. Jon Shopping \nEh I would argue that Lenovo has a leg up on Dell. I like the Dell business machines, but at all price points Lenovo delivers solid machines. \nHP build quality seems to be getting cheaper every day. The Iceman Cometh \nActually Lenovo is better quality than Dell these days. Sorry Will Maitner \nExcuse me, but if it’s running an x86 processor, then it can run full Windows, so no Continuum required. Just dock it like you would the Venue 8 to a Plugable Pro8 dock.

      "text": "Tweet \nMicrosoft has kept its promise and delivered a vulnerability patch for its Windows operating system, for a flaw, revealed by Google, which allowed attackers to gain full control of a targeted system. \nReleasing the details in a security bulletin , Microsoft says the flaw in the Windows kernel \"could allow elevation of privilege if an attack logs onto an affected system and runs a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities\". \nOnce an attacker gains control of the system, they can install other malicious applications which would allow even easier access, eliminating the need for the original flaw. \"To exploit the vulnerabilities, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control of an affected system\". \n\"The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory”, it says in the bulletin. The important patch, named MS16-135, is currently available for Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and all Windows Server versions from 2008 to 2016. \nOne of the biggest contributors to the vast number of cyberattacks against both individuals and companies is an outdated operating system, or application. Besides having a quality cybersecurity solution in place, and having healthy online habits, it is important for everyone to keep their software up to date, to protect from different flaws, vulnerabilities, viruses and other malware. \nPublished under license from ITProPortal.com, a Future plc Publication.

LFG has been used for years as a way to find fellow gamers to play multiplayer titles, and Microsoft is bringing its own take on LFG to the Xbox.\n\nLFG for Xbox will let gamers find people to complete quests, achievements, and other activities by posting on Xbox Live. The result is like a forum post that others can filter to find, and quickly start a party chat and play the game required.

      "title": "Why Microsoft cares so much about Xbox Live’s new social features",
      "text": "In the new era of Xbox Live, you’ll get by with a little help from your friends.\nA new update is out for for Xbox One and the Xbox app for Windows 10 that adds several new features, including an easier way for people to find others to play with via the LFG system (LFG standing for “looking for group”). Plus, people can make now make Clubs, player-run places where they can chat and join up with friends and like-minded Xbox users.\nGamesBeat interviewed head of platform engineering at Xbox, Mike Ybarra, about the upcoming changes, Microsoft’s focus on social features, and how it plans to moderates these new groups.\nAbove: Killer Instinct is the first game to get Arena support.\nImage Credit: Microsoft GamesBeat: Clubs and Looking For Group are out now, but the tournament-based Arena system is coming out a bit later, right? \nMike Ybarra: Yeah, that’s right. Arena will stay in preview for a while. We have some great tournaments for Killer Instinct that will go online. We’re just getting a bit more fine-tuning, a bit more time on it. It’s one of the features that’s among the highest growth areas in esports, in terms of developer and consumer interest. We’re very excited about what that’s going to bring.\nGamesBeat: These are also social features. Sometimes these fall updates are more about the interface. Why such a strong push for the social aspect this time? \nYbarra: When we prioritize features, we look at our user voice feedback, which is a general site where anybody can go up and say, “Here’s a feature I think is important and would make Xbox better.” We look at that pretty closely. There are times where we focus on UI elements because the feedback says it’s a little slow, or it’s a little too complicated to get into a party, or people want a brand new feature. This cycle — it’s a good conclusion to say that we wanted to focus on a lot of the top feedback around bringing people together on Xbox Live, making it easier to find friends, making it more inviting to play with people that have the same likes I have.\nThat’s where you see a lot of the focus in this cycle. In addition to that, there’s a lot of interest in ensuring that Xbox Live goes where people go. We have big investments in our mobile app and the Xbox app on Windows 10, making sure those features show up and light up anywhere that people are. They can check on their status, reply to their friends, and be part of that social gaming network at any time of the day. There’s a lot of social features here, but it’s all based on a consistent prioritization around user feedback and what the fans are asking us for.\nGamesBeat: I’ve seen places for games — Destiny is a big example — where people have been setting up their own sites to find groups. Is there a desire to keep people within the Xbox infrastructure while they’re doing these sorts of things? \nYbarra: I wouldn’t say that exactly. I love giving gamers choice to go do things any way they want to. They should have fun gaming wherever they game. It’s true that there’s a couple of websites you can use to get into — you used Destiny as an example, to get into Destiny games. On the console there wasn’t really an easy solution to that. A lot of people love those apps because they can go do the weekly Nightfall or strike or raid or whatever they want with new people they meet. We just wanted to make it easier for people to be able to do that on their console or their PC or their phone at any time. A lot of what you see on the websites are what we call “now moment items.” I want to do a strike right now in Destiny. I need two more people, level 30 or higher. Must have a microphone. That type of scenario.\nWith our tech we’re allowing you to set it up to seven days in advance, so if you want to do something on Saturday and today’s Tuesday you can set it up. People on Xbox Live will accept it. You can approve them going into the group. It’s a bit more trustworthy in the sense that the number of people who drop out or don’t show up is far less, because you know they’re already on Xbox Live. They’re playing your game. They’ve probably looked at your profile. To me it’s all about giving gamers the choices they want and making it as easy as possible. We don’t want people to have to bring up websites, find websites for different games. We bring that all together in one place across our phone app, the Windows 10 app, and the console.\nAbove: There’s gotta be someone who wants to play me somewhere.\nImage Credit: GamesBeat GamesBeat: As I get older, it’s harder to find time to play with people. I think when we’re younger, we would just get on and your friends would be available and you’d play with them. But as the demographic grows up we need to schedule our game time. \nYbarra: I think it’s a little different from that. Games have evolved from largely single-player experiences to team experiences. Working together as part of a group to accomplish a task. As games evolve, Xbox Live has to evolve to make sure that we’re in front of what customers and game developers expect. To use your example, Destiny’s great. There’s weekly Nightfall, weekly raids, strikes that reset every single week. You want to find people to do that every week. As games evolve and go forward, across all our devices we want to make sure our platform evolves and enables creators to build these experiences and give fans what they need.\nGamesBeat: Clubs are similar, except it’s a way for people to join a group and be able to chat with each other that’s centered around a shared interest, right? \nYbarra: We designed clubs with a few things in mind. One of them was, we want Xbox Live to be a great place for every type of gamer. I have a 12-year-old son and he has a club that’s just his school friends. I know it’s completely safe. He can share and chat and do whatever he wants in that club. He has a great time.\nI have several clubs for old gamers I went to college with where we hang out. It’s about discovering people that have the same values and goals in gaming that you have, but it’s also about bringing some of the core clans and guilds that exist over to Xbox Live in a meaningful way for them, so they can easily communicate – either when they’re in front of their consoles or when they’re on their phone or PC. I think of it as more of a discovery of people that share similar interests and a way to have a safe place to play together and create some awesome gaming moments.\nGamesBeat: Are clubs going to be moderated by Microsoft at all, or are the people who start the clubs self-moderating there? \nYbarra: It’s a mix of both. When you create a club there’s a code of conduct that you accept. Of course, we have teams watching that. At the same time, we want to empower the people that create and moderate the club to have the freedom to do so. Obviously there’s the owner of a club. That person controls a whole set of settings on privacy and who can do what within the club that they can manage. There are admins of the club who can invite people and kick people. There’s a set of tools that not just one person, but a set of people defined by the owner of the club, can use to help manage the conduct in the club and make sure that it’s a great place for people.\nGamesBeat: Both of these features have been available in the preview program for a bit. What has the feedback been like? Have you made any changes based on feedback? \nYbarra: We’re very excited to get this out of preview and into everybody’s hands. It’s been a great feedback process we went through and we’re super happy with where we are today. All the features we went through in preview, I can’t think of one where we didn’t receive feedback that caused some change. Some of those changes were minor – maybe the way the UI works – up to questions of whether something was really designed correctly. Several features, we didn’t release them. We went back to the drawing board because of feedback. I love the preview audience we have. They give us invaluable feedback. They’re some of our most passionate fans. Their feedback impacts the product across the board, whatever it is we do.\nAbove: You can make a group with fellow Gears of War 4 fans.\nImage Credit: Microsoft GamesBeat: Achievements are seeing some changes in the update. Why mess with something that’s been relatively unchanged since the launch of the Xbox 360? \nYbarra: One of the big asks we see from fans — achievements is something that’s a staple of Xbox Live. There’s a set of folks out there who love that score and want to drive that score as high as possible. From a game developer’s standpoint, it’s their way of patting the user on the back when they do something great in the game. We’ll introduce achievement rarity later this week when we launch this update to everyone. We wanted to give a special pat on the back to people who achieve something that less than 10 percent of the people playing a title accomplish. To keep going down the Destiny path, if you beat the latest raid in the latest expansion, probably less than percent of players achieve that.\nSo when you do that and get the achievement, it’s a brand-new animation and a brand-new sound in all the UIs – mobile, Windows 10, Xbox. They all show a diamond next to it to recognize the fact that you’re one of the 10 percent to achieve that. At the same time, for all achievements, you’ll be able to see what percentage of the Xbox Live community that’s played the game received the achievement. In Destiny you get one that’s almost mandatory, right out of the gate, and you’ll see that 85 percent or whatever it is have achieved that. There’s a rarity element to it, and then there’s the overall percentage element, which has been awesome.\nThe feedback we have is very positive. You have a goal of getting rare achievements now. People are becoming rare achievement hunters, spending hours trying to get the achievements nobody else has. It’s a great feature that’s been widely accepted.\nGamesBeat: Why change Achievements now? \nYbarra: It’s something fans have asked for for a while. We wanted to think about how to implement this in the right way. There are lots of feedback channels and processes we go through. From a feature prioritization standpoint and a user feedback point of view, it was high. We felt like now was a great time to deliver that and give people a little more insight into the number of achievements their fellow gamers are doing across titles.\nGamesBeat: Clubs are on both Xbox One and Windows 10, correct? \nMS: Yeah, that’s right. A lot of users right now are logging in to Xbox Live on their mobile devices. We’re very proud of the Xbox app that we have. The engagement is very high. It’s our commitment to make sure that when new features come out, users can engage with those anywhere they are. If they’re on the bus, on the way home, they can check in on their clubs. They can chat in their club chat. They can look at their latest achievements. They can reply to group messaging on their phone. If they’re at their PC, at school or work, they can check in really fast. And of course, if they’re in front of the console, they can do the same. That element of consistency is important to us.\nGamesBeat: You said Arena is going in testing a bit longer. What info do you want to get out of that longer testing period? What are you looking to tweak? \nMS: It’s a couple of things. One, developer feedback on Arena. Competitive play, which is inclusive of esports, is one of the hottest areas in a lot of the latest games and future games coming out. Developers are spending a lot of time saying, “I want to figure out how our title engages with that.” It increases the amount of time people play in their games. It’s healthy for game developers and the titles they make. So we’re having a lot of discussions with developers about what that means and how we differentiate ourselves in a meaningful way that provides value to them. Then, from a consumer standpoint, there’s a whole host of feedback as far as the experience.\nToday, to effectively compete and play in competitive games, it’s pretty difficult. There are these large events, but that’s .001 percent of the population that actually particulates in those events. A lot of people watch, which is very cool — more people watching and playing is a trend we see too. But we want to make sure that anybody has a chance to play in Arena. There’s some work we want to do from an experience point of view to make sure that’s super optimized for the broadest set of users on Xbox Live.\n",

      "text": "share \nMicrosoft is starting to roll out its holiday update to Xbox One owners today. The update brings two big new features to Xbox One and Xbox Live: looking for group (LFG) and Clubs . LFG has been used for years as a way to find fellow gamers to play multiplayer titles, and Microsoft is bringing its own take on LFG to the Xbox. \nLFG for Xbox will let gamers find people to complete quests, achievements, and other activities by posting on Xbox Live. The result is like a forum post that others can filter to find, and quickly start a party chat and play the game required. It's a useful way to avoid LFG sites and spare your inbox from lots of Xbox Live messages. \nAlongside the LFG feature, Microsoft is also rolling out Clubs with the holiday update. Clubs are designed to be created by anyone on Xbox Live, and you can create unique names for these groups just like a gamertag is unique. They're effectively Microsoft's version of clans, and they make creating parties, sharing game clips, and party chat a lot easier for groups of friends or people interested in the same game. \nMicrosoft is also rolling out the club functions to the Xbox apps for Windows 10, iOS, and Android today, and all apps and the Xbox One will also support group messaging on Xbox Live. Group messaging lets you send a single message to an entire group of friends or a clan, and everyone can reply using the Xbox apps or an Xbox One console. Microsoft is adding emoji to its Xbox One keyboard to assist with group chat messages, so you can get creative with your replies. \nThe Xbox One will also include some variations on the achievement feature with this new holiday update. A dramatic new sound will now play for rare Xbox achievements , and gamers will now be able to see just how rare achievements are within each game. The Gamerscore leaderboard is also being tweaked, and it will now reset at the beginning of the month, instead of rolling over a 30-day period. Next Up In Gaming",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 6 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft today announced the general availability of the Holiday Update for the Xbox One and One S. As with all updates to the console since Windows 10 was introduced to it, it's known by many names, including Version 1610 and the Anniversary Update (AU). \nYou might recall that when the company first detailed the AU for the Xbox One, it had promised that it would roll out in two separate updates , the first being the Summer Update (also referred to as the 'August Update'), which was released back in July . Previews for the second wave began arriving to testers in September . \nThe main features of today's update include Clubs, Looking for Group, and Arena, which were all announced back at E3 2016 in June . Here's what's new: \nClubs on Xbox Live. Clubs are gamer-created and managed groups that can help you meet people and grow communities of gamers who love the same things you do. Anyone can join or create a Club, and you’ll probably see a Club for just about everything. If you do not, creating a Club is quick and easy. As a Club member, you’ll be able to set up parties, play games, share content, and easily communicate using voice and text chat with the Club across Xbox One and the Xbox app on Windows 10, iOS, and Android devices, which is great if you want to stay in touch with your Clubs on the go, or find and join new Clubs from your phone. You can search for Clubs (or create your own) in the Community tab on Xbox One and the Clubs section on other devices, and Clubs associated with a game will be accessible in the title’s Game Hub. As a Club admin, you’ll have the tools to ensure that everyone is having a great time and help create a lively and inclusive environment. In case you missed it, check out our tutorial video on Clubs here . \nLooking for Group on Xbox Live. Looking for Group (LFG) helps you quickly find other players that you want to game with. It’s like posting a gaming “want-ad” to the Xbox community. You can use LFG to help complete daily quests, Achievement hunt, or even get a group together to annihilate hordes of the Swarm and DeeBees in Gears of War 4. You’ll be able to add certain requirements to make sure that you’re finding the right gamers. You can specify the game, the game mode, the language the party will be speaking, how many people you need, rules like no trash talking or casual friendly, and any other in-game requirements like level, gear or character type. \nHere’s how LFG works: gamers can browse open LFGs and request to join the ones that they’re interested in. The LFG host chooses from the list of gamers who have expressed interest and, once the group is full or the host is ready, the host can quickly get those people into Party Chat and start playing. You can even create an LFG post for future gaming sessions up to seven days in advance! For example, if you’re on your way home and want to make the most of your gaming for the night, you can set up everything in advance from your phone, so when you’re home and ready to go, you can just jump right in. \nQuick and easy. Whether you’re playing on Xbox One or Windows 10 PC, you can quickly find other gamers to play with on Xbox Live. Check out our LFG tutorial video on LFG here . \nAchievement Rarity. Achievement Rarity, a top fan request on Xbox Feedback, helps you discover just how unique an Achievement is among players of a given game. When you earn a rare Achievement, you’ll get a special notification and diamond icon highlighting it. Unlock one today and let us know how you like the new animation! \nGroup Messaging on Xbox Live: Group Messaging helps you coordinate and keep in touch with your friends and fellow gamers by sending a single group message to everyone in a single conversation. You can also add people to the group and dynamically change the conversation topic. Group Messaging works across Xbox One and the Xbox app on Windows 10, iOS, and Android devices. To help you write your messages even faster on Xbox One, we have added a new predictive dictionary which you can quick access with the right thumb stick on your controller. \nGamerscore Leaderboard. We’ve improved the Gamerscore Leaderboard on Xbox One and the Xbox app on Windows 10 devices. The Leaderboard now resets at the beginning of each month instead of displaying results for a 30-day rolling period, meaning you and your friends will have a clean slate to compete against one another at the start of each month! You can keep an eye on the Gamerscore Leaderboard through the Achievements tab in your profile. \nEmojis for your Xbox One virtual keyboard. Emojis will be joining your virtual keyboard on Xbox One! In addition to the existing alphabet and symbols that you can use, you’ll now be able to express your likes, dislikes and more with a host of different emojis on Xbox Live. Once on your virtual keyboard, you can get to emojis by pulling the left trigger until they show up. From there, select any emoji, or press and hold on one to see more related emoji. \nAs you can see, there are quite a few new features. Of course, if you're on the Xbox One Preview Program, you have all of this already. In fact, the Preview Program was recently rebranded as the Xbox Insider Program , and anyone can sign up for it now; however, new members will be ineligible for system updates. \nThe next thing in the Xbox's future will be the Creators Update . There's not a lot that's known right now about what will be included in the Xbox One variant of it, but given that it's slated to be released in four or five months, we shouldn't have to wait too long to find out.

      "text": "Enlarge (credit: Peter Bright)\nThe Surface Pro 3 has had a series of issues around its battery life. There are two brands of battery used inside Microsoft's tablets: Simplo and LG. A bug meant that Simplo-equipped systems were seeing their battery life reduced to a handful of minutes , and this was fixed with a firmware update in August . But that fix appeared to be causing problems for systems with the LG batteries, rendering the devices unable to charge.\nA new firmware update has been released (first spotted by Neowin ) that purports to remedy this problem. Fingers crossed it won't cause any further issues for Simplo systems.\nMicrosoft's release notes suggest that in both cases, the problems appear to be with the way the battery management reports the available battery life to the system. Batteries were being reported as full, even when they were empty. This prevented the system from being able to fully charge the batteries. With each successive charge, the \"full\" indication would be sent more and more prematurely, making the battery life fall further and further.\nRead 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "  \nThe Microsoft Translator team has taken to the MSDN blog to announce that you can now fine tune your translations using categories with Translator for Bing. The availability comes after the categories feature was introduced in January for use with the Microsoft Translator Hub, and now finally make its way in Translator for Bing on the web. \nTo use the categories feature to get text translations related to the topic at hand, all you need to do is type “?category=xyz”, where xyz is the category, at the end of the URL. For example, if you’re looking for text translations on technology, you would type, www.bing.com/translator?category=tech . Currently there are two categories, “tech,” and “speech,” but more are on the way. \nAccording to Microsoft, the categories feature is perfect for, “If you need to translate related, speech-based content, or frequently translate short passages using terminology unique to your business or industry, category-enabled translations.” \nWith the categories feature, Bing Translate has become smarter, and now not only considers general language data, but (with the user input from categories) can now come up with a translation that is tailored to the topic or individual organization. As per Microsoft, there are two types of categories: standard categories to fine-tune your translations based on the subject matter of the content and Hub category IDs for customized translation systems. \nThe Standard categories allow for users to improve their translations by telling Microsoft Translator what type of content is being translated. On the other hand, with Hub category ID’s you can add your own unique category ID and build customized translation systems that understand your own unique terminology within your business and industry. To use the Hub, however, you will need to first sign up for an account with Microsoft Translator. \nTo learn more about the new categories feature, you can check out the full blog post here . As always, though, please do let us know how you will be using categories, by dropping us a comment below! In this story stream:",

      "text": "\nAfter America elected Donald Trump as its next president this week, many tech leaders weren’t shy about sharing their concerns. 500 Startups founder Dave McClure said he was sad, ashamed, and angry. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said he was “stunned.” RealNetworks CEO Rob Glaser called it the “most disastrous night in American Political History in my adult lifetime.” HyperloopOne co-founder Shervin Pishevar even said he wanted to support a campaign for the state of California to split from the nation.\nMicrosoft and its CEO Satya Nadella, meanwhile, remained fairly diplomatic.\nIn a short LinkedIn post , Nadella wrote that on Tuesday “we witnessed the democratic process in action here in the U.S.”\n“The results are of importance around the world, and I know that interest is shared among Microsoft employees,” he continued. “We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday. Our commitment to our mission and values are steadfast, and in particular fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.”\nEmbed from Getty Images \nNadella then linked to a longer post penned by Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith.\n“Today is a day that finds some Americans celebrating and others commiserating about the electoral result,” Smith wrote. “But it’s also a day that reminds us of what makes the country special. It’s a day that provides an opportunity to look beyond disagreements and divides, identify bold solutions to common problems, and find new ways to work together. It’s a good time for all of us to listen and to learn from each other.”\nLike Nadella, Smith kept a diplomatic tone throughout his piece. He congratulated Trump and his running-mate Mike Pence for winning the nomination and then laid out four issues that “rise near the top as we think about the country and information technology”: Job creation, infrastructure, diversity, and cybersecurity.\nMicrosoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith (GeekWire File Photo) Microsoft wants to help more people — particularly those with a high school degree or less — find jobs, and thinks that technology can play a role. Smith pointed to the company’s pending acquisition of LinkedIn, noting how “new technology services and tools help individuals develop new skills and connect with new jobs.”\nHe also said that data analytics and cloud technologies can help fuel new investments in infrastructure, whether it be related to transportation or broadband internet.\nSmith also touched on diversity , noting that more than a third of Microsoft’s engineers come from other countries.\n“We have employees from every race, ethnic background and religion,” he wrote. “If there’s a language spoken on the planet, there’s a good chance that it’s spoken by an employee at Microsoft. And we’re committed to promoting not just diversity among all the men and women who work here, but the type of inclusive culture that will enable people to do their best work and pursue rewarding careers.\nWe know that this is the only way we’ll fully succeed as a company. And we believe it’s the only way we’ll fully succeed as a country.”\nFinally, as questions swirl about how Trump will handle issues around cybersecurity and encryption , Smith said Microsoft is committed to developing “technology that is secure and trusted, both for Americans and for people around the world.” He said that everyone will benefit from “stronger government policies.”\nOther tech giants like Apple and Facebook also played it fairly safe with their responses to Trump’s victory. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who was berated by Trump over his ownership of the Washington Post and Amazon’s tax practices, tweeted this on Thursday:\nCongratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 \nYou can read Microsoft’s full post here .",
