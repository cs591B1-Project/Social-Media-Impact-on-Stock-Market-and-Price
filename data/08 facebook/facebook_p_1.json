Did you know, your Facebook friend circle is connected to your life span? \nA study says that if you accept all your Facebook friend requests, you’re probably expected to live longer, reports the New York Daily. \nScientists who studied Facebook activity for more than a decade suggest that people who have strong social media networks and receive multiple friend requests are less likely to die. \nThe study, led by Northeastern University professor Williams Hobb and University of California, San Diego, professor James Fowler, showed that there are links between people’s health and their social media accounts, whether in person or online. \n“We find that Facebook users who accept more friendships have a lower risk of mortality, but there is no relationship for those who initiate more friendships,” the authors wrote. “Mortality risk is lowest for those with high levels of offline social interaction and moderate levels of online social interaction.” \nHobbs believes people who have modÂ­erate interÂ­acÂ­tions on Facebooks are more likely to remain friends with them in person, he said in a Northeastern newsletter. \nIn their study, Hobbs and Fowler took data over six months from 12 million California-based Facebook users in 2011 and compared them to records from the California Department of Public Health from 2012 to 2013 to check how many people died within those years. Those Facebook users, of all genders and ages, were born between 1945 and 1989. \nThe scientists concluded that there was no link between people’s health and the Facebook requests they have sent and those who accepted them. \n“You would think that the assoÂ­ciÂ­aÂ­tion would go both ways,” Hobb said in the newsletter. “That was a disÂ­apÂ­pointing finding because it sugÂ­gests that telling people to go out and make more friends might not improve their health.” \nThe study has been published in the National Academy of Science.

      "title": "What's Spiking the Vikings?",
      "text": " Share Share on Facebook + Comments \nThis is a talented team, with a potential top five defense, solid receivers, an above average quarterback, special teams that are usually consistent (with one horrific exception, discussed below. Guess.) and one of the best defensive minds in the game at head coach. \nSo what's happening? Why this sudden, embarrassing skid, and can it be fixed? \nThe good news is, yes, it can. Every team has less-than-par facets. The art of football is game planning so that you maximize your strengths, while targeting your opponents' weaknesses. The Vikings are no exception, and there is no reason why, with this level of talent that the Vikings, with proper game planning, shouldn't be expected to repeat as NFC North champions. What happens after that is, of course, anyone's guess. Teams with much more serious weaknesses than this year's Viking squad have won Super Bowls. \nThe bad news is, fixing it is going to require some radical changes that the organization doesn't seem inclined to pursue. \n1) The Offensive (and I mean that in every sense of the word) Line. While the protection was somewhat improved over the last two weeks, this unit has to be counted over the course of the season as one of the worst in the NFL. They get no significant command of the LOS on most running plays, and the pass protection can be described, if you're being generous, as spotty. Why? Lack of quality personnel. Injury has played a role in this, of course, but forgive me if I don't see Kalil as the answer to our prayers. \nHow can it be fixed? This year, it can't. There simply isn't enough room under the salary cap, or the personnel available on the market to bring in the 2-3 quality players it will take to bring this unit up to the NFL average. This is a gross weakness that is difficult to game plan around, but it CAN be done. The first five games of the year give an excellent example of how that can be done. \n2) The Kicking Game. Blair Walsh has the yips. While it is, unarguably true that no one player loses a game, the course of several games has been impacted by Blair Walsh's remarkable ability to miss routine kicks under pressure. \nThere are plenty of people out there who can kick a ball straight for 40 yards or so. What makes an NFL kicker is the ability to do so with thousands of people screaming at him, the game on the line, and eleven world-class athletes doing everything they can to prevent it. That is an issue of confidence. If he loses it, he will miss. If the coaching staff loses their confidence in him, it effects their decisions in game. \nThere is also the issue of accountability. Consistency should be rewarded in every position on the field. Unreliability must be weeded out. The message to the team is, \"We will put you in position to win the game, every week, if you execute.\" If the team is worried that all their work will be undone by missing a routine kick at the end of the game, it has an impact. \nHow can it be fixed? Blair Walsh must go. Immediately. It really doesn't matter who you replace him with – Locke should be able to fill in well enough, or any number of journeymen kickers are available at any time. Any number of \"scrubs\" can be relied upon to hit extra points and 35 yard field goals, which is a substantial improvement over what has been called, \"The Blair Walsh Project.\" \n3) Situational Defense. Although our defense is talented, they have shown a distressing inability to stop big running plays in critical situations during this recent skid. In each of these circumstances, the linebackers have been caught out of position, and with the exception of Harrison Smith and sometimes Xavier Rhodes, the tackling in the secondary has been spotty. \nHow to fix it? Training. The Linebackers must make better use of the defensive line to preserve their freedom of movement on running downs. The aggression that has made this defense so potent during the early season has been exploited by opposing offensive coordinators. As for the secondary, the point must be driven home to them that how hard you hit is secondary to your ability to get your body on the runner, wrap your arms, and bring him to the ground. The lesson you learned in Junior High must be reinforced. Form in the tackle is superior to velocity. The Viking defense must learn that making the highlight reel is less important than making sure that a five to seven yard gain doesn't become a forty-yard game changer. \n4) Game planning. The Viking offense, while it is never going to be spectacular with the current personnel, has been sufficient to win games when the game plan is built around short, quick-developing pass plays with the occasional sweep or trap to \"keep things honest.\" When the team has attempted to establish a power running game, the inability of the line to create push or open holes has been painfully apparent. Likewise, the long drop from under center highlights the line's inability to pass protect, and the relative immobility of Sam Bradford. Quick hitting slants, outs and crosses highlight Bradford's strength – his accuracy and decision making skills. \nHow to fix it? Play to our strengths, avoid our weaknesses. I am beginning to think that we need to establish a \"stubborn jar,\" where whoever calls the offensive plays must pay $20 every time he calls a run up the middle on first down and it is stoned at the line of scrimmage, or calls a seven-step drop from under center and gets a drive smothered by a sack or gets Bradford planted into the turf like a turnip. \nBy the way, Zimmer made some bad decisions today. But that doesn't obliterate the fact that he has made a great many good ones. The early success this season may have obscured the fact that he is still relatively new to Head Coaching duties, and may still have to find his feet, especially where the offensive game plan and play calling are concerned. I persist in thinking that he is capable and determined. In this case, patience is the cure. \nWhile I can't guarantee a Super Bowl if these recommendations are followed, I can guarantee that the Vikings will look less like a team trying to play like another team and failing. Do I think they will \"right the ship?\" To some degree. But much will depend on whether the staff can see this team as it is, not as they wish it were.

(Photo: File)   \nOsteopathic medicine dates to the early 1800's, when a physician named Andrew Taylor Still developed the concept after tragedy struck his own family. In the same season, three of Dr. Still's children died of meningitis as he watched helplessly, due to the lack of available medicine and the modern methods we enjoy today. “Osteopathic medicine considers and treats the patient as a whole rather than focusing solely on a specific ailment, or disease,” said Dr. David Abend, of Rowan Medicine’s NeuroMusculoskeletal Institute and an assistant professor at Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine. “Osteopathic physicians are taught that the structure of the human body is intimately related to its function and that both structure and function are subject to a wide range of disorders and diseases.” Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (DOs) practice their distinct philosophy in every medical specialty, employing a keen understanding of how each of the body’s systems affects the others. As part of their education, DOs receive additional instruction in the musculoskeletal system – the body’s interconnected system of nerves, muscles and bones – and are uniquely trained to use their hands and hands-on skills in osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM). \n“Through OMM, osteopathic physicians use their hands to diagnose illness and injury and encourage your body’s natural tendency toward self-healing,” explained Dr. Abend. “OMM can effectively treat your muscles and joints to relieve pain, promote healing and increase overall mobility.” \nA distinctive form of hands-on or 'manual' physical medicine, OMM remains one of medicine's best kept secrets. When performed by an osteopathic physician, OMM helps to restore the structural balance of the neuromusculoskeletal system, which is comprised of the brain, spinal cord and its associated nerves, ​bones, ligaments, tendons, blood vessels and muscles. \nOMM includes joint and spinal manipulation, physical therapy, postural re-education, exercises and any necessary prescribed medication, and can be combined with other sound medical specialties to act as an important adjunctive, but natural, healing option for both acute and chronic pain. \n“OMM can be effective in treating arthritis and spinal and joint pain,” Dr. Abend said. “And some osteopathic primary care physicians also use osteopathic manipulative techniques to help heal viral, sinus, respiratory, and digestive infections, as well as menstrual disorders, and to decrease the common back and sciatic pain women suffer during pregnancy and labor and in the postpartum period.” \nThis story is provided and presented by Rowan Medicine . \nMembers of the editorial and news staff of the Courier-Post were not involved in the creation of this content.  //on.cpsj.com/2fvhwK9",

      "text": "18 Remarkable Facts in Jewish History Share on Facebook 1. Jerusalem in Judah Benjamin – Because of the later Kingdom of Judah, whose capital was of course Jerusalem, it's only natural to think of the Holy City as belonging to the tribe of Judah. Originally, however, Jerusalem belonged properly to the tribe and territory of Benjamin, which abuts the northern border of Judah and which was later incorporated within the latter. 2. King for a Week – Army officer Zimri was the treasonous murderer of his master Elah, king of Israel. Like his forerunner Baasha, Zimri on his accession slew the entire line of his predecessors, in this case of the House of Baasha (even killing friends of the dynasty). Zimri was one of several senior military officers then vying for the monarchy. He reigned only for 7 days before the Israelite army at Gibbeton promoted Omri, a military captain, to the throne. Omri promptly besieged the capital Tirzah with Zimri therein. When he saw that the capital had fallen, the desperate Zimri set fire to the royal palace and perished in the flames. 3. High Priests & Murderers – In the Persian period, the high priest Johanan ben Jehoiada was provoked by his brother Jeshua into murdering him in the Temple. Josephus called the murder \"so great a crime, and so much the more horrible, that there never was so cruel and impious a thing done, neither by the Greeks nor Barbarians\" ( Jewish Antiquities , XI:7, § 1). In the Seleucid (Syrian Greek) period, the Jewish high priest Menelaus bribed a Seleucid high official to murder a predecessor, Honya (Onias) III, who was the legitimate scion of a high priestly dynasty and who had accused Menelaus of corruption and misdeeds. For his efforts, Honya was slain outside the temple at Daphne, Syria, where he had been seeking refuge. Later, the high priest Alcimus (Eliakim) pledged peace to the pious Hassideans who solicited him, but betrayed his word and arrested and slew 60 rabbis on the same day. When as high priest King Yannai Alexander offered the prescribed water libation during Sukkot, he let the water run on his feet, incensing the Pharisees, who pelted him with etrogs and vitriol in contempt. Yannai let loose his mercenaries upon the Pharisees and 6,000 were slaughtered. 6 years of civil war ensued, amid which the Pharisees invited the Seleucid ruler Demetrius III Eucaerus to war against Yannai, who was defeated. Yannai recuperated and had 800 Pharisees crucified in Jerusalem. By the cessation of hostilities, 50,000 Jewish lives had been lost and the Pharisees, including their leaders, had been scattered among foreign lands, awaiting the king's demise before their eventual return. 4. Chanukah's Arch-Villain Mourned Jewish Leader – Due to the corruption and hellenizing extremes of his successors Jason and Menelaus, the high priest Honya III fled for safety to a temple in Daphne, near Antioch. He was murdered at Menelaus' instigation by Andronicus, a Seleucid high official, who was soon thereafter put to death for the cold-blooded crime. Remarkably, according to 2 Maccabees (4:37), \"King Antiochus was deeply grieved and was so filled with sorrow that he was moved to tears when he recalled the wisdom and self-control that Honya had shown throughout his life.\" 5. Peace Was Agreed in the Hasmonean Civil War – The sons of King Yannai Alexander and Queen Shalom Zion, Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, disputed the royal succession. Hyrcanus' soldiers defected to Aristobulus in battle at Jericho; Hyrcanus retreated to Jerusalem but was compelled to surrender when Aristobulus captured the Temple. A victorious Aristobulus deprived Hyrcanus of the throne and high priesthood alike, but peace was made, though it proved short-lived. Thanks to the wily Antipater, a seditious Idumean and father of Herod the Great, the sibling rivalry and civil war were renewed, eventuating in the Roman occupation and annexation of Judea. 6. A Jewish Royal Was the First Ever Put to Death by the Romans – In 40 BCE, t he Parthians (Arsacids) of Persia conquered Jerusalem and crowned the Hasmonean contender Mattathias Antigonus king and high priest of Judea. Mattathias' uncle Hyrcanus II was once again deposed as high priest, and Herod the Great's brother Phasael was held hostage. Herod fled and rallied his Roman allies: Marc Antony defeated the Parthians, and Herod besieged Jerusalem and captured Mattathias in 37 BCE. Herod delivered Mattathias to the Romans at Antioch, Syria, where they promptly beheaded the last Hasmonean king of Judea in the first known instance of the Romans putting to death a defeated monarch. 7. Entrepreneurial Pedagogues – Many of the sages of Israel were as intrepid as they were erudite. Schools were founded in various eras by the enterprising likes of Shimon ben Shetah, Joshua ben Gamla, Hiyya bar Abba I (Rabbah), Judah Nesiah II, Rav (Abba Arikha), Judah bar Ezekiel, Sheshet, Papa, Samson Raphael Hirsch, Israel Lipkin Salanter, Hayyim of Volozhin, Samuel Tiktinsky, Nathan Tzvi Finkel, Abraham Isaac Kook, Moses Mordechai Epstein, Joseph Kahaneman, Yehezkel Sarna, Aharon Kotler, Menahem Mendel Schneerson, Noah Weinberg, and Berel Wein, inter alios . 8. Sages & Tradesmen – Jewry's greatest sages were also toilers earning a living in a wide variety of roles: flax merchant (Shimon ben Shetah, Hiyya bar Abba I Rabbah), woodcutter (Hillel the Elder), mason (Shammai the Elder), flower grinder (Joseph), tanner (Yosi ben Halafta), blacksmith (Joshua and Yitzhak Nappaha), silk merchant (Hiyya bar Abba I Rabbah, Shimon ben Judah HaNasi), shoemakers (Johanan, Hanina, and Oshaiah), coin tester (Eleazar ben Pedat), winetaster (Karna), carpenter (Abbina), tailor (Abba bar Zminah, Daniel, Hanan, Yehudah), shepherd (Adda), baker (Judah), honey dealer (Hanina bar Hama), orchard guard (Resh Lakish), jewelry dealer (Abbahu), digger (Nehunya), cowherd and fruit picker (Huna), porter and clothing merchant (Sheshet), wine merchant (Judah bar Ezekiel), brewer (Hisda, Papa, Huna bar Joshua), and poppy seed dealer (Papa, Huna bar Joshua). 9. The Pre-Renaissance Man – A native of Kafri, near Sura in Babylonia, and a disciple of Judah HaNasi, Hiyya bar Abba I Rabbah descended from Shimei the brother of King David and was the uncle and teacher of Abba Arikha (Rav) and Rabbah bar Hana, whom he tutored in an open marketplace. Hiyya possessed considerable knowledge of medical science and may have originally been a physician. Later in life, when Hiyya and his sons emigrated to the Land of Israel and settled in Tiberias, in partnership with Shimon ben Judah HaNasi he established a business exporting silks to Tyre, and also dealt in flax. Hiyya all the while maintained an academy at Tiberias. He was very wealthy and always provided for the poor who solicited him at his home. It was said of Hiyya that, after his arrival, \"shooting stars, earthquakes, storms, and thunder ceased, wine did not sour, nor was flax ruined.\" His prayers were said to have elicited rain during a drought and to have prompted a prowling lion to leave the Land of Israel. Ever the entrepreneur, he also founded elementary schools and personally instructed children. In addition, Hiyya helped compile the Tosefta and, with his pupil Hoshea (Oshaiah), other baraitas as well, redacting halakhot known variously as \"Baraitot de-Rabbi Hiyya\", \"Mishnat de-Rabbi Hiyya\", and \"Mishnayot Gedolot\" that were omitted from the Mishnah by Judah HaNasi. He earned the epithet \"Rabbah\" (The Great) and was also known to his colleagues as \"the lion of the company.\" It was said that when Hiyya died fiery stones fell from heaven. He was buried in Tiberias. 10. The Proto-Feminist – The daughter of the sage Rabbah bar Avuha, Yalta married Nahman bar Jacob, a disciple of her father. Despite being immersed in the realm of renowned Torah scholars, Yalta was no shrinking violet and was immortalized in the Talmud for being strong-minded and assertive. She once broke 400 wine casks when a guest, the sage Ulla, declined to pass her a cup of wine over which he had recited a blessing. When Ulla attempted to placate her, Yalta replied: “All your words are as meaningless as a peddler’s tale” (BT, Berakhot 51b). On another occasion, when her husband Nahman ordered the sage Judah bar Ezekiel to appear on trial before him in Nehardea, only to have Judah correct his grammar and critique his Torah learning, Yalta unhesitatingly advised Nahman to \"send the man away or else you will earn a reputation as an ignoramus\" (BT, Kiddushin 70b). Her husband also permitted her to be carried about in a palanquin on the Sabbath, despite objections from scholarly colleagues, on the grounds that the people required her guidance. 11. The Hebrew Grammar War – A Moroccan-born disciple of Saadia Gaon, Dunash ben Labrat became a rabbi and religious judge ( dayyan ). After migrating to Spain, he wrote a tract against Menahem ben Jacob ibn Saruk, secretary to respected Jewish statesman Hasdai ibn Shaprut and author of the Hebrew lexicon Mahberet , because Mehahem had criticized Saadia unfairly in Dunash's estimation. His polemic, which disputed 160 items in Menahem's work, was dedicated to Hasdai, whose favor Dunash earned. A literary feud followed between the immediate students of Dunash and Menahem in Spain, and centuries later it was revived in France between Jacob ben Meir (a.k.a. Rabbenu Tam, who sided with Menahem) and Joseph Kimhi (a.k.a. Rikam, who sided with Dunash). In the interim between these debates, Rashi quoted Dunash dozens of times and Abraham ibn Ezra, who Hebraicized the Berber name Dunash into \"Adonim HaLevi\", recovered in Egypt another polemical and philological treatise of Dunash's authorship. Ironically, both Menahem and Dunash erred in their grammatical techniques, which allowed for Hebrew roots of one or two letters (Hebrew stems are triliteral). 12. The Chaplain's Apostasy – Wecelinus, a cleric in the service of Duke Conrad I of Carinthia (a relative of Holy Roman Emperor Henry II), converted to Judaism in 1005 and joined the Jewish community in Mayence (Mainz), Germany. Not content to part ways with Christianity, he polemicized against it, eliciting a rebuttal from the irate emperor's own churchman, and prompting Henry II to briefly expel all the Jews from Mayence in 1012. 13. The Defector's Wrath – Upon denigrating the Talmud, Nicholas Donin was excommunicated in 1225 by Rabbi Yehiel of Paris. After languishing for a decade in the purgatory of excommunication, Donin converted to Christianity and became a Franciscan friar, changing his name to Nicholas de Rupella. Embittered and vengeful, he incited crusaders against French Jewry: 3,000 Jews died and over 500 forsook Judaism. He then visited Rome in 1238 and delivered to Pope Gregory IX a written denunciation of the Talmud with 35 references supposedly hostile to Christianity. During the Disputation of Paris in 1240, he was opposed by 4 leading rabbis including Yehiel of Paris and Moses of Coucy (Semag/Ram MiCoucy), who were unable to prevent the many public burnings of the Talmud and other Judaic works that ensued in Europe. 14. Rabbi on the Moon – A grandson (or great-grandson) of Moses ben Nahman (Ramban/Nahmanides), Levi ben Gershom (1288–1344 CE), a.k.a. Ralbag/Gersonides, is most famous for his philosophical masterwork, Milhamot Adonai , dealing with: the immortality of the soul; dreams, divination, and prophecy; divine omniscience; divine providence; the celestial spheres; and Creation and miracles. Yet he also wrote the astronomical treatise Ben Arba'im LeBinah and commentaries on the works of Euclid, Aristotle, and Ibn Rushd. A lunar impact crater (lunar latitude: 34.7° south/lunar longitude: 23.6° east) was named \"Rabbi Levi\" in his honor. 15. The Shul that Love Built – Moses Isserles, a.k.a. the Rama (1525-1572 CE), married Golda, the daughter of one of his teachers, Shalom Shakhna. She died in 1552 at the tender age of 20, and the widower Moses, not only a great halakhic authority but also a man of means, constructed a synagogue in her honor in Krakow, Poland. The Isserles Synagogue, built in 1553, became known as Rama's Synagogue, and exists to this day. 16. The Convert Messiah – Before he was Solomon Molcho, he was Diogo Pires (1500–1532), a Christian born into a family of conversos (Jewish converts to Christianity who secretly practiced Judaism). In 1525, after meeting the charismatic adventurer David Reubeni in Portugal, he circumcised himself and took a Hebrew name. He was forced to flee Portugal and settled in Salonika, Greece, where he studied kabbalah and likely encountered Joseph Caro, who admired Solomon greatly. He also was supported by leading Talmudist and kabbalist Joseph Taitatzak (a teacher of Joseph Caro and Solomon Alkabetz). Solomon wrote Derashot (a.k.a. Sefer HaMefoar ), a collection of his mystical sermons. In 1529, he returned to Italy where he preached of the coming redemption to sizable crowds of Jews and Christians. When he was soon accused of being a converso who had reverted to Judaism, he fled to Pesaro then Rome. Convinced he was the Messiah, Solomon garbed himself as a beggar and for a month dwelt among the ailing and infirm on a bridge over the Tiber river, near the Papal Palace. Oddly, he gained the favor and protection of Pope Clement VII, and his predictions of natural disasters were confirmed by events, thereby bolstering his credibility. Solomon helped prevent the Inquisition from spreading to Portugal, but in Rome an inquisitional tribunal sentenced him to death, though he was saved on this occasion through the Pope's direct intervention. In 1532, he joined David Reubeni on a mission to Ratisbon (Regensburg), Germany, in the hope of persuading Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to inspire the Jews to resist the Turks. In the event, the emperor incarcerated both men then conveyed them to Italy. An ecclesiastical court in Mantua condemned Solomon to burn at the stake. He refused the late offer of a pardon if he recanted his Judaism and resumed his Christianity, preferring instead martyrdom. 17. Edel the Patroness – A native of Krakow, Poland, Samuel Eliezer ben Judah HaLevi (Maharsha) moved to Posen as a young man and soon married the daughter of Moses Ashkenazi Heilprin. His new mother-in-law Edel, whose name was later applied to Samuel, was very wealthy and financed the academy Samuel headed, including supporting his many pupils, for 20 years (!). 18. The Female Rebbe – Born in Lodmir, Volhynia (now Vladimir-Volynski, Ukraine) to an affluent family, Hannah Rachel Verbermacher (1805/6-1888 CE) underwent a spiritual transformation after a severe illness in her late adolescence and subsequently declined to marry. Instead, she developed a reputation as a healing miracle worker and became the only woman \"Tzaddik\" in the history of Hasidism, despite lacking the associative authority derived from being related to a Hasidic Rebbe. Hannah used her inheritance to establish her own beit midrash (study house), where she delivered discourses on the Sabbath to her Hasidim, and she became known as the Maid of Ludomir (or Maiden of Ludmir). Under pressure from Mordechai Twersky (the Maggid of Chernobyl), Hannah reluctantly married at the age of 40, but the union was unconsummated and divorce soon ensued. Around 1859, she immigrated to the Land of Israel, where she settled in Jerusalem and became renowned as a saintly kabbalist who engaged in rituals to hasten the advent of the Messiah. She died in Jerusalem and was buried on the Mount of Olives. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. Think others should know about this? Please share |",

At AUS$2,159 (US$1,656) , this craft closet is probably not for beginners. \nAlthough for serious clean freaks who take on major creative tasks, particularly within a confined space, this might be perfect. You can store almost anything in it, including tools, paintbrushes, pens, and markers. \nWith a metal rod for ribbons and punches, space for a sewing machine and seven shelves and acrylic guards, you could totally use this closet to jump start your creative craft profession!

USA TODAY NETWORK Leonardo DiCaprio is an executive producer on two new documentaries: National Geographic Channel's 'Before the Flood' and Netflix's 'The Ivory Game.' (Photo: Jerod Harris, Getty Images for National Geographic) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nJennifer Lawrence ( A Beautiful Planet ) and Katie Couric ( Under the Gun ) have turned up the wattage on true-life tales that otherwise may have been overlooked by moviegoers in 2016. But this fall boasts an unusually high number of celebrity-supported documentaries, delving into politics, music, social change and heartwarming adventures. \nUSA TODAY picks a few highlights: \nElephant tusks burn in Netflix's 'The Ivory Game.' (Photo: Richard Ladkani, Netflix) The Ivory Game \nBacked by: Leonardo DiCaprio \nAbout: Along with throwing his weight behind last month's climate change documentary Before the Flood for the National Geographic Channel, environmental activist DiCaprio is also an executive producer on Netflix's Ivory Game . Co-directed by Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani, the film explores the dark underbelly of ivory trafficking, following an undercover team of experts on a suspenseful, sometimes heart-wrenching journey from African countries where elephants are poached to shops in Hong Kong and China where their tusks are sold. Bad news, Earth: Leonardo DiCaprio is going to Mars \nWhere to watch: Now streaming on Netflix; in theaters in New York and Los Angeles. \nGirl power soars in 'The Eagle Huntress,' which follows a 13-year-old Mongolian girl as she trains for a hunting competition. (Photo: Asher Svidensky) The Eagle Huntress \nBacked by: Daisy Ridley \nAbout: Ridley narrated and produced this empowering documentary, which premiered at Sundance Film Festival in January and follows a Mongolian teenager not unlike the actress' fearless Star Wars: The Force Awakens character, Rey. With the support of her father, 13-year-old Aisholpan Nurgaiv trains to be the first woman to take part in Mongolia's Golden Eagle Festival, a frigid hunting expedition through the mountains in which she competes against 70 older male competitors. Daisy Ridley posts honest message about social media and self-esteem \nWhere to watch: Now playing in New York and Los Angeles; expands to additional cities Friday and Nov. 18; opens nationwide Nov. 23. \nA young X Japan sport their signature 'visual kei' style in an archival photo, featured in documentary 'We Are X.' (Photo: Drafthouse Films) We Are X \nBacked by: Gene Simmons \nAbout: The Kiss frontman has been waving the flag for this music documentary in which he appears, charting the ups and downs of heavy-metal band X Japan, known for its \"visual kei\" style of heavy makeup and flamboyant costumes. The enigmatic group, which has sold more than 30 million singles and albums combined, has attracted A-list fans such as Beatles producerGeorge Martin, Stan Lee and Simmons, but is still mostly unknown to North American music fans. Produced by the same team as the Oscar-winning Searching for Sugar Man (which follows another elusive artist, Rodriguez), We Are tracks the band's tumultuous three-decade history, culminating in a 2014 concert at New York's Madison Square Garden. \nWhere to watch: Now playing in seven cities including New York, San Francisco and Atlanta; expands to 10 additional cities Friday and more throughout November and December. \nA police officer on the scene of the 1966 University of Texas at Austin massacre in the partially animated documentary 'Tower.' (Photo: Kino Lorber) Tower \nBacked by: Meredith Vieira and Luke Wilson \nAbout: The longtime news anchor and Old School actor produce a gripping documentary about America's first mass school shooting. Told through a mix of rotoscope animation and archival footage, the film weaves together the untold stories of witnesses, heroes and survivors in the University of Texas at Austin massacre on Aug. 1, 1966, when engineering student Charles Whitman killed 16 people and wounded three dozen others before he was fatally shot by police. \nWhere to watch: Now playing in six cities, including Chicago, San Francisco and Portland, Ore.; expands to Atlanta, Philadelphia and Charlottesville, Va., Friday and more throughout November, December and January.

It's the kind of country we want for our children and grandchildren,\" Clinton, the Democratic nominee, said, sitting behind a table and speaking to the camera. \n\"Is America dark and divisive, or hopeful and inclusive? Our core values are being tested in this election, but everywhere I go, people are refusing to be defined by fear and division.\" \nThe ad will air Monday night before an estimated 20 million people during the shows with largest audiences available — \"The Voice\" on NBC and \"Kevin Can Wait\" on CBS.

No one knows that better than Gabriel Scanu, who has access to its best views. \nThe 20-year-old photographer from Sydney brings his drone wherever he goes, capturing jagged coastlines and turquoise waters interspersed with man-made structures. \n“The thing I love most about drone photography is the fact that you can capture scenes from a perspective that they are never usually viewed from,” Gabriel told Wired . \nHe started taking aerial photos after his dad, a cinematographer, took him on a trip to Mount Selwyn in New South Wales. Gabriel was so impressed by drone photography that as soon as they got back, he got one for himself. \nHe has since visited places like Melbourne, and other parts of Southern Australia. He’s also flown his drone while vacationing in California and Europe. \n“In terms of what makes Australia such a magical place, I would have the say the amazing diversity in the landscape,” he told From Where I Drone . “You’ve got the desert, beaches, snow and amazing cities. It has everything, so I count myself lucky to live in such a beautiful place.” \nSee more from Gabriel Scanu over on Instagram .

      "text": "We pretty much shocked our friends and family yesterday with this Facebook picture…\nPhoto: Jason Pearl\nWe’ve been engaged since March and are no closer to planning an actual wedding than we were the night he popped the question. Finances, time, decisions about where to have it and who to invite… It’s just overwhelming and I haven’t been able to focus on it.\nWe wanted to get legally married sooner rather than later but there is a pretty long wait to make an appointment at the court house… and I really didn’t want to do it that way.\nA few weeks ago our good friend told us she was going to be visiting DC so we asked her if she wanted to get ordained and marry us while she was here. She said she would be happy to, so then we just had to figure out where to get it done.\nI wanted to be able to take some nice pictures, especially since at this point I really don’t know if a “real” wedding is ever going to happen… We talked about going to a winery or maybe to Sugarloaf mountain, but I ended up picking the National Mall. It was kind of a joke at first, but the more I thought about it the more I thought it would be fun.\nI really didn’t even plan on wearing an actual wedding dress, I just wanted to coordinate our outfits and wear something special. I ended up finding the dress on clearance at Macy’s for $67! It’s a size 4 and I almost didn’t bother trying it on because I thought it would never fit, but it did!\nEverything came together perfectly… Well, except for the fact that my wedding band that needed to be fitted didn’t get back to the jeweler in time, but I didn’t stress over it. It ended up being an unseasonably warm sunny day, we got great pictures, we made it special, and now I’m officially a married woman!\nPerfect day! \nA photo posted by Dana McKay (@danasdirt) on Nov 6, 2016 at 12:00pm PST \nFollow Dana and 94.7 Fresh FM on Twitter. \nFollow Dana and 94.7 Fresh FM on Instagram. \nFollow Dana and 94.7 Fresh FM on Facebook. \nFollow Dana on Snapchat.

(Photo: Courtesy photo)   \nUnited Way sponsors children’s book drive \nUnited Way of the Dutchess-Orange Region is collecting donations of new and gently used children’s books appropriate for those up to age 8. The book drive runs through Nov. 15 with the goal of having 1,000 new children’s books as well as many more gently used children’s books to stock the shelves at United Way for distribution in the community. \nIndividuals, businesses and organizations who have responded to the drive include: employees at The Culinary Institute of America, who donated seven cartons of books; Allstate Insurance agents who opened up their offices to serve as book drops; a Marist College professor who is encouraging students to bring books to class; and the Children’s Writers Group of the Hudson Valley, whose members donated many of their own books as well as gently used ones. \nBook drive collection points are open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday through Friday until Nov. 15. Sites include United Way offices in Poughkeepsie at 75 Market St. and in Montgomery at 30 Scott’s Corners Drive, as well as these Allstate Insurance offices: Tom McHugh, 702 Freedom Plains Road, Poughkeepsie;Annalisa Romano, 1012-C Main St., Fishkill; Glen Valente, 320 Main St., Cornwall; and Lori Buhagiar, 125 Dolson Ave., Middletown. \nFor more information, visit www.uwdor.org/books or call United Way, 845-471-1900 Ext. 3120 or Ext. 3114. \nLast year, United Way distributed more than 10,000 books to their community partners.

      "text": "Facebook \nAt this point, we have to accept that some transformations are needed in some cases and circumstances. So many people have started to feel cheated on with the rate at which their partners or friends are changed with makeup. \nThey feel it is highly deceptive for women to wear so much makeup and mask their identities with many layers of concealers and foundation. \nWhile it is important for ladies to tone down their makeup if they are not going for events, we also have to allow those with one facial deformity or the other to explore all the options that makeup has to offer. \nREAD ALSO: Reasons why you should never stop eating pawpaw \nA makeup artist of Sojuloge makeover has proved that there is beauty in scars. The work done on a client’s scarred face will make you stare hard at the pictures here. \nFire victims with burns on their faces have the right to be pretty and enjoy the glitz and glamour that other ladies enjoy at events. As a matter of fact, they need the makeup more in order to mask their scars and feel pretty inside out without being stared at. \nAccidents that erode the distinct facial features of a person often leave the victim traumatised and feeling out of place. Getting a talented makeup artist to work on such faces is hard, the artist that did worked on this lady’s face is skilled.",

      "text": "Lorde opened up about life and her upcoming second album in this super beautiful Facebook post It’s been a while since we heard new music from Lorde, but Entertainment Weekly let us know that she posted a beautiful note about her second album on Facebook — so we know it’s coming soon! We’ve been excited since we heard that she’s working on a new album , because this girl is mega talented to boot. Remember when you couldn’t stop listening to her new song with Disclosure? Well, prepare for things to get even better.\nThe FB message was titled, “A NOTE FROM THE DESK OF A NEWBORN ADULT,” because she wrote it last night, on the eve of her 20th birthday. As in today is her birthday, so HAPPY BIRTHDAY LORDE! And with her signature unapologetic style, everything she says speaks volumes about the transition she’s gone through in the music industry.\n“Sometime in the last year or so, part of me crossed over. For one thing, I made a very deliberate choice to withdraw for a little while from a public life. I haven’t had my hair or makeup done in a year, the free handbags dried up LONG ago, and the paparazzi at the airport are almost always for someone else.” Enchanté ! \nA photo posted by Lorde (@lordemusic) on Oct 5, 2016 at 9:41am PDT \nShe goes on to hint that the new album will be influenced by how she’s changed as a person.\n“I turned inwards to my friends, my family, towards this moment, so I could learn more about who I was, and so I could let this new project show itself to me. And oh my god, it was a colossal year! One for the ages. I maxed out every single emotion I have in the best possible way, the colours still aching behind my eyes like this weird blissful hangover.” diner brat! : @lenadunham \nA photo posted by Lorde (@lordemusic) on Jul 31, 2016 at 9:57am PDT \nThis is bittersweet and downright relatable AF.\n“My heart broke. I moved out of home and into the city and I made new friends and started to realize that no-one is just good or bad, that everyone is both. I started to discover in a profound, scary, blood-aching way who I was when I was alone, what I did when I did things only for myself.” in four days i am twenty \nA photo posted by Lorde (@lordemusic) on Nov 3, 2016 at 8:53am PDT \nWe absolutely love how honest Lorde is, and can’t wait for her new music because we know it’s going to pack an emotional punch. You can read her whole FB post here:\n& A NOTE FROM THE DESK OF A NEWBORN ADULTTomorrow I turn 20, and it s all I ve been able to think about for days. I walk...\nPosted by Lorde on  Sunday, November 6, 2016 Note how she signs off like a #boss.\n“What i’m trying to say is: this is a special birthday. The party is about to start. I am about to show you the new world.” Currently waiting patiently for Lorde to show us this “new world” of which she speaks!\nThe post Lorde opened up about life and her upcoming second album in this super beautiful Facebook post appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nMy heart is so full right now. \nA woman running the 2016 TCS New York City Marathon on Sunday was proposed to at the end of the race, and I literally can’t handle the cuteness. \nAccording to PopSugar, Charlotte Haigh’s boyfriend got down on one knee at the finish line and asked her the big question . \nNo, the question wasn’t “Hey, great job! Do you want some water?” \nIt was “Hey, will you marry me?” \nYUP. I’m going to go crawl into a hole until I find someone who will do the same thing for me. She said yes!! We had a proposal at the #tcsnycmarathon finish line pic.twitter.com/U9pE1Nc2ZK \n— TCS NYC Marathon (@nycmarathon) November 6, 2016 \nCould you imagine? The last thing I’d be thinking about after running a marathon is getting married, but I guess that was the point of the surprise. \nKudos, dude! \nReally though, if you know me at all, you know I’m not a fan of running. But I AM a hopeless romantic and New York City resident. Therefore, the footage of this proposal is making me want to live vicariously through Charlotte. \nSo much sweat and tears. They’re good tears, though. Congrats, you two! Instagram \nTo make things even CUTER – it’s possible, I swear – Haigh tweeted about the dreamlike proposal and her plans for the night. \nNeedless to say, I’m a little jealous… mostly because pizza was involved. \nApparently, she wrote, \nToday, I ran 26.2 miles. And got engaged to the love of my life. Now, I get to go eat pizza and drink beer with my family and best NYC friends. \nNow, I’m crying. \nCharlotte, definitely hold on to this one. Any dude who will love you this much after you run almost 27 miles is definitely a keeper. \nAlso, if he has any single friends, feel free to send them my way. \nPS: I hope you guys enjoyed some authentic NYC pizza. After a day like that, you definitely deserved it. \n ",

(Photo: KentuckyOne Health) \nA trip to the emergency room can be stressful and overwhelming. Not only are you or your loved ones facing a critical health issue, but you may also face a long wait. In an effort to improve the experience of ER patients and their treatment, KentuckyOne Health completely redesigned the way its Emergency Departments intake and provide care. Although KentuckyOne Health’s goal has always been providing the best care possible, they are now dedicated to doing it in the fastest way possible in each of their 15 ER departments statewide. \nHow it works \nDuring peak ER times, patients are assessed by a pivot nurse as they arrive. Pivot nurses are seasoned healthcare veterans with years of experience handling the range of possible cases that come through the ER. Patients are given a number from 1-5, corresponding to the severity of their condition, based on a standardized severity index. Depending on the number, patients are then introduced to their “mini team,” a specialized group of physicians specially trained in treating the conditions that fall under their severity level. \nThe results \nPatients with less severe conditions typically receive treatment in the “FastER,” and tend to not only have very short wait times, but shorter treatment times as well when compared to the average ER. Those with more severe injuries or conditions receive care through a traditional emergency care path. \nThese new process improvements not only allow our patients the most appropriate treatment based on their conditions, but door-to-provider wait times have been reduced—in some cases by over 50 percent. \nSince the introduction of our FastER, we’ve also seen a significant reduction in the Left Without Being Seen (LWBS) rates—patients that enter the ER, but leave without being treated. \nWith our new approach to ER care, our patients’ treatment begins the minute they walk through the door. It’s compassionate care, geared towards getting you better, and on your way. \nVisit ChooseYourDoor.org to find an ER location near you. 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

He likes to hang out at a food park/bar and sometimes walks up to the locals for some pets and love. \nMeet Creampuff or Alfred. Photo: suey22 \nPeople adore this little guy, who brings everyone a smile with his presence, but soon they found out something was not right with his tail. \nAfter a Redditor shared a photo of the kitty, many who had met him, recognized him right away. They began to talk about how sweet of a cat he is, but also showed some concerns about his health. \n\"After some discussion, it came out that he had an injury on his tail, and several concerned Redditors suggested getting this little guy to a vet for a checkup and neuter surgery,\" reddit user iamkmi said. \niamkmi volunteered to chauffeur the kitty to the vet and asked if anyone would pitch in to help for the bill. Within hours, they collected $255. So the journey began! \nIt was Thursday afternoon Creampuff was lounging under a tree, napping away. Photo: iamkmi \n\"He was a little startled at first, but came over pretty quickly after I called to him.\" ",

      "title": "Q&A with Ken Bone",
      "text": "Like us on Facebook! “Y \nou either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain , Harvey Dent once said in The Dark Night . But on the night of October 9th, when the microphone was passed on to an audience member named Ken Bone at the presidential town hall debate, he didn’t sign up to be made into an icon, a hero or a villain. All he sought to do was to ask the candidates what they would do to tackle the looming energy crisis without ruining the environment. It was America, in desperate search of someone, perhaps anyone, who could save the entire country from moral implosion or existential crisis with a moment of levity, that decided to make him an icon. What is more, it was also America that set the stage for his fall from grace a few days later. Yet, Ken Bone did not despair, or worse, go on a rant and delete his accounts. Instead, Ken Bone tells us like it is: he is “just a regular guy, with flaws and all.” Interview \nQ: Let’s start with the night of the debate. You’ve mentioned in previous interviews that you realized your sudden viral fame as soon as you left the venue and turned your phone back on. Could you sum up the feelings and thoughts that were going through your head at that exact moment? A: Humbled, Excited, Surprised, Confused, Exhausted. \nQ: This year’s election memescape (and Halloween!) certainly wouldn’t have been the same without Ken Bone. You must’ve seen a few parodies or Halloween costumes that were inspired by your appearance during the debate. Do you have any favorites that actually made you laugh out loud? Like, until your stomach hurt? A: The prayer candle proclaiming me “The Patron Saint of Indecision” still gets me. \nQ: As you would probably agree, much of the online buzz seemed to focus on your attire, from the red sweater to your mustache. But what about that disposable camera? What were you taking pictures of on the stage after the debate ended? And how did they come out? A: When I get the photos back on Tuesday I’ll share them. \nQ: Not long after the night of the debate, you hosted an AMA event on Reddit. Clearly, the fact that you had been an active member of the community for over a year made you even bigger of a hero to some. What are some of your favorite subreddits that you like to frequent? A: r/upliftingnews helps me recharge when the negativity creeps in. \nQ: What makes your story of viral fame really stand out from the precedents is the baffling speed at which you went from being hailed “as the American hero we needed” to being labeled “a kind of an awful guy” in the news media. As a family man, it must have been unpleasant to see your reputation and image get toyed around like that in public. Do you have any takeaway or lesson from this fiasco that you’d like to share with us? A: Any negative media tends to be ignored by those who really know me. They know I’m just a regular guy, flaws and all. Besides, all the negative stuff only affects me, the good I’ve been a part of helps the whole community. \nQ: On a related note, social media sleuthing and crowdsourced investigating have increasingly become major variables and powerful forces in online storytelling, which doesn’t always add up to a happy ending for everyone. And as a result of that, the grey area between citizen journalism and invasion of privacy has only gotten greyer. You mentioned in your AMA that you had received a few death threats. What were the motives behind and the nature of these threats? A: I think the people threatening violence against me are just attention seekers, and it doesn’t really get to me. People threatening violence against my family will be prosecuted if caught. \nQ: The average life cycle and lifespan of overnight internet stardom has been getting shorter and shorter. Once the election is over, do you have any plans or projects to turn your nano-fame into something more semipermanent? Or are you comfortable with staying in the # BONEZONE until it lasts? A: I don’t plan to try to drag out my time in the spotlight. I may start a YouTube channel, but I don’t really know what to talk about. Other than that I will only be responding to incoming media requests like always. I don’t do anything to try to get back on the air. \nQ: Could you tell us about your charitable t-shirt campaign to raise money for the homeless? How’s it going? A: I don’t want to mislead anyone into thinking it was pure charity. I made a profit from the shirts too. I gave 10% of my profits to St. Patrick’s Center, totaling over $7,000, in addition to a contribution from the shirt company. By the time all of my charitable efforts for all the charities I’m trying to help are totaled, we’ll be at over $30,000 between myself, my sponsors, and regular folks donating on my behalf. \nQ: We’re well aware that you have repeatedly declined to talk about your choice of candidate in this year’s election, but we gotta give it a try! Have you made up your mind yet? A: I made up my mind not long after the third debate, but I remain committed to raising voting awareness in a non-partisan way. I won’t be telling anyone who I voted for. \nQ: As per our long-running tradition, here’s our final question. What is your favorite meme of all time? A: I got the most enjoyment from “Shoop Da Whoop” . I still find myself chuckling about “firin’ ma lazor” every now and then. \nKen Bone is an American plant technician who has been working at Prairie State Generating Company since 2010 and currently lives with his wife of 12 years, Heather, and their cat in the suburb outside of St. Louis, Missouri. Shortly after rising to viral fame in early October 2016, Bone launched a t-shirt merchandise line bearing a design of his face in a charitable for-profit campaign to raise money for the homeless in St. Louis.

Getty Images @stevenmusil \nWhile helping you keep in touch with friends from your past, Facebook might also help you find a job in the future. \nThe online social network confirmed Monday it is testing a feature that will allow administrators of business pages to promote job openings on their pages and receive applications from job candidates. TechCrunch , which first spotted the new feature, noted that the feature could help Facebook \"muscle in\" on LinkedIn , which derives much of its revenue from companies paying to search for new recruits. \n\"Based on behavior we've seen on Facebook, where many small businesses post about their job openings on their Page, we're running a test for Page admins to create job postings and receive applications from candidates,\" a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. \nFacebook is no stranger to new endeavors in sectors already dominated by one company. In October 2015, the social network challenged Craigslist with the launch of Marketplace, a new section of its mobile app that lets people list their furniture, cars and clothes for sale to any Facebook users in their area. Last week, Facebook launched Gameroom , a PC gaming platform that takes aim at Steam.",

      "text": "Reply Hello everyone. I had a date recently that went bad. She got my Facebook password and posted this under my name. I don't think I'm gonna make it...so if you guys don't hear from me again, I've decided to end things. If I've met or spoken to you, I hope you will count me as a friend. Thank you for reaching out to me. I hope to meet a new best friend because mine all are moved away or dead. Hi my name is Delora and I'm temporarily using Jeff's account to let you know what a freak he is. The dude first of all says he wants a baby and then doesn't know how to make one. Then he starts going off on how everyone makes fun of his underwear at the group home. NEWSFLASH: He wears Joe Boxer underwear! He also doesn't know how to masturbate....idiot...moron. I sent him home walking. He was even nice enough to give me his password for this account. LISTEN PEOPLE: Jeff Blumenthal is fucktard that belongs in the group home. AVOID HIM EVERYONE!

Its growing prevalence has become a topic of concern and health professionals are redoubling their efforts to educate the public to its harmful health complications, including heart attack, stroke — and eye conditions that can cause blindness. \n“Diabetes is an endocrine disorder that causes blood sugar levels to rise higher than normal. The most common form is type 2 diabetes, where the body either resists the effects of insulin — a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells — or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain a normal glucose level,” says Dr. Phillip J. Calenda , an ophthalmologist with NewYork-Presbyterian Medical Group Hudson Valley and NewYork-Presbyterian/Hudson Valley Hospital in Cortlandt Manor. “High blood sugar can lead to problems such as cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. In fact, diabetes is the primary cause of blindness in adults ages 20 to 74. Cataracts \nA cataract is a clouding of the eye's natural lens, which lies behind the iris and the pupil. “In most instances, cataracts are associated with age-related changes in the eye, though other factors, such as medication, surgery, sun exposure, and disease can also play a role in its development,” says Dr. Calenda. Diabetes can lead to cataracts in younger people as well, and the condition worsens at a faster rate than for non-diabetics. If left untreated, cataracts can cause blindness. In fact, the condition is the leading cause of blindness in the world, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. A minimally invasive surgical procedure eliminates cataracts from the eyes, but whether surgery is needed depends on the degree of vision loss and whether it affects quality of life and ability to function. “In many instances, a good pair of eyeglasses will help a person see better, and surgery can be delayed for months or even years,” he says. Diabetic retinopathy \nDiabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic eye disease, affecting nearly 7.7 million Americans age 40 and older. It is caused by swelling and damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Says Dr. Calenda, “Retinal tissue is like the film in a camera, if it is damaged the patient cannot correctly process images, resulting in decreased vision and perhaps blindness.” At first, diabetic retinopathy may cause no symptoms or only mild problems, but as it progresses, symptoms can include blurred vision, fluctuating vision, spots or dark strings floating in your vision (floaters), or vision loss. Glaucoma \nGlaucoma occurs when there is a gradual increase in the normal fluid pressure inside the eyes. The increased pressure can damage the optic nerve, causing vision loss. “Glaucoma is an insidious disease,” says Dr. Calenda, “because there are no symptoms until there is a loss of peripheral (side) vision. If glaucoma is left untreated, the result can be complete vision loss. The longer someone has had diabetes, the chances of developing glaucoma increase.” A type of glaucoma closely associated with diabetes is known as neovascular glaucoma, a condition where abnormal blood vessels grow on the iris (the colored part of the eye), blocking the normal flow of fluid out of the eye, raising the eye pressure. \n“The longer you have diabetes and the less controlled your blood sugar is, the more likely you are to develop eye complications,” says Dr. Calenda, who adds “that is why early detection through regular eye checkups are so important, as is maintaining good control of your blood sugar.” Imaging studies such as dilated eye examinations help detect the presence of cataracts, glaucoma, and retinopathy. If the condition is mild or moderate, good blood sugar control can usually keep the condition in check. In more advanced cases, surgery can help slow or stop the progression, although future retinal damage and vision loss are still possible. Even after treatment, regular eye exams and further treatments (such as injections) may be necessary. \nVisit nyp.org/hudsonvalley or call 800-482-4842 to find a physician. \nThis story is provided and presented by our sponsor: NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. \nMembers of the editorial and news staff of The Journal News/lohud were not involved in the creation of this content.​ 1 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "Man deletes wedding pic from Facebook after friends comment more on the stylish car parked in the background in the pic   Delhi based couple’s idea to share their wedding pics on Facebook went for a toss after friends and family were seen commenting more about the stylish car parked in the background in the pictures. The new Nissan Terrano 6 Speed Advanced Auto Drive \nAnkit and Neha, who tied the knot a few days back, decided to share their happy memories by posting wedding pictures online for their friends to see. \nApparently, the couple uploaded 20 wedding pictures, of which 8 received highest number of comments. But to their dismay, the comments were directed at the car that was seen in the background in the pictures. \nWith their wedding pics receiving not attention on Facebook, the couple were at loss of words over how something like this could happen. \nSpeaking to Faking News, weary from week long wedding celebrations, a clueless Ankit said, “I don’t know what was so special about that car. Agreed that it had eye catching exteriors, but how could they overlook us. We put in so much effort to look our best and this is what we get.” \nThough Ankit put up a brave front, Neha was distraught. Her expensive wedding lehenga and jewelry went completely unnoticed on Facebook. \n“I got the trousseau designed by Frocky S, the famous dress designer. I thought they’ll all comment on how beautiful I looked. Was expecting at least 500 Likes. Even the usual pics get me comments like ‘ Hotness ki dukaan ‘ and ‘Looking like Aishwarya’. But nothing about my wedding pics,” she sobbed, sitting amidst a pile of tissue papers, with Ankit next to her to console. \n‘Majestic! Which car is it?’ read one comment on the FB page while others seemed like they’d already made up their mind to buy it. \nThough Ankit deleted the pictures to draw attention back to his wedding album, it didn’t help him much. \nThe discussion about the ‘mysterious stylish’ car moved on to family WhatsApp group, with many wanting to know more about it. \nOur reporter tracked down the owner of the car, who turned out to be an old college friend of Ankit. \n“It’s the new Nissan Terrano 6 Speed Advanced Auto Drive. I had no intention to take the spotlight away from the wedding but not really surprised at what happened. Have been getting a lot of compliments since I bought it. If the stylish exterior is getting so much attention, when people find out about its effortless driving and spacious interiors it might end up being Breaking News,” he quipped. \nMeanwhile, the newly wed Arora couple are planning to take off for a vacation to Mauritius, hoping that another set of pics from the honeymoon destination will help them get the desired attention that they were looking for.",

      "text": "For the first generation to grow up on Facebook, online identities hold both promise and pitfall November 8, 2016 by Sian Lincoln And Brady Robards, The Conversation Credit: Jacob Lund/Shutterstock \nDespite suggestions that young people are losing interest in the platform, its 1.5 billion users still puts Facebook at the centre of social media. The site was launched in 2004, and so those meeting Facebook's minimum age requirement of 13 will, in 2017, be the first generation for whom Facebook has always existed. \nWe are now able to reflect on the long-term use of Facebook, which has enjoyed unrivalled longevity and growth. Those who joined in their early teens are now in their twenties and have \"grown up\" on Facebook, documenting their life through text, images, videos, and geo-location data such as \"check-ins\". We spent two years interviewing these twenty-somethings to explore how they had documented their experiences of growing up on Facebook. \nTheir Facebook profiles have become effectively an archive of their lives. As our participants scrolled back through their Facebook timelines with us, they recounted the experiences they had posted to the site: exam results, new romantic relationships, breakups , losing a job, travel, and so on. Sometimes seemingly banal disclosures would remind them of more complex stories that were not immediately obvious. A photo of one participant sleeping on her father's couch, for example, reminded her of a painful breakup with a partner. For another, the gaps in his timeline elicited stories about his gender transition that led him to switch to a new profile. \nAs our participants delved into their past many reflected on points in their lives where they were making critical decisions about their futures such as graduation, launching their careers and starting their own families. Some were in their final year of university study and were looking for a job. Today, Facebook profiles have become almost as important as a CV. And, much like the preparation and polishing of a CV, young people are cleaning up their Facebook profiles – prioritising stories about travelling or voluntary work and making the embarrassing details about nights out with friends private or erasing them altogether in an attempt to present a more professional, measured, mature identity. \nPutting the best face forward \nFor many, Facebook has shifted from being the site on which to document carefree student days to a space where a more professional identity can play out. Recruiters have for some time examined social media profiles, something that raises important privacy questions. Facebook even now offers its own, work-focused Facebook app, Workplace , showing the company's desire to expand into more areas of our lives. \nTwo participants in our study were final year medical students. Coached in a job-seeking seminar, they were told that the recruitment team would carry out web searches on the candidates, including Facebook pages. This was an incentive for them to tidy up their profiles, and reflect on how many years of Facebook posts might be interpreted by potential employers and patients. Job-seekers now perfecting Facebook timelines, not just CVs.

This concept is particularly applicable to social media such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter because it captures the way these services are embedded into young peoples' lives, and their professional development. \nBy polishing their Facebook profiles they can revise their past – removing pictures or posts that no longer play a role in who they are, or who they wish to portray themselves to be. Entire events that once seemed significant can be removed, having since been diminished into the realm of teenage naivety as priorities, networks, and identities change. \nCompeting versions of identity \nThese erasures raise important questions. When in decades to come those who have grown up using Facebook are running for public office or moving into positions of power, how might we think differently about what constitutes a professional identity, and its relationship with our younger selves? Will future prime ministers be embarrassed by a love-struck selfie documenting a one month anniversary of their first relationship? Will future CEOs be deemed inappropriate for their jobs because of a flippant post made decades earlier? Should they? \nSports stars and politicians are often shamed and sometimes ruined for things they say on social media. Gymnast Louis Smith and footballer Joey Barton have found themselves in trouble for their questionable social media posts. Cheerleader Caitlin Davies's career was ruined after a photo of her drawing offensive graffiti on an unconscious man was shared on Facebook. \nThe issue is that the hundreds or thousands of posts that make up twenty-somethings' social media profiles are disclosures written and shared in the past, often forgotten and buried – until uncovered by someone scrolling back through them. In another case, the UK's first youth crime commissioner Paris Brown resigned following the uncovering of apparently racist and homophobic comments posted on Twitter as a younger teenager. \nMight this kind of scrutiny intensify as entire lives recorded on social media are dredged up and put under the microscope? Or perhaps our attitudes will change, and they will be appreciated for what they are – moments in time, often from long ago. \nFor either the carefully edited approach to Facebook or the forgotten posts that come back to haunt their creators, it will be interesting to see the impact on future generations. What, for example, will a child think on scrolling through the Facebook timelines of parents who grew up using social media ? Might the edited, polished version of their lives that they have put forward on Facebook stand in place of memory, and so eventually become the recorded story of their lives, however carefully curated and managed?",

Using a technique called style transfer, the feature takes live video and turns it into something that resembles the work of Van Gogh, Picasso and other artists.\n\nThat effect is probably familiar to people who have used the app Prisma, which uses similar techniques to change the look of photos. Prisma’s app can’t perform live filtering, and some filters require a connection to the internet. Facebook’s system can work offline and render live.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

My father was moving to hospice and wasn’t expected to live much longer. After booking the next available flight out of Reno, I dashed home to pack and then headed to a little store on Center Street called the Isles. It had all kinds of Irish, Scottish and English products. I was distraught and didn’t really know what I was looking for, but felt I needed to take something with me. \nThere I found a magnificent lamb’s wool shawl that seemed perfect to keep him warm. It was brilliant in color — golden but with blues and greens woven in. I guess I thought it didn’t look Irish because it wasn’t just green. But it was the perfect weight and beautiful. \nThe lamb’s wool shawl Erin Breen gifted to her father. (Photo: Erin Breen) \nWhen I got to Portland, my father was in good spirits. But he knew he was at the end of life. He said he knew his heart had given out and was no longer going to fight fate. The family assembled with him, and we took turns sitting with him and talking. And the entire time he insisted that shawl stay close. He said it was comforting and looked like Ireland in fall. \nOver the next week and a half I had a handful of heartfelt conversations with my father, asking him questions I couldn’t let go unanswered, telling him things I couldn’t let go unsaid and sharing every minute we could. \nI know this may sound odd, but he wanted me to write and read him his obituary saying he wanted to hear what would be said about him after he was gone. And while some may find that gruesome, I did it. Far too many people never get a chance to hear quite how much we loved them because we often save that for funerals. He had input.",

      "text": "Prisma brings its art filters to Facebook Live Prisma brings its art filters to Facebook Live Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Apps - Apps + Prisma , the application that made headlines almost every month since its release on the Android and iOS platforms, has just been improved with the new service that will be provided for free to all users.Beginning this week, Prisma users will be able to apply any of the eight alt filters included in the application to their Facebook broadcasts . The developers confirmed that Prisma filters are now available for Facebook Live broadcasts on the iPhone 6S and 7.The new feature requires quite a lot of processing power, which is done locally on the phone, which is why the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 are the only iOS devices supported for the time being.According to Prisma's Aram Airapetyan, the company is already working to bring Prisma filters to Facebook Live on Android devices as well. However, it will only be available on the most powerful smartphones due to processing constraints.In order to take advantage of the new feature, iOS users must be logged into their Facebook account via the app. Whenever you switch from Photos to Videos in Prisma , you will now have a “Live Stream” button at your disposal, which allows you to broadcast whatever you capture on the camera and apply the app's filters.Aside from the addition of the new feature, Prisma developers announced that the latest update brings some improvements to the video quality, too.Unfortunately, Android fans will have to wait a while longer until the new feature arrives on their devices, but, as mentioned earlier, rest assured that Prisma's engineers are working hard to make it available as soon as possible. source: Prisma via TechCrunch",

      "text": "Donald Trump may lose the presidential election, but he was the winner when it came to using social media. According to a report last week from EzyInsights , “Trump’s campaign has utterly trounced Hillary Clinton’s” at utilizing Facebook, and specifically live video on Facebook. Trump used Facebook and Twitter more than Clinton did. But he used the two platforms in different ways—and so did the electorate.\nView photos \nTrump vs. Clinton: native video engagement on Facebook More Trump vs. Clinton on Facebook and Twitter At some points in October, Trump saw roughly three times as much Facebook engagement as Clinton, according to the EzyInsights report. He also killed Clinton on both types of Facebook video: native (a pre-shot video that will play directly on Facebook) and live. He has 12 million Facebook fans to her 8 million. And he utilized Facebook more often than Clinton, though one could argue how effective it really was if it didn’t help him win.\nView photos \nTrump vs. Clinton: live video engagement on Facebook More And yet even with his campaign’s strategic use of Facebook video, it was Twitter where Trump truly waged his campaign. Twitter was where Trump announced his running mate, Mike Pence, and where he ranted at 3 in the morning about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado.\nTrump joined Twitter four years before Clinton, he has tweeted more than three times as much she has, and he has 13 million followers to her 10 million. Trump writes about half of his tweets himself (as an August study by a Stack Overflow data scientist found) whereas Clinton personally wrote just 59 of her tweets in 2016 . Trump used Facebook for videos from rallies, but Twitter for practically everything else—statements, retorts, and rejoinders on negative stories; unprompted comments on pop culture issues; and many, many retweets.\nFacebook and Twitter also served different roles for the voters. And both companies experienced positive and negative attention as a result of how they were used during the election.\nFacebook spurred voter registration On Sept. 23, Facebook made a good case for its influence when it devoted its top banner to voter registration, encouraging users to register online. A subsequent report from the Center for Election Information & Research credited Facebook with a major positive impact. Multiple secretaries of state echoed the kudos , such as California’s Alex Padilla, who told The New York Times that Facebook “clearly moved the needle in a significant way.”\nBut the site also came under fire during the campaign cycle for hosting fake news stories , a problem that got worse in August after it fired the whole team of people responsible for curating the stories that appear in Trending Topics.\nThe election forced Facebook to very publicly grapple with questions of who ought to control the news that appears on its platform, and how to keep that news politically neutral and fair .\nThe vital importance of those questions is proven by a new Pew Research Center study that reports 20% of social media users “say they’ve modified their stance on a social or political issue because of material they saw on social media.” 17% said social media changed their view of a specific candidate. Couple that with an earlier Pew report that says nearly 65% of US adults get their news from social media, and you see that news sharing and gathering on Facebook was key to the election, even if Facebook executives still refuse to classify Facebook as a media company .\nTwitter saw lots of tweets, but also abuse This election was a similarly mixed bag for Twitter, but for different reasons.\nThe highlight for Twitter was its engagement during the three presidential debates, the second of which was the most tweeted debate ever and the most tweeted day of the election cycle. Twitter saw 30 million tweets on Oct. 9, and 17 million of them were debate-related. Donald Trump got 65% of that conversation.\nFinal share of Twitter #debate conversation around the presidential candidates on stage:\n64% – @realDonaldTrump \n36% – @HillaryClinton pic.twitter.com/jD338cX5Rr \n— Twitter Government (@gov) October 10, 2016 \n\n\nTwitter also saw success live streaming the debates: 3.1 million people streamed the second debate on Twitter . (Facebook also offered a stream, and many news outlets used Facebook to offer their own live streams.)\nDespite high use of Twitter around the election, there was also high abuse. In mid-October, the Anti-Defamation League released the findings of a Task Force on Harassment and Journalism . The ADL found “a significant uptick in anti-Semitic tweets from January 2016 to July 2016,” and found that the hateful tweets were “disproportionately likely” to come from Trump supporters. In total, the ADL found 2.6 million tweets containing anti-Semitic hate speech, earning an estimated 10 billion impressions.\nTwitter trolls and vitriol on the platform (certainly not just anti-Semitic) had long been a problem for Twitter, but it came to the fore with the acrimonious election, and reportedly was even part of the reason potential bids to buy Twitter fell through. After a rumored acquisition offer from Salesforce.com never came, Jim Cramer of CNBC claimed that bidders were “seeing the hatred… I know that Salesforce was very concerned about this notion .”\nIt isn’t certain whether the sale of Twitter fell through because of abusive tweets or because of deeper problems with its business model and its ability to grow revenue, but one could argue that the election was a net negative for the company. Its success as a public company is still not guaranteed.\nFacebook, on the other hand, isn’t about to face the firing squad over its problems with hosting news (despite how much that conflict may interest the media) and comes out of the election having only further reinforced its popularity and importance to the voting public.\n—\nDaniel Roberts is a writer at Yahoo Finance, covering sports business and technology.

      "text": "Home > Internet > Facebook adds jobs feature to take on LinkedIn Facebook adds jobs feature to take on LinkedIn | 0 Comments \nThe world’s largest social networking website Facebook now wants to be a job openings platform too. The California-based company has added a jobs tab on its page, in a move that could potentially challenge the position of professional networking site LinkedIn. \n“Based on behavior we have seen on Facebook, where many small businesses post about their job openings on their Page, we’re running a test for Page admins to create job postings and receive applications from candidates,” a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch a few hours ago. \nThe move is expected to give corporations yet another reason to drive traffic to their pages on Facebook. \nNow companies can advertise their job openings on their Facebook page and share details such as title and salary offered, among others. \nThe job postings will have an “Apply Now” button, which will launch the application form. These applications will be received as a Facebook message by the company. \nBusinesses can also pay to show their job postings to more people on the platform. This move can turn into a substantial challenge for sites such as LinkedIn because Facebook has a much wider reach than most job sites in the world. LinkedIn, for example, has 467 million members, TechCrunch said in its report. Facebook, on the other hand, has 1.79 billion users across the globe monthly . \nThe monthly user count of Facebook is higher than the population of India and the US put together. \nNearly 84.9% of the US-listed firm’s daily active users are outside the US and Canada. As per the data from Q2 results, India has 155 million monthly active users on Facebook. The country-wise numbers for the third quarter are not available yet. \nFacebook’s Q3 results (for the quarter ended September 2016) show that it had an average of 1.18 billion daily active users and 1.09 billion active mobile users every day. \nIn October, Facebook had unveiled its Slack-competitor. US-based Slack is a fast growing workplace messaging app . \nDuring the same month, Facebook added new features which allow users to get advice from their friends on things-to-do in their vicinity, book movie tickets, make appointments and even order food. However, these features have been rolled out only for users in the US for the time being.",

      "text": "Facebook has announced a new AI-powered filter for your photos—a modest move, but one that signals the company’s grand ambitions to bake artificial intelligence into every aspect of its business.\nThe new software uses deep neural networks to transform photographs and live video into images that resemble famous artworks. But unlike other products that achieve a similar result by farming out the calculations to algorithms running on the cloud, Facebook’s offering will actually perform all the computation on your phone.\nThat’s a necessity in order to apply the filters in real-time—the lag introduced by sending data across the Internet would render a cloud-based approach useless. But it’s also a massive engineering headache. Facebook engineers say that it was made possible by building two products: a lightweight AI processing system called Caffe2Go, and a specially optimized set of models that create desired artistic effects without wasting computational effort.\n\nEssentially, the team spent a long time running its artistic AI models—not themselves a new concept—to work out where it could cut corners. That let the team shrink down the size of the model by a factor of a hundred. The result is a piece of AI software that can run on a smartphone to provide convincing results, while also remaining fast and unaffected by the reliability of a data connection.\nIt’s certainly not the first company to shoehorn AI into a software running on a handset. Google’s translation tool and Apple’s facial recognition system do, too. But the new Facebook software is impressive because it replicates a process that’s usually so resource-intensive.\nIn fact the way in which Facebook has approached the problem shows that, really, the image filter isn’t the big news here. Instead, with Caffe2Go it appears to have figured out a path toward introducing on-device AI into far more products. That might include gesture or image recognition in the near future, and it’s not difficult to imagine a similar approach being used to power speech recognition or sound synthesis.\nIndeed, in an enthusiastic post about the company’s AI ambitions published today, Mike Schroepfer, the chief technology officer at Facebook, expounds about how machine learning research is reaching all corners of the organization. The company is using computer vision tools to optimize Internet access , say, and speech recognition to create more realistic VR avatars .\nHe also points out some numbers that quantify the rapid pace of AI adoption. It’s created a data-sharing tool called AutoML, for instance, that allows all of its machine learning modes—of which it apparently tests more than 300,000 each month—to automatically update each other with new learnings. And it’s now running twice as many AI experiments per month than it was six months ago.\nThere are still some major hurdles facing AI systems, of course—among them providing a genuine understanding of language , the ability to make sense of how the real world looks , and the capacity to predict how real physical situations play out . Schroepfer acknowledges those as the next big challenges for AI research. It’ll be a while before those kinds of smarts make it to your phone—but Facebook is certainly eyeing the possibility.\n(Read more:  Facebook , Facebook Code , “ AI’s Language Problem ,” “ Apple Lags Behind Google and Facebook on AI ,” “ Apple Rolls Out Privacy-Sensitive Artificial Intelligence ”)\nWeren't able to make it to EmTech?

      "text": "Facebook has shared some metric and insights into how Election Day ripples through the conversations of U.S. citizens most popular social media platform on the planet.\nMore than 190 of 310 million Americans use Facebook, according to Statista .\nAs of 4 p.m. Pacific Time today, more than 7.5 million U.S. citizens shared on Facebook that they voted today, according to a spokesperson who provided data to VentureBeat via email. By comparison, on Election Day in 2012 more than 9 million Americans said they voted on Facebook.\nTop issues of conversation around policy on Election Day: government ethics, religion, racial issues, crime and criminal justice, and the economy.\nOn Election Day and in the month leading up to Election Day, between Oct. 1 and Nov. 6, Donald Trump has been the focus of the majority of conversations.\nBetween that period of time, more than 67 million had 1.14 billion interactions related to Donald Trump, while 59.1 million people had 934 million about Hillary Clinton.\nClinton tied or led the conversation in reliably blue states like Maryland, Minnesota, New York, and New Jersey, while Trump led the topic of conversation in reliably Republican states like Arizona, Nebraska, Kansas and Louisiana.\nAs of 6 p.m. Pacific Time on Election Day, as polls began to close in the most contentious battleground states, Trump was the topic of the majority of conversations. For example, Trump leads in Michigan 53-47 and in Georgia 52-48. In Virginia, another state considered too close to call at the time this story was published, the number of conversation is tied at 50-50.\nTop 10 moments of the 2016 presidential race \n1. The second presidential debate on October 9.\n2. The release of the Access Hollywood tape.\n3. The first presidential debate on September 26.\n4. The third presidential debate on October 19.\n5. The Democratic Convention.\n6. FBI Director Comey reopens investigation into Clinton emails.\n7. The Republican Convention.\n8. The Vice Presidential Debate on October 4.\n9. Trump criticizes the Khan family after the Democratic Convention\n10. Super Tuesday on March 1.\nBetween the day the first presidential nominee declared his candidacy on March 23, 2015 and Nov. 1, 128 million people in the United States generated 8.8 billion likes, posts, comments and shares related to the election.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "By Book of Mormon Central   \nFollow Us on Facebook \n“And upon the plates of Nephi I did make a full account of all the wickedness and abominations; but upon these plates I did forbear to make a full account of their wickedness and abominations, for behold, a continual scene of wickedness and abominations has been before mine eyes ever since I have been sufficient to behold the ways of man.” Mormon 2:18 \nThe Know \nBy the time Mormon began documenting scenes and events from his own time, his commentary had become terse and despairing. Exemplary of this is Mormon 2 , which begins in the 326th year since Christ’s birth ( Mormon 2:2 ) and passes quickly through the intervening years to the 350th ( v. 28 ). The whole book of Mormon (chapters 1–6) covers a span of 64 years, including the entirety of Mormon’s adult life, in the space of approximately eleven pages in our modern printed Book of Mormon (averaging less than .25 pages per year). \nThe brevity of Mormon’s writings regarding his own time is surprising when compared to the depth of his coverage of the era of Alma, Helaman, and Captain Moroni in the book of Alma, which covers only 38 years in 161 pages (averaging 4.13 pages per year). [1] After covering other eras, even times wrought by war and violence, such as the “War Chapters” of the book of Alma, in such exhaustive detail, why did Mormon write so briefly about his own time? \nThere are a few possible reasons. \nRunning Out of Time First, he was probably running out of time. If Mormon began the abridgment of the Nephite records in about the year 350, when the period of peace began, then he probably didn’t get to his own record until the war with the Lamanites had recommenced in 360th year ( Mormon 3:4 ). [2] The destruction of the Nephite people would not be far away. Mormon was getting older—likely around 50 years old at this time—and was weary from war and preaching to his people in vain ( Mormon 3:3 ). He may have been worried about how much longer he would live to finish his record. \nOccupied with War \nFurthermore, after the war recommenced in 360, Mormon was almost constantly involved in battles with the Lamanites until the end of his life. When he was active in the wars, he was often having to flee to new areas, build up fortifications and make other war preparations, and occupy himself with many other duties. He did have a hiatus of approximately 13 years when he refused to lead the Nephite armies due to their wickedness ( Mormon 3:11 ; 5:1 ). While this no doubt afforded him some time to work on his record keeping duties, it is clear in his record that during those years he was weary and worn from all the warfare and wickedness that surrounded him. \nEmotional Difficulty \nMost of all, though, it appears that Mormon was reluctant to write about the happenings of his own time because of the great pain and anguish he felt for the demise of the Nephite people. Mormon specifically stated that he was sparing readers some details as he abridges his own history on the plates because “a continual scene of wickedness and abominations has been before mine eyes” and “my heart has been filled with sorrow because of their wickedness, all my days” ( Mormon 2:18–19 ). [3] \nLater, Mormon added that he was only writing “a small abridgment,” because he dared not “give a full account of the things which I have seen” because he was apparently commanded not to by the Lord, and “also that ye [the future Gentile readers] might not have too great sorrow because of the wickedness of this people” ( Mormon 5:9 ). Mormon made it clear that he did “not desire to harrow up the souls of men” by describing in too much detail “the awful scene of blood and carnage” ( Mormon 5:8 ) that played out as his people were swept from off the land. The “blood and carnage” was so rampant that he, perhaps even unconsciously, repeated that phrase multiple times in his record. [4] \nThe Why \nNot long before abridging his own record, Mormon had recently reached what must have been a spiritual pinnacle as he reviewed and abridged the account of the Savior’s ministry to the Nephite people ( 3 Nephi 11–26 ) and the two-century long era of peace that followed His visit ( 4 Nephi ). [5] To recount the subsequent fall of those happy and righteous people to the depths of depravity that he saw all around him in his day must have been utterly heartbreaking for Mormon. [6] \nWhen he saw so many of them fail to repent and turn to the Lord and then be killed by the thousands, he could not contain his sorrow. He noted that “my sorrow did return to me again, and I saw that the day of grace was passed with them, … for I saw thousands of them hewn down in open rebellion against their God, and heaped up as dung upon the face of the land” ( Mormon 2:15 ). He lamented that “my heart has been filled with sorrow because of their wickedness, all my days” ( v. 19 ). \nMormon was a righteous individual in a wicked society, a “sober” man ( Mormon 1:2, 15 ), sensitive to the Spirit and the ways of the Lord. He knew the blessings that could come from keeping the covenants of the Lord and walking in His ways. When he was only 15 years old he had been “visited of the Lord, and tasted and knew of the goodness of Jesus” ( Mormon 1:15 ). [7] \nHe spent most of his life honoring the commandment of the Lord to write the history of his people. Mormon was careful to follow the instructions given to him by God regarding what the message of his record should be. He put enough detail into his book that future generations would be well aware of the lessons to be learned from the destruction of his people, without submerging them in the profound anguish that he experienced at the loss of the “fair ones” whose history he recorded. \nFurther Reading \nRichard Neitzel Holzapfel, “ Mormon, the Man and the Message ,” in Fourth Nephi, From Zion to Destruction , ed.

(Mormon 3:1),” KnoWhy 228 (November 10, 2016). \n[3] Despite this, Mormon had kept a more detailed record of all that happened to his people on the large plates of Nephi, as the prophet Ammaron had instructed ( Mormon 1:4 ; 2:17 ; cf. 3 Nephi 5:8–20 ). The record of Mormon that has come down to us as part of the larger Book of Mormon was a later abridgment of the more detailed record he wrote on the Plates of Nephi. \n[5] See Book of Mormon Central, “ Why Did the Peace Last So Long in 4 Nephi? (4 Nephi 1:16) ,” KnoWhy 225 (November 7, 2016). \n[6] Mormon describes their abominations in greatest detail in his letter to his son, Moroni, recorded in Moroni 9 . He recounts how the Nephites’ actions were worse than those of the Lamanites, including rape, murder, torture, and even the eating of human flesh. See Moroni 9:7–13 . \n[7] See Book of Mormon Central, “How Did Mormon’s Upbringing Shape Him as a Prophet-Historian? (Mormon 1:6),” KnoWhy 226 (November 8, 2016).",

      "text": "18 Remarkable Facts in Jewish History Share on Facebook 1. Jerusalem in Judah Benjamin – Because of the later Kingdom of Judah, whose capital was of course Jerusalem, it's only natural to think of the Holy City as belonging to the tribe of Judah. Originally, however, Jerusalem belonged properly to the tribe and territory of Benjamin, which abuts the northern border of Judah and which was later incorporated within the latter. 2. King for a Week – Army officer Zimri was the treasonous murderer of his master Elah, king of Israel. Like his forerunner Baasha, Zimri on his accession slew the entire line of his predecessors, in this case of the House of Baasha (even killing friends of the dynasty). Zimri was one of several senior military officers then vying for the monarchy. He reigned only for 7 days before the Israelite army at Gibbeton promoted Omri, a military captain, to the throne. Omri promptly besieged the capital Tirzah with Zimri therein. When he saw that the capital had fallen, the desperate Zimri set fire to the royal palace and perished in the flames. 3. High Priests & Murderers – In the Persian period, the high priest Johanan ben Jehoiada was provoked by his brother Jeshua into murdering him in the Temple. Josephus called the murder \"so great a crime, and so much the more horrible, that there never was so cruel and impious a thing done, neither by the Greeks nor Barbarians\" ( Jewish Antiquities , XI:7, § 1). In the Seleucid (Syrian Greek) period, the Jewish high priest Menelaus bribed a Seleucid high official to murder a predecessor, Honya (Onias) III, who was the legitimate scion of a high priestly dynasty and who had accused Menelaus of corruption and misdeeds. For his efforts, Honya was slain outside the temple at Daphne, Syria, where he had been seeking refuge. Later, the high priest Alcimus (Eliakim) pledged peace to the pious Hassideans who solicited him, but betrayed his word and arrested and slew 60 rabbis on the same day. When as high priest King Yannai Alexander offered the prescribed water libation during Sukkot, he let the water run on his feet, incensing the Pharisees, who pelted him with etrogs and vitriol in contempt. Yannai let loose his mercenaries upon the Pharisees and 6,000 were slaughtered. 6 years of civil war ensued, amid which the Pharisees invited the Seleucid ruler Demetrius III Eucaerus to war against Yannai, who was defeated. Yannai recuperated and had 800 Pharisees crucified in Jerusalem. By the cessation of hostilities, 50,000 Jewish lives had been lost and the Pharisees, including their leaders, had been scattered among foreign lands, awaiting the king's demise before their eventual return. 4. Chanukah's Arch-Villain Mourned Jewish Leader – Due to the corruption and hellenizing extremes of his successors Jason and Menelaus, the high priest Honya III fled for safety to a temple in Daphne, near Antioch. He was murdered at Menelaus' instigation by Andronicus, a Seleucid high official, who was soon thereafter put to death for the cold-blooded crime. Remarkably, according to 2 Maccabees (4:37), \"King Antiochus was deeply grieved and was so filled with sorrow that he was moved to tears when he recalled the wisdom and self-control that Honya had shown throughout his life.\" 5. Peace Was Agreed in the Hasmonean Civil War – The sons of King Yannai Alexander and Queen Shalom Zion, Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, disputed the royal succession. Hyrcanus' soldiers defected to Aristobulus in battle at Jericho; Hyrcanus retreated to Jerusalem but was compelled to surrender when Aristobulus captured the Temple. A victorious Aristobulus deprived Hyrcanus of the throne and high priesthood alike, but peace was made, though it proved short-lived. Thanks to the wily Antipater, a seditious Idumean and father of Herod the Great, the sibling rivalry and civil war were renewed, eventuating in the Roman occupation and annexation of Judea. 6. A Jewish Royal Was the First Ever Put to Death by the Romans – In 40 BCE, t he Parthians (Arsacids) of Persia conquered Jerusalem and crowned the Hasmonean contender Mattathias Antigonus king and high priest of Judea. Mattathias' uncle Hyrcanus II was once again deposed as high priest, and Herod the Great's brother Phasael was held hostage. Herod fled and rallied his Roman allies: Marc Antony defeated the Parthians, and Herod besieged Jerusalem and captured Mattathias in 37 BCE. Herod delivered Mattathias to the Romans at Antioch, Syria, where they promptly beheaded the last Hasmonean king of Judea in the first known instance of the Romans putting to death a defeated monarch. 7. Entrepreneurial Pedagogues – Many of the sages of Israel were as intrepid as they were erudite. Schools were founded in various eras by the enterprising likes of Shimon ben Shetah, Joshua ben Gamla, Hiyya bar Abba I (Rabbah), Judah Nesiah II, Rav (Abba Arikha), Judah bar Ezekiel, Sheshet, Papa, Samson Raphael Hirsch, Israel Lipkin Salanter, Hayyim of Volozhin, Samuel Tiktinsky, Nathan Tzvi Finkel, Abraham Isaac Kook, Moses Mordechai Epstein, Joseph Kahaneman, Yehezkel Sarna, Aharon Kotler, Menahem Mendel Schneerson, Noah Weinberg, and Berel Wein, inter alios . 8. Sages & Tradesmen – Jewry's greatest sages were also toilers earning a living in a wide variety of roles: flax merchant (Shimon ben Shetah, Hiyya bar Abba I Rabbah), woodcutter (Hillel the Elder), mason (Shammai the Elder), flower grinder (Joseph), tanner (Yosi ben Halafta), blacksmith (Joshua and Yitzhak Nappaha), silk merchant (Hiyya bar Abba I Rabbah, Shimon ben Judah HaNasi), shoemakers (Johanan, Hanina, and Oshaiah), coin tester (Eleazar ben Pedat), winetaster (Karna), carpenter (Abbina), tailor (Abba bar Zminah, Daniel, Hanan, Yehudah), shepherd (Adda), baker (Judah), honey dealer (Hanina bar Hama), orchard guard (Resh Lakish), jewelry dealer (Abbahu), digger (Nehunya), cowherd and fruit picker (Huna), porter and clothing merchant (Sheshet), wine merchant (Judah bar Ezekiel), brewer (Hisda, Papa, Huna bar Joshua), and poppy seed dealer (Papa, Huna bar Joshua). 9. The Pre-Renaissance Man – A native of Kafri, near Sura in Babylonia, and a disciple of Judah HaNasi, Hiyya bar Abba I Rabbah descended from Shimei the brother of King David and was the uncle and teacher of Abba Arikha (Rav) and Rabbah bar Hana, whom he tutored in an open marketplace. Hiyya possessed considerable knowledge of medical science and may have originally been a physician. Later in life, when Hiyya and his sons immigrated to the Land of Israel and settled in Tiberias, in partnership with Shimon ben Judah HaNasi he established a business exporting silks to Tyre, and also dealt in flax. Hiyya all the while maintained an academy at Tiberias. He was very wealthy and always provided for the poor who solicited him at his home. It was said of Hiyya that, after his arrival, \"shooting stars, earthquakes, storms, and thunder ceased, wine did not sour, nor was flax ruined.\" His prayers were said to have elicited rain during a drought and to have prompted a prowling lion to leave the Land of Israel. Ever the entrepreneur, he also founded elementary schools and personally instructed children. In addition, Hiyya helped compile the Tosefta and, with his pupil Hoshea (Oshaiah), other baraitas as well, redacting halakhot known variously as \"Baraitot de-Rabbi Hiyya\", \"Mishnat de-Rabbi Hiyya\", and \"Mishnayot Gedolot\" that were omitted from the Mishnah by Judah HaNasi. He earned the epithet \"Rabbah\" (The Great) and was also known to his colleagues as \"the lion of the company.\" It was said that when Hiyya died fiery stones fell from heaven. He was buried in Tiberias. 10. The Proto-Feminist – The daughter of the sage Rabbah bar Avuha, Yalta married Nahman bar Jacob, a disciple of her father. Despite being immersed in the realm of renowned Torah scholars, Yalta was no shrinking violet and was immortalized in the Talmud for being strong-minded and assertive. She once broke 400 wine casks when a guest, the sage Ulla, declined to pass her a cup of wine over which he had recited a blessing. When Ulla attempted to placate her, Yalta replied: “All your words are as meaningless as a peddler’s tale” (BT, Berakhot 51b). On another occasion, when her husband Nahman ordered the sage Judah bar Ezekiel to appear on trial before him in Nehardea, only to have Judah correct his grammar and critique his Torah learning, Yalta unhesitatingly advised Nahman to \"send the man away or else you will earn a reputation as an ignoramus\" (BT, Kiddushin 70b). Her husband also permitted her to be carried about in a palanquin on the Sabbath, despite objections from scholarly colleagues, on the grounds that the people required her guidance. 11. The Hebrew Grammar War – A Moroccan-born disciple of Saadia Gaon, Dunash ben Labrat became a rabbi and religious judge ( dayyan ). After migrating to Spain, he wrote a tract against Menahem ben Jacob ibn Saruk, secretary to respected Jewish statesman Hasdai ibn Shaprut and author of the Hebrew lexicon Mahberet , because Mehahem had criticized Saadia unfairly in Dunash's estimation. His polemic, which disputed 160 items in Menahem's work, was dedicated to Hasdai, whose favor Dunash earned. A literary feud followed between the immediate students of Dunash and Menahem in Spain, and centuries later it was revived in France between Jacob ben Meir (a.k.a. Rabbenu Tam, who sided with Menahem) and Joseph Kimhi (a.k.a. Rikam, who sided with Dunash). In the interim between these debates, Rashi quoted Dunash dozens of times and Abraham ibn Ezra, who Hebraicized the Berber name Dunash into \"Adonim HaLevi\", recovered in Egypt another polemical and philological treatise of Dunash's authorship. Ironically, both Menahem and Dunash erred in their grammatical techniques, which allowed for Hebrew roots of one or two letters (Hebrew stems are triliteral). 12. The Chaplain's Apostasy – Wecelinus, a cleric in the service of Duke Conrad I of Carinthia (a relative of Holy Roman Emperor Henry II), converted to Judaism in 1005 and joined the Jewish community in Mayence (Mainz), Germany. Not content to part ways with Christianity, he polemicized against it, eliciting a rebuttal from the irate emperor's own churchman, and prompting Henry II to briefly expel all the Jews from Mayence in 1012. 13. The Defector's Wrath – Upon denigrating the Talmud, Nicholas Donin was excommunicated in 1225 by Rabbi Yehiel of Paris. After languishing for a decade in the purgatory of excommunication, Donin converted to Christianity and became a Franciscan friar, changing his name to Nicholas de Rupella. Embittered and vengeful, he incited crusaders against French Jewry: 3,000 Jews died and over 500 forsook Judaism. He then visited Rome in 1238 and delivered to Pope Gregory IX a written denunciation of the Talmud with 35 references supposedly hostile to Christianity. During the Disputation of Paris in 1240, he was opposed by 4 leading rabbis including Yehiel of Paris and Moses of Coucy (Semag/Ram MiCoucy), who were unable to prevent the many public burnings of the Talmud and other Judaic works that ensued in Europe. 14. Rabbi on the Moon – A grandson (or great-grandson) of Moses ben Nahman (Ramban/Nahmanides), Levi ben Gershom (1288–1344 CE), a.k.a. Ralbag/Gersonides, is most famous for his philosophical masterwork, Milhamot Adonai , dealing with: the immortality of the soul; dreams, divination, and prophecy; divine omniscience; divine providence; the celestial spheres; and Creation and miracles. Yet he also wrote the astronomical treatise Ben Arba'im LeBinah and commentaries on the works of Euclid, Aristotle, and Ibn Rushd. A lunar impact crater (lunar latitude: 34.7° south/lunar longitude: 23.6° east) was named \"Rabbi Levi\" in his honor. 15. The Shul that Love Built – Moses Isserles, a.k.a. the Rama (1525-1572 CE), married Golda, the daughter of one of his teachers, Shalom Shakhna. She died in 1552 at the tender age of 20, and the widower Moses, not only a great halakhic authority but also a man of means, constructed a synagogue in her honor in Krakow, Poland. The Isserles Synagogue, built in 1553, became known as Rama's Synagogue, and exists to this day. 16. The Convert Messiah – Before he was Solomon Molcho, he was Diogo Pires (1500–1532), a Christian born into a family of conversos (Jewish converts to Christianity who secretly practiced Judaism). In 1525, after meeting the charismatic adventurer David Reubeni in Portugal, he circumcised himself and took a Hebrew name. He was forced to flee Portugal and settled in Salonika, Greece, where he studied kabbalah and likely encountered Joseph Caro, who admired Solomon greatly. He also was supported by leading Talmudist and kabbalist Joseph Taitatzak (a teacher of Joseph Caro and Solomon Alkabetz). Solomon wrote Derashot (a.k.a. Sefer HaMefoar ), a collection of his mystical sermons. In 1529, he returned to Italy where he preached of the coming redemption to sizable crowds of Jews and Christians. When he was soon accused of being a converso who had reverted to Judaism, he fled to Pesaro then Rome. Convinced he was the Messiah, Solomon garbed himself as a beggar and for a month dwelt among the ailing and infirm on a bridge over the Tiber river, near the Papal Palace. Oddly, he gained the favor and protection of Pope Clement VII, and his predictions of natural disasters were confirmed by events, thereby bolstering his credibility. Solomon helped prevent the Inquisition from spreading to Portugal, but in Rome an inquisitional tribunal sentenced him to death, though he was saved on this occasion through the Pope's direct intervention. In 1532, he joined David Reubeni on a mission to Ratisbon (Regensburg), Germany, in the hope of persuading Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to inspire the Jews to resist the Turks. In the event, the emperor incarcerated both men then conveyed them to Italy. An ecclesiastical court in Mantua condemned Solomon to burn at the stake. He refused the late offer of a pardon if he recanted his Judaism and resumed his Christianity, preferring instead martyrdom. 17. Edel the Patroness – A native of Krakow, Poland, Samuel Eliezer ben Judah HaLevi (Maharsha) moved to Posen as a young man and soon married the daughter of Moses Ashkenazi Heilprin. His new mother-in-law Edel, whose name was later applied to Samuel, was very wealthy and financed the academy Samuel headed, including supporting his many pupils, for 20 years (!). 18. The Lady Rebbe – Born in Lodmir, Volhynia (now Vladimir-Volynski, Ukraine) to an affluent family, Hannah Rachel Verbermacher (1805/6-1888 CE) underwent a spiritual transformation after a severe illness in her late adolescence and subsequently declined to marry. Instead, she developed a reputation as a healing miracle worker and became the only woman \"Tzaddik\" in the history of Hasidism, despite lacking the associative authority derived from being related to a Hasidic Rebbe. Hannah used her inheritance to establish her own beit midrash (study house), where she delivered discourses on the Sabbath to her Hasidim, and she became known as the Maid of Ludomir (or Maiden of Ludmir). Under pressure from Mordechai Twersky (the Maggid of Chernobyl), Hannah reluctantly married at the age of 40, but the union was unconsummated and divorce soon ensued. Around 1859, she immigrated to the Land of Israel, where she settled in Jerusalem and became renowned as a saintly kabbalist who engaged in rituals to hasten the advent of the Messiah. She died in Jerusalem and was buried on the Mount of Olives. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. Think others should know about this? Please share | ",

By: Reuters | Published: November 8, 2016 8:01 AM With Facebook’s jobs features, companies could drive more traffic to their Facebook pages while allowing them to pay the social network to get their job openings in front of more candidates, TechCrunch said. (Source: Reuters) \nFacebook Inc said on Monday, it was testing a feature that would let page administrators create job postings and receive applications from candidates, a move that could pressure LinkedIn Corp’s recruiting business.”Based on behavior we’ve seen on Facebook, where many small businesses post about their job openings on their Page, we’re running a test for Page admins to create job postings and receive applications from candidates,” a company spokesman told Reuters. \nLinkedIn makes most of its revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people on what’s often known as the social network for business.Technology news website TechCrunch first reported the news on Monday. \nWith Facebook’s jobs features, companies could drive more traffic to their Facebook pages while allowing them to pay the social network to get their job openings in front of more candidates, TechCrunch said. \nIn October, Facebook launched Marketplace to allow people to buy and sell items locally as the social media network tries new ways to keep its users engaged.

      "text": "Share on Facebook 8 Can you feel the love? Romare can, and he's injected as much of it as humanly possible into his latest record without it becoming sickly sweet. From the album and song titles to the vocal cuts and on to the sugary melodies, Love Songs: Part Two is an album steeped in romance. It follows the same suit as his 2013 EP, Love Songs: Part One , and to a slightly lesser extent, his more recent album Projections . Yet, despite being strong releases in their own right, the two aforementioned seem more like warm-ups in the wake of Part Two . Romare has been quietly honing his craft in ever more subtle ways, and this is really what makes the record: the barely identifiable little hooks that seamlessly bob and weave into frame. Part of this newfound finesse could lie in the fact that Romare played more instruments on this album, leaving vinyl samples to play a more minor role. The result is at times like listening to a '70s band with enough clairvoyance to sound modern-day. \"New Love\" — which, reportedly, Romare's mum cuttingly refers to as \"the traffic-jam song\" because of its relentless horns — has all the signs of a psychedelic group lost in a hypnotic jam session. Out-and-out highlight \"Who Loves You?\" is, meanwhile, an absolute masterpiece of layering, where every level complements the other. The funky bass line, perfectly echoed vocals and silvery keys all rise to a dazzling crescendo around the seven-minute mark, leaving one at a loss for what to play next. Part Two is a serpentine tour of disco, psych-rock, folk and funk, with a touch of house and a generous glaze of unabashed love. It's Romare at his finest so far, and whets the appetite for whatever honeyed treasures Part Three might hold. ( Ninja Tune ) Get It",

      "text": "Facebook \nThere is no doubt that the White House is one of the finest pieces of real estate in the country, but would it be a step down for President-elect Donald Trump? \nThe billionaire businessman collects opulent mansions like they are baseball cards. While he could never own the property at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, his dream is to live there for the next eight years. The question remains however, would the White House be up to the Donald’s standards? \nAs a matter of fact, Trump has already announced plans to renovate the White House. Trump promised to install a new ballroom at the White House during a campaign event in Iowa. \n“We’ll get the top people, the top everything, we’ll have the best ballroom,” Trump said. \nTrump spends most of his time at his lavishly decorated penthouse on the 66th through 68th floor of Trump Tower, at 725 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. The marble and gold clad Italianate style abode offers a cushy 30,000-square-feet of living space. On size alone, the White House has the Trump penthouse beat with 55,000 square feet of space. \nBut Trump has an even bigger crib in Florida—the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, FL. Trump purchased the historic property in 1985 for $8 million. Ten years later he converted much of the property for use as a private country club, but still maintains a private quarters there. \nSo how does Trump’s house in Florida stack up against the White House? \nWe crunched the numbers and the results are in, check our infographic below to see which iconic estate is the best: Embed this image on your site (copy the code below): \n<p><a href=’https://www.sparefoot.com/self-storage/blog/14259-which-is-better-trumps-mansion-or-the-white-house’><img src=’https://www.sparefoot.com/self-storage/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/03/trump-vs-whitehouse.jpg’ max-width=’1000px’ title=’Which is Better?

(Photo: Mike De Sisti, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) 32 CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nJanesville — House Speaker Paul Ryan said he plans to work closely with President-elect Donald Trump to implement an ambitious conservative agenda, made possible by Trump pulling off \"the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime.\" \nRyan, addressing the media Wednesday in his hometown of Janesville, said he's spoken with Trump twice in the past 18 hours. He lauded Trump for helping the GOP keep majorities in the U.S. House and Senate, which now gives Republicans control of both the executive and legislative branches. \n\"The opportunity is now here. The opportunity is to go big, go bold and to get things done for the people of this country,\" Ryan said. \nMORE COVERAGE : Trump wins | Johnson defeats Feingold | Exit poll data | GOP holds Legislature | Bice's winners and losers \nRyan said he plans to seek the speakership despite tensions with Trump and many of his supporters. \nAfter initially withholding his endorsement of the Republican nominee after the GOP convention, Ryan endorsed Trump. But following the release of a 2005 video that showed Trump suggesting he can sexually assault women because of his star status, Ryan did not campaign for Trump in the weeks leading up to the election. \nRyan said his relationship with Trump is \"fine,\" and when asked about their squabbles, Ryan replied, \"I don't worry about things like that.\" It's expected that some in the House will push Trump to support a new speaker, though Trump could use an ally like Ryan on Capitol Hill to work with establishment Republicans. Trump hasn't commented publicly on whether he plans to push for Ryan's ouster. \n\"I think we're going to hit the ground running,\" Ryan said. \"We had great conversations about how we work together.\" \nIf he continues as House speaker, Ryan will have to bridge two factions in the Republican Party: more traditional conservatives; and the populist wing that largely boosted Trump to the White House. \n\"The key here is not only to unity and merge these approaches,\" Ryan said, \"but to also invite everyone else in the country to get us focused on our solutions. What I see here is great potential.\" \nDespite his pre-election reticence toward Trump, Ryan praised the president-elect for carrying Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes — the first Republican to do so since 1984 — and helping down-ticket candidates. \n\"Our House majority is bigger than expected. We won more seats than anyone expected,\" Ryan said. \"And much of that is thanks to Donald Trump.\" \nThe across-the-board victories, Ryan said, give Republicans a mandate to institute change. \n\"It showed that people don't like the direction we were going,\" he said. \nAsked about citizens who fear Trump will erode civil liberties, particularly in light of his statements about keeping Muslims out of the U.S. amid terrorism fears, Ryan sought to assuage voters. He pointed to Trump's list of potential U.S. Supreme Court nominees, calling them judges who \"actually respect the rule of law, that respect the Constitution.\" \n\"For those people who are concerned, this is the time to unify. This is the time to heal,\" Ryan said. \"And our president-elect, I think he set the right tone last night with his speech, which was to be magnanimous, to be presidential, and to bring people together.\" 32 CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.jsonl.in/2ffrrW2 TOP VIDEOS",

      "text": "How the Hell Did Donald Trump Become President? By Facebook A brief, valiant attempt at explaining this...this... thing . \nIt can't happen here. That was the sentiment that powered so much thinking and analyzing and predicting during the 2016 presidential campaign. Yes, there was plenty of polling and data and modeling and historical precedent that gave us good reason to think that Donald Trump would never be elected president. But, in the end, the idea that Trump would lose and Hillary Clinton would win came down to faith; faith that no matter what those polls showed—even when they tightened, even when an event like Brexit proved that maybe they weren't quite capturing the tides of public sentiment—the notion of Trump entering the Oval Office remained unthinkable. \nSo what happened? The articles and dissertations that try to answer that question will occupy us for years. But in the early hours of the greatest upset in American political history, here are a few thoughts. \nThe normal rules of campaigns no longer apply. Trump was essentially a one-man band. While Clinton had a data operation and a ground game and an army of high-powered surrogates—including the First Family—Trump had himself, his airplane, and a love of giant rallies. It was thought that those rallies were about Trump's vanity, that his careening across the country and addressing giant crowds—even when his message was amplified by live coverage on cable news—was no match for the paid staffers and volunteers on Clinton's team who were doing the dark and lonely work of phone-banking and door-knocking. But clearly, Trump's speeches weren't just about stoking the candidate's ego. They were about motivating people to vote in a way that Clinton herself never could compete with. \nClinton, meanwhile, was seduced by the idea of running up the score. As Ronald Brownstein noted on November 2, in what proved to be the most prescient article of the campaign, Clinton was so focused on winning in Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina—three states she didn't have to win in order to secure her easiest path to an electoral majority—that she essentially ignored Michigan and Wisconsin. Would Clinton have fared better in the Upper Midwest if she'd spent as much time and money there as she did in Florida and North Carolina? Probably not—as her lack of success in Ohio and Pennsylvania, where she did spend time and money, suggests. But, in hindsight, her plan to win an electoral landslide and deliver a stern rebuke to Trump and everything he stood for—rather than focus on a narrower path to the White House—was a historic miscalculation. \nFinally, there's the trite but true point that the anger that Trump tapped into is a deep, deep well—and not all of that anger is fueled by racism. Although Trump ran, at times, an essentially white-nationalist campaign, Clinton suffered some of her biggest losses in places—like Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania—where Obama was strongest among white voters in the last two elections. The Obama-Trump voter—a Sasquatch-like apparition that Alec MacGillis had been warning us was in fact real—is the new Reagan Democrat. \nAnd now Trump, heaven help us, is their (and our) president. It's hard to imagine what will transpire over these next few days—much less these next four years. At the moment, it seems futile to even try. For now, we can only hope that the predictions for a Trump presidency—and the disaster that will ensue—turn out to be as wrong as the predictions about this election. \nJason Zengerle is GQ ’s political correspondent.

      "text": "Oman Air celebrates National Day with launch of Facebook competition   \nOman Air, the national carrier of the sultanate, is celebrating the country’s 46th National Day with the launch of a Facebook competition for three lucky winners to receive return flight tickets from Muscat to Europe, India or the GCC. \nAs Oman gears up for the celebrations on November 18, Oman Air is welcoming photo submissions via Facebook (www.facebook.com/omanair/) that demonstrate the ‘My Oman National Day’ theme of celebrations, decorations, costumes, the Omani national flag, community gatherings and special events. \nWinners will be selected by Oman Air according to criteria such as how well the photo fits the contest theme of ‘My Oman National Day’, how creative the photograph is, the extent to which the photograph is inspirational and the quality of the photo. \nThe first prize winner will receive two return tickets from Muscat to any European destination on the Oman Air network, the second prize winner will receive a return ticket from Muscat to any of Oman Air’s 11 destinations in India and the third prize winner will receive one return ticket from Muscat to any of Oman Air’s 11 destinations in the GCC. \nMohammed al Shikely, vice president, Marketing, Oman Air, said, “It is an indescribable honour and privilege to be joining the rest of the country in celebrating the foresight and inspirational leadership of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, may the Almighty protect him and grant him a long and healthy life. To mark this incredible day of the 46th National Day of Oman, we will be launching a number of initiatives, which will be announced. \n“On social media, we want people to visit our Facebook page and share with us their national pride. We want people to capture any of the many vibrant moments across the sultanate and express what Oman’s National Day means to them. As the national carrier of the sultanate, we are delighted to be joining the country’s citizens in celebrating National Day.” \nThe contest is open from November 1-30; winners will be announced on or around December 4. There are no age restrictions for participating in this contest. Similar content",

      "text": "I woke up wanting to type “F*ck you, America” into my Facebook status. \nYeah , that’s where I started off this morning. \nAs a professional in the business of personal growth I instantly recognized, though, that this as what we in the industry would call “ Not a winning mindset. ” \nSo I slowed down and put attention on my feelings. \nWhat was causing them? And what perspective would I need to adopt instead that would help me climb out of that deep dark hole of anger, fear and hopelessness that was taking over my Facebook feed and threatening to take over my state of mind? \nSee, I get that our outrage and our fear are warranted. I’m not here to argue that we’re in good shape right now. I am intimately familiar with so many different perspectives on this election and I know the fervor by which they are espoused and by which I, myself, have espoused them. I’m not writing this to argue with anyone about politics. \nBut as someone who views the world through a growth-mindset lens, I can’t stop myself from seeing what is actually going on. It’s never that things are hopeless and we get to simply wallow in resentment and blame. That’s never the end of it, nor is it the way forward. \nThe natural order is that life is constantly aiming to evolve. We are constantly offered opportunities for it and the direction we get to take depends on how we meet those opportunities. Here’s what I think is going on: \n1. We were frustrated and didn’t feel seen/heard. We continued to point at the things we thought were important and we continued to feel ignored and furthermore, ridiculed. We were told “That’s not how it works. We need pragmatism, not radical change, you wing-nut,” and there was a part of us that internalized this disenfranchisement because it was already a part of our own shadow. \nWe wanted change but didn’t completely believe we could have it. We felt disempowered and blamed it on them ; the political establishment. \n2. We reacted. We (collectively) elected a man who is stuck in the wounded child and rebellious teen stages of emotional development because that’s where we are stuck. When I say “we” I mean that it’s the norm in our culture to react to discomfort with anger, fear, scarcity and divisiveness. When I say “we” I include those who voted for him as well as those who dismissed his supporters as crazy and stupid, those who dug their heels in about Bernie Sanders’ loss out of resentment, and those who arrogantly pushed Hillary Clinton on the large contingent of leftist voters who ideologically couldn’t, and made it clear they wouldn’t support her. \nEveryone has a part in this from where I’m standing. In an ecosystem we must all be responsible and invested in the health of every single element of our system. \n3. Many of us are now reacting to the election results from our wounded child/rebellious teenager. Anger, fear, scarcity, divisiveness. I see a lot of people defending their right to be terrified and resentful. Look, fear and resentment certainly hold up in the court of opinion, but when it comes down to what’s productive and what’s not, this is not productive and will not lead us to the change we want to see. \nWe’ve fallen right in line with the dominant narratives of the Trump campaign here folks. That is the vibration he resonates at and we are meeting him in it. Let’s dust ourselves off and rise to the challenge ahead. \n4. The next stage of emotional development is called adjusted adult. Some of us are relating to the election results from adjusted adult in that we are not reactive but instead responsive. \nWe are observing what happened and we are seeing our part in it, looking for where we can learn and grow from it, and setting our sights on actions to move forward in creating the reality we want to see. We are aiming for connection over disconnection in all we do. We have opted out of wallowing, blame, and hopelessness. \n5. There are two ways we evolve our consciousness. The first is by choice and inspiration. This happens when we want something different, something better, and we start taking steps to make that change long before we’re forced to. For a lot of us, Bernie Sanders was an expression of an inspired evolution of our political system, but he didn’t quite stick. Perhaps we weren’t quite ready or not enough of us were. \nThe second way we evolve is through the desperation of being left with no other choice. It’s the result of feeling that a shift wants to happen but being too scared of losing our homeostasis to let the change begin. It’s what happens when we grip to something that’s not working long past the point when we’ve seen the signs that we needed a change. \nIf we had elected Hillary Clinton, we would have felt safe…for now. \nWe would have all put our earplugs back in and fallen asleep for another four years. But make no mistake, four years from today we’d have had to face our demons all over again but this time they likely would have grown even more terrifying. They grow more terrifying every election cycle, don’t they? \nHillary Clinton was a sleeping pill. Donald Trump is, apparently, an alarm clock blaring in our ears, a bucket of ice water thrown in our face, and a fiery dawn piercing our eyes. \nThis is what it took for us to wake the hell up. \n6. We have the opportunity to transmute shit into gold here, folks. Okay, so we missed out on inspired evolution. We are now in the midst of an evolution born of desperation. Let’s make the turn this time or else skid off the road. We brought ourselves to a point where we really have no choice. So let’s get to work on the alchemy. Alchemy: Transmuting base metal into gold. Or as those of us in the growth industry would say, giving meaning to our suffering by transmuting it into evolution. \nWith alchemy, it’s never about the object we want to change. It actually begins with us. When we change, our relationship to everything around us changes. When our relationship to it changes, maybe it changes too, or maybe it doesn’t…but often once we have undergone our own change, it renders that other thing, as it was, irrelevant anyway. \nIf we weren’t so disconnected from each other, Trump would be irrelevant. If we weren’t so leaned out from giving a damn about each other, Trump would be irrelevant. If we hadn’t let fear keep us from holding our leaders accountable and voting them out when they didn’t serve us, Trump would be irrelevant. \nIf we believed good people could win and we actually showed up to support them, Trump would definitely be irrelevant. \nSo let’s make him irrelevant. \nI woke up this morning wanting to type “F*ck you, America” in to my Facebook status, but now I feel hopeful. I look around and see opportunity. Yes, we went on a bender. We’ve been on a bender for decades, and now we’ve hit our rock bottom and it’s time to sober up. \nWe have the opportunity to evolve and it depends entirely on where we put our attention and energy. \nWhat will you choose to look for? What will you choose to see? What amazing thing do you want to create in the space that’s opening up now that we no longer hold the burden of maintaining the status quo? \nMy guess is that you already know what you need to do and you’ve just been too afraid to do it. Well Donald Trump is president now. What have you got to lose? \n~",

      "text": "Throughout October, our Facebook feeds filled up with kids in “I’m with her” shirts, with a rare shot of a child in a red “Make America Great Again” hat in the mix. Sometimes they were on their way to a rally or off to campaign in a swing state. Often, these kids were toddlers or just slightly older. \nTheir parents, most confident in a Hillary Clinton victory, set high expectations. And when election night brought disappointment, we saw a new question start making the rounds: “What do we tell our children?”\nAnd not just on Facebook. CNN’s Van Jones, on the verge of crumpling into tears, asked it live on-air. Calling Trump’s win a “nightmare,” he said: “You have people putting children to bed tonight, and they’re afraid of breakfast. They’re afraid of — ‘How do I explain this to my children?’”\nThe Huffington Post had a piece up shortly before midnight, titled “What Do We Tell The Children?” While the author — Ali Michael, an “educator, consultant, writer, filmmaker” — did note the importance of telling kids their parents will protect them, her piece was mostly a howl for Trump-haters. \nShe advised principals to tell kids “that you will honor the outcome of the election, but that you will fight bigotry. Tell them bigotry is not a democratic value, and that it will not be tolerated at your school. \n“Tell them you stand by your Muslim families. Your same-sex parent families. Your gay students. Your Black families. Your female students. Your Mexican families. Your disabled students. Your immigrant families. Your trans students. Your Native students. \n“Tell them you won’t let anyone hurt them or deport them or threaten them without having to contend with you first.”\nPlease don’t do this. Especially if you’re talking to grade-school children and your point is to make them feel safe. It only sends the message that almost all of them should be afraid, especially if they fall into one of the categories Michael sets out. \nIf you’re terrified of a Donald Trump presidency, then it’s imperative that you shield your kids from seeing your fear. That’s specifically the responsibility of parents and teachers: to reassure children they’re safe.\nThe problem is that parents too often treat their children like little friends. Sure, they’re not that smart and they spill stuff on themselves constantly, but aren’t children just miniature adults? When it turns out they’re not, it’s already too late to stop the emotional damage being done to them. \nThe main role of parents is as protectors, and while educating your children is important, fearful political indoctrination is a whole other animal.\nDr. Jonathan Friedman, director of psychology with The COR Group, advises, “Parents should make every effort to shield their children from the vitriol and mudslinging of politics, particularly during a campaign as divisive, salacious and ugly as this one has been.” \nAmazing that this has to be said.\nIt’s hard to totally shield our kids from politics’ ugly side, but we certainly shouldn’t be the one emphasizing it to them to make our own political point. Friedman says “rather than communicating harshly about those with whom they may vehemently disagree, they can instead emphasize the importance of everyone having a right to express their opinion through their vote, and how sacred this right is to us all.”\nI was against Donald Trump all the way back to the Republican primaries — long before some Clinton supporters were getting ready to measure the White House drapes. But when I talked about the election to my mature 6-year-old daughter, or her 3-year-old brother, I told them how we were making a decision about whose vision was better for America. \nI didn’t demonize either candidate, despite finding them both noxious, because one was going to be our president and my role as a parent isn’t to pass on my fears to my kids but to let them know that everything will be OK.\nWe want our kids civically involved, sure, but we’ve gone way too far in trying to instill our political ideology in them at too young an age. More than anything else, a parent’s role is protection. Let that guide the way we talk to our kids after this election and in all future ones.\n  2016 presidential election ,  daughters ,  facebook ,  hillary clinton ,  politics",

EJ Montini , The Republic | azcentral.com 7:36 a.m. MST November 9, 2016 965 Shares Share President-elect gives his acceptance speech in midtown Manhattan on Nov. 9, 2016. \nJust after I found out who would be America’s next president I went outside and looked to the heavens. \nNear as I could tell, the sky was still up there. \n(I decided against checking my 401(k). I didn’t want to push my luck.) \nSince I was awake and roaming about the two dogs who live the house decided that we’d be going for walk even earlier than normal. \nWhich to them is GREAT. \nAnd why shouldn’t it be? Near as they could tell their lives were unchanged. They would go for a walk, come back and have breakfast, and then get to hang around the house all day, napping when they felt like it and raising the occasional alarm when an unknown human (or cat) walked by a front window, or when some manner of delivery was being made to our house or to one of the neighbors. Sure enough: Nothing had changed \nPresident-elect Donald Trump \nFrom the dogs’ point of view, nothing had changed. \nThe house was still the house. \nThe residents of the house were the same residents of the house. \nI wasn’t sure, however, so I did some further checking. \nThe foundation of the house had not shifted. The walls had not come tumbling down. \nThe fencing around the yard was still intact. \nThe water in the pool hadn’t drained, which I presume to mean that there were no sudden fissures in the earth about to swallow us up. \nThe car was parked out front, where it’s always parked. \nThis computer that I’m typing this on is still functioning, as is the internet connection through which I’d learned about who would become the next president. \nThere is a TV set on in the room, but it’s on “mute.” The news always seems better to me that way. \nAt any rate, the house still has electrical power. \nAnd the plumbing still functions. I’ve had to splash water on my face several times. \nThere is still food in the refrigerator (which is still cold.) \nThe clothes that were in the closet when I left earlier in the day are still hanging on the same hangers. \nFrom all outward appearances, not much had changed. Can you look in the mirror today (and smile)? \nJust to be safe, however, I rushed to the bathroom, switched on the light (which still illuminated the room) and looked in the mirror. \nI was stunned. \nThe person who stared back at me had gray hair. And sharp, craggy features. \nHe was not at all what I pictured in my head. I could pretend it has something to do with the election results but the fact is I’ve seen that same reflection for some time now. \nI’ve learned to deal with it, even smile at it. \nThe whole country is now looking at itself in the mirror. For a lot of us, it’s not we pictured in our heads. Although the reflection probably been there for some time. \nWe’ll learn to deal with it. Maybe even smile at it. \nMaybe. Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. In this election, the biggest winners and losers aren't necessarily on the ballot. The Republic's editorial board breaks 'em down (and, yes, there are more losers than winners): Photo by Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen WINNER: SOCIAL MEDIA. Donald Trump proved you could run a national campaign with very little staff if you have a knack for digital self-publishing. The tweeting fiend took shots at everyone, at all hours, before his staff finally corralled him and imposed some discipline. Photo by Getty Images/iStockphoto WINNER: BARACK OBAMA. Next to Clinton and Trump, our current president looked like the Messiah. How long will it take before people begin to long for the days when he was in office? Photo by Gerry Broome, AP WINNER: MICHELLE OBAMA. The First Lady is the new rock star of the Democratic Party and sure to surface in future years as a potential name for president. Strike that. She already has. Photo by Rob Schumacher/The Republic WINNER: VLADIMIR PUTIN. Though a perennial loser, the Russian authoritarian put his imprint on this election, gaining Trump’s admiration and apparently authorizing the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. Photo by Alexei Nikolsky, AP WINNER: TRUMP'S CHILDREN. Even Hillary Clinton had to acknowledge that Trump's kids have grown up to be pretty impressive young adults. Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images Fullscreen WINNER: CHELSEA CLINTON. A member of the Clinton Foundation’s inner sanctum described her as “a spoiled brat kid.” Now we know why. She caught someone in Clinton Inc. mixing business and charity, and she demanded an audit of the entire operation. Photo by Michael Chow/The Republic WINNER: YOUNG PEOPLE. Because they took one look at Trump and Clinton and saw a couple of dried up (and corruptible) old prunes. Photo by David Wallace/The Republic WINNER: JEFF FLAKE. Arizona's junior senator is a winner because he understood that the greater risk to Republicans rejecting Trump is not the loss of a Senate seat. It is the loss of one’s soul. Photo by Tom Tingle/The Republic Fullscreen LOSER: EXPOSURE. The more Clinton and Trump were in the news, the more their poll numbers plummeted. “One remarkable feature of this campaign has been that no news has been good news for the major presidential candidates,” observed FiveThirtyEight’s Carl Bialik. Photo by Katie Klann/Naples Daily News Fullscreen LOSER: CONSERVATISM. Once a winning ideology in America, its fate is uncertain now that Trump has ransacked the citadel. Trump took over the Republican Party and ran as a populist. If there is to be a legitimate conservative party in America, a rebuild is essential. Photo by Kelly Jordan/USA TODAY LOSER: THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. Not simply because it nominated Donald Trump, but because it is virtually all white. That might be a Republican virtue. It's not an American one. Photo by Nick Oza/The Republic LOSER: ALT-RIGHT. These losers with cell phones and printing presses oozed out of the tar pits to support Donald Trump, complete with their fetid subculture of white supremacy and anti-Semitism. Photo by Nick Oza/The Republic LOSER: TRUTH. It’s now possible for a major-party candidate to lie all the time with impunity and still win millions of votes. Trump told whoppers throughout the campaign and never demurred. Photo by Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen LOSER: BILL CLINTON. It wasn’t just that his wife’s opponent aimed a flamethrower at his lustful past. It was all the gaffes, such as calling the Affordable Care Act “the craziest thing in the world.” The same expression describes Bill. Photo by Mark Vergari/The Journal News Fullscreen LOSER: THE MEDIA. Because we missed the big story: The ascendance of Donald Trump and the popular wave at his back. Even today it is unclear why so many Americans were willing to throw their support behind not just a New Yorker, but the loudest and most obnoxious of the species. Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images Fullscreen LOSER: JAMES COMEY. The FBI director authored one of the most bizarre October surprises in U.S. history -- bizarre because he never meant to hurt Clinton. Comey was obsessed with his image and tried to manage it with strategic memos. They became his exploding cigars. Photo by Michael Reynolds/EPA Fullscreen LOSER: ENRIQUE PENA NIETO. Mexicans already disliked their president when he invited Donald Trump for a state visit. Trump rewarded him the same day by telling Mexicans they’ll be paying for America’s new border wall. Now they really hate him. Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images LOSER: ANTHONY WIENER. No explanation necessary. The former congressman known online as Carlos Danger is a loser because, well, no one wears the word so well. Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images LOSER: JULIAN ASSANGE. He may have revealed Democrats' secret communications. But it appears Assange was working for the Kremlin, which apparently ordered the hack. Once considered lefty and edgy, Assange now looks more like a tool of totalitarians. Photo by AFP/Getty Images LOSER: MEN. Because whether fair or not, the “Access Hollywood” footage of Donald Trump and Billy Bush dialed back the standing of men in our society to pre-history when the only accouterments in the man cave were skins and clubs. Photo by Getty Images/iStockphoto LOSER: YOUNG PEOPLE. Because they backed a silver-haired socialist who wants to centralize power in Washington, D.C., even if they hate that same control on the Internet and in their daily lives. That’s not youthful and energetic. That's loopy. Photo by Nick Oza/The Republic LOSER: LIBERTARIANS. They had a prime break-through opportunity in 2016. But Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson was stuck scouring his memory bank for the meaning of the word “Aleppo.” No wonder running mate William Weld touted Hillary Clinton by the end.

(Reuters) \nAlthough Facebook has been one of the most widely used social media platform—it has 1.79 billion users as compared to LinkedIn’s over 450 million—that has not stopped the Menlo Park, California-based company to venture into new streams, especially those encompassing workplaces. The company earlier this year announced Facebook at Work, which allows for creation of company pages where employees can access mails, messages and notifications. But on Monday, it moved a step closer to entering LinkedIn’s territory, by allowing for companies to post jobs on their Facebook profile. The new feature, which is still in the test phase, would allow companies to post jobs along with their usual notifications. While Facebook did not specify if it would follow a LinkedIn model, of charging users for advertising jobs, it is expected to do the same. Moreover, it is also expected to incorporate an “Apply Now” button, which would collate all the information from the candidates profile to submit an application via Facebook Message. \nWith small enterprises already posting vacancy alerts on Facebook to reach a wider audience, there are certainly a few gains from the social media giant entering this space. But it may have to filter FB messages, as companies often get user-complaints via social media posts and messages. Besides, not many people may feel comfortable sharing personal information over a Facebook account, which is usually filled with personal posts, with a prospective employer. To find traction with users, Facebook would have to price its products more competitively than LinkedIn and also make sure that it allows for more features than just a page and a button.

      "text": "If you ask Dave Jabas to share a story about his granddaughter, he’s happy to share three.\nHer name is Clara and she is 2 years old; his first grandchild. And even though Clara lives in San Francisco and Grandpa lives in Apple Valley, they hang out every week on Skype.\nClara lives in California and her grandparents live in Minnesota, but she sees them every week via Skype.<br />(Courtesy photo) “She’s just starting to talk now, which is great,” Jabas says. “On our recent Skype call, my daughter asked her where they were going for Christmas and Clara said, ‘Minnesota!’ That was pretty special.”\nAnd during another Skype call:\n“She was climbing up on a play table in their living room and her mother said, ‘Are we listening and obeying? She said, ‘Not yet!’”\nAnd:\n“I went to a local library book sale and I ended up with two bags of children’s books, I spent about $8 for about 50 books,” Jabas says. “I took a picture of the two bags and sent them to my daughter. I said, ‘Clara has a library in Minnesota now.’ Sometimes, I like to read a book to Clara over Skype.”\nDave Jabas of Apple Valley flew out to California to help his daughter and son-in-law after his first grandchild, Clara, was born. This is when their nicknames were born, too: “Grandpa Bear” and “Clara Bear.” (Courtesy photo) Jabas, 60, knows he is not the only grandparent out there with stories to share. So even though he is a master locksmith and a business owner , he is now also the founder of a new Website called Spoilthegrandchildren.com .\n“I wanted a place to share stories about spending time with the grandchildren — not spoiling them necessarily,” Jabas says. “My goal is to have a place where it’s fun to go and share stories and read stories about spending time with the grandchildren, to encourage people to continue to build family traditions and legacies. Really, it’s about building memories with your grandchildren — that’s what I want the site to be. I want it to be a resource on how to build relationships through time, gifts and technology.”\nThe home page includes an introduction: “Welcome to the digital table to share special moments about experiencing the gift of grandchildren.”\nGrandparents (and also great uncles and great aunts) are invited to share their stories and pictures; the online community (you don’t have to be a grandparent to join) votes for their favorites. Each month, the most popular storytellers win $100 Amazon gift cards.\nDave Jabas and his granddaughter, Clara. (Courtesy photo) Recent stories include this one from another new grandpa about his granddaughter : “Shortly after her arrival, I dropped by my daughter’s house to make sure that they were holding the baby enough. After a few hours of holding the baby and discussing with her things like where Mommy was going to keep her pony, she got quite hungry. Gramps to the rescue with a bottle and a burp. Then I started getting a little tired, so I handed her back to Mommy and said goodbye. As soon as I handed her off, we heard an explosion in the three megaton range that shook the house and smelled like a sewer had backed up in the living room. Now that is perfect timing. Time for me to go home. Time to go tell everybody how beautiful and sweet my new grandbaby is, while Mommy cleans up the worst natural disaster to hit our good city in 30 years.”\nJabas shares his own stories on the blog he keeps on the website. He’s good at coming up with material.\n“We recently went out to eat and were waiting for a table,” Jabas says. “While we were walking around, I saw an elaborate marble run for $150. It reminded me of one my son and I built together for an assignment for school when he was about 9. We ended up with this 9-foot-high thing that we had to put in the van to get it to school.”\nGuess what Clara is getting for Christmas?\n“It took me about six or seven hours to assemble it — there are tubes and even a trampoline,” Jabas says. “I sent my daughter some pictures and told her that I could justify the expense because it was ‘research and development’ for my latest blog post. It’ll be called ‘Some Assembly Required.’ One of Clara’s big things right now is to say ‘Again! Again!’ and I fully expect her to say ‘Again! Again!’ when we play the marble run together (and yes, I know she will be need to be closely supervised around marbles). That’s the thing about grandkids — they bring you back in time while you are building new memories together.”\nDave Jabas of Apple Valley — also known as “Grandpa Bear” — reads a book to his granddaughter, Clara, — also known as “Clara Bear” — while the giant teddy bear that Grandpa bought her keeps them company. Jabas has started a Web site, SpoiltheGrandchildren.com, where grandparents can share stories, wisdom and advice. (Photo courtesy of SpoiltheGrandchildren.com)",

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter \nMankind has been panicking since time immemorial. Some were quite legit, like the 2008 recession, others not so much, like the Cat Nun Outbreak of the Middle Ages. \nAtlas Obscura has released an infographic detailing some of the most widespread and weirdest panics in history, from A to Z. \nIt includes ridiculous ones like Scotland’s 1954 Vampire Panic, wherein hundreds of kids with knives and sticks patrolled a graveyard for three straight nights until they were convinced to go back to bed. \nOther stories involve typical hoax characters such as aliens, witches, and monkey-men. \nOf course, what would a list of panics be if it didn’t include penises? In 1967 in Singapore, men everywhere became worried that their manhood would shrink after eating contaminated pork. The doctors later advised them that the hysteria was all in their (other) heads. \nCheck out the entertaining infographic below to see the rest.",

      "title": "Should Facebook Buy Snopes?",
      "text": "A lot of what’s on Facebook isn’t true. Maybe that’s not surprising, because a lot of what’s on the internet at large isn’t true, and Facebook is a place for people to share what they’re thinking, or seeing, or reading.\nThat’s certainly how Facebook seems to conceive of its role as a distributor of information. “We are a tech company, not a media company,” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO, said this summer . Chris Cox, the company’s product manager, elaborated a few weeks ago : “A media company is about the stories it tells. A technology company about the tools it builds.”\nBut in its attempt to be an apolitical platform for news, Facebook also helps circulate misinformation, much of it politically tinged. In The New York Times Magazine, John Hosenball explored how Facebook “centralized online news consumption in an unprecedented way,” giving rise to news sources so far outside the mainstream that their interest in actual facts is subordinate to their thirst for virality.\nThese news sources’ stories have sidled into everyone’s personal Facebook feeds, sneaking in between baby pics and status updates. On one side: “Hillary Caught Wearing Earpiece Again!” (She never wore an earpiece.) On the other: “The Photos of Donald Trump with his Daughter That the Campaign Doesn’t Want You to See!” (Most were Photoshopped.)\nIn May, G izmodo reported that Facebook had assigned a team of human “editors” to curate its Trending section, the list of topics in the upper-right corner of the desktop site. The editors were charged with making sure the items that appeared were factual, and linking them to a news story from a reputable source.\nBut the human element got Facebook in trouble. In another Gizmodo story , a former Facebook editor said he was instructed to suppress news about conservative topics. At first, Zuckerberg denied the practice—“We have rigorous guidelines that do not permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or the suppression of political perspectives,” he wrote in a post in May—but within months, the humans were fired and algorithms took over.\nThat immediately went poorly. Just days after the switch, the Trending section prominently displayed a fake news story declaring that Megyn Kelly had been fired from her job as a Fox News host for being a “traitor” and supporting Hillary Clinton for president. By 9:30 a.m., it had been removed from the Trending widget, but not before it spent hours there, likely seen by millions.\nThe fake article’s appearance in the Trending section was particularly problematic: Stories posted there come with an implied stamp of approval from Facebook, which might make users more likely to trust them. The fact that Facebook took it down makes it clear the company didn’t want to validate the misinformation.\nBut what about stories that appear in the newsfeed that are so clearly false a quick Google search disproves them? Should Facebook be filtering those?\nThe company’s already using machine learning—different algorithms than the ones that drive the Trending section—to try and catch misinformation on the platform, a Facebook spokesman told me. If a post containing a link to a news story gets a lot of pushback in the comments—links to posts debunking it on Snopes or PolitiFact , two popular fact-checking sites, for example—an algorithm will infer that the original news story is probably fake. Once the link is flagged internally, it’s less likely to crop up on users’ news feeds as they scroll through—no matter who posts it. That means anybody else who shared the same link will have their posts suppressed, too. (The algorithm only works on links, the spokesperson said, not text-only posts.)\nAnd there might be more to come in the fact-checking field. Adam Mosseri, Facebook’s vice president in charge of the news feed, shared a statement with TechCrunch that hinted at future plans:\nDespite these efforts we understand there’s so much more we need to do, and that is why it’s important that we keep improving our ability to detect misinformation. We’re committed to continuing to work on this issue and improve the experiences on our platform.\nWhat Facebook chooses to do will ultimately be informed by how the company sees its role on the internet. If it considers itself a mirror that reflects the rest of the net, unfiltered and unvarnished, then it probably won’t step in to play a stronger moderating role. But if it fancies itself a safe space for sharing opinions and ideas, in addition to the daily humdrum of life, it might need to be more of an arbiter.\nThe company’s recently taken strides toward the “safe space” model, building safety tools like a hub for cyberbullying prevention resources and a system that makes it easy for Facebook users to report friends’ posts that seem to indicate thoughts of self-harm or suicide . (At an event in New York City Thursday night, Zuckerberg said , “When we started, the north star for us was: We’re building a safe community,” reported Will Oremus, a technology writer at Slate. )\nIt would still be quite a leap to move from a focus on emotional and physical safety to refereeing the facts in a debate—and, on top of that, it would be really hard to do. The sheer volume of links posted to Facebook every day would make it incredibly difficult for even a large team of human fact-checkers to take on. Yet the current, algorithmic system doesn’t seem to be doing its job, either, judging by the volume of posts that have slipped through the cracks.\nPerhaps the algorithms that currently find disputed posts could flag them for human review by a Snopes -like fact-checking team—heck, it could even buy Snopes. Once they’d researched the facts in the story and determined its accuracy, they could overlay a badge like the ones that already populate the Snopes site —an X in a red circle for “false”; a check mark in a green circle for “true”—on one corner of the link preview in the post.\nA perfect fact-checking system probably wouldn’t have changed the outcome of this week’s election; Trump’s surprise win wasn’t Facebook’s doing alone, of course. Zuckerberg said Thursday that fake news “surely had no impact” on the election, Oremus reported.\nBut one of the central criticisms of Trump’s campaign was his disinterest in facts, and the willingness of his supporters to join him in ignoring them. Despite an incredible spread of fact-checking resources available online, Facebook made it easy to see the same mistruths that were shouted from the podium emblazoned in headlines shared over and over, by friends and family.\nIf Facebook’s users don’t call out mistruths online, and Facebook itself isn’t willing to, who will?\n",

      "text": "1. A woman from Snohomish shared this heartwarming story on Facebook. She was working at Starbucks this week, and the coffee shop was pretty empty except for a table with a mother and her three young children, one of them wearing a spiderman sweatshirt. Well two soldiers (Edgar Gonzalez and Pedro Cordoba) walked into the shop in all of their gear and the kids went silent, in awe of the men. So after placing their order, one of the soldiers went over to the boy in spiderman gear and they talked for a bit (about their favorite super heroes) and then both soldiers gave the boy the American flag patches from their uniform. The mom gushed her thanks & the boy even stood to do his best salute. The soldiers said that they find doing kind things helps them alleviate the stress and anxiety they’ve experienced, post-deployment. (Q13) \nThis embed is invalid\n2. This presidential election was a tough one, and people are looking for a break. A lot of travel companies are offering discounts for those who need a good post-election “detox. Everyone from airlines to hotels are taking advantage. Spirit Airlines is even offering a 75 percent discount on any flights to Canada. According to reports, one-way flights to Canada jumped 133 percent after the election, compared to the last four weeks. (Mashable) \n3. Snap, the recently-rebranded company formerly known as Snapchat, announced in September that it will roll out camera-equipped sunglasses called Spectacles. But consumers won’t be able to buy the glasses in stores, or even online. Instead, they’ll get them from giant, futuristic vending machines called “Snapbots” that will be placed in a rotating roster of U.S. locations throughout the fall, with the first machine popping up in Venice Beach. In a nod to the limited life span of Snap’s namesake self-deleting image app, the machines will only be available for about a day before they’re moved to a new location. The company will add the locations of the bots to a map on its home page 24 hours before one lands. The glasses, which record 10 second of video at a time and send the recording to a user’s phone, cost $129.99.

In a picture posted on Instagram yesterday, Hill had her bandaged foot propped up and she was reading the December issue of “InStyle,” featuring Dolly Parton and Reese Witherspoon. Hill explained in the caption, “Catching up on some reading while I recover from a foot surgery that I finally decided to have from a past injury. Gettin’ stage ready for 2017.” Tim and Faith will launch their Soul2Soul World Tour on April 7th in New Orleans.",

      "text": "No matter how hard Facebook tries, its Instagram Stories and Messenger Days can’t seem to dethrone the original Snapchat app in the US. But in emerging markets, Facebook still has an opportunity to become leader.\nEver since Snapchat rejected Facebook’s $3 billion buyout offer in 2013, Mark Zuckerberg’s social network has been creating imitations to fight the app’s success. The latest copycat attempt is a standalone app launched in Brazil on Nov. 8 called Flash , which allows people to send ephemeral text and video messages. The app will let you “add fun face masks, draw and send disappearing messages,” Snapchat’s signature features.\nFlash could give Snapchat a run for its money in emerging markets, where users are strapped for data and storage space. The app takes up less than 25 megabytes as opposed to Snapchat, which consumes over 70 MB . It also comes with data saving features like loading media only after a user prompts interest in viewing it, caching media over Wifi when possible, and allowing for an offline mode where “Flashes” will be sent after connectivity is regained. Users will also be able to post through the app even when the internet is patchy or limited.\n“We specifically built Flash to bring a great experience to Android users regardless of their data connection or phone mode,” a Facebook spokesperson told Quartz. Since iPhones aren’t popular in price-sensitive markets beyond the west, debuting on Android— the operating service running the vast majority of the world’s smartphones —was a calculated choice. To gain users who don’t switch out handsets frequently, the app supports most Android devices released in the last four years. An iOS release has not yet been announced.\nLaunching in Brazil first could help the app gain traction by piggybacking on the success of Facebook and WhatsApp in the country. The latter, which Facebook bought in 2014, is king among the messaging apps, with over 100 million users in Brazil.he Menlo Park giant is instead looking to make a mark in places like Brazil, where only 9% of the population uses Snapchat.Flash will roll out to other markets following the test in Brazil.\nFacebook has a long history of going after Snapchat, which boasts 150 million active daily users . Here are some highlights:\n2012: Facebook released Poke, only to pull it back over a year later. 2013: Facebook attempted to buy the real deal. Snapchat says no thanks, which looks like a very smart move . 2014: The now-shuttered Slingshot app was based on the same ephemeral technology but users could only unlock their friends’ messages once they sent one back. Aug. 2016: Facebook launched Instagram Stories, a blantant rip off of Snapchat’s stories feature . (At least, it gave credit.) Sept. 2016: Stories for Messenger is introduced. And since these messages last 24 hours, the feature was dubbed Messenger Day . Oct. 2016: Facebook made a failed bid to acquire Snapchat’s Asian doppelgänger, Snow , owned by the creators of popular messaging app Line. Nov. 2016: WhatsApp got its own photo and doodles feature with a 24-hour limit called “Status.” ",

      "title": "Still fighting: Vietnam vets seek help for rare cancer",
      "text": "Share on Facebook \nMike Baughman considered himself one of the lucky ones, returning from Vietnam without any major injuries or psychological scars. But after falling ill nearly a half-century later, he found out he did not escape the war after all. \nThe 64-year-old from Danville, California, is among hundreds of veterans who have been diagnosed with a rare bile duct cancer that may be linked to their time in the service and an unexpected source: parasites in raw or poorly cooked river fish. \nThe worms infect an estimated 25 million people, mostly in Asia, but are less known in America. They can easily be wiped out with a few pills early on. Left untreated, a cancer known as cholangiocarcinoma can develop, often killing patients just a few months after symptoms appear. \nThe U.S. government acknowledges that liver flukes, endemic in the steamy jungles of Vietnam, are likely killing some former soldiers. Ralph Erickson, who heads post-deployment health services at the Department of Veterans Affairs, said about 700 cholangiocarcinoma patients have passed through the agency's medical system in the past 15 years. \nLess than half of those submitted claims for benefits, in part because they were unaware of a potential link to time in service. Of the claims submitted, 3 out of 4 have been rejected, according to data obtained by The Associated Press through the Freedom of Information Act. \nThe VA requires veterans to show medical conditions are at least \"as likely as not\" related to their time in service to receive financial help, but doctors note that often isn't easy with bile duct cancer caused by liver flukes. \nThe parasites typically go undetected, sometimes living for more than 25 years without making their hosts sick. The body reacts by trying to wall off the organisms. This causes inflammation and scarring and, over time, can lead to cancer. The first symptoms are often jaundice, itchy skin and rapid weight loss. By then, the disease is usually advanced. \nIf American doctors better understood bile duct cancer and the potential risks to those who served in Vietnam, they could use ultrasounds to check veterans for inflammation, and then surgery might be possible for some of them, said Jeff Bethony, a liver fluke expert at George Washington University. \n\"Early is key,\" he said, adding he regularly receives desperate letters from veterans' family members. \"The VA should be testing for this.\" \nOnce diagnosed, most men don't realize there may be a connection to their service in Vietnam. The few who figure it out often spend their final months fighting for recognition and benefits, leaving them feeling angry and abandoned, as many did when they first came home from the war. \n\"Hard to believe,\" Baughman said in his living room, flipping through a photo album from his war days. \"I dodged all those bullets, then get killed by a fish.\" \n___ \nBaughman had just turned 19 when his draft number came up in late 1970. He was soon deployed to central Vietnam near Hue to do reconnaissance in the mountains. Although he was the youngest in his Army unit, he quickly became one of its most valuable members. \n\"The Vietnamese like to shoot the first guy in line, and last guy,\" Baughman said. \"And so that's what I trained to do: Be the first guy in.\" \nHe would walk point clearing thick jungle with a machete and, thanks partly to growing up hunting in the hills of West Virginia, he proved gifted at noticing the smallest twig or leaf brushed out of place by the enemy. It was his job to spot booby traps and potential ambushes. \nOften on long missions, sometimes forced to sleep outside with sheets of monsoon rain pelting down, his unit would run out of rations and go fishing for dinner near the border with Laos. \n\"We would throw a grenade in the water, and then scoop them off the river floor,\" Baughman said. \"We called it 'fish on a stick.'\" \nThe men would use a helmet and a tiny blue smokeless flame to cook the fish as best they could, but it never really got done. \nYears later, when he returned home, those makeshift meals became just another story he would tell about roughing it in Vietnam. He went on to earn a master's degree and became a successful engineer in Silicon Valley working for Atari, Apple and others. \nIn October 2013, he was about to remarry and decided to get a long-overdue physical. He felt fine, but his blood work indicated there might be a problem with his liver. Further testing revealed he had bile duct cancer. \nAfter researching the condition, Baughman discovered that worms ingested decades ago in that raw \"fish on a stick\" could be killing him. He turned to the VA for help, and his private physician wrote a letter highlighting the potential connection between the worms and the disease. \nHe went to a VA doctor as well, who also acknowledged liver flukes were one of the main risk factors for the cancer but concluded there was \"no evidence of infection\" from Baughman's service time. \nHe was twice denied benefits in 2015, and is waiting for the results of his latest appeal. \n___ \nLiver flukes are found mainly in parts of Southeast Asia, China and South Korea, where residents and tourists alike risk infection from specific types of freshwater fish such as tilapia and carp. \nIn one location in Laos, researchers found liver flukes — which can survive pickling and fermentation — in about 60 percent of villagers, and in some parts of Vietnam, up to 40 percent were infected. Experts say it's hard to know how many people in the region may be dying from cholangiocarcinoma caused by the parasites because there are few cancer registries. \nIn northeastern Thailand, where many villagers have a taste for the sour fish dish pla som, new bile duct cancers affect about 84 in 100,000 people, the world's highest recorded rate. Little research has been conducted outside of Thailand, where mobile clinics routinely perform bile duct ultrasound screenings in hard-hit areas. \nOnce cancer is detected, surgery is sometimes an option, depending on the tumor's location. Liver transplants typically aren't performed due to organ shortages and poor prognosis. \nIn the United States, cholangiocarcinoma is extremely rare, with roughly 5,000 people diagnosed each year, including some Asian immigrants who ate infected fish in their native countries. Liver flukes aren't the only risk factor for the disease; others include hepatitis B and C, cirrhosis and bile duct stones. \nBut some physicians say for Vietnam veterans diagnosed decades after U.S.-backed Saigon fell to communist forces in 1975, the cancer is \"as likely as not\" tied to their service time. And by VA standards, that should be enough to receive benefits. \nAsked if it was likely men were infected on the battlefield, Dr. Banchob Sripa, a leading expert on the disease at Khon Kaen University in Thailand, said \"it is the only way to explain it.\" He said doctors in the U.S. and Australia, which also sent troops to the war, have contacted him for help in determining whether the parasites are to blame for veterans' cancer. \nMore than 100 appeals for cholangiocarcinoma dating back to the early 1990s are on the VA's website. Though Erickson said there have been no significant case increases among veterans in recent years, data collected following an AP inquiry showed the number of benefit claims has increased sixfold since 2003. \nClaims hit a high of 60 last year, with nearly 80 percent denied. Decisions appear to be haphazard. Some are approved automatically. Others, presented with the same evidence, are denied. \nFor instance, some rejections were based on the fact that parasites were not found in stool samples, but those tests were conducted years after the worms would have died. Other claims were dismissed because the veteran did not report his illness within a year of leaving Vietnam, yet symptoms typically don't appear until decades later. \nVA officials say while they're sympathetic, it's up to the men to prove that liver flukes from Vietnam are killing them. They say because the cancer remains rare, it would be unrealistic and onerous to carry out regular screenings. \n\"This is still a legal process that both the VA and the veteran have to go through, and we will look at each case and all the evidence that is presented to us and make a determination at that point,\" said Steve Westerfeld, a spokesman for the VA's Veterans Benefits Administration. \"Certainly any veteran has an opportunity to appeal.\" \nMany do, sometimes two or three times before either getting approved or giving up. \n\"It's discouraging to fight for something that you think should probably be available for people who actually went over and served,\" Mike Brown of Valencia, California, told the AP earlier this year after learning he had bile duct cancer. He died last month at age 68, just days after finding out the VA had approved his claim. \nOften, it's the widows who are left fighting. \n\"It's bad enough,\" said Anne Petitti, whose husband, Mario, died from the disease in 2010, just a few months after being diagnosed. \"They shouldn't be put through the wringer or have to go through all the red tape.\" \nShe eventually won her fight with the VA, and set up a Facebook page to help other veterans navigate the system while also cataloging new cases. \nHow much veterans, or their families, are compensated depends on many factors, including to what degree the illness is affecting their ability to have productive lives. An unmarried veteran can get nearly $3,000 a month, but some spouses said they get about half that amount. For many, it's not about the money. It's about raising awareness, both among veterans and the VA, and receiving recognition for their service. \n\"Most vets understand very quickly it's a terminal disease and that they don't have much time,\" Petitti said. \nBaughman talks about his own future with caution, even though he's already beaten the odds: He was supposed to have died last November. \nThe illness forced him to stop working, and his medical bills have skyrocketed from all the tests, radiation and chemotherapy. He's luckier than some because he has good insurance. \nHe's not in touch with most of the guys from his old unit, but he worries about them too. Unlike today's troops, those who served in Vietnam were shunned when they came home. It's one more reason having this medical condition recognized by the VA matters so much to him. \n\"It'd be nice to have me win my little battle,\" he said. \"But ... I want the government to do it for everybody.\" \nAssociated Press writer Tran Van Minh contributed to this report from Hanoi, Vietnam. The best SoCal news in your inbox, daily.

      "text": "Welcome to Facebook's internet.\nThe social network is absolutely crushing the competition online, new information from the Pew Research Center shows — in case you needed more evidence.\nSEE ALSO: Facebook's mobile business is bigger than ever\nSeventy-nine percent of American adults who use the internet are on Facebook, according to the results from a Pew survey released Friday, and 76 percent of them say they use it every day. The next-largest social network is Facebook-owned Instagram, with 32 percent of online adults.\nThe survey indicates that older Americans are joining the social network \"in increasing numbers.\"\n\"Some 62 percent of online adults ages 65 and older now use Facebook, a 14-point increase from the 48 percent who reported doing so in 2015,\" Pew's Shannon Greenwood, Andrew Perrin and Maeve Duggan wrote in a post about the survey.\nAnd Facebook is used across demographics. Eighty-four percent of internet-connected Americans earning less than $30,000 a year use the social network, while 77 percent of online Americans earning at least $75,000 do. Eighty-one percent of urban-dwelling online Americans use Facebook, as do 81 percent of rural online Americans. And 77 percent of connected Americans with a high school degree or less use the service, while 79 percent of those with at least a college education do.\nThe research arrives at a controversial moment for Facebook. The site has come under fire this week for allowing the spread of misinformation in its News Feed.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg downplayed his site's influence at a tech conference Thursday night.\n\"Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, which is a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way, I think is a pretty crazy idea,\" he said. \"Voters make decisions based on their lived experience.\"\nPrevious research from Pew indicates that most Americans get news from social media, and 20 percent of American social media users say they've changed their views \"on a political or social issue\" because of something they saw on a site like Facebook.",

(Photo: Bonnie Bolden/The News-Star) 7461 CONNECT 22 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMONROE, La. --- Darius Washington, 16, said he didn't think he'd done that well the last time the took the ACT, but he was in for a shock. \nWhen he checked his results around midnight Monday, the Neville High School student learned that he earned 36 on the ACT, which is a rare perfect score. \nHe said his parents, Marish and Sonica Washington, are very proud. His mom and aunt shared the news online. \nWashington said his classmates are excited that he got the perfect score. \n\"We are not surprised, but we are very proud,\" Neville Assistant Principal Whitney Martin. \nWashington said he had taken the test a few times before and had an idea of what to expect. He advises other students not to stress too much over the exam because that will burn them out before they take the test. \n\"Manage your time wisely because if you run out of time that directly affects your score. If you don't get to questions, then you can't answer them,\" he said. \nWashington plans to attend the University of Louisiana at Monroe and major in computer science. The only child said he hopes to stay near home and work with CenturyLink or IBM, or he might move to Dallas because it's the nearest large city. \nWashington is graduating early and he's a National Merit Scholar semifinalist. He attends honors classes and is a member of the National Honor Society and the quiz bowl team, which recently earned a spot in nationals in Chicago. When he's not studying, Washington said he's relaxing and watching a lot of Netflix. \nFollow Bonnie Bolden on Twitter @Bonnie_Bolden 7461 CONNECT 22 COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story FORT WORTH \nFacebook will expand its far north Fort Worth data center project now under construction from three buildings to five buildings totaling nearly 2.5 million square feet of space, triple the space in its initial plans, the social media giant said Friday. \nFacebook made its announcement on the project’s Facebook page. When it began, Facebook said it would have three buildings totaling about 750,000 square feet of space. Facebook has said its investment in Fort Worth could reach beyond $1 billion. \nWith this expansion, our Fort Worth data center will play an even more important role in making that possible. \nKC Timmons, Facebook’s site manager in Fort Worth \n“This expansion comes as more people around the world use Facebook apps and services every day, and as video becomes even more central to the way people connect and share with each other,” said KC Timmons, site manager for the Fort Worth data center. “ With this expansion, our Fort Worth data center will play an even more important role in making that possible. We're now starting to roll racks of servers into the first building, and we couldn't be more impressed with the fast pace of the teams working on this project.” \nThe announcement comes nearly a year after Facebook, based in Menlo Park, Calif., bought an additional 39 acres adjacent to the 110 acres it already owned at Texas 170 and Park Vista Boulevard in Alliance. At that time, Facebook speculated the additional land would be for an expansion. \nThis is what we hoped for when did the deal and they have been great to work with. We are excited not only about the overall impact to the economy, but what this could mean as we look to attract similar operations to Fort Worth. \nRobert Sturns, Fort Worth’s economic development director \nRobert Sturns, Fort Worth’s economic development director, said it’s a great deal to see Facebook expand its Fort Worth presence. \n“This is what we hoped for when did the deal and they have been great to work with,” Sturns said. “We are excited not only about the overall impact to the economy, but what this could mean as we look to attract similar operations to Fort Worth.” \nConstruction on the project started in July 2015 , a year after Facebook vetted 220 cities for the project. Fort Worth was chosen from a group of four finalists. \nThe first data center building is expected to come online early next year. Facebook said it has started construction on the second building, which could be up and running in December 2017, and is nearing starting construction on the third building. Construction on the remaining two buildings hasn’t been determined, the company said. \nTimmons said about 950 workers on site every day have logged more than 1.7 million hours of work on the project. It expected to have more than 120 employees when the data center complex is completed. \nIn May 2015, the Fort Worth City Council approved a 20-year, $146.7 million incentive package on real and business personal property taxes for the project. Tarrant County commissioners also approved a 10-year tax abatement for up to 60 percent of new real and business personal property value.",

      "text": "in Trending \nAs if Facebook wasn’t filled with enough drama these days, it seems that people’s accounts are being memorialized —even though they’re alive. Here’s proof: So Facebook is falsely notifying people that users are dead, including me….. pic.twitter.com/tBSbpMcEFN \n— Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) November 11, 2016 \nEven Mark Zuckerberg’s account was affected. \nAccording to The Guardian , People logging in to their accounts to find that they had been “memorialized”, with a message saying (in Zuckerberg’s case): “We hope people who love Mark will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life.” \nPeople are taking to Twitter to talk about this issue on Facebook because, well, social media. \nOmg catch this bug while its hot: facebook has memorialized all of its accounts accidentally.

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — An apparent glitch on Facebook Friday afternoon added a memorial note at the top of users' pages, including that of CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The notices seem to have first appeared at around 3:45 Eastern time.\nThe wording was the same in all cases. For instance: \"Remembering Mark Zuckerberg. We hope people who love Mark will find comfort in the things others share to remember and celebrate his life. Learn more about memorialized accounts and the legacy contact setting on Facebook.\"\nThe notices disappeared shortly after.\nA query to Facebook asking for comment was not immediately returned.\nFacebook allows loved ones to “memorialize” the account of someone who had died, to allows their family and friends to remember the person and pay tribute to the life they life.\nIn a posting in 2011 , Facebook’s Chengos Fei wrote about the option.\n“We hope that by allowing the people who use our service a chance to mourn together and remember someone who passed away, people can find comfort in sharing happy and heartwarming stories about their departed friend or family member.\"",

      "text": "Facebook I've decided I've wanted to change my life for good and become a more positive and overall healthy person and I did this by detoxifying my life and one thing I did was raise my standards in relationships which included romantic encounters and friendships. I did this because I believe people took advantage of my kindness and saw it as a weakness and I was putting a lot into relationships but wasn't really receiving anything back and they only needed me when they needed to sort something out and as the good friend I was always there to help but somehow when the tables turned they could never be found which hurt mr and I got to the point where I decided this needed to stop. One of my best friends is someone who our relationship was rocky at the start however we managed to get through the worst and we truly enjoy each others company and we have genuine conversation, hilarious inside jokes and everything. However all of a sudden the topic of discussion has changed and all she ever obsesses over is boys and even got involved with some dangerous boys and tried to put me in harms way by inviting me, she also stayed at my mum's house for a while cause she got kicked out of hers and never even said thank you and the most current thing she did was the last straw which is she is not particularly confident with herself or her weight and that would be one of the things I'd stay up late on the phone with her discussing and being her shoulder to cry on whenever she needed but never seemed to return the favour and would zone out when I needed her help or motivation with something and also she'd spend hours on the phone gossiping about these popular girls and there was one in particular who doesn't seem to like me and she would curse her out but behind my back she attended her birthday dinner, but isn't there some kind of girl code for if your best friend doesn't associate herself with someone for a valued reason you shouldn't either?

      "text": "Share Peeing in the Pool. What Can Be Done? on Facebook \nA passionate plea from a former swimmer, swim coach, and now pool design professional. Please, the culturally accepted practice of peeing in the pool needs to stop! My body can’t take the chlorine cough anymore! \nThere are a lot of great cultural aspects that make swimming one of the best sports. Hard work, intelligence, support, and drive are words that could be used to describe any swim team in the country. \nAt any college campus across the country, you can count on the swim team to lead the way in hours put into their sport, GPA on campus, and community service. You can also count on them to swim in their own filth for 4 hours a day. \nLet’s put this into perspective. My own brother won’t eat fish because they spend their entire life in their own waste. However, he will be one of the first to announce to the entire pool, that he just used your water space as a bathroom. This needs to stop. \nBelow are some of the misconceptions of peeing in the pool that we need to forget and some of the new behaviors we need to develop to fix the problem. Misconceptions: Chlorine is in the pool to kill everything. I have heard this over and over again on a pool deck. I have even heard a coach say to a swimmer with a fresh wound, “Get in and let the chlorine clean it out.” While this is true, chlorine is in the pool to kill unwanted organisms, it doesn’t mean that we should flood the pool with these items. Do you bring in a wheelbarrow of dirt to dump on the floor before you vacuum the carpet? Then why would we do this in a swimming pool? The pool is the only shower I need. We all know of that swimmer that only showers at the pool, and only after a workout. We all, also know that swimmer that doesn’t even shower. I mean why should they? They are in the water four hours a day anyway and they’ll just let the chlorine do the job of soap. Yet, I am sure this same person will wash their hands every chance they get, so let’s shower sometime before we get in the water out of courtesy. The pool filtration system is good enough to take care of my body waste. The water in a typical competition pool is turned over every 5.5 hours. To the non-engineer, this means that it takes 5.5 hours for the full volume of water in the pool to pass through the filtration system. This does not actually guarantee that every drop of water will actually go through the filtration system. It actually takes 3 complete turnover cycles for 95% of the water to pass through the system. It’s a bad HVAC design that causes bad air. The HVAC design has nothing to do with the creation of the bad air. A majority of the time, the pool chemical makeup is equally to blame for the resulting “bad air” in a facility. Bad air is created by the water chemistry. Blame the HVAC system for not carrying away the bad air. Blame the water chemistry for creating the bad air. It’s not like I am drinking the water. Chances are even if you are swimming with your mouth shut and are the most skilled swimmer, you are still drinking a decent amount of pool water. I know a few little kids whose belly swells when they get in the pool because they are constantly drinking the water. The UV system will take care of it. A UV system is only able to clean water that passes through it as part of the overall filtration system. It is does not treat water out in the swimming pool. What can be done? Shower before you get in the water. Especially if you are coming from an outdoor sweaty activity. Did you just do dryland? Get in the shower. Did you just come from sitting in an unconditioned class room all day? Get in the shower. Unless you showered right before you arrived at the pool, you should shower before you get in it. Wetting your hair with non-chlorine water is actually good for your hair. Swimmer hair is not cute. Get in the shower and do your hair a favor and wet it down with non-chlorinated water. This helps lock in the natural oils of the hair and keep out the “bad” chlorine water. Use the bathroom before you get in the pool. Every swimmer of every age should be encouraged to use the bathroom before a workout. Little kids need the reminder. College kids need the reminder. I am sure most master’s swimmers need the reminder. If we all use the bathroom one more time outside of the pool, that is one more time we don’t have to use it in the pool. This is an easy fix. Allow for bathroom breaks in a practice schedule. If a practice is over an hour, build in a 5-minute break for swimmers to go to the bathroom. If a practice is that long, chances are you need that time to regroup anyway. Coaches might even see greater performances in the later part of the workout if they let their swimmers relieve themselves and fill up their water bottle. \nEurope is leading the way in most of these practices. They actually treat and filter their pool water like drinking water. Think about it, we should too. I want be able to swim with my mouth open again.
