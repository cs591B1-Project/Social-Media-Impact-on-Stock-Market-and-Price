      "text": "print Netflix head of content Ted Sarandos Cindy Ord/Getty Images \nNo matter what movies Netflix has on its service, subscribers spend about a third of their time watching films on Netflix, according to the company's content boss Ted Sarandos. \nOn Monday at the UBS Global Media and Communications conference in New York, Sarandos was asked about the perceived sparseness of Netflix's movie offerings. \"No matter what, we end up with about 1/3 of our watching being movies,\" he responded. \nSarandos cited two contrasting examples: the US and Canada. In Canada, Netflix has five major movie studio output deals, while in the US, it basically has none, with the exception of the just-starting Disney one. And yet in both places, Netflix sees about 1/3 of its viewing being movies. \nResearch earlier this year showed that Netflix's selection of IMDb's 200 highest-rated movies had gone down in the past two years by a substantial amount , as had its total catalog of movies . And g iven what Sarandos revealed Monday about the viewing habits of Netflix subscribers, that decision makes total sense. Why would you pay a bunch of money for blockbuster movie deals if it's not going to make people watch more Netflix? The future of movies \nSarandos went on to say that Netflix needs to find a way to really differentiate itself in the movie business. \nIf you take a film that that does well at the box office, and get it 7-10 months later on your streaming service, that's not going to create a ton of value, he explained. \"If you were passionate [about the movie], you've already seen it,\" he said. Netflix is \"happy to have\" some of those movies, but the audience isn't particularly passionate (hence the \"1/3 no matter\" what pattern). \nDisney's 'Moana' Walt Disney Animation Studios \nBut there are ways Netflix can elevate its movie strategy. \nAn exception Sarandos pointed to was Disney, which puts out movies people like to watch over and over again, he said. The new Disney deal is a chance for Netflix to shine. He also mentioned Netflix's original film strategy, which is still in its early stages. He said he wanted Netflix to put out original movies people would go to see in theaters, and pointed to the new Will Smith vehicle \"Bright\" as a big test. That's a movie you'll be able to see on Netflix the day it comes out. \nThe bottom line: Netflix still seems to be experimenting with how to make a winning movie strategy that fits the company's goals and bottom line. And if you're a movie buff who has felt like Netflix hasn't exactly been catering to your interests in the past few years, you're not imagining things.

      "text": "Markets Today Netflix's Content Chief Details Bet on Reality TV Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos says the streaming service is turning to reality TV to help generate new subscribers. Dec5,20163:20PMEST \nNetflix ( NFLX ) is going unscripted as part of its effort to go global. \nThe streaming service will debut \"about 20\" reality TV shows next year, as part of its ongoing goal to reach 1,000 hours of original content production, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said at Monday's UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in midtown Manhattan. Netflix produced about 600 content hours in 2016. \nUnscripted shows also give Netflix an opportunity to expand into burgeoning overseas markets. Until now, the company has used localized scripted content to reach international viewers, such as through the French original Marseille . Netflix produces original content in 12 countries around the world. \nIts upcoming reality TV show Ultimate Beastmaster , produced by Sylvester Stallone, will be its first effort to use unscripted content to reach international markets. The obstacle course series will have simultaneous production around the world, so that each region will have its own local production team and cast. For example, viewers in South Korea will see local hosts and athletes when they watch Beastmaster , Sarandos explained. \nNetflix for the most part has been well received in international markets. In the most recent quarter, the company added about 3.2 million international subscribers, which was higher than Wall Street's estimate of 2.01 million subscriber additions. Netflix, however, has momentarily admitted defeat in penetrating the Chinese market, blaming the tough regulatory environment as the main reason behind its decision to pause development there. \nThe recent decision to introduce offline streaming also was an effort to grab a hold of emerging markets, Sarandos said. He denied it was a move to catch up with Amazon 's ( AMZN ) Prime Video, which unveiled plans to expand globally last month. \n\"For the most part we developed it for entry in emerging markets that have slower broadband and limited access to Wi-Fi,\" Sarandos added. \"So in places like India ... the way they use Netflix is they download things overnight and then watch them the next day.\" \nWhen asked if Netflix is concerned about growing original content offerings from Amazon or Hulu , Sarandos said the numbers seem to indicate they're \"spending a lot\" but not necessarily encroaching on Netflix's subscribers. Investors shouldn't expect to see any detailed subscriber numbers from Netflix just yet, though, as Sarandos said the company isn't planning to release in-depth viewership statistics \"at this point.\" \nWhile Netflix has ventured into live programming with some of its original sitcoms, Sarandos said it won't be entering the fray of companies bidding for the rights to air highly sought-after live sports such as the National Football League. \n\"The liveness is the selling point, and we're not a great solution for that,\" he noted, saying that Beastmaster is a solution to that problem because it draws repeat viewers who don't care as much about seeing it live but are in it for the story line. \n\"Don't look to us to be bidding for the league rights,\" Sarandos added. \nSarandos also handily deflected any talk of Netflix being bought by a larger company when asked if it could ever \"become a bigger company.\" Recent reports have speculated that Disney ( DIS ) might explore making a bid for the streaming service. \nNetflix has always been focused on \"one product,\" and a deal might distort that focus, he said. \n\"I do think there [are] some other multicompany conflicts that emerge with bigger companies that would make it difficult to be disciplined,\" Sarandos added. \nNetflix shares on Monday afternoon were down 1.3% to $119.23.

      "text": "Get Ready To Turn Off Bravo, Because Netflix Is Adding 20 Unscripted Shows Next Year Real Housewives of Netflix, anyone? 12/05/2016 03:47 pm ET Carly Ledbetter Entertainment Writer, The Huffington Post Kim Hong-Ji / Reuters Reed Hastings, co-founder and CEO of Netflix, and Ted Sarandos, Netflix chief content officer, pose for photographs in Seoul, South Korea on June 30. \nWith the extraordinary success of “Stranger Things,” the buzz around “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,” and oh, the fact that you can now watch Netflix anywhere without internet , it’s safe to say the streaming service is having a pretty good year. \nLucky for viewers, Netflix’s plan for 2017 is as ambitious as ever. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Netflix Content Chief Ted Sarandos revealed Monday that the company would spend $6 billion on new programming next year, resulting in 1,000 hours of original programming and 20 unscripted shows. \nWhile speaking to investors at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference, Sarandos talked about Netflix’s upcoming competition show and a “new model” for the service. He also denied the entertainment giant would bid on live-sports streaming (for now, at least). \nThe content chief couldn’t resist taking a slight dig at competitor Amazon, the company behind “Transparent” and “Mozart in the Jungle.” In his mind, Amazon has essentially been spending money but not “gaining much traction.” The e-commerce giant did recently incorporate HBO and Cinemax programming —which Netflix currently doesn’t offer — for Prime members for an additional fee. \n“Maybe it sells Prime memberships or other things I’m not privy to, but right now it just looks like they’re spending a lot of money,” Sarandos said.

      "text": "New Netflix Shows Coming in 2017 By Facebook PHOTO: Netflix \nNetflix, we love you, but you can be super shady sometimes! The streaming service-slash-studio is notoriously hush-hush about its ratings—and almost equally so about its plans for new shows. Even if something has been announced—like the fact that Netflix plans to more than double its original programming lineup in 2017—details can be hard to find (take the One Day at a Time reboot, for example ). Of course, once a show has a trailer, you see it all over the place (hello, Gilmore Girls revival ). With that in mind, our investigators have scoured every inch of entertainment gossip (so, Google) to compile the most complete and up-to-date list of new Netflix original series that will—as of now—likely be released in 2017. This list does not include kids or teen shows, foreign language shows, or new seasons of existing shows. (We know Master of None will be back. Chill.) And stay tuned—we'll update this post as more information becomes available. One Day at a Time - January 6 \nThis \"reimagining\" of TV legend Norman Lear's sitcom follows a Cuban-American family, which consists of a recently separated mom (Justina Machado), her teen daughter (Isabella Gomez) and tween son (Marcel Ruiz), and the family matriarch, played by EGOT Rita Moreno. Other than that, details are few—but our hopes are high. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events - January 13 \nA ghastly tale of the grisly adventures of the poor, pitiful, orphaned Baudelaire children and their daring escapes from the evil Count Olaf (Neil Patrick Harris). Those books basically were our childhoods (aside from Harry Potter , of course), so we're obviously really excited. Let's just pretend the Jim Carrey movie never happened. \nWhile we wait for its premiere, check out the trailer: Santa Clarita Diet - February 3 \nDrew Barrymore (who also produces) and Timothy Olyphant star in this new comedy as Sheila and Joel, L.A. real estate agents whose lives take a turn when Sheila goes through some kind of change. Look, we don't 100% know what this is about yet, but it's Drew Barrymore. It's gonna be cute AF. Iron Fist - March 17 \nDanny Rand, a.k.a. Iron Fist, is a martial arts expert who uses supernatural (?) powers. Look, it's a Netflix-Marvel show about a New York City superhero. You're gonna see GIFs of this all over Tumblr for the foreseeable future. \nDate Still Unannounced... The Defenders \nThe Defenders = Luke Cage + Jessica Jones + Daredevil + Iron Fist. It's the superhero team-up squad of the Netflix arm of the Marvel Cinematic Universe a.k.a. the Junior Varsity Avengers. These heroes team up to save New York City because what else would they be doing? Punisher \nSurprise! A Marvel/Netflix superhero show that takes place in New York City! And guess what? It's gritty. Who . Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later \nThe cult classic Wet Hot American Summer was already given the prequel treatment by Netflix in 2015's WHAS: First Day of Camp ; now, we'll catch up with our favorite Camp Firewood staff, you guessed it, 10 years later. And, sure, technically the original WHAS came out 15 years ago, but we're still looking forward to seeing the cast—which will hopefully still include Amy Poehler and Bradley Cooper—play something resembling their real ages. El Chapo \nNetflix is partnering with Univision to bring to life the story of one of our generation's most notorious criminals. The big question: Will Sean Penn make an appearance? Dear White People \nBased on the 2014 indie of the same name, Dear White People follows the biracial Samantha White as she attempts to navigate and influence her college campus, which is rife with racial tension. The film was a hit and a breath of fresh air, and most of the cast and creatives are back for the series—except for Tessa Thompson, who has been replaced by Logan Browning in the role of Samantha because she's about to become a superhero in Thor: Ragnarok . Girlboss \nBritt Robertson plays Sophia, likely modeled on Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso, as she begins her journey from fashion outsider to punk C.E.O. The creator/showrunner is Kay Cannon, a former 30 Rock writer who is also behind Pitch Perfect , so we are expecting some serious laughs. Bill Nye Saves the World \nThe OG science guy hosts a talk show refuting anti-science conspiracies and discussing pressing scientific issues like climate change and evolution. Our hypothesis? We love it. Kiss Me First \nPer Netflix' description: \"Lonely, 17-year-old Leila befriends Tess in the virtual world of Agora. When Tess disappears, Leila assumes her identity and is drawn into a mystery.\" So, Black Mirror , but about teens. Too real? Crazy Face \nNetflix' first horror comedy—about ghosts who possess the living—will star Cara Theobold ( Downton Abbey ) and Susan Wokoma ( Chewing Gum ) as a woman who can see ghosts and a demon hunter, respectively. Both are socially awkward, both are pretty unready to battle the supernatural forces of evil. We are getting major Kevin Smith vibes here, in a good way. Big Mouth \nThe animated adventures of Nick and Andrew, best friends facing puberty, was created by real-life BFFs Nick Kroll and Andrew Goldberg. Kroll will voice his character, Nick, and comedian John Mulaney will play Andrew. The rest of the cast is equally hilarious: Jenny Slate, Jessi Klein, Jason Mantzoukas, Jordan Peele, Fred Armisen, and Maya frickin' Rudolph. 13 Reasons Why \nBased on the best-selling YA series, 13 Reasons Why follows teenager Clay as he attempts to discover why his crush Hannah killed herself. This series has an all-star creative team: written by Pulitzer Price winner Brian Yorkey, directed by Spotlight (and The Cobbler , so...) helmer Tom McCarthy, and produced by Selena Gomez. Ozark \nDetails are sparse, but here's what we got on this drama: Jason Bateman plays a man who moves to the Ozark Mountains in Missouri to pay off a Mexican drug lord. Laura Linney plays his wife. And then Laura Linney is nominated for an Emmy because she is Laura Linney and amazing. Gypsy \nLow-key queen Naomi Watts (possibly in a brunette wig) plays Jean Holloway, a therapist who begins to develop intimate and dangerous relationships with her patients. Billy Crudup plays her husband in this psychological thriller. The first two episodes will be directed by Fifty Shades of Grey 's Sam Taylor-Johnson . Mindhunter \nAlways on the hunt for minds! The drama follows two FBI agents—Holt McCallany and Jonathan Groff a.k.a. Kristoff from Frozen —as they interview imprisoned killers in order to solve ongoing cases. Charlize Theron and David Fincher are listed among the executive producers, so this is serious, people. Mystery Science Theater 3000 \nAfter a successful Kickstarter campaign, MST3K will be back with its original cast, including Patton Oswald and Felicia Day. The cult fave is aimed directly at the intersection of comedy and nerd, tapping talent from Community, The Daily Show , and Nerdist . Your stoner brother is going to LOVE this. Anne \nWe return again to Avonlea with another adaptation of Anne of Green Gables , this time a limited series that will lean more toward drama. \nBonus! Technically a tween series, but we're still in love with the original...Netflix is bringing back The Worst Witch ! Keywords:",

More > \nhe penultimate episode of the massive CW-DC crossover just so happened to coincide with Arrow's 100th episode, which means that in addition to seeing our heroes fight a villainous new alien race, we also got to take a pleasant stroll down memory lane. \nBy Alexander Zalben, \nMarvel and Netflix's superhero show Luke Cage reportedly broke the internet when it launched back in September. And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again: as just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime. \nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements... A short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season; and the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 \nWhat's most interesting about the teaser to fans is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke ( Mike Colter ) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders , which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil ( Charlie Cox ), Iron Fist ( Finn Jones ), and Jessica Jones ( Krysten Ritter ), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next...",

      "text": "Netflix \nNetflix famously keeps its viewing numbers under lock and key, but there is one company that believes it has broken through the combination.\nSymphonyAM  has an  app that listens to sounds from users' televisions and takes that data to extrapolate viewership. As of March, the company boasts about 20,000 users. \nThe chart below shows how the most popular Netflix originals shows' ratings  stack up against each other. The data looks at viewership for their respective premiere dates plus the three following days with adults under 50 years 0ld — the demographic most popular with advertisers. Though it should be noted Netflix relies on a subscription model, not advertising, and this is purely for the sake of comparison. \nIt's also important to point out that Netflix has  called the data \" remarkably inaccurate ,\" though it hasn't furnished its own set of numbers yet. \nSymphonyAMc recently took into account the premieres of Netflix's latest shows, the \"Gilmore Girls\" revival and the reportedly very expensive \"The Crown.\" \nFrom \"Gilmore Girls\" and \"The Crown\" to \"Stranger Things,\" here's how many people are watching your favorite Netflix shows according to SymphonyAM: \nNetflix \nNOW WATCH: Netflix is giving part of the ‘Mythbusters’ team their own show — here’s the trailer \n",

For example the Ultimate Beastmaster show will include athletes from six different countries . \n“When ‘Beastmaster’ hits in Korea, they’ll never have seen anything like it,” Sarandos confidently added. \nJust because Netflix is seeking to add a number of reality TV shows to the line-up doesn’t mean it’ll lose sight of drama in 2017. \nWith Stranger Things season 2 now in production, the streaming giant is now moving into merchandising arguably its biggest hit. \nSarandos said Netflix is exploring licensed products because of the \"huge demand for people who want a T-shirt with Eleven on it,” \nShut up and take our money for action figures, Ted. \nVideo - Amazon Echo hands-on \nAre you pleased to see Netflix move into unscripted content or is there enough reality TV guff on regular telly?

      "text": "Reddit \nNetflix is the pinnacle of streaming home entertainment, but even veteran subscribers probably aren’t using it to its fullest abilities. The video streaming service is full of secrets, some more secret than others, and you’re unlikely to stumble upon them unless you go searching for them. Would you like larger, more colorful subtitles? Yes, there’s a setting for that. How about filtering genres down to niche categories? Yep, you can do that, too. Change subtitle size, color, and font \nI’m more or less blind, even with glasses. Small subtitles on the bottom of a television screen are the same to me as useless streaks of color. I’d have to scoot the recliner closer to the TV to watch foreign films, but no more. Turns out, Netflix offers a way to increase subtitle size within the “My Account” section of the website. Look under “My Profile” within “My Account” for a link that says “Subtitle appearance.” Click that. \nYou can change the subtitles’ size, as well the font used, whether it has a drop shadow, and even the font’s color. Subtitle size is set to medium by default, but you can toggle it down to small or up to large. While you’re at it, there are four text effects to choose from (drop shadow, etc), seven fonts (typewriter, etc), and eight colors (hot pink anyone?). More detailed genres \nNetflix has done a great job improving its user interface, but it’s still lacking when it comes to sorting content. You can’t hide anything, so you’re forced to scroll through the same personalized garbage you’ve been ignoring for the last year. This effect — being presented with the same things you’ve been ignoring — makes the Netflix library feel very small over time, but it’s not. You just don’t have any easy way to see everything Netflix has to offer. \nThat’s why so-called “hidden genre” codes are so valuable. With them, you can narrow down your category searches to things that are very specific and niche. “Deep Sea Horror Movies” is one example, showing only movies in the Netflix library that involve scary monsters from the ocean’s depths. There are a bunch of websites that offer a list of these genres, and Netflix Codes is arguably the most popular (and easiest to use). Watching (and chatting) with friends \nThis isn’t a feature offered by Netflix itself, but I’m continually surprised by the number of people who don’t know it’s an option: watching the same Netflix video with friends in a dedicated viewing/chatting web page. \nInstead of two people (who are in two different locations, obviously) opening the same video at the same time and hoping they stay in sync, then opening Facebook or Hangouts to chat during it, services like Showgoers.tv puts its all together in one place. \nWith Showgoers, everyone who wants to watch a Netflix video together installs the Chrome extension. The person who initiates the party then opens a Netflix video on their laptop and starts playing it. After that, clicking the Showgoers extension provides a URL that is shared with others. \nEveryone who joins the viewing party sees the same video at the same place within it. If one person pauses the video, it pauses for everyone. As well, a chat box is provided next to the movie so everyone can chat with each other without having to toggle between apps. Restrict content in non-Kids profiles \nNetflix offers two profile options: adult and “Kids.” The Kids profile option present a library of content that is family-friendly. The feature is great for giving kids control of the remote, but also limited: the content presented under the “Kids” profile is for young children. \nMany don’t realize, however, that Netflix also allows you to restrict adult profiles so that only movies with certain ratings are accessible in the library. This is done via the parental control feature you can find under “Your Account” > “Settings.” You’ll need to set a PIN up the first time you open this feature. \nAfter creating a PIN, you can choose which age category is restricted; options span from content for young kids up to adults. So, for example, selecting “Teens” means that anyone can access content rated for young kids and older kids, but anything rated for teens or adults (including NR and NC-17) requires the user to enter the PIN first. Arranging “My List” by hand \nBy default, your “My List” content selection is ordered based on Netflix’s own suggestions. In that case, the content will be arranged so that Netflix’s suggestions are boosted to the top of the list and everything else is lower. There’s a second option, though. \nHead into “My Account” > “My Profile” > “Order in My List.” In this menu, choose “Manual” for your “My List” order and you’ll be able to arrange these titles in the order you want them (in planned watching order, for example) rather than the order Netflix prefers. Manually select video quality \nYou may want to chose your own video quality, but Netflix automatically adjusts it by default. You can change this if, for example, you have a data cap and would prefer to only stream videos in basic quality (or on the flip-side, you want to force best-quality streaming). \nGo into “My Account” > “My Profile” > “Playback settings.” In this menu, you’re presented with three video quality options other than “Auto,” and they include basic video quality (uses up to a third of a gigabyte per hour of video), medium quality (uses up to .7GB per hour of video, and best quality (uses up to 3GB per hour, or 7GB per hour for UHD content). \nAs a bonus, you can also toggle on/off episode autoplay in this menu. Get access to previews and Netflix tests \nThe standard Netflix experience is, well, standard , but it’s not the only one available. You can choose to participate in special Netflix tests and previews by switching on a toggle switch in your account. Head into “Settings” and then choose “Test participation.” Toggle the switch and you’ll now be included in future Netflix tests. Wrap-up \nNetflix doesn’t hide these features, but they’re all tucked away within a user’s account, and so those who access the service via a set-top-box or on mobile often don’t know they’re available. Customizing your account, as well as taking advantage of third-party tools, can make the overall experience much more pleasant. Do you have a favorite Netflix tip or feature? Drop us a comment!",

      "text": "Netflix, CBS and Fox Execs Detail Their Plans for Streaming and Advertising in 2017 Talking mergers, growth and ad revenue By Jason Lynch December 5, 2016, 4:38 PM EST Television David Zaslav, Ted Sarandos, Leslie Moonves and James Murdoch spoke at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference. Getty Images This has has been a roller coaster year for the television industry—ratings are falling, the upfront cost per impression is soaring, and there are major questions about the future of TV—which means TV's top executives have a lot to reflect on as they plot for 2017. And that's what many of them did at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference, which kicked off today in New York. Here are some of the Day 1 highlights: Netflix doubles down—again Netflix is bigger than ever—chief content officer Ted Sarandos said the company currently has 30 scripted series in various stages of production. That's double last year's output, and Sarandos said the number will double again next year. Just about the only genre he's not looking to program is live sports. \"To the extent that the 'live-ness' is the selling point, we're really not a great solution,\" he said. While Netflix keeps getting bigger, Sarandos said it isn't interested in being acquired by a larger company. \"We've been maniacally focused on one product,\" in a way that big companies aren't able to do because of their size, said Sarandos. Unlike many of Netflix's competitors, which are trying to own as much of their content as possible, \"I don't want to get trapped in that model\" of only producing shows that the the company owns outright. Otherwise, Netflix would miss out on opportunities like its recent revival of Gilmore Girls, which is owned by Warner Bros. Instead, the company is focusing on using most of its licensing dollars to grab global rights to shows outside of its home market, like Designated Survivor or Star Trek: Discovery. As usual, Sarandos declined to talk about ratings, explaining that \"every show is not designed for the same audience,\" and each have different budgets and different economics. \"We try to make sure we have something for everyone in the house.\" Sarandos also took a shot at his streaming competitors Hulu and Amazon, noting that while they are also pouring billions into original content (Netflix has a $6 billion original content budget for 2017), \"it doesn't appear they're gaining traction against all that spending\" and closing the gap with Netflix. \"As of now, they're just spending a lot of money,\" he said. Netflix expects to grow for years to come. \"I really feel like we're in the early innings of this business, of internet television,\" said Sarandos. CBS: 'Anything could happen' with Viacom Leslie Moonves, chairman, president and CEO, CBS Corp., didn't shed any light on his company's merger talks with Viacom, which are ongoing but in the early stages. \"We are very happy the way we are as a standalone company,\" but \"anything could happen,\" said Moonves, who praised the early moves by Viacom's new acting president and CEO, Robert Bakish, as \"pretty positive.\" While CBS' programming was absent from last week's launch of DirecTV Now, Moonves said the companies are still negotiating, and that digital rights and stacking rights are part of the holdup. Still, \"I'm assuming that we will be able to make a deal with them,\" said Moonves, though he questioned how AT&T will be able to make money on its current DirecTV Now pricing plans. \"There's no way they can last for a whole long period of time at $35 for 80 channels.\" CBS won't have the benefit of presidential political advertising or the Super Bowl in 2017, but Moonves said the network will have the entire Final Four (it alternates with Turner as part of their new deal). That means it \"is going to be a very strong year once again. … I'm feeling really good heading into May.\" Scatter has been strong this fall, though not at the same level as last fall, given the robust upfront demand this year. He insisted that despite the declines in NFL ratings this fall, \"there have been no makegoods\" on any NFL inventory and the games remain the top draw on TV. When CBS didn't have NFL rights between 1995 and 1998, \"the network fell apart,\" said Moonves. This was Moonves' first public appearance after completing a deal last week to finally bring NFL games to CBS All Access subscribers (except for mobile; Verizon maintains exclusive mobile streaming rights). \"We have a very good partnership with them,\" he said, explaining how the deal got done. \"We give them over a billion dollars a year. It's not hard to figure out!\" CBS research chief: ratings are down, but ad revenue should still rise David Poltrack, chief research officer for CBS Corp. and president of CBS Vision, said network TV ad revenue was up 8 percent this year, with an underlying growth rate of 4 percent after the Summer Olympics were subtracted. He predicts a 4 percent underlying growth rate for 2017, with no overall change after adjusting for the lack of Olympics content in 2017. Those increases will come even though C3 ratings fell for the top four broadcasters this fall: CBS is down 10 percent, NBC dropped 7 percent, ABC plummeted 21 percent and Fox fell 11 percent. Poltrack attributed the drops to the election (which included an uptick in cable news ratings, and top-rated shows that were pre-empted by debate coverage), a seven-game World Series and soft NFL ratings. The new broadcast season is \"still unsettled,\" said Poltrack, who said that twice as many ad-supported cable networks are showing season-to-date audience losses versus last year (32 networks are down) compared with those showing ratings gains (17 are up). Still, Poltrack predicted that the 2017-2018 broadcast season should be \"off to a strong start.\" Fox says no to a merger, and OTT Fox isn't feeling any pressure to make a big move in response to AT&T and Time Warner's merger, said James Murdoch, CEO, 21st Century Fox. \"We feel pretty good about our mix of assets … we don't feel the urge to go acquire some other large piece,\" said Murdoch, adding \"we've passed on a lot of opportunities that we thought were too expensive.\" And while many companies are putting together their own over-the-top options for consumers, Fox isn't one of them. While \"I think we could do it,\" Murdoch would prefer to focus on Hulu (which his company partly owns) and third-party options like DirecTV Now. Murdoch pointed to Fox's success in its Empire and Pepsi integration last season, and Hulu's ad-free tier, saying, \"That fluidity in the marketplace is something that we're really just at the beginning of.\" One future option, he suggested, would be giving consumers the ability to pay for a single night of ad-free programming, as opposed to an entire month, as Hulu now offers. What grade would he give his father Rupert for stepping in to run Fox News after Roger Ailes resigned in July ? \"A-plus,\" said Murdoch. Discovery: Global content is more important that domestic ratings bumps Fox might be reticent to dive into over-the-top, direct-to-consumer offerings, but not Discovery. \"We're well-positioned to take our product direct to consumer in 2017,\" said David Zaslav, CEO of Discovery Communications. \"We're going to try to disrupt ourselves.\" That process began a few weeks ago, when the company quietly launched a pair of direct-to-consumer offerings with Amazon, one with paranormal-themed programming (Destination Unknown) and one with crime-themed content (True Crime Files by Investigation Discovery). Zaslav said the company is thinking globally. \"For us, the fact that we're on brand really helps us. About 90 percent of our content works around the world,\" said Zaslav, who added that he and Discovery president Rich Ross have said no to shows that would have been ratings hits in the U.S. because they didn't resonate with international markets. Along those lines, the company is working to \"tighten up\" the content on each network, rather than try to be all things to all people. \"We're these branded groups, and let's not try to be anything else,\" said Zaslav.

      "text": "Netflix Launches Downloads Just in Time for Holiday Travel Woes \"Unscripted television is a very interesting business,\" Sarandos said at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference Monday, the Wrap reported . \"The content itself seems to be largely interchangeable. Meaning, if you want to see a show about hoarding, there are three different shows about hoarding.\" True . But where does 20 hours of reality TV fit into Netflix's larger plans for the future? For Sarandos, the important thing moving forward is to avoid getting trapped in any particular \"model\" by constantly taking logical steps toward reinvention. \"What we try to do is take very measured swings for the fences, if that's possible,\" Sarandos said Monday, according to Variety . As part of their big unscripted push, Netflix is betting on global success for upcoming series like Sylvester Stallone's Ultimate Beastmaster. \" When Beastmaster hits in Korea, they'll never have seen anything like it,\" Sarandos added.​ This promise of a swath of fresh original content for 2017 comes just one week after Netflix announced the launch of downloads , just in time for the woes of migraine-inducing holiday travel. \"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, director of production innovation at Netflix, said in a press release last week. With all this new shit that’s purportedly coming out next year, we all might need to start making room on our respective devices for some offline binging. Tags:",

      "text": "Thomson Reuters \nDonald Trump's election has been kind to the stock market so far, with major indexes having reached record highs in the days following his victory.\nHowever, at least one popular stock pick could be jeopardized by the incoming administration. The president-elect named two advisors last week who are notable opponents of net neutrality, the concept that all data traffic should be treated equally by internet service providers. This is a particularly sensitive issue for Netflix , which takes up more web traffic than any other company but owns none of the pipes that bring it into homes.\nNetflix has repeatedly highlighted this issue in its earnings reports. In a recent one, the company said, \"We support strong net neutrality across the globe, allowing all consumers to enjoy the Internet access they pay for, without ISPs blocking, throttling, or influencing content in the last mile or at interconnection points.\" \n\nNetflix had been mostly pleased with progress on the issue under the Obama administration, but Trump's selections, who come directly from the telecom industry, threaten to undo that. The two men, Jeff Eisenach and Mark Jamison, have previously spoken against net neutrality standards, each having served as a lobbyist for the telecom industry -- Eisenach once called it a form of \"crony capitalism.\"\nWhere net neutrality stands today Though net neutrality is a global issue, the U.S remains by far Netflix's biggest market, accounting for more than half of its subscriber base. Obama's Federal Communications Commission Chairman, Tom Wheeler, has been seen as proactive against monopolistic abuses among cable companies and telecoms, creating net neutrality standards and breaking up the set-top box monopoly that has inflated prices for cable boxes.\nIn February of 2015, the commission issued a set of rules to \"preserve the internet as a platform for innovation, free expression, and economic growth.  The Open Internet platform above all prohibits blocking access to websites, throttling traffic, or accepting payment to favor one content source over another. Telecoms like  Verizon  have fought the regulations in the past, and an appeals court struck down portions of a former net neutrality bill in 2014. \nWhat the end of net neutrality would mean for Netflix If Trump's FCC rolls back net neutrality, it could have a number of consequences for Netflix, other streamers like Hulu and  Amazon  Prime, and small, independent content providers that may be unable to afford higher fees that ISPs could charge for better service.\nThe most likely outcome of the unraveling of net neutrality is that prices for consumers will go up as ISPs could charge extra fees to carry streams from bandwidth hogs like Netflix. Stricter data caps could also apply to mobile devices, making it harder to use such services away from home.\nThe biggest threat to Netflix, however, could be cable providers giving so-called \"fast lane\" treatment to their own services, as Comcast  could do for its Stream service. The end of net neutrality would also give additional leverage to a combined  AT&T - Time Warner , as AT&T could use its Pay TV services like DirecTV and U-Verse to give preferential treatment to HBO and the Turner cable networks owned by Time Warner.\nWhile rolling back net neutrality would be a challenge for content providers like Netflix, it would be a boon for cable and internet service providers, whose stocks have gained since the election. \nThomson Reuters The net neutrality development comes at a time when communities are already toying with the idea of a \"Netflix tax\" or a surcharge on streaming services that treats them like a utility. Between local taxes and the end of net neutrality, Netflix could soon become more expensive for the average American. Expect CEO Reed Hasting to address this issue in the next earnings report, if not sooner, as Netflix has long been one of the biggest proponents of net neutrality. \nNOW WATCH: Here's why Boeing 747s have a giant hump in the front \n",

The show starring Mike Colter as the reluctant superhero has been a hit with critics and audiences alike, but Cage will also be a big part of Marvel's universe on Netflix in the near future. Colter will team with cast members of Daredevil , Jessica Jones , and the upcoming Iron Fist for The Defenders . Of course, in the comics, Cage is best friends with Iron Fist and romantically involved with Jones. There are no details about when the second season will premiere, but it will almost certainly be after The Defenders debuts in 2017. The official Twitter account for Luke Cage celebrated with the post below. Meanwhile, check out some easter eggs you might have missed in the show's first season. — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 Recommended",

      "text": "The Netflix sign on is shown on an ipad in Encinitas Thomson Reuters\nDonald Trump's election has been kind to the stock market so far, with major indexes having reached record highs in the days following his victory.\nHowever, at least one popular stock pick could be jeopardized by the incoming administration. The president-elect named two advisors last week who are notable opponents of net neutrality, the concept that all data traffic should be treated equally by internet service providers. This is a particularly sensitive issue for Netflix , which takes up more web traffic than any other company but owns none of the pipes that bring it into homes.\nNetflix has repeatedly highlighted this issue in its earnings reports. In a recent one, the company said, \"We support strong net neutrality across the globe, allowing all consumers to enjoy the Internet access they pay for, without ISPs blocking, throttling, or influencing content in the last mile or at interconnection points.\"\nNetflix had been mostly pleased with progress on the issue under the Obama administration, but Trump's selections, who come directly from the telecom industry, threaten to undo that. The two men, Jeff Eisenach and Mark Jamison, have previously spoken against net neutrality standards, each having served as a lobbyist for the telecom industry -- Eisenach once called it a form of \"crony capitalism.\"\nWhere net neutrality stands today Though net neutrality is a global issue, the U.S remains by far Netflix's biggest market, accounting for more than half of its subscriber base. Obama's Federal Communications Commission Chairman, Tom Wheeler, has been seen as proactive against monopolistic abuses among cable companies and telecoms, creating net neutrality standards and breaking up the set-top box monopoly that has inflated prices for cable boxes.\nIn February of 2015, the commission issued a set of rules to \"preserve the internet as a platform for innovation, free expression, and economic growth.

Between local taxes and the end of net neutrality, Netflix could soon become more expensive for the average American. Expect CEO Reed Hasting to address this issue in the next earnings report, if not sooner, as Netflix has long been one of the biggest proponents of net neutrality.\nRead the original article on The Motley Fool .

      "text": "Luke Cage is getting a second season from Marvel and Netflix 2016-12-05T21:30:05Z \nBy Alexander Zalben, \nMarvel and Netflix's superhero show Luke Cage reportedly broke the internet when it launched back in September. And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again: as just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime. \nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements... A short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season; and the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 \nWhat's most interesting about the teaser to fans is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke ( Mike Colter ) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders , which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil ( Charlie Cox ), Iron Fist ( Finn Jones ), and Jessica Jones ( Krysten Ritter ), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next...",

      "text": "Owen Kolasinski/BFA/REX/Shutterstock December 5, 2016 | 02:05PM PT \n“Looking” star Raúl Castillo has joined the cast of Netflix’s “Atypical,” Variety has learned exclusively. \n“ Atypical ” is a dark comedy centering an 18-year-old son (Keir Gilchrist) on the autism spectrum and his family: mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh, also a producer on the series), father (Michael Rapaport), and sister (Brigette Lundy-Paine). Castillo will recur in a long arc on the series as Nick, a handsome, free-spirited bartender who meets Leigh’s Elsa. \n“How I Met Your Mother” alum Robia Rashid created the family comedy, which was given a straight-to-series order at the streaming giant in October. Rashid will pen the series and serve as an executive producer with Mary Rohlich and Seth Gordon, who is set to direct the pilot. Related Netflix Greenlights ‘Atypical’ Autism Family Comedy Starring Jennifer Jason Leigh \nCastillo’s dance card is a little full of late: In addition to “Atypical,” he’ll also appear alongside Regina King in Netflix’s “Seven Seconds” (helmed by Veena Sud), is filming a recurring role on The CW’s “Archie” adaptation “Riverdale,” and is in production on the feature adaptation of Justin Torres novel “We the Animals.” \nCastillo, best known as the singularly charming Richie on “Looking,” also recently appeared in Joe Swanberg’s Netflix series “Easy.” He is repped by CAA.

      "text": "Netflix becomes the Top Grossing iPhone app for the first time Posted OpenAI’s Universe is the fun parent every artificial intelligence deserves \nNetflix’s decision to introduce an in-app subscription option in its iOS app over a year ago has helped the streaming service steadily gain more subscribers, and surge up the Top Grossing charts in the Apple App Store. Back in November of last year, the app hit the Top Grossing chart for the first time, reaching the #9 position. Today, Netflix has reached another milestone, as the app has earned the #1 Top Grossing spot on the U.S. iPhone App Store. \nIts bump up to the top spot was spotted by app intelligence firm Sensor Tower , which has been following its climb since the introduction of in-app subscriptions last fall. Between then and today, Netflix has grown its weekly net revenue from under $50,000 to nearly $2.9 million, its report says. \nThe app has come close to snagging the #1 spot on Top Grossing chart before, Sensor Tower notes. The closest it got was on November 14th, 2016, when it ended the day at the #2 position. For what it’s worth, rival app intelligence firm App Annie didn’t record that brief fling with #2, and only credits Netflix with having achieved the #3 Top Grossing spot in the U.S. on November 8th, 2016. \nThe discrepancies come down to how the firms measure and record app data, but regardless, neither had recorded the app as ever having earned the number one spot in the U.S., previously. \nThe milestone is significant for Netflix, as it indicates the company’s success at continuing to grow its U.S. subscriber base, despite earlier concerns that the U.S. market was nearing saturation. As indicated by Netflix’s Q3 earnings, the company appears to be shaking off its weak U.S. subscriber growth – something that’s been attributed to the appeal of its growing library of original content. \nIn addition to revivals that tap into viewer nostalgia, like “Fuller House” and “Gilmore Girls” – the number #1 and #3 most popular original shows, according to a research firm – Netflix has original series that appeal to a variety of viewers. \nThere’s its well-received political drama “House of Cards,” sci-fi series “Stranger Things,” comedy like “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” and “Orange is the New Black,” drug czar docu-drama “Narcos,” and Marvel comic book far like “Daredevil,” “Jessica Jones,” and “Luke Cage,” among others. \nThe advantage of being a streaming service is that Netflix’s shows don’t have to each receive blockbuster ratings on their own, as compared with what’s required in network television to keep a series on the air. Instead, they have the power to reach niche audiences, that, when combined, can boost the company’s bottom line. \nNetflix aims to continue to bolster its library with more originals that will bring in new subscribers – more than doubling the number of hours of original programming in 2017 compared with this year. The company today announced its plans to delve into unscripted series as well, with around 20 more shows in this category launching next year. \nWhile today represents the first time Netflix has scored the top grossing position in the U.S., the iPhone app has already earned this honor in other markets. It’s also now the No. 1 grossing app on iPhone in India, Mexico and Columbia. 0",

      "text": "Use keywords to search content on this website Search Use keywords to search content on this website Netflix believes you’ll watch the same amount of movies regardless of the perceived quality of the library December 6, 2016 9:26am Nick Whigham Netflix has addressed why its movie library is often perceived in some markets to be so mediocre. NETFLIX has addressed why its movie library is often deemed to be so mediocre, and the reason is because the company just doesn’t think it matters. \nSpeaking at the UBS Global Media and Communications conference in New York this week, the company’s head of content Ted Sarandos explained why the streaming giant isn’t that fussed about filling its platform full of top-notch flicks. Apparently, customers just don’t care that much. \nAccording to the Netflix exec, subscribers spend about the same time watching movies on the service regardless of the depth or perceived quality of the movie library. \n“No matter what, we end up with about one-third of our watching being movies,” he told the audience. \nAccording to Business Insider , Mr Sarandos cited two contrasting examples of the United States and Canada as proof of such behaviour. \nIn Canada Netflix has five major deals with movie studios to use their content while in the US the company basically has none, with the exception of the recently signed Disney deal. Despite US subscribers having far less access to movies from big studios, both countries spend roughly the same proportion of their time on the service watching movies. \nNetflix believes that by the time many blockbuster movies make it onto the platform — many months after being released in the cinema — a majority of fans have already seen them. \n“If you were passionate (about a movie), you’ve already seen it,” he said. \nWhile he added that Netflix is definitely “happy to have” those sorts of blockbuster movies, having all the big hits won’t necessarily increase participation on the service. \nTherefore it makes sense why Netflix isn’t necessarily keen to spend big on movie deals, and why many of its movie catalogues have shrunk over the past two years with numerous top-rated films disappearing . \nNetflix has been credited with taking binge watching to the next level and much of that has been to do with its focus on original series. \nThe company has poured billions of dollars into original programming in recent years. In 2016 it pledged $US5 billion ($A6.49 billion) for producing original content and earmarked another $US6 billion ($A7.78 billion) for the same purpose in 2017. \nA vast majority of that has gone into creating originals TV series such as House of Cards, The Crown, Barry, Narcos , The Get Down and Stranger Things . \nDuring the New York conference, Mr Sarandos also spoke of Netflix’s intention to significantly boost its non-scripted offerings by releasing 20 unscripted series next year, referring to the genre as “a very interesting business.” \nHe believes the company’s strong suit when it comes to the genre is its ability to syndicate its shows worldwide. \n“The content itself seems to be largely interchangeable. Meaning, if you want to see a show about hoarding, there are three different shows about hoarding,” he said. More Local News",

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nLOS ANGELES—Netflix currently has 30 original scripted series in various stages of development or release, and in 2017 it's going to go big on unscripted shows, according to chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \nIn 2017, Netflix plans to debut 20 unscripted shows, including global competition series, \"Ultimate Beastmaster,\" produced by Sylvester Stallone and \"The Biggest Loser\" EP Dave Broome. \nNext year Netflix's original programming lineup will grow to up to 1,000 hours, more than doubling from 2016, and \"that's a conservative measure right now,\" said Sarandos, speaking Monday at the UBS Global Media & Communications Conference in New York. \n\"Unscripted television is a very interesting business,\" Sarandos said, saying the company is focusing on shows that are \"more likely to travel internationally.\" For example, \"Ultimate Beastmaster\" will feature athletes and announcers from six different countries (the U.S., Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Germany and Japan). \"When 'Beastmaster' hits in Korea, they'll never have seen anything like it.\" \nSarandos reiterated Netflix's previous guidance that the company plans to spend about $6 billion in 2017 on content on a profit-and-loss basis, up from $5 billion in 2016. With the boost in production on originals, that will take up a bigger chunk of the overall content budget, and Netflix execs have said they're aiming to have 50% of the content on its service to be originals. \nSarandos called supernatural thriller \"Stranger Things\" a milestone for the company, because it was the first original series developed in-house and produced by Netflix. The show's creators, the Duffer Brothers, pitched the show 19 times before they took it to Netflix, according to Sarandos. \"I knew it was something special,\" he said about \"Stranger Things,\" although he acknowledged that he was surprised by the level of social-media engagement the show has created. Netflix is now in production on season 2 of the show. \nHowever, Sarandos added, \"I don't want to get trapped in that model\" of producing every original series or film in-house. He cited the Netflix reboot of \"Gilmore Girls,\" which was licensed from Warner Bros. \"Warner Bros. owned the IP. There was no model I could do that myself. We had a unique ability to do it,\" Sarandos said. \nBig TV bets that Netflix has made include \"The Crown,\" the show about the young Queen Elizabeth II and the British royal family. In January, the company will premiere \"Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events,\" based on the book franchise and starring Neal Patrick Harris. \"If this was a movie, it would be a big movie,\" Sarandos said. In addition, he called out shows Netflix has greenlit to date including \"Santa Clarita Diet,\" starring Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant, new series from David Fincher, \"Mind Hunter,\" about the early days of serial-killer profiling in FBI. \n\"What we try to do is take very measured swings for the fences, if that's possible,\" he said. \nAsked about whether Netflix would ever be interested in acquiring sports rights, Sarandos—as he has repeatedly in the past—said the company is not a great vehicle for live programming. \"Today, don't look for us to be bidding for league rights,\" he said, but added that \"league creation might be interesting.\"",

      "text": "The latest Android Nougat update brings a piece of Pixel to Nexus phones Posted Netflix becomes the Top Grossing iPhone app for the first time \nAndroid 7.1.1 starts going live today as an over-the-air update – a roll out that will continue through the next several weeks to a select number of Google approved devices, including the Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus Player, Pixel C and General Mobile 4G (Android One), along with devices enrolled in Google’s Android Beta Program. \nThose devices will mostly be playing catch up with the company’s last flagship, the Pixel, which got a bit of a head start when it launched with 7.1. It’s not exactly a major upgrade, but should help curb users who have been suffering from a little bit of Pixel-based jealousy. \nThe of updates includes a more inclusive set of emojis, with male/female counterparts for those emojis that were initially just limited to one – include female welders and men getting haircuts. Because it’s 2016 and anyone can get haircuts and weld stuff, thank you very much. Other message-based additions include the ability to send GIFs from the keyboard of apps like Allo, Messenger and Hangouts. \nApp shortcuts have been added to the home screen in this latest version, as well, launching favorites with a long press of the corresponding icon. 0 ",

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nLOS ANGELES—Netflix currently has 30 original scripted series in various stages of development or release, and in 2017 it's going to go big on unscripted shows, according to chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \nIn 2017, Netflix plans to debut 20 unscripted shows, including global competition series, \"Ultimate Beastmaster,\" produced by Sylvester Stallone and \"The Biggest Loser\" EP Dave Broome. \nNext year Netflix's original programming lineup will grow to up to 1,000 hours, more than doubling from 2016, and \"that's a conservative measure right now,\" said Sarandos, speaking Monday at the UBS Global Media & Communications Conference in New York. \n\"Unscripted television is a very interesting business,\" Sarandos said, saying the company is focusing on shows that are \"more likely to travel internationally.\" For example, \"Ultimate Beastmaster\" will feature athletes and announcers from six different countries (the U.S., Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Germany and Japan). \"When 'Beastmaster' hits in Korea, they'll never have seen anything like it.\" \nSarandos reiterated Netflix's previous guidance that the company plans to spend about $6 billion in 2017 on content on a profit-and-loss basis, up from $5 billion in 2016. With the boost in production on originals, that will take up a bigger chunk of the overall content budget, and Netflix execs have said they're aiming to have 50% of the content on its service to be originals. \nSarandos called supernatural thriller \"Stranger Things\" a milestone for the company, because it was the first original series developed in-house and produced by Netflix. The show's creators, the Duffer Brothers, pitched the show 19 times before they took it to Netflix, according to Sarandos. \"I knew it was something special,\" he said about \"Stranger Things,\" although he acknowledged that he was surprised by the level of social-media engagement the show has created. Netflix is now in production on season 2 of the show. \nHowever, Sarandos added, \"I don't want to get trapped in that model\" of producing every original series or film in-house. He cited the Netflix reboot of \"Gilmore Girls,\" which was licensed from Warner Bros. \"Warner Bros. owned the IP. There was no model I could do that myself. We had a unique ability to do it,\" Sarandos said. \nBig TV bets that Netflix has made include \"The Crown,\" the show about the young Queen Elizabeth II and the British royal family. In January, the company will premiere \"Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events,\" based on the book franchise and starring Neal Patrick Harris. \"If this was a movie, it would be a big movie,\" Sarandos said. In addition, he called out shows Netflix has greenlit to date including \"Santa Clarita Diet,\" starring Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant, new series from David Fincher, \"Mind Hunter,\" about the early days of serial-killer profiling in FBI. \n\"What we try to do is take very measured swings for the fences, if that's possible,\" he said. \nAsked about whether Netflix would ever be interested in acquiring sports rights, Sarandos—as he has repeatedly in the past—said the company is not a great vehicle for live programming. \"Today, don't look for us to be bidding for league rights,\" he said, but added that \"league creation might be interesting.\"",

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access Published: Sunday | December 4, 2016 | 12:00 AM Video \nNetflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com , has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the US and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including Orange Is The New Black , House of Cards , and Stranger Things , are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include Spotlight , this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. SPOTTY CONNECTIONS \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when travelling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the US. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage - access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.",

      "text": "Meet Pacific Heat , Netflix’s Latest Animated Series by Keisha Hatchett | 5:22 pm, December 5th, 2016 \nNetflix isn’t just about your favorite Marvel dramas Jessica Jones , Daredevil and Luke Cage or sci-fi hits like Sense8 and Stranger Things . The streaming site also features some great animated originals like BoJack Horseman , and now their library is getting another boost with the new series Pacific Heat . Set in Australia’s Gold Coast—a glitzy, sun-drenched paradise for tourists—the series offers up a satirical take on your run-of-the-mill cop shows. \nIt centers on a covert group of highly trained operatives who are sent in to investigate the flourishing crime scene fostered by everyone from “drug smugglers and biker gangs to eco-terrorists and the person who invented frozen yogurt.” The series was created by Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner and Rob Sitch from the animation company Working Dog. \nIn honor of the show’s debut, we spoke to Sitch about why he wanted to co-create the show, as well as how many women are involved. \nTMS (Keisha): What made you want to do this show? Rob Sitch: Sending up dramatic cliches have always made us laugh. Most comedians are observers and we do it to amuse ourselves but occasionally you feel the need to point out just how silly it’s got. The self importance of imaginary crime fighting has got very silly. \nTMS: What are you most excited for people to see? RS: I think we give too much respect to “authorities”. It’s fun to point out that they’re just as big idiots as the rest of us. \nTMS: Because this takes place in Australia, how integral will that location be to the part of the show? Will there be special nods for Aussies? RS: Our greatest influence for this series as American Cop dramas. We grew up on them. In fact we’re old enough to have seen Hawaii Five 0 and Charlie’s Angels in different centuries! It’s more the genre than the nationality. \nTMS: What is your favorite thing about this crop of characters? RS: I like villains. The western world tends to rotate its villains. Russian to Middle Eastern to Chinese to South Americans and so forth. Evil Geniuses rarely come out of the Mid West! \nTMS: Are there a lot of women involved behind the scenes? If not, are you hoping there will be more in the future? RS: Our producer, Deb Herman, has overseen everything we’ve done for 20 years. We recently did a TV production where every department head was female. It wasn’t by design and it didn’t occur to me until I was writing thank you cards! \nTMS: Was it straightforward to do animation? RS: No!! Most people have the vague impression that you can buy it off the shelf. It’s surprising with all th ecomputer power that there isn’t an app! Amination still has to be hand made to fit the writing. \n———- \nPacific Heat is now available to stream on Netflix. \n(image via screencap) \nWant more stories like this?

      "text": "By Kevin Fitzpatrick December 5, 2016 2:42 PM | ScreenCrush Netflix \nNetflix boss Ted Sarandos set an impressive goal for 2016, upping its number of original series from 16 to 30 , but who wants to get complacent? The streaming service wants to do it again in 2017, doubling its already-doubled original series count with a heavy push into unscripted fare. \nPer Variety , next year will see Netflix debuting an additional 20 unscripted series, among the the Sylvester Stallone -produced competition series Ultimate Beastmaster . Chief content officer Sarandos also confirmed from the UBS Global Media & Communications Conference in New York that the original programming lineup will double in 2017 to around 1,000 hours of content. \nNetflix will spend around $6 billion in 2017 on original, up from $5 billion the previous year, with a goal that 50% of the content on the service will represent original programming. Last year, Sarandos claimed that the volume of original programming had increased in the wake of other networks’ reticence to license Netflix their own shows, given that the service became a competitor in the original content space. \nAmong the new scripted series scheduled to debut in 2017, there’s Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events , Jason Momoa ’s Frontier , Santa Clarita Diet , Marvel’s Iron Fist , Jason Bateman ’s Ozark , Mindhunter , Dear White People , The Defenders , Gypsy , and more. Meanwhile, The ten-episode Ultimate Beastmaster will feature 108 competitors from the U.S., Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Germany, and Japan tackling “The Beast” obstacle course, with each episode highlighting 12 challengers from the different countries (in six teams). \nWe might be writing up Sarandos’ intent to double the original series number again in 2017, but which of the coming series should get us most excited to stream, on or offline ?",

      "text": "Netflix will double the amount of original series in 2017, including 20 reality TV shows Netflix wants to dominate the global market share Netflix Netflix’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, announced today that the streaming service was looking to double the amount of original series available to subscribers in 2017. Sarandos made the comments during a conference in New York City on Monday, as reported by Variety , telling those gathered that Netflix aimed to have 1,000 hours of original content by the end of next year. Sarandos added that aiming for 1,000 was relatively conservative. Netflix currently has 30 original series either in development or available to stream right now, and Sarandos said the company is looking into expanding its unscripted or reality TV selection. The network has ordered a new series from Rocky actor Sylvester Stallone and the executive producer of NBC’s The Biggest Loser , Dave Broome. Sarandos said Netflix saw unscripted television as a way to broaden its global audience including in territories like South Korea. In order to ensure that the company is able to deliver on its promise of more original content than ever before, Sarandos said that Netflix had every intention to invest the $6 billion in its TV series and films that it confirmed it was willing to spend earlier this year. The company is set to spend quite a bit of its budget on creating and acquiring original series, with the goal to make at least half of the shows and films available to subscribers be Netflix originals. Sarandos added that Stranger Things marks the first series that was created and produced in-house at Netflix, but the company wasn’t looking to make multiple series through its in-house studio. Instead, like with the recent Gilmore Girls revival, the company was also looking to purchase the rights to series and have other studios produce for them, with Netflix essentially being the distributor. Next year, Netflix will release The Defenders, The Punisher, Iron Fist, Stranger Things’ second season, and a slate of other shows. The company is also planning to bring a few of its original films to the Sundance Film Festival in January. More From Polygon",

      "text": "by Katie Roberts \nAfter doubling down on its offering of original programming , Netflix will also be doubling down on \" Luke Cage ,\" too: The streaming service has renewed the Marvel series for a second season. \nThe news was announced on the show's social media accounts on Sunday, with a short video focusing on Pop's Barber Shop (a key setting in season one), and a neon sign in the window that says \"Season 2: Coming soon.\" The announcement also included Pop's motto, \"Always forward,\" an important mantra for the titular hero (played by Mike Colter ) throughout the show's inaugural season. — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 \nIt should come as no surprise that Netflix would want to stay in the \"Luke Cage\" business, considering the show's critical acclaim and warm reception from fans. The series was so in-demand during its debut weekend back in October that it temporarily crashed the streaming service . \nThe renewal also means that there will be more adventures in the Marvel deal that the comics powerhouse struck with Netflix, which will culminate in the \"Defenders\" team-up series featuring characters from \" Daredevil ,\" \" Jessica Jones ,\" \"Luke Cage,\" and \" Iron Fist .\" The latter series is set to debut sometime in early 2017. \nNo word yet on when fans can expect season two of \"Luke Cage.\" Stay tuned.",

Following the massive success of their original programming like The Crown , Orange Is The New Black , and Stranger Things the online streaming platform is ready to venture into reality TV. According to the Hollywood Reporter , the entertainment giant is committing a whopping $6 billion to new programming in 2017. They are producing more than 1,000 hours of contact (that’s more content than all episodes of Keeping Up With The Kardashians combined) and 20 unscripted shows next year.With this much money and so many opportunities, the possibilities are truly endless. Netflix is clearly prepared to win TV. But if the company is struggling for ideas, we might be able to help. Here are a few of our suggestions for some good ol’ reality TV. Begin Slideshow",

      "title": "12 things to watch on Netflix instead of the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show",
      "text": "Lisa Marie Basile December 05, 2016 \nLet’s be honest, the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show peaked in the 90s and early aughts with supermodels like Gisele Bundchen, Naomi Campbell, and Tyra Banks. Today, it’s a spectacle that doesn’t really represent the changing landscape of fashion. \nSo, if you’re like me, you probably won’t be watching it, which means you’re free to watch something on that long Netflix list of yours. Or, you can watch one of my recommendations below. The only catch? I didn’t include any holiday movies, since you’re probably looking for something that hasn’t been on repeat every single day since the moment Thanksgiving ended. \nNetflix has a lot of good stuff happening this month. Here’s everything you should check out if you aren't planning on watching people walk around in their underwear. 1. The Crown Credit: Netflix \nJust go ahead and get ready to binge-watch this fantastically well-done series. A must-see for Anglophiles or enthusiasts of The Monarchy, this series humanizes the royal family’s members and their famous rites and rituals. It’s not embellished in silly ways; it simply documents what happens as Queen Elizabeth II ascends the throne. And it does so in a way that makes you want to buy a crazy hat and move to England. 2. I Am The Pretty Thing That Lives In The House Credit: Netflix \nTurn down all the lights, quiet your phone and prepare to be made very uncomfortable by this slow-moving, atmospheric story of death’s dark touch. If you like ghosts stories, this is it. A word of warning for the skeptics: Don’t be fooled by the fact that it only has one star. This chilling film is gorgeously shot, the performances are haunting, and its take on the gothic genre is in fine form. 3. Black Mirror Credit: Endemol UK \nIf you ever worry that social media has started controlling our lives, or if you ever think that the government is keeping some serious secrets from the people, this show is for you. This brilliant show explores how humanity, through its innovation and uber-connectivity, taps into grave darkness. It’s almost too close for comfort. 4. A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night Credit: VICE Films \nIf you prefer your cinema feminist, Western-inspired, and noir, this chilling award-winning film has those elements in spades. Not sure how that would look? Trust the hundreds of rave reviews out there that call this inventive Iranian vampire film a masterpiece. If you’re going to be watching Netflix, watch its very best. This is definitely that. 5. Atonement Credit: Focus Features \nThis gorgeously-shot, riveting film—which earned wins and nominations for both the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards—is essential viewing for anyone with a distinct taste for British dramas. Just a warning: you will cry, and then you’ll probably begin your “British period piece” phase, much to the chagrin of anyone who lives in the same house as you. Cheers! 6. The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe Credit: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures \nIt’s December, which is a great month to nurture your sense of fantasy and exploration. Already watched all the Harry Potter films? Don’t worry. The Chronicles of Narnia (which you may have read a decade ago) offers the same sense of excitement and suspense. So, stay in, make some hot cocoa and pretend that a piece of furniture is, in fact, a portal to fantastic lands. Can Victoria’s Secret do that? Nope. They’ve just got a closet full of undies. 7. Stranger Things Credit: Netflix \nAll your friends watched it. Facebook raved about it. Your brother begged you to try it. Well, what are you waiting for? Worried you’ll lose cool points for liking something popular? It’s December, and we’re well beyond that point. If you can make it through episode one, I promise it’ll pay off. It’s weird, smart and clever. 8. Glitch Credit: Netflix \nAre you in search of the next Lost? So am I. Every single day. Disappointedly, Glitch isn’t quite that, but it’s close enough. A group of complete strangers come back to life in a small town—without knowing why or how. Together, they’re all linked and they have to figure out why they’re there. While you’re not watching the world’s most famous supermodels wear expensive, mismatched outfits, this ought to be your next binge-watch. 9. Nanny McPhee Credit: Universal Pictures \nNanny McPhee is one of those adorable, oh-so-gooey movies that you can always rely on. The film is family-friendly, there’s an adorable baby in it and it’s filled with quirky British humor. Let loose, have a laugh. 10. Fantasia Credit: Walt Disney Productions \nProbably one of the best animated films of all time, Fantasia is the perfect family movie. It’s visually stunning, engaging and completely enchanting. Not to mention, the music is exquisite. Oh, and Netflix is also offering up Fantasia 2000, which includes the original Sorcerer’s Apprentice as well as seven newer shorts. Perfect for a chilly December night. 11. African American Credit: Showtime Networks \nWith everyone watching the post-election landscape very closely, it’s nice to know that Trevor Noah is bringing some humor to the insanity. You probably know him from The Daily Show, but in this comedy special, he’s bringing his talent to the stage. If you’re burned out on holiday movies, this is definitely a great watch for some laughs and cultural truths. 12. Paddington Credit: StudioCanal \nWhat do you get when you mix a talking stuffed animal with an adorable British family? A film that will turn you to goo almost immediately. Kids will love it and adults will dig its quirky feel-good vibe. It’s about a silly talking bear with a floppy hat.

      "text": "Netflix's (NFLX) Management at UBS 44th Annual Global Media and Communications Conference Transcript Dec. 5.16 UBS 44th Annual Global Media and Communications Conference Call December 5, 2016 12:15 AM ET Executive Ted Sarandos - Chief Content Officer Analyst Question-and-Answer Session Q - Unidentified Analyst Hi everybody. I think it’s notable just of the start as we sort of talk about 2016. And you’re at the point where you’re putting up videos like that, right. I mean things have really changed over the last couple of years. Ted Sarandos And there’s enough to fill a reel now. Unidentified Analyst You can actually fill a reel. So, the pace here’s going by next year, you’re not going have anytime to talk because the reel is going to be so long, right. Ted Sarandos We have 30 original scripted series now in different stages of production, which is a doubling on last year, which is a doubling on the year before. Unidentified Analyst And it continues. Why don’t we talk about 2016 at first? And since it’s winding down and so we’ll start with at this conference. What were the important dynamics from your perspective? What was better or worse than expected? Ted Sarandos Well like I said, we were able to wrap our original production and original spend on a pretty dramatic basis, and manage through the scale and the volume of that. And across the big variety of programing, so comedies, dramas, kid shows, documentaries, then in comedy specials, and maintain a really excellent level of quality. So in that doubling a lot of things could have done poorly, but instead we doubled our presence at the things like the Emmy Awards both in nominations and wins, Time Magazine gave three Net Flicks episodes, the Best 10 Episodes of Television of the Year. Of all there must be 4,000 plus episodes of television and the top number one was an episode of BoJack Horseman, then an episode of Black Mirror, an episode of Orange Is The New Black, and certainly from a consumer receptiveness standpoint. So they are loving the content even in higher and higher volumes. And probably a big milestone for us was launching Stranger Things, which was a Netflix Studio title that was developed inside of Netflix and produced by Netflix entirely, and then kind of the international success we’ve seen with two projects like The Crown. Late in the year just last week, we launched a show called the 3%, which is a Portuguese language, Brazilian sci-fi series that people are watching in enormous numbers all over the world. And I don’t think there’s ever been any history of Portuguese language, Brazilian television being watched anywhere outside of Brazil and Portugal. So we’re really excited about. Unidentified Analyst Do you know Stranger Things was going to be a big hit? Ted Sarandos I knew it was something special. The pitch and the Duffer Brothers who created this show, they said they pitched it 19 times before they came to Netflix. And the pitch was great and they had never really done anything expect for a small movie and a couple of episodes of a show called Wayward Pines. So there wasn’t a lot to go in terms of their track record. But this movie they made for Warner Brothers never really got released. We took a look at it and said, look that vision against that execution this is worth taking a flyer with. And as the episodes were coming in, the one thing that was unique about Stranger Things was everyone in the office who access to them was chopping a bit for the next episodes to come. And that was really - I mean across from the admins all the way up to the most senior creative executives. So we knew that it was going to be a broad appeal show. I was surprised at the level of social media engagement and excitement that the show created and continues to create and now we’re production on season two right now. Unidentified Analyst And The Crown is something you’ve highlighted in the Wall Street. I think partly because may be the Wall Street was further right demo for it. But how is that performing? Ted Sarandos Really great, and exactly how we’d hoped, which is that Queen Elizabeth is probably the most famous human being on the planet right now, living human being known around the world and people who know the history of her or don’t and just know the history of the monarchies around the world are really fascinated by this family and the story. And I think the show really works because it is a story of a family. If it was just about history and cold events, I don’t think it would have gone over the way it has. But I think people have really been taken with Claire Foy as the Queen. Her performance, the way that she’s really put flesh on the bone of Queen Elizabeth as a woman, a mother or a daughter and how she wrestles with the things that people would wrestle with every day. So oddly she is relatable. Unidentified Analyst Right. Certainly it’s a beautiful looking show. Ted Sarandos Peter Morgan wrote every word of every script, which is very unusual for US television to have big writers room. Peter obviously has an incredible track record writing some of the greatest movies ever. But he really knows this world inside and out, and he is an incredible writer and really has given a meticulous tone to the details of the show. Now some of them are very well known factual data points in terms of how you tell the story. But a lot of those conversations, you have that kind of a unique privy to people who lived around the royals to know those conversations and they are based on all that. So instead of having a big room full of writers, he has a big research room, and he turns those in to words. And John Lithgow’s performance as Winston Churchill and nobody expected a six foot plus guy like John Lithgow to be able to pull off Churchill like that, but he sure did. Unidentified Analyst So when you think about 2017, what do you think the original concept of play looks like and will it take any quantification in addition to qualification? Ted Sarandos Well we said we’re going to grow out to a 1000 hours. I think that’s a conservative measure as of right now. You see we’re another doubling of our series output and very high profit shows. In January we’re releasing Lemony Snicket in The Unfortunate Series Of Events, which is also produced in Netflix Studio from a right sale that we purchased from the book series, and are doing are great series based on with Neil Patrick Harris in lead, and it’s this is the kind of - and if it was a movie, it’d be a big movie. One of those kinds of projects. We’re in various stages of production on some shows like Santa Clarita Diet, where Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant. We have new series from David Fincher, Mindhunter that is the story of the early days of serial killer profiling in the FBI. So a big more ambitious slate of big ticket events, but also rolling out about 20 unscripted shows for the first time, including one of our more high profile shows called Ultimate Beastmaster which is global competition show executive producers by Sylvester Stallone and it will feature athletes and announcers from six different countries. So when the show appears in Korea, it will be in Korean with Korean appears and when it appears in Mexico it will be with Mexican announcers and Mexican contestants, and in US it will be purely American product. So it’s a new product for a model for us of simultaneous international co-production versus formatting, but we think we could successful in this space. Unidentified Analyst That’s strange. I think the one way you asked us to sort of judge you over time is, well if you continue to make a series that must have been successful and must have sort of hit all the IRI metrics. So when you start to look at the 30 originals that you’ve done this last year, are they mostly continuing? Ted Sarandos Yeah, I mean the hard thing for people to wrap their head around is when we produce these shows. And one of the reasons why we don’t want to talk about the ratings and the typical format we will talk about ratings is, they are on every show not designed for the same audience. Some of these shows are very expensive and very broad and meant for big broad audience and indeed attract tens of millions of people. Some of the other shows are smaller, really targeting for a couple of million to watch, and when they turn out and the show meets all the other milestones that we want that show to meet, it is successful. And in fact it is equally successful at 2 million or 30 million viewers, because of the economic investment that went in to it. And we’re trying to make sure that we have something for everyone in the house and we’re using the personalization tool to make sure that there’s time to reflect to your case. So we are doing a lot of - your show and your wife’s favorite are probably different and your kid’s favorite show is probably different. The fact that we can program to that all under one roof is something that makes us very unique and our ability to personalize the site is what makes internet television super unique. Unidentified Analyst So can you talk about building that up internally? The execution of scaling original (inaudible) was something we talked about last year. how do you do it, how do you do so many shows, its unprecedented and obviously Netflix feels like it’s on a roll on the content side, but doubling volume again off of 30 is still - have you fully built a studio with inside Netflix and now it’s just a question of putting everybody to work or is there actually still an ongoing scale and it is taking place? Ted Sarandos It still continues. I mean the one thing that makes us a bit different than the other network studios is that typically, probably most of the folks will be if they’re talking are, they primarily make content for themselves and license a few shows. Their business models come kind of dependent on them producing and owning all their own content. For us, what I don’t want to do is get trapped in that model of only producing content that we can own outright, because sometimes someone owns great IP and we have to figure out the right business models of how to bring great IP to our subscribers. So Gilmore Girls is a project I’m thrilled that we did. People love it all over the world, but Warner Brothers own the IP. So there was no model where I could have made it myself. And I think it’s the reason why nobody else did it. And we had a kind of unique ability to bring that to consumers and they love it. And mothers and daughters watch that show together and I know people talk about this as a really unique American show. I ran it for seven years on the CW and kind of disappeared from the culture, so we thought. But DVD and Netflix and piracy in some places in the world really kept that show alive all this time and then we come back 10 years later with the new shows and people flipped out for it. The online searches of Wikipedia and Google for Gilmore Girls are 40% not in English. So it’s a very global experience. Unidentified Analyst And you know I’m financial analyst I’ve to think about margins every now and then. Have you scaled the studio up enough that as the cost of growing that starts to blend in or is that something that we should think is still farther on the future? Ted Sarandos No, mostly it’s baked in to content cost today and our infrastructure. There’s not that much infrastructure cost around it, its people cost around managing right to managing the physical production than we otherwise are shopping out to folks with production deals with Netflix versus us building studio space out and all those kinds of things. As an example, I think most physical production for content is very, very rentable and very, very competitive. So there’s no need for us to go and build it, but build the infrastructure. Like in our current facilities that we’re moving to in LA in January, we’re situated on a studio back lot, where we have access to all the stages. But I don’t want to operate a lumber mill to do that. So we have the ability to take advantage of their back bone or their infrastructure to produce all of our content. Unidentified Analyst So there are two areas of content that I wanted to touch on that is certainly related. The first is, seems to be an increasing focus on sort of premium content. I think The Crown for you, Westworld for HBO, Grand Tour for Amazon. As I think how many tables take now or audiences, is fragmentation so great that audiences really need something big to capture their attention? Ted Sarandos It’s possible. How do you rise above the clutter and there’s a lot of clutter. And what’s been defined as clutter is getting bigger and bigger. So I think that there’s some temptation for that I’m sure. But there’s equal excitement around the world for something on the scale of The Crown or The Get Down, as there is for something like the Gilmore Girls or Fuller House, where people just want content that they love. I think people try to hedge their bets a little bit by going, swinging for the fences every time. What we try to do is take really measured swings for the fences if that’s possible, which is with known creators with a great idea, in many cases with a great script. So in the case of The Crown, I think betting on Stephen Daldry and Peter Morgan to make a story about the royal family was a pretty proven bet. And the fact that we would do it on the scale that we are able to actually increased the odds of success versus raise the risk on that. So I think that that’s the kind of mentality around movies and television is that small stuff seams riskier in an odd way. And I think they probably have their own different flavors of risk. Unidentified Analyst So in addition to quality which now sort of pushes for everything that you do, there’s also sort of quantity. You mentioned doing 20 unscripted, like how big an opportunity do you see in the unscripted? Ted Sarandos I think you’ve had some discussion here about the space. I think that unscripted television is a very interesting business. The content itself appears to be largely interchangeable, meaning that if you want to watch a show about hoarding, there’s three different shows about hoarding that you can watch, and people watch it with seemingly equal passion when you swamp them out. And what we could do by producing our own is focus on the shows that are more likely to travel internationally because we have seen that from the thing that we licensed. We can do things that are slightly more elevated and more event-driven like we just talked about with Ultimate Beastmaster, where we’re able to take a format, but add something different to it by being able to bring the global scale and global production to it. By bringing people that you k now, sites you haven’t seen before. When Beastmaster hits in Korea and feels like local Korean television show, they’ve never seen anything like that in that country in terms of the scale of production. So that’s the kind of thing that we’re trying to do with our scripture. We have a factual show on the rise and fall of the Roman Empire that just started last month on Netflix, it’s been hugely successful for us. So that’s one of the first ones coming out of the 20 that are going. Unidentified Analyst I think we’re already trying to figure out, what genre is on the margin you could invest more in to drive more growth. And whether we think about that in United States, you’re doing fantastic and you’re an elite and you’ve got half the market but that means you don’t half the market, and then you sort of thing around that, you talk about programming globally and you think around the world sort of each market with a rule, a bit of a different dynamic. So are there genres in particular where you think you guys should be leaning in more aggressively to program to broaden the service? Ted Sarandos Well it depends, and there are different life cycles in all these different countries, right. So I think in the US where you’re trying to get things a little more mainstream and broad, but not at the expense of your core base. So we’re not doing any fewer crowns or mind hunters or shows like that, but we’re adding in to it. Shows that are a little more like the multi-camera sitcoms that are - and Les is going to be up here talking after me, he’ll talk to you about that business. It’s a great business, but man is it risky. Meaning it’s a - one in every couple of dozen will actually connect and there’s a lot of development cost that go in to making them. We’ve been very successful with Fuller House, we have a new one coming up with One Day At A Time, Chuck Lorre has been so hugely successful for CBS and Warner Brothers is making a new show for us called Disjointed that’s a four primary sitcom that is kind of perceived to be more mainstream television. But we are able to put a little bit more of an edge on it. If you see the Ranch one of our other multi-cams, but it doesn’t look or feel like a multi-cam but it’s shot in front of a live audience, its lit different, the patterns and the jokes different. It feels a lot more like a single - the things that people love about a single camera show but with the energy of a multi-cam. Unidentified Analyst Are the kid’s categories still growing for us on per home basis? Ted Sarandos Yeah, on a per home basis and the hours within each of those categories is growing. So kids are finding things on the real areas shows the second of Trollhunters. This is Guillermo Del Toro’s new animates series for us. A lot of the scale that we talked about in our re-scripted series, it’s actually that on steroids on the kids face. We’re near to 40 original shows now on the kids originals for Netflix, and again as we’ve kind of ramp them up, we just did yesterday the Emmy Awards where nominations came out and we had 11 different shows nominated for 18 Emmies. It was 34 day time Emmy nominations for our kid’s shows. So we went from nothing to really leading that market place in the last three years. Unidentified Analyst Any issues about the DreamWorks Animation being acquired by ComCast? Ted Sarandos I don’t think so. I think it actually gives them the opportunity to use some of that IP from Universal to make different shows. We’re growing our in-house production a lot more, so less and less depended on those deals. But we’ve had great success with that DreamWorks deal, and I think we’ll continue to. Unidentified Analyst At the risk again, the same answer we always get, but I still feel like I have to ask once again about sports and live programing. What would have to change in the market place for you to consider those types of programs? Ted Sarandos And at the risk of being repetitive, I think that to the extent that the liveness is the selling point, we’re not a great solution, right. So broadcasting cable is great for the live sports, meaning that the whole aliveness is the selling point. If things that are not as outcome oriented. Like this competition show during Beastmaster hits athletes on a course competing against one another. We’ll you’ve seeing in things like American Ninja Warrior, the repeat viewing is as high as the live viewing, even though people know who won, its knowable who won. But people come back and it’s about the story and the drama and the cinematic quality of the production, and less so about who won. And I think a live football game or a live baseball game is all about who won. So maybe I’m talking ahead of myself, because maybe a decade from now near live is different and people will be less focused on sports coverage changes. But from where I’m at today, don’t look to us to be bidding for the league rights. But there’s something that this might be educational for us in a way that heads us in to different alternative sports and league might be interesting. But getting in to an already very crowded and very competitive league bidding for NFL and HL and NBA, very unlikely. Unidentified Analyst The league bidding, that’s new twist. So now we’ve opened the pandora’s box and I like that. Ted Sarandos Every year I come just so we could keep that sports going. Unidentified Analyst What are the big thrust for you over the, sort of, year and a half you’ll correct me, you were scuffing worldwide rights. How do you feel like you’ve down with that initiative. Ted Sarandos So far so good. We’re orienting a bunch of sellers who are oriented around selling regionally around selling to Netflix globally. So we had our work cut out for us going in to it. We’re spending most of our licensing dollars now on global rights only. And we’ve seen we’ve been able to do global right deals in the first and second window with every major US network and most of the top cable channels as well to where we are either premiering a US show everywhere outside of the US like we are with Designated Survivor with the Shooter right now, with Expanse, shows that are premiering on US Networks and they are premiering on Netflix everywhere outside of the US. We’re doing it in reverse with movies that are or TV shows that are premiering in Canada and then on Netflix everywhere outside of Canada. So we are doing that in all different combinations all over the world right now and those are global deals, and those shows then we have in the country of origin a season after. In some cases it’s global, fully second season like with Fox on American Crime Story and (inaudible). Unidentified Analyst I think besides there’s always wondering whether my company is either trying to reinforce Pay-tv bundle or getting nervous about your growth globally will start to sell less to you. Any signs of that from your end? Ted Sarandos No, we’re following a path that we set out on a few years ago, which is to kind of move up the food chain in those productions. So be less likely to be an aftermarket buyer at many screening and more likely to be a co-production partner with the networks. Again when Les comes up in a few minutes, he can talk to you about the Star Trek series that he is premiering - they’re producing, they’re going to have the first one on CBS and then the show will air on all access in the US only and then it will premiere on Netflix everywhere else in the world. And our co-production dollars help make that a much bigger and better show for us and for CBS. Unidentified Analyst So mergers in the US AT&T-Time Warner foreign collaboration of course, potential for Les to have interest in Viacom we’ll see later. But obviously tectonic plates are shifting in media. Would you expect more M&A to take place in 2017 and would you expect any impact on Netflix from a consolidating sector? Ted Sarandos I don’t know about our impact to us, I could tell you that in a world where carriage fees are shrinking and ad rates are shrinking, consolidation would probably be a necessary outcome. Unidentified Analyst So even if there’s consolidation it’s hard to imagine too many of the big studious getting together. So maybe it doesn’t shift that much from your standpoint. Ted Sarandos Just being a lone cable operator, a lone general operator of one or a few of a handful of channels to leverage is probably just immense. Unidentified Analyst Why are we (inaudible) how would you articulate the film strategy at this point? Ted Sarandos In its early beginning the things we’ve released so far have been about two films from Adam Sandler and recently a film from Kevin James that are kind of comfort food comedy that people really lover all over the world. So we’ve been really happy with the results in terms of people watching. The Adam Sandler films they’ve premiered number one in every territory we operate everywhere in the world. Even in places where his movies haven’t opened theatrically. So we’re really thrilled with the reception of those films. What we’re trying to do is make the movies that people would go see, movies that you would go see in the theaters if that’s where they were on Friday night. I think the kind of first real test of that would be a movie that were in production right we’d call Bright, it Will Smith’s next movie. David Ayer is directing it, Joel Edgerton co-stars. So basically the cast and director of Suicide Squad between Suicide Squad 1 and 2, making this movie which is another franchise world building kind of film project that will premiere on Netflix, and that’s the kind of projects that we try to steer the model towards, which is the way we’ve been able to create television events, can we do that in the movie is best, and can those movies be subscription drivers and retention builders the way our [result] for television has. Unidentified Analyst Yes, it’s hard for us to figure out because obviously partly the lack of audience (inaudible) think about, some of the feedback we get from HBO and the other traditional premiums and they have huge movie viewing on linear or a little bit less on their sort of streaming services. But I think there’s a perception by some that you’re still a little bit light in terms of sort of volume of movie content on Netflix, don’t know if you agree with that or not? Ted Sarandos What’s interesting is no matter what we end up with about a third of our watching these movies. So in some places we have more pay one output deal coverage than HBO has here, places like Canada where we have five major studio output deals, and movie viewing is about a third of the watching and we have basically no major studio output deal here with the exception of Disney deal that just started and in the US it’s about 30% of the viewing. So I think that there is a behavior that people like to watch movies and like to watch TV in some combination. But sometimes they look for an old movie that they like, sometimes they’re looking for something exciting. What I’m trying to just say, how does Netflix satisfy their customer. So HBO’s output strategy say, you have a movie that’s big in the box office and 7 to 10 months later it’s on your service. If you were really passionate to watch that movie, you would have. You would have seen in in the theater, you would have bought the DVD, you would have downloaded on iTunes. And so really what you’re last word, there’s a kind of a more dispassionate audience and so that viewing is likely not to differentiate you from everybody else. It’s fine to have, I’m happy to have it, and I think the rare exception of that is Disney, because Disney makes big franchise films. The movies that people like to watch over and over again. But we see that as kids we were watching the animated features, we see what the families were watching, things like Jungle Book. But it just started for us that deal. So far we have Zootopia and Jungle Book and Finest Hour, and on Christmas Day we’ll launch Captain American - Civil War and in January, Finding Dory. So we’ll have their biggest film property on Netflix only, but it’s in that window where it’s not terribly exclusive, but it’s a great way for people to watch and enjoy those films. Unidentified Analyst Stars management said that those weren’t very strong performers for them --. Ted Sarandos I bet they weren’t. I bet you’re right because most of Pay-tv channels make very adult programing and they don’t differentiate. So the kids weren’t sitting around watching Spartacus waiting for cartoon to come on. I’ll see I hope. And there’s things that probably showed in HBO too where they really hadn’t programed very kid-friendly programing all day and they are very linear businesses. So for us it appear on-demand world, there are kids with their iPads that’s all they are watching as kids on Netflix. So we can distinguish that way by user and personalization and really have a big business around the kids viewing in a way that a linear television network that is adult at one time of the day and kids on another part of the day would be very difficult. Unidentified Analyst So, World 1.0 will be your first pay-one Star Wars film. Ted Sarandos",

      "title": "Netflix Becomes Top-Grossing iPhone App in the U.S.",
      "text": "Courtesy of Netflix December 5, 2016 | 04:33PM PT \nNetflix ’s iPhone app topped Apple ’s list of top-grossing apps for the first time Monday, surpassing not only mobile games like “Mobile Strike” and “Candy Crush Saga,” but also fellow subscription services like Spotify and Pandora. The news comes on the heels of Netflix adding mobile downloading capabilities to its iOS and Android apps . \nThe ascend in the top-grossing chart was fist noted by SensorTower, a company that tracks app performances across mobile app stores. “In addition to being the top app in the U.S., it also occupies the No. 1 grossing spot on iPhone in India, Mexico, and Colombia,” the company wrote in a blog post. \nNetflix’s app is free to download in the Apple App Store, but the company started to offer users the ability to pay for their monthly subscription fees via in-app subscription fees a little over a year ago . \nApple is charging publishers a 30 percent cut on any in-app fees, which has long been criticized by media services and game developers alike. In June, Apple announced that it was going to lower this fee to 15 percent for any user that stays subscribed for 12 months or longer. In addition, Apple is reportedly looking to lower its fees to 15 percent for any video app that joins its new programming guide for Apple TV. \nNetflix added the ability to download select programming to its mobile apps last week. To do so, the company tweaked its encoding schemes for mobile video , allowing users to download better-looking videos at equal or smaller file sizes.",

      "text": "'Looking' Star Raul Castillo Joins Netflix's 'Atypical' (EXCLUSIVE) Updated: December 5, 2016 — 5:05 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Oriana Schwindt \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - \"Looking\" star Raul Castillo has joined the cast of Netflix's \"Atypical,\" Variety has learned exclusively. \n\"Atypical\" is a dark comedy centering an 18-year-old son (Keir Gilchrist) on the autism spectrum and his family: mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh, also a producer on the series), father (Michael Rapaport), and sister (Brigette Lundy-Paine). Castillo will recur in a long arc on the series as Nick, a handsome, free-spirited bartender who meets Leigh's Elsa. \n\"How I Met Your Mother\" alum Robia Rashid created the family comedy, which was given a straight-to-series order at the streaming giant in October. Rashid will pen the series and serve as an executive producer with Mary Rohlich and Seth Gordon, who is set to direct the pilot. \nRelated Netflix Greenlights 'Atypical' Autism Family Comedy Starring Jennifer Jason Leigh \nCastillo's dance card is a little full of late: In addition to \"Atypical,\" he'll also appear alongside Regina King in Netflix's \"Seven Seconds\" (helmed by Veena Sud), is filming a recurring role on The CW's \"Archie\" adaptation \"Riverdale,\" and is in production on the feature adaptation of Justin Torres novel \"We the Animals.\" \nCastillo, best known as the singularly charming Richie on \"Looking,\" also recently appeared in Joe Swanberg's Netflix series \"Easy.\" He is repped by CAA.

      "text": "Netflix Has 30 Original Series Today, Will Double That in 2017, Content Chief Ted Sarandos Says Updated: December 5, 2016 — 5:24 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Todd Spangler \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Netflix currently has 30 original scripted series in various stages of development or release, and in 2017 it's going to go big on unscripted shows, according to chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \nIn 2017, Netflix plans to debut 20 unscripted shows, including global competition series, \"Ultimate Beastmaster,\" produced by Sylvester Stallone and \"The Biggest Loser\" EP Dave Broome. \nNext year Netflix's original programming lineup will grow to up to 1,000 hours, more than doubling from 2016, and \"that's a conservative measure right now,\" said Sarandos, speaking Monday at the UBS Global Media & Communications Conference in New York. \n\"Unscripted television is a very interesting business,\" Sarandos said, saying the company is focusing on shows that are \"more likely to travel internationally.\" For example, \"Ultimate Beastmaster\" will feature athletes and announcers from six different countries (the U.S., Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Germany and Japan). \"When 'Beastmaster' hits in Korea, they'll never have seen anything like it,\" he said. \nRelated Netflix's Ted Sarandos: Acquisition by Larger Media Company Would Hamstring Us \nSarandos reiterated Netflix's previous guidance that the company plans to spend about $6 billion in 2017 on content on a profit-and-loss basis, up from $5 billion in 2016. With the boost in production on originals, that will take up a bigger chunk of the overall content budget, and Netflix execs have said they're aiming to have originals represent 50% of the content on its service. \nSarandos called supernatural thriller \"Stranger Things\" a milestone for the company, because it was the first original series developed in-house and produced by Netflix. The show's creators, the Duffer Brothers, pitched the show 19 times before they took it to Netflix, according to the exec. \"I knew it was something special,\" he said about \"Stranger Things,\" although he acknowledged that he was surprised by the level of social-media engagement the show has created. Netflix is now in production on season 2 of the show. \nHowever, Sarandos added, \"I don't want to get trapped in that model\" of producing every original series or film in-house. He cited the Netflix reboot of \"Gilmore Girls,\" which was licensed from Warner Bros. \"Warner Bros. owned the IP. There was no model I could do that myself. We had a unique ability to do it,\" Sarandos said. He also cited Netflix's deal with CBS to stream \"Star Trek: Beyond\" everywhere outside the U.S., saying \"our coproduction dollars help make that a bigger and better show\" than CBS could make on its own. \nBig TV bets that Netflix has made include \"The Crown,\" the show about the young Queen Elizabeth II and the British royal family. In January, the company will premiere \"Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events,\" a series based on the book franchise and starring Neal Patrick Harris. \"If this was a movie, it would be a big movie,\" Sarandos said. In addition, he called out shows Netflix has greenlit to date including \"Santa Clarita Diet,\" starring Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant, new series from David Fincher, \"Mind Hunter,\" about the early days of serial-killer profiling in FBI. \n\"What we try to do is take very measured swings for the fences, if that's possible,\" he said. \nNetflix also is building up a stable of original movies. According to Sarandos, the comedies from Adam Sandler it has released so far (\"The Ridiculous 6\" and \"The Do-Over\") have been the No. 1 performing titles everywhere in the world. He also pointed to \"Bright,\" a cops-and-orcs action film starring Will Smith and Joel Edgerton and directed by David Ayer (\"Suicide Squad\"), as a potential franchise. \"That's the kind of project we're trying to steer the model toward -- the way we've created television events, can we do that in the movie space?\" said Sarandos. About one-third of Netflix's overall viewing is of movies, he said. \nAsked about whether Netflix would ever be interested in acquiring sports rights, Sarandos -- as he has said repeatedly in the past -- said the company is not a great vehicle for live programming. \"Today, don't look for us to be bidding for league rights,\" he said, but added that \"league creation might be interesting.\" \nSarandos also commented on the question of whether Netflix would benefit from being part of a larger media company, an allusion to rumors that Disney may be interested in making a multibillion-dollar play for the streamer. He responded that large conglomerates have inter-company conflicts that would \"make it difficult to stay as disciplined as we've been.\" \nPictured above: Netflix's original series \"Stranger Things\" Published: December 5, 2016 — 1:30 PM EST | Updated: December 5, 2016 — 5:24 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "7 hours ago Chris Ween : I agree with that. But it was way better than Jessica Jones...the most unlikeable heroine ever. JJ is supposed to be challenging and a little unlikable. She doesn't even like herself. It's a story about PTSD and paranoia, and just how damaged a person can be.Re-watch the first four or so episodes with this in mind: JJ was a mildly farked-up kid from a broken home, but not really \"bad\". Then a truly bad person came along and she ended up doing impossibly bad and irreversible things. Said person violated her and created an environment where literally anybody around her could be working to hurt her again. Her totally-biatchy, standoffish nature totally makes sense. Plus, as a viewer, (if you can summon a little empathy), you can see how she views literally every person she interacts with as a potential threat. It's a fantastic allegory for survivors of war, violence, sexual abuse, and so much more. ThatBillmanGuy : My only complaint about Claire (and most of the characters in Daredevil in general) is how hypocritical they are towards Matt, while everyone frigging loves Luke Cage for doing the same thing. But I'm sure part of that is the writers and the Catholic need for self loathing and persecution they write into the character. There's the guilt aspect, but there's also a more subtle bit about the differences between Matt and Luke. Luke is so massively overpowered compared to the street thugs that he has the luxury of hurting them \"just enough\".Matt is the scrappy underdog - in any sane scenario the blind guy would be an instant-loser. He fights from the position of win-or-die, and with a lot of (righteous?) rage, much in the same way his father fought as a boxer. Like his dad, he doesn't really just \"defeat\" his opponent, he punishes them.Secondarily, Luke confronts known bad actors in the community, whereas Matt is generally going after the more shadowy underworld. People, generally, aren't as aware that he's pushing back a larger tide of evil, they just see what looks like a lot of random street violence.Finally, Daredevil characters are understandably \"judgy\" because of their characters: Lawyers and Cops (advocates for the law), and a nurse (healer), who see breaking the law and hurting people as bad things. Given a crossover, Foggy and Karen would certainly judge Luke. Claire, while still a nurse, is bringing her own baggage as a black woman from a similar neighborhood background. Luke's fight is less abstract to her.",

      "text": "What's on Netflix > What's on Netflix United Kingdom > House, Jericho, The 4400 & Charmed Leaving Netflix UK House, Jericho, The 4400 & Charmed Leaving Netflix UK Tweet \nSome massive shows are due to leave Netflix United Kingdom in January 2017. So get ready to binge through this massive selection of big TV series that are scheduled to leave the service next month. \nWe’ve mentioned a few of the shows in the title but let’s start off with as to why they’re leaving. Netflix secures third-party content (content made by providers other than Netflix) by acquiring licenses to stream the shows. These normally work in yearly cycles and January 1st is when a lot of the cycles come to a close. In some cases, Netflix chooses to renew the show but in some cases decides to let it go. Often there are cases when the shows have been bought out by another provider meaning Netflix simply has no choice other than to expire them. \nLet’s run through the big hitters. \nHouse M.D is the first big show to be leaving on January 1st. The Fox show which has been on Netflix UK since November 2014 is likely going exclusive on NowTV where Fox currently hosts most to all of its content currently. It stars Hugh Laurie who plays a disgruntled doctor who goes after the complex cases in the hospital. It’s brilliantly written and probably the best medical drama on Netflix. \nCharmed is a show about magic and witches although that’s trying to summarise the show a little too much. It’s a timeless series about three powerful witches who have to hunt down demons. \nFinally, we have two great action drama in the form of The 4400 and Jericho . The latter was rumoured to be making a comeback as a Netflix Original but this looks to dispell that rumour completely. Also Expiring from Netflix UK in January 2017 \nIn addition to these shows mentioned above these titles are also due to expire from Netflix in the first few days of January. The 4400",

      "text": "5 Real-Life Inspirations for ‘Black Mirror’ Episodes (Photos) \nNetflix’s “Black Mirror” reflects reality — sometimes without changing a thing Tim Molloy | December 5, 2016 @ 4:58 PM View as Grid View as List Netflix \nNetflix's \"Black Mirror\" is a dark satire that explores how technology affects our humanity. It makes its points through exaggeration -- but not too much exaggeration. Some of the episodes hit painfully close to home, because the situations and tech they portray aren't far off. Here are five examples. Netflix \nSeason 3, Episode 3: \"Shut Up and Dance\" Perhaps the most gut-wrenching episode of \"Black Mirror\" finds a young man racing to meet blackmailers' demands after they use his laptop's camera to catch him in a compromising position. Guess what? This has already happened in real life. Netflix \nHackers can -- and do -- watch people on their own cameras. The U.S. Justice Department’s website tells the true story of “sextortionist” Luis Mijangos, who prosecutors accused of spying on more than 200 women through their webcams, and blackmailing some of them. \nIf you want to tape over your camera lens before you keep clicking through this gallery, we'll wait. Netflix \nSeason 2, Episode 3: \"The Waldo Moment\" A failed comedian voices a cartoon bear who berates politicians without adding anything substantive to the discussion. Voters love it. \n\"So it seems to me that that's almost like a dystopian version of what comics like Sacha Baron Cohen as Ali G or Robert Smigel as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog have done, which is take their humor into the real world and confront politicians and persona,\" said \"Fresh Air\" host Terry Gross in a recent interview with \"Black Mirror\" creator Charlie Brooker. Netflix \nSeason 3, Episode 1: \"Nosedive\" This brilliant episode, starring Bryce Dallas-Howard, images a world in which everyone is constantly ranking each other. Rankings establish social status. Would you believe at least one country is already trying to make this a reality? Baihe.com \nBBC News reports that the Chinese government is developing a \"social credit system\" that \"compiles fiscal and government information, including minor traffic violations, and distills it into a single number ranking each citizen.\" One company, meanwhile, Sesame Credit, encourages its 400 million users to share their credit scores with friends and potential mates. China's biggest dating service, Baihe, promotes clients with high credit scores. Netflix \nSeason 1, Episode 1: \"National Anthem\" In the first episode of the series, a kidnapper demands that the British prime minister have sex with a pig on television if he wants to save the life of a beloved princess. \n\nBrooker told \"Fresh Air\" he was inspired by the way real politicians humiliate themselves for the amusement of voters. \"I was watching things like 'I'm A Celebrity' and there were people doing these degrading things ...\" \nGetty Images \n\"We've got a politician called Boris Johnson in the U.K. who's persona -- popular persona is kind of as a buffoon,\" Brooker continued. \"And he showed up on comedy panel shows as a guest and would sort of dither and say outrageous things and look a bit crazy. And what that did was it made him kind of unassailable. You know, you can't humiliate him because ... he's inoculated himself to humiliation.\" \nIn a bizarre twist, British Prime Minister David Cameron was accused in 2015 -- nearly four years after the \"Black Mirror\" episode aired -- of putting \"a private part of his anatomy in a dead pig’s mouth\" while a student. Cameron publicly denied it. \nSeason 3, Episode 4: \"Men Against Fire\" This episode repeats a contested claim from the book “Men Against Fire: The Problem of Battle Command,” by Samuel Lyman Marshall, that most soldiers deliberately avoid firing on or killing their enemies because of their fundamental empathy and humanity. In the episode, an Army outfits all its soldiers with special lenses that make them see their enemies as inhuman. \nWe've been doing this forever -- and haven't needed special lenses to do it. Here's a link to an article about the anti-Japanese propaganda of World War II.",

      "text": "Netflix top grossing iPhone app after enabling content downloads   05:16 pm PT (08:16 pm ET) Less than a week after enabling downloads of select TV shows and movies for offline viewing, Netflix on Monday beat out popular games and rival streaming services to become the top-grossing iPhone title for the first time ever. As noted by Variety , Netflix now sits atop the Top Grossing list of Apple's Top Charts for iPhone in the U.S. App Store, bypassing games like Mobile Strike and Candy Crush Saga . The performance also places Netflix above music streaming giants Pandora and Spotify , both of which are consistently listed as top-ten earners. According to app tracking firm SensorTower, Netflix is also the No. 1 grossing title on iPhone in India, Mexico, and Colombia. Alongside a rise in revenues for iPhone, Netflix is now the third highest grossing app on the iPad App Store. The development comes less than a week after the streaming service activated offline viewing for select original shows. The long-awaited download feature is currently restricted to \"Stranger Things,\" \"Orange is The New Black,\" \"Narcos\" and \"The Crown,\" but Netflix promises additional titles will be added in the near future.

      "text": "Netflix Plans On Doubling The Number Of Original Shows In 2017 By Tyler Lee on 12/05/2016 17:28 PST \nOne of the benefits of subscribing to Netflix is not only do you get access to a bunch of different TV shows and movies, but you also get access to Netflix produced content, like Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, Marvel’s Netflix series, and so on. In fact original programming is one of the ways that streaming services entices customers. \nThat being said, it seems that Netflix plans on doubling their efforts come 2017. In a report from Variety , the company announced that they plan to double the amount of original shows that they have, going up to 1,000 hours worth which is more than double of the total number of hours that the service has accumulated so far in 2016. \nThe company also expects to focus more on unscripted shows. This is according to Netflix’s CEO Ted Sarandos who said that they wanted more shows that travel internationally, like “Ultimate Beastmaster”. That being said, while the company is looking at more original content, they won’t all be produced in-house. \nStranger Things was actually the first series that was made and produced in-house at Netflix, but they’re also looking to purchase the rights to series and have other studios produce it for them. This combined with offline viewing should make Netflix a force to contend with in 2017. \nFiled in General . Read more about Movies and Netflix . Related Articles",

      "text": "Netflix aims to reel you in with custom previews Netflix aims to reel you in with custom previews Browsing through Netflix's humongous catalog on your TV may have just gotten a little easier. Up Next Memes that need to die along with 2016 \nYour Netflix television experience is getting an upgrade. \nThe streaming provider is rolling out a global update to its TV interface, letting users instantly preview 15-30 second clips of shows as they browse Netflix's vast catalog. The new look follows an earlier update allowing Netflix users to download shows to phones and tablets . \n\"The notion of continuing to improve the user experience for Netflix and how people are able to choose the right thing to watch has kind of been the guiding light for what we've been trying to do with our product strategy,\" said Chris Jaffe, Netflix's vice president of product innovation, in an interview with CNET. \n\"What we are trying to do is live within your attention budget, and find you something great to watch in that budget.\" \nThe rollout will head to gaming consoles like the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One as well as Roku boxes starting today, before making its way to smart TVs and other devices in the next few weeks. \nEvery show in Netflix's catalogue will feature a video preview, which has been manually curated to intrigue viewers. Instead of showing a specific clip from the show or movie, the video is designed as a mini reveal to introduce the story and characters. \nOf course, it's not the first time that Netflix's TV interface has shown video previews. The streaming service has been using the top half of its user interface for trailers, and hiding it when users start to browse through its catalog. Now, it will retain the space for video previews. \nThe change also means users will have less rows to browse through compared to the old design, but that change could be helpful in deciding what to watch. \nCompared to Netflix's web layout, the TV interface is designed to be different, said Jaffe. Unlike watching Netflix on the computer with a mouse, TVs and TV boxes usually only have four directional buttons to work with. \nWe try to design our experiences so features are appropriate for that specific device, said Jaffe. \"If we put a TV UI on a website, that would drive people crazy,\" he said. \"And consequently, if we put a website UI on a TV, it would drive people nuts.\" \n\"TV has an enormous amount of constraints, because you can only go left right up down, it's actually one of the hardest platforms to design for,\" he added. \nFor those worried about extra bandwidth consumption, Netflix says the feature can be turned off. The preview system also uses the same adaptive streaming technology as Netflix's usual videos, which increases the resolution of the video as it plays. Share your voice",

Reunited with his biological dad, Po sets off on a new adventure that finally gives fans what they really want: a whole army of pandas. Published: December 5, 2016 5:05 PM PST Photo by: Richard Trenholm/CNET / Caption by: Rick Broida 'Chicken Run' \nWho doesn't love a good prison escape? Especially when the prisoners are chickens? The woefully underrated \"Chicken Run\" has plenty of slapstick to amuse kids and plenty of clever references to please parents. Published: December 5, 2016 5:05 PM PST Photo by: Dreamworks / Caption by: Rick Broida 'Dragons: Race to the Edge' \nDreamworks' popular \"How to Train Your Dragon\" returns as a Netflix-original series set before the events of the second movie. Kids can enjoy three complete seasons' worth of Hiccup and Toothless. Published: December 5, 2016 5:05 PM PST Photo by: Dreamworks / Caption by: Rick Broida 'Hotel Transylvania 2' \nNot that anyone was really clamoring for a sequel to Adam Sandler's modest hit, but the gang is back with a hotel open to human guests. Think they'll have a bloody good time? Published: December 5, 2016 5:05 PM PST Photo by: Sony Pictures Animation / Caption by: Rick Broida 'Minions' \nNever mind that critical response to \"Minions\" was lukewarm at best. The scene-stealing stars of the \"Despicable Me\" movies are tiny, yellow and adorable, so kids will have no problem overlooking the weak plot and bland gags.

But a movie about kids who discover their parents are spies, and then have to go rescue them? Your kids will eat it up. Published: December 5, 2016 5:05 PM PST Photo by: Dimension Films / Caption by: Rick Broida 'The Andy Griffith Show' \nYep! Your kids may balk at watching a show that's black-and-white for its first few seasons, but with any luck they'll give it a chance. Come for the adorable Ronny Howard, stay for the wholesome entertainment. Published: December 5, 2016 5:05 PM PST Photo by: CBS / Caption by: Rick Broida 'The Flash' \n\"The Flash\" is not only one of the best comics-to-TV adaptations, it's also one of the most kid-friendly. Sure, there's lots of action, and definitely some violence in the form of fight scenes, but this show is all about family, friendship and doing the right thing. Published: December 5, 2016 5:05 PM PST Photo by: The CW / Caption by: Rick Broida 'Voltron: Legendary Defender' \nNetflix resurrected the 1980s classic about Earth kids who become pilots for robotic lions during an intergalactic war. The last half of that sentence will probably send kids of a certain age into orbit. Published: December 5, 2016 5:05 PM PST Photo by: Netflix / Caption by: Rick Broida Hot Galleries",

      "text": "A Peek at Netflix's Playbook for the Domestic Streaming Market PART 11 OF 12 Netflix’s Technical Indicators: Peer Comparison By Shirley Pelts | Nov 30, 2016 4:58 pm EST Technical indicators \nTraders and investors analyze technical indicators when making market entry and exit decisions. Moving averages and the RSI (relative strength index) are among the most widely used technical indicators. An RSI below 30 signifies that a stock is oversold, while an RSI above 70 indicates that a stock is overbought. In this part of the series, we’ll look at Netflix’s technical indicators and compare them with those of other media companies. 100-day moving averages \nOn November 29, 2016, Netflix ( NFLX ) was trading 13% above its 100-day moving average. The Walt Disney Company ( DIS ) was trading ~4.9% above its 100-day moving average. 21st Century Fox (FOXA) was trading 9.5% above its 100-day moving average, and Comcast ( CMCSA ) was trading 6.3% above its 100-day moving average. Relative strength index \nNetflix currently has a 14-day RSI reading of 31. Comcast has a 14-day RSI reading of 86, which leads traders to believe the stock is overbought. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"NFLX\",\"CMCSA\",\"FOXA\",\"DIS\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Netflix, Inc.\",\"Comcast Corporation\",null,\"The Walt Disney Company\"]} X",

      "title": "Luke Cage is getting a second season from Marvel and Netflix",
      "text": "By Alexander Zalben, Marvel and Netflix's superhero show Luke Cage reportedly broke the internet when it launched back in September. And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again: as just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime.\nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements... A short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season; and the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\"\nThat's it.\nAlways forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr\n— Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 What's most interesting about the teaser to fans is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke ( Mike Colter ) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2?\nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders , which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil ( Charlie Cox ), Iron Fist ( Finn Jones ), and Jessica Jones ( Krysten Ritter ), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series.\nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next...\nOther Links From TVGuide.com\nMarvel's Luke Cage Mike Colter\nView the original article on TVGuide.com",

      "title": "Netflix Plans To Double Its Original Programming Output In 2017",
      "text": "In December 2015, Netflix said its 2016 slate would more than double its output of original programming from 15 shows to 31. One year later, Netflix now counts 30 original shows within its library, but the subscription-video on-demand platform isn’t stopping there. Its Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos , announced during the BS Global Media & Communications Conference in New York that Netflix will once again double its output in 2017, bringing its total number of original programs above 60.\nWhile Netflix’s upcoming slate will include plenty of feature films, new scripted shows, and returning hits, the company is putting a particular emphasis on unscripted content. Variety notes that the SVOD platform plans to release 20 unscripted programs in 2017, with Sarandos calling that format a “very interesting business.”\nThere are two major reasons why Netflix is interested in unscripted content. For one, according to Sarandos, those shows can more easily connect with overseas audiences. The Netflix CCO specifically noted Ultimate Beastmaster , an upcoming competition series produced by Sylvester Stallone , as the sort of series that could play well both in the United States and in South Korea. Given that Netflix’s high market saturation within the U.S. has caused it to turn more of its efforts toward the world at large , shows that can appeal to multiple regions are a priority.\nThe other reason, even if Sarandos didn’t spell it out exactly, is that unscripted shows are generally cheaper to produce than their scripted cousins. The evidence of that fact can be seen in Netflix’s proposed original content budget for 2017. Despite the fact that it plans to double the number of shows it distributes, it only plans to raise its budget by about 20%, from $5 billion to $6 billion.\n30 shows in a single year may seem like a daunting task, but Netflix thinks it could even surpass that number. As Sarandos said, “that’s a conservative measure right now.”\nVisit Tubefilter for more great stories.",

      "text": "James Badge Dale battles killer ghosts in trailer for Netflix's Spectral 2 hours ago by: 2 Comments \nWhat would your first instinct be upon coming face to vapour with a murderous ghost? If your reply comes close to \" immediately open fire on the intangible being, \" then you might feel right at home with the trailer for Netflix's upcoming SPECTRAL . Starring James Badge Dale (IRON MAN 3), Emily Mortimer (HUGO), Max Martini (PACIFIC RIM) and Bruce Greenwood (STAR TREK), the Nic Mathieu directed flick features Dale in the lead role as a \" brilliant DARPA scientist embarks on a deadly mission with a Special Ops team of Delta Force soldiers into a battle-scarred, war-torn city, where mysterious phantom aggressors code-named Spectral have been causing inexplicable civilian deaths. \" Certainly sounds interesting, let's check out the trailer! \nA little BLACK HAWK DOWN meets GHOSTBUSTERS. I like it. Legendary Pictures had originally planned to release SPECTRAL theatrically this past summer, but it was quietly taken off the schedule with no real explanation and picked up by Netflix just last month. Normally this would indicate that the movie isn't all that great, but when you combine the talent of those involved (plus music by Junkie XL, weapon's created by Weta Workship and VFX by Weta Digital), SPECTRAL might just wind up being a decent waste of your time. \nSPECTRAL will make its Netflix debut on December 9th .

The streaming service announced on Dec. 4 that they have renewed the superhero hit series “Luke Cage” for a second season.\nAlways forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr \n— Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 \n\nAccording to the Huffington Post , the show that stars Mike Colter , Alfre Woodard , Rosario Dawson and Mahershala Ali was an instant hit when it debuted on September 30 and its popularity was rumored as the reason why Netflix crashed during its debut weekend. The show also received critical praise for its pro-Blackness, political undertones (i.e. his bulletproof hoodie) and love letter to Harlem. \nThis embed is invalid\nWhile a release date for season 2 has yet to be confirmed, Mic speculates that the show’s return will probably be based on the timelines set by Netflix’s other Marvel shows. They write that Luke Cage is the third Netflix Marvel drama behind Daredevil and Jessica Jones, with a fourth, Iron Fist , and fifth, The Defenders , due out in 2017. So most likely, we won’t see all that sexy chocolate until 2018. \nBut trust: It will be worth the wait! \nAs expected, Twitter erupted when the news hit:\nMarvel’s ‘Luke Cage’ Netflix Series Officially Renewed for Season 2 https://t.co/XjG3HZyLxC \n— deray mckesson (@deray) December 5, 2016 \nYES @LukeCage season 2 confirmed!\n— Bad HoHoHombre ❄️ (@TheBardockObama) December 5, 2016 \nHELL TO THE YAAAASSS https://t.co/ADwBDpzcBk @LukeCage @SimoneMissick @netflix #LukeCageSeason2 #SweetChristmas #BulletproofLove \n— ✨ Afia ✨ (@afiab) December 6, 2016 \ni woke up to DAPL being blocked and luke cage being renewed for season 2 is it still 2016 i'm not used to hearing such good news\n— angela (@captaindeadpooI) December 5, 2016 \nBig Congrats to Mr Mike Colter.\nFor a season 2 of @LukeCage @Marvel @netflix https://t.co/1v2uHMJg4S \n— Vincent D'Onofrio (@vincentdonofrio) December 4, 2016 \nThis embed is invalid\nOTHER NEWS: \nOprah Lands Final White House Interview With First Lady Michelle Obama \nSerena Williams Pens Powerful Letter About Sexism, Sports And Success \nKelly Rowland Debuts Book On Motherhood And Raising A Titan \n",

Scripted shows on the horizon include A Series Of Unfortunate Events (starring Neil Patrick Harris), Santa Clarita Diet (starring Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant), and Mind Hunter (a David Fincher series about the early days of FBI serial killer profiling). \nNetflix will spend approximately $6 billion on content in 2017, an increase of $1 billion over this year.

      "text": "Six Pixels of Separation - The Blog December 5, 2016 7:48 AM Netflix Lets You Download Movies Now, Facebook Will Have Some Cools Games Soon And More - The Week's CTRL ALT Delete Segment On CHOM 97.7 FM \nEvery Monday morning at 7:10 am, I am a guest contributor on CHOM 97.7 FM radio broadcasting out of Montreal (home base). It's not a long segment - about 5 to 10 minutes every week - about everything that is happening in the world of technology and digital media. The good folks at CHOM 97.7 FM are posting these segments weekly on iHeart Radio , if you're interested in hearing more of me blathering away. I'm really excited about this opportunity, because this is the radio station that I grew up on listening to, and it really is a fun treat to be invited to the Mornings Rock with Terry and Heather B. morning show. The segment is called, CTRL ALT Delete with Mitch Joel . \nThis week we discussed: Netflix ... you did it! Yes! We can now download movies and TV shows from Netflix to your mobile device. It's not for all movies or shows, but it's a start and it's a huge move for Netflix to truly dominate the on-demand business. Here's what you need to know ... Last week we had Cyber Monday. This follows Black Friday, only it's much more civilized. Some might argue that it's more frustrating, as inventory moves faster and some sites crash, but still last Monday's numbers are impressive . Adobe says that $3.45 billion was spent online, a 12.1 percent year-over-year spike. Mobile represented a 34 percent year-over-year increase. This means that one in three purchases were made using a smartphone. Facebook made $2.5 billion in 2015 on what? Would you believe me, if I told you games? That's a surprisingly big number. Well, Facebook thinks this is just the beginning. They recently announced the launch of Instant Games . And, these games will be playable within the newsfeed and Messenger. This could turn Facebook into a destination for games as well. Big move. Games will include classics like Pac-Man , Galaga , Space Invaders and newer titles like Word With Friends and more. App of the week: StayConnect . By Mitch Joel \nRelated Posts:",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) FILE - In this Friday, Jan. 17, 2014, file photo, a person displays Netflix on a tablet in North Andover, Mass. Some television companies are balking as more people watch shows online, and may start delaying the release of shows to streaming services like Netflix and Hulu. These studios fear that the success of streaming services might lead more households to cut back or drop cable TV services. It also comes as online services have been dabbling in creating their own television shows. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix’s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service’s decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its “Red” premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on HBO’s internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix’s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service’s most popular shows, including “Orange Is The New Black,” ”House of Cards,” and “Stranger Things,” are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include “Spotlight,” this year’s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix’s expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix’s steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix’s DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix’s DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Netflix updated its video encoding to make downloads look better Using Google's VP9 codec, Netflix says it can achieve the same quality at much lower bitrates. Share Save \nFrom time to time, Netflix updates the technology it's using to convert and compress each of the digital copies of movies it streams to customers. Because people watch from so many different platforms, in so many different situations, it has to be ready for any number of possibilities. Late last year, it revealed the use of a smarter way to apply compression , recognizing that different types of content (animation like Bojack Horseman vs. dark action scenes in Daredevil ) need different levels of bitrate or resolution to look their best. Now it's focused on enhancing the efficiency of compression , starting with the video it delivers to mobile devices. \nNetflix: AVCMain: Our existing H.264/AVC Main profile encodes, using per-title optimization, serve as anchor for the comparison. AVCHi-Mobile: H.264/AVC High profile encodes using more optimal encoder settings and per-chunk encoding. VP9-Mobile: VP9 encodes using more optimal encoder settings and per-chunk encoding. \nIt's using Google's VP9 on some platforms (most Android phones), while H.264/AVC High profile works for others (anything iOS). The \"per-chunk\" encoding mentioned above mean that beyond just optimizing for the type of show or movie, it's actually applying optimal settings across different parts of each video . Variety notes these pieces can range between 1- 3 minutes in length, and Netflix says that using this with Google's VP9 tech can result in a video that has the same quality, but uses 36 percent lower bitrate. \nThat means it can look better on your phone, while also using less data, and taking up less space as a download. That last part is key, because the new encodes are currently rolling out in the new downloads feature , although they will be available for streaming on mobile devices in the \"near future.\" ",

      "text": "By Alexander Zalben, Marvel and Netflix's superhero show Luke Cage reportedly broke the internet when it launched back in September. And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again: as just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime.\nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements... A short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season; and the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\"\nThat's it.\nAlways forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr\n— Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 What's most interesting about the teaser to fans is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke ( Mike Colter ) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2?\nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders , which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil ( Charlie Cox ), Iron Fist ( Finn Jones ), and Jessica Jones ( Krysten Ritter ), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series.\nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next...\nOther Links From TVGuide.com\nMarvel's Luke Cage Mike Colter\nView the original article on TVGuide.com",

The news was shared on the show’s Twitter and included a short clip displaying Pop’s Barber Shop reading “Season 2 coming soon” in a post accompanied by Pop’s own motto: Always forward . \n— Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 \nLuke Cage — Netflix’s highest rated show to date — is the third Marvel show to get a second season on the streaming service, joining Daredevil and Jessica Jones in their fandom and success. \nSeason 1 of Luke Cage was well received by critics and had a huge impact within the Hip Hop community. Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Adrian Younge were appointed to spearhead the show’s score , giving it a ’90s Hip Hop vibe. It should also be noted that the show’s creator, Cheo Hodari Coker , channeled the name of Gang Starr cuts for each episode. \nIn other Hip Hop – Marvel collaborations, the comic book company took popular cover arts and “marvelized” them for installment covers inspired by Wu-Tang Clan and Chance The Rapper as well as LL Cool J’s BAD being remade with Luke Cage as HARD. \nThe exact date Luke Cage episodes will become available is unknown for now, so those who haven’t had a chance to watch the show yet can go ahead and catch up . Sweet Christmas arrived 21 days early! Season Two coming soon! Forward….Always. \n— Cheo Hodari Coker (@cheo_coker) December 4, 2016 Sign up for The Daily Drop \nThank you, thank you, thank you,you're far too kind!",

      "text": "how to download movies and tv shows from netflix ios More For years, Netflix subscribers have dreamed of the ability to download movies or episodes of their favorite TV shows to accompany them on a long trip off the grid. Now that the dream has we’re here to help you make that transition offline go as smoothly as possible so you can simply sit back and enjoy.\nFor now, downloading titles for offline playback is only available via the Netflix app on iOS and Android mobile devices. Follow us below to figure out how to get downloading so you can get off the grid, and take your Netflix along for the ride.\nGetting your download on Step 1: Get up to date First things first, you’ll need to make sure your Netflix app has been updated to be ready for downloading. If you don’t have your device set to auto update, for iOS devices you can simply click on the app in the app store to get version 9.0.1 or later, while on Android devices you can do the same at the Google Play, where the version varies by device.\nStep 2: Choose your download quality\nnetflix_download_screens_011 More Netflix offers two different quality levels for downloads: Standard and “Higher,” the latter of which is seemingly high definition (720-1080p resolution), though Netflix doesn’t specify there. Standard uses less space on your device and downloads faster, while Higher takes a bit more space. Which one you’ll want to use will depend on how much free space you’ll have on your device, and what kind of device you’re using — a Standard title may look fine on a phone, while Higher may be necessary for your tablet. To choose, tap the menu icon on the left, then scroll down to App Settings. From here, under the Downloads heading, tap Video Quality and select your preference. We’ll get to more details on how much space Netflix downloads use later in this article.\nStep 3: Pick your poison\nnetflix_download_screens_012 More Not everything on Netflix is available for download, but the company has made downloadable titles easy to find by arranging them in a special section called simply “Available for Download.” To get there, tap the menu button in the upper left and it’s the first option below the Home section. If you’re searching for specific titles simply look for the download icon, which looks like an arrow pointing down to a line.\nStep 4: Get downloading Read More\nnetflix_download_screens_01 More To begin downloading, simply tap on the download icon on the show or movie you want to watch. There is one thing Android users will need to be aware of here: Netflix can only download titles to the same storage space in which the Netflix app is stored, so if you want to download to an SD card, you’ll need to make sure to download the Netflix app there as well.\nStep 5: Watch your downloaded titles\nhow to download movies and tv shows from netflix screens More how to download movies and tv shows from netflix screens More Once titles are downloaded, they can be found in the “My Downloads” section of the app, can be found by tapping the menu button in the upper left hand corner of the app. The My Downloads folder is located just above the Home section. A title’s running time as well as how much space it uses is listed next to the title. To play a downloaded episode, simply tap on the video thumbnail.\nHow much space do I need?\nnetflix_download_screens_013 More Just how much space a download takes up depends on how long the title is and, of course, which video quality option you’ve chosen. As an example, we downloaded the Netflix original film Mascots , as well as the first episode of Stranger Things in both Standard and Higher quality.\nMore: Time to kill? These are the 101 best movies on Netflix\nMascots has a runtime of 1 hour and 35 minutes. The Standard quality download of the movie used 487MB of space, while the Higher quality version took up 749.4MB. Stranger Things episode one is 48 minutes long and takes up 197.1MB of space in Standard quality, and 310.1MB in Higher. As mentioned above, Standard should be fine for most phones, but if you’re picky — or going to a tablet — you’ll want to use the Higher resolution.\nWhat’s available? As mentioned above, not all of Netflix’s library of streaming titles is available for download. One thing you can count on being available are Netflix Originals, as every Original we looked at was available for download right away, including episodes of Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, Narcos, and The Crown.\nThe Crown More The Crown\nOther titles available at the time of writing were TV shows like Breaking Bad, Blacklist, and Weeds . Movies available for download included No Country for Old Men, London Has Fallen, Pulp Fiction , and Jaws.\nMore: The absolute best TV shows streaming on Netflix right now\nAs with Netflix streaming, many of these titles will only be available for a limited time, and once they’re gone from the service, you won’t be able to watch the downloaded version either. There is also no way to move the files off of a mobile device and play them with another app, so if you were planning to file a hard drive with Netflix titles, you’ll be sorely disappointed.\nHow do I delete titles? Whether you’ve watched downloaded titles or simply want to make room for more downloads, you’ll eventually want to get rid of them. There are two ways to go about this, depending on how much you want to delete.\nDeleting a single title\nIf you only want to delete one title at a time, this can be done from the My Downloads section. Just tap Edit in the upper right, then tap the red X icon next to any titles you want to delete. Titles will be deleted without a second confirmation, so be careful what you tap.\nDeleting all downloaded titles\nYou could delete everything from the My Downloads section, but if you’re looking to clear everything all at once, there’s an easier way. Tap the menu icon in the upper left, then scroll down to App Settings. From here, just tap Clear All Downloads, confirm that you do want to delete all your downloaded titles, and you’re done.\nHow to install fonts on iPad or iPhone with AnyFont Join the Apple club with our complete guide to switching from Android to iOS These are the 35 tips and tricks you need to master the Galaxy S7",

      "text": "Courtesy of BBC America June 9, 2016 | 03:05AM PT \nNetflix has boarded BBC drama “ The Last Kingdom ” as a co-producer for the second season as filming starts in Budapest, Hungary. The new season will premiere next year on BBC Two in the U.K. and on Netflix in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, Japan, Spain and Portugal. The show is produced by Carnival Films , best known for “Downton Abbey.” \nThe first season was a hit with viewers during its eight-week run on BBC Two in 2015, averaging 2.7 million total viewers. The show was nominated for best drama series at the Royal Television Society Awards. \nSet in the year 878, the second season returns “as fearless and instinctive warrior Uhtred continues his fight for his native land of Northumbria,” Carnival Films said in a statement. “Uhtred, having given his sword to King Alfred, despite his upbringing by the invading pagan Danes, embarks on his voyage north to reclaim his own fate: to avenge Earl Ragnar’s death and recapture his ancestral lands of Bebbanburg.” \nAlexander Dreymon (“American Horror Story”) returns as Uhtred, alongside David Dawson (“Peaky Blinders”), Emily Cox (“Homeland”), Ian Hart (“Boardwalk Empire”) and Tobias Santelmann (“Marcella”) from the first season. They are joined by new cast members including Thure Lindhardt (“The Bridge”), Millie Brady (“Legend”), and Peter McDonald (“Thirteen”). \nGareth Neame and Nigel Marchant return as executive producers for Carnival Films alongside screenwriter Stephen Butchard, who adapted Bernard Cornwell’s novels. Elizabeth Kilgarriff is the executive producer for the BBC, and Dominic Barlow will produce this season. Filed Under:",

      "text": "Reddit \nNetflix has long been one of the most popular iOS apps, but over recent months, the company has seen its revenue from the mobile increase exponentially. As noted in the latest data from analytics firm SensorTower , Netflix recently cracked the number spot on the Top Grossing charts in the United States for the first time ever. \nNetflix first added support for allowing users to subscribe via its iOS app just over a year ago, and since then, the growth has been steady despite a few rough patches during early fall of last year. \nNetflix neared the number one spot on the Top Grossing charts during the middle of last month when it hit number two, but only today did it close at the number one position on the Top Grossing charts in the United States, India, Mexico, and Colombia. \nSpecifically, Netflix has seen its net revenue from in-app subscriptions rise from under $50,000 per week to nearly $2.9 million per week. Last month, Netflix was the number seven grossing app overall on iOS in the United States. \nNetflix has seen its app’s revenue increasing steadily, even as it faces challenges in growing its user base in the U.S. Below, we’ve charted its weekly net revenue on iOS in the U.S. since in-app subscriptions were introduced in fall 2015. Over this time, its weekly net revenue has grown from less than $50,000 to nearly $2.9 million. Last month, Netflix was the No. 7 grossing iOS app overall in the U.S. \nThe news of Netflix’s conquer of the Top Grossing charts comes following the addition of support for downloading shows for offline viewing. This, of course, is a feature that many have been requesting since the service’s inception. \nNetflix announced the feature last week and we offered up some more specifics on how exactly the feature works. While title availability is somewhat limited at this point, Netflix’s own original shows and some third-party titles are supported. \nIt’s also somewhat important to note that in addition to adding offline viewing, Netflix also recently released one of its biggest pieces of original content yet in “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,” and it’d be naive to think that release hasn’t contributed at all to Netflix’s recent surge. Netflix is also releasing the second season of “Fuller House” later this week.” \nEither way you look at it, this is good news for Netflix and investors alike as the company has worked hard to grow its subscriber numbers in the United States amid competition from companies like Amazon.

      "text": "\n(Vassi Dyulgerova/Netflix) Posted December 5 2016 — 11:44 AM EST \nCameron Dallas is making the jump from your phone screen to your TV in Chasing Cameron , a new Netflix series starring the social media superstar. \nIn a new trailer released Monday, Dallas offers a behind-the-scenes look at what it’s really like to be a 22 year old with nearly 17 million followers on social media, and the trials and tribulations that follow the European leg of his MAGCON tour. \n“There’s definitely pressure for me to keep everyone happy,” Dallas says as the drama builds and the tears flow from his fellow MAGCON bros Aaron Carpenter, Taylor Caniff, Willie Jones, Trey Schafer, and Blake Gray. \nIf you’re wondering just what MAGCON is and how a teenager can amass such a large following, thank the now-defunct Vine app. Dallas rose to fame by posting vines that quickly went viral, and managed to turn the support into a social media empire, even scoring gigs on network television and a short-lived music career. MAGCON “stands for meet-and-greet convention,” as Dallas explains, and serves as a way for fans to connect with their favorite social media stars. \nThe Netflix show will go behind-the-scenes as Dallas and company take their tour across the pond, but you can expect the typical amount of selfies, crying preteens, and police drama (“We’ve got serious safety problems!” one yells). \nChasing Cameron premieres Dec. 27 on Netflix. \nWatch the trailer below.

Since the offline download feature is mostly meant for those who prefer to watch movies and TV shows on their smartphones/tablets, while on the move, Netflix thought it would be great to improve the download speed or shrink the size of the files needed to be downloaded. The latest update for Netflix is focusing on delivering more efficient video encodes targeted towards low-bandwidth Internet connections. Basically, Netflix introduced two new types of mobile encodes: AVCHi-Mobile and VP9-Mobile. These new encodes will only be avai...",

      "text": "Netflix ( NFLX ) is going unscripted as part of its effort to go global.\nThe streaming service will debut \"about 20\" reality TV shows next year, as part of its ongoing goal to reach 1,000 hours of original content production, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said at Monday's UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in midtown Manhattan. Netflix produced about 600 content hours in 2016.\nUnscripted shows also give Netflix an opportunity to expand into burgeoning overseas markets. Until now, the company has used localized scripted content to reach international viewers, such as through the French original Marseille . Netflix produces original content in 12 countries around the world.\nIts upcoming reality TV show Ultimate Beastmaster , produced by Sylvester Stallone, will be its first effort to use unscripted content to reach international markets. The obstacle course series will have simultaneous production around the world, so that each region will have its own local production team and cast. For example, viewers in South Korea will see local hosts and athletes when they watch Beastmaster , Sarandos explained.\nNetflix for the most part has been well received in international markets. In the most recent quarter, the company added about 3.2 million international subscribers, which was higher than Wall Street's estimate of 2.01 million subscriber additions. Netflix, however, has momentarily admitted defeat in penetrating the Chinese market, blaming the tough regulatory environment as the main reason behind its decision to pause development there.\nThe recent decision to introduce offline streaming also was an effort to grab a hold of emerging markets, Sarandos said. He denied it was a move to catch up with Amazon 's ( AMZN ) Prime Video, which unveiled plans to expand globally last month.\n\"For the most part we developed it for entry in emerging markets that have slower broadband and limited access to Wi-Fi,\" Sarandos added. \"So in places like India ... the way they use Netflix is they download things overnight and then watch them the next day.\"\nWhen asked if Netflix is concerned about growing original content offerings from Amazon or Hulu , Sarandos said the numbers seem to indicate they're \"spending a lot\" but not necessarily encroaching on Netflix's subscribers. Investors shouldn't expect to see any detailed subscriber numbers from Netflix just yet, though, as Sarandos said the company isn't planning to release in-depth viewership statistics \"at this point.\"\nWhile Netflix has ventured into live programming with some of its original sitcoms, Sarandos said it won't be entering the fray of companies bidding for the rights to air highly sought-after live sports such as the National Football League.\n\"The liveness is the selling point, and we're not a great solution for that,\" he noted, saying that Beastmaster is a solution to that problem because it draws repeat viewers who don't care as much about seeing it live but are in it for the story line.\n\"Don't look to us to be bidding for the league rights,\" Sarandos added.\nSarandos also handily deflected any talk of Netflix being bought by a larger company when asked if it could ever \"become a bigger company.\" Recent reports have speculated that Disney ( DIS ) might explore making a bid for the streaming service.\nNetflix has always been focused on \"one product,\" and a deal might distort that focus, he said.\n\"I do think there [are] some other multicompany conflicts that emerge with bigger companies that would make it difficult to be disciplined,\" Sarandos added.\nNetflix shares on Monday afternoon were down 1.3% to $119.23.",

The popular streaming site is finally making its digital content downloadable… anytime, anywhere, with or without wifi or 3G. \nThe tweet we've all been waiting for finally went out via the official Netflix account last week, reading, \"Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favourite stories are now available for download any time. \" Yas yas hellll yaaas! \nThe new offline mode enables Netflix app users to download a selection of their fave programs (such as Orange is the New Black , Stranger Things and The Crown ) and save them for later viewing. You know, like on those long walks to campus, or those long train/plane rides home for Winter break, or when your phone bill is way past overdue and Bell cuts you off from accessing wireless anything. You: 1 Bell: 0. \nAccording to Gizmodo , not all content is available to download, but Netflix ensures users that “ many of your favourite streaming series and movies are already available for download , with more on the way.” Weeee, it’s the gift that keeps on giving! \nThis super dope feature is iOS and Android friendly , and all it needs from you is a click of the “download” button on the app and you’re off! Literally, you’re off, as in, you can go offline. \nCall it a miracle, an early holiday gift or just one of those it’s about damn time kinda things, who cares?! We can all savour this tidbit of good news as we head into the hell that is final exams. \nBrb, off to binge-watch Black Mirror real quick! \n\nCover photo obtained from: http://www.droid-life.com/2016/11/30/netflix-offline/ \nArticle photo obtained from: http://gizmodo.com/offline-playback-comes-to-netflix-1789511566 You Might Also Enjoy",

      "text": "Courtesy of Netflix October 22, 2016 | 10:23AM PT All 13 episodes of the second season of “ Marvel ’s Jessica Jones ” will be directed by women, according to executive producer and showrunner Melissa Rosenberg . Rosenberg discussed the all-female directing roster during her panel at Transforming Hollywood 7: Diversifying Entertainment, a conference held Friday at University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. Rosenberg said that in the second season of the superhero show, she had wanted to increase the number of female directors — a goal that Marvel was completely on board with, she noted. Given how in-demand many women directors are these days, she and her fellow producers had set their sights on booking women first, she said, and contracting male directors later in the pre-production process. Related Krysten Ritter, Sam Heughan Find Value in ‘Jessica Jones,’ ‘Outlander’ Sex Scenes But then someone else involved in the production — she didn’t specify who — floated the idea of booking only women as directors. Rosenberg was honest about the fact that she hadn’t contemplated that concept prior to that conversation, but she said she quickly jumped at the opportunity. When it comes to behind-the-scenes personnel, hiring an inclusive array of people was “ a conscious decision and it’s very important that showrunners do that,” she said. That directing roster puts “Jessica Jones” in very rarified company, as one of the few one-hour dramas to have an all-female list of directors. Ava DuVernay’s “Queen Sugar,” which airs on OWN, also had only female directors during its debut season . Rosenberg didn’t divulge any details about the second season of “Jessica Jones,” except to tell Variety before her panel that scripts were in the midst of completion and shooting was set for next year. With Henry Jenkins and Stacy L. Smith of USC, who moderated her panel, Rosenberg freely discussed drawing on a variety of perspectives when coming up with the story arcs of the New York-set Marvel drama. “When I interview a writer, I’m less interested in what you’ve been doing professionally than I am in where you’re from, what your parents do, what’s your life experience, what are you bringing to the table personally?” Rosenberg said. “I don’t want a bunch of people who look and sound [like me] and have the experiences I have.” Rosenberg, who also penned the “Twilight” movies, in addition to her experience writing for other TV and film franchises, told her audience that persistence was one of the key attributes that aspiring creatives should bring to Hollywood, whatever their background, gender, or culture. “I think the only reason I’m sitting here is because of tenacity. It’s a tough business. You really have to be able to take a hit,” noted Rosenberg. “I’ve gotten fired so many times, I can’t even count now.” “That’s the nature of the business, it’s really hard,” she added. Rosenberg said that “delusional optimism” had allowed her to survive . On the bad days, “you have to be able to pick yourself up and say that tomorrow is going to be better than today.” The all-day conference featured an array of producers, writers, academics, and activists. Producer Effie T. Brown (“Dear White People,” “Project Greenlight”), Desmin Borges (“You’re the Worst”), Melissa Silverstein of Women in Hollywood, Javier Grillo-Marxuach (“The Middleman,”“Lost,”“Xena”), and Dodai Stewart, editor-in-chief of Fusion, were among the panelists discussing where Hollywood has made progress on screen and behind the scenes — and where that progress has stalled . But as Rosenberg and DuVernay proved — as has FX — changing directing stats is far from impossible. In an earlier panel, Melissa Goodman , director of the LGBTQ, Gender and Reproductive Justice Project, ACLU of Southern California, noted that there were methods of increasing inclusion that have a strong track record of effectiveness in many industries — not just in Hollywood. The strategies revolved around setting targets for hiring, and revisiting the progress toward those measurable goals at regular intervals. “Track the data and pay attention to it,” Goodman said. “It’s actually pretty simple.” Filed Under:",

      "text": "Dec 5, 2016 Netflix Has Become the No. 1 Grossing iPhone App in the U.S. \nJust over a year after Netflix began allowing iOS users to subscribe to its service via in-app purchases, the Netflix app has summited the Top Grossing Apps chart for iPhone on the U.S. App Store. The app had flirted with the No. 1 spot previously on November 14, 2016, when it ended the day at No. 2, and returned to second place yesterday before topping the chart for the first time today. \nThe Netflix app’s ascent to the top can be seen in the category ranking history below, from our App Intelligence platform. Following some stumbles in the early days of fall 2015, it’s been a steady climb to the No. 1 position. In addition to being the top app in the U.S., it also occupies the No. 1 grossing spot on iPhone in India, Mexico, and Colombia as of this post. \nNetflix has seen its app’s revenue increasing steadily, even as it faces challenges in growing its user base in the U.S. Below, we’ve charted its weekly net revenue on iOS in the U.S. since in-app subscriptions were introduced in fall 2015. Over this time, its weekly net revenue has grown from less than $50,000 to nearly $2.9 million. Last month, Netflix was the No. 7 grossing iOS app overall in the U.S. \nHaving recently added the ability for users to download selected TV shows and movies for offline playback in its app, Netflix has focused on growing its subscriber base through original television and film content, such as its incredibly popular Marvel Entertainment series Daredevil , Jessica Jones , and Luke Cage , which was just renewed for a second season. Netflix also intends to make a big push into unscripted programming with 20 such shows slated to debut in 2017. \nSensor Tower’s Store Intelligence platform is an Enterprise level offering.

And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again: as just announced with a short teaser video on Twitter, Luke Cage is returning to Harlem for a second season of fighting crime. \nThe video is right in line with most of Marvel/Netflix's teasers and announcements... A short animation, some news, and that's it. In this case, it's a slow push-in on Pop's Barber Shop, a key location in the first season; and the reveal of a neon sign that says \"Season 2 Coming Soon.\" \nThat's it. — Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 \nWhat's most interesting about the teaser to fans is that the finale left Pop's Barber Shop destroyed (again), with the cast wondering what they could do with the location. Could Luke ( Mike Colter ) return to Harlem -- after being taken back to jail in the finale -- in order to bring new life to his mentor's shop? Or is it just a case of finding something simple to sell the idea of Season 2? \nWhatever happens, most likely we won't find out what'll happen with Cage and company until after the launch of the superhero mash-up Marvel's The Defenders , which teams Cage with fellow NYC based heroes Daredevil ( Charlie Cox ), Iron Fist ( Finn Jones ), and Jessica Jones ( Krysten Ritter ), as well as basically every other character who has ever appeared in a Marvel/Netflix series. \nTime to grab a cup of coffee and find out what's next...",

And now, the studio (and network) are getting ready to break the internet again.

Best TV performances of 2016 \nWith more TV shows, and more great TV shows, every year it gets harder to pick what were the singular best performances out of the plethora of phenomenal acting available. \nWith more TV shows, and more great TV shows, every year it gets harder to pick what were the singular best performances out of the plethora of phenomenal acting available. \nBy Liz Raftery, \nThere were several times in 2016 when we found ourselves watching TV with our hands over our eyes, or wanting to turn the whole thing off entirely -- and we're not even talking about the presidential campaign. \nFrom The Walking Dead to Westworld , Westeros to Roanoke , one thing remained constant in the ever-changing entertainment landscape: television's ability to turn our stomachs time and time again. \nHere are the top 12 grisliest TV moments of 2016. (Warning: Not for the faint of heart!) \n12. Cassidy drinking the co-pilot's blood, Preacher \nViewers who tuned into the pilot episode of AMC's Preacher got a bloody introduction to Cassidy ( Joseph Gilgun ), who exposes himself as a vampire by killing an airplane pilot as well as the passengers on board, and drinking the pilot's blood. Just to be on the safe side, he also makes himself a to-go container of the pilot's blood as well before jumping out of the plane before it crashes. \n11. Ash getting his head stuck in a corpse's butt, Ash vs. Evil Dead \nIn the Ash vs. Evil Dead episode \"The Morgue,\" Ash Williams ( Bruce Campbell ) may face his most preposterous dilemma yet, when -- there's no elegant way to say it -- he gets his head shoved, quite graphically, through a corpse's anus. Is the scene revolting, hilarious or both? You be the judge. \nThe Best TV Shows of 2016 \n10 . Punisher's prison hallway massacre, Daredevil \nDaredevil took the idea of a prison brawl to new heights in Season 2. The brutally violent episode \"Seven Minutes in Heaven\" proves (as if there was any doubt) that The Punisher ( Jon Bernthal ) means business, as he takes out countless fellow inmates, armed with only a shank and his bare hands -- which he uses to pry out one victim's eyes. \n9. A French gymnast breaking his leg at Olympics \nMost people will remember the Rio Olympics as the site of Ryan Lochte's downfall stemming from his fake robbery . But that's not the only wince-worthy thing that happened at the summer games. In the men's gymnastics qualifying round, France's Samir Ait Said broke his leg on a vault. The most stomach-turning thing about this video? No acting here! \n8 . A demon-possessed child getting beaten up, Outcast \nThere's more than one way to slay a demon. But in the series premiere of Outcast , Cinemax's new show from Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman , main character Kyle Barnes learns that the most effective way to perform an exorcism is to punch a possessed person in the face repeatedly -- even if said person is a 10-year-old child. \n7. A man's head getting crushed in a vice, Banshee \nIn the Season 4 premiere of Banshee , a member of the Red Bones gang gets a painful (and eventually fatal) lesson about working outside of his own territory. First, Calvin Bunker crushes the man's head inside a vice before Burton eventually finishes him off with a baseball bat, painting the walls with bits of his brain. Burton must be a fan of The Walking Dead . \n6. A zombie biting a man's nose off, Fear the Walking Dead \nLike its predecessor, Fear the Walking Dead isn't exactly short on gross scenes. But the moment that's still stuck in our brains is from the Season 2 finale, when a zombie goes on a violent rampage and bites off a man's nose and then a woman's finger. The zombie is finally taken out by Nick ( Frank Dillane ), who presses his thumbs into its eyes to kill it, but we're left wondering: Are there reconstructive surgery clinics in the post-apocalyptic world? \n5. Shelby killing Matt, American Horror Story: Roanoke \nIt's called American Horror Story for a reason. Amid all the disgusting moments on this season, the moment when Shelby ( Lily Rabe ) kills Matt ( Andre Holland ) in a fit of rage stands out. After discovering that her husband Matt is having an affair with the Wood Witch, Shelby rams a poker into his head, splattering his brains all over the floor of the basement where she caught Matt and the Wood Witch in a fit of passion. \n4. Freddy slitting a fellow prisoner's throat, The Night Of \nWe knew Freddy ( Michael K. Williams ) was a ruthless murderer on HBO's The Night Of , but we got a demonstration of just how brazen he can be with his cruelty in Episode 7, when he casually strolls through a group of prisoners watching TV and swiftly slits one's jugular. The victim, a former member of Freddy's crew, bleeds out on the floor before any of the guards -- who are being distracted by Naz ( Riz Ahmed ), asking for a new inhaler -- can do anything about it. \n3. Ramsay feeding Walda and the baby to hounds , Game of Thrones \nWhat is perhaps Ramsay's ( Iwan Rheon ) most dastardly deed (though there are so many to choose from) came in \"Home,\" the second episode of Season 6, when Ramsay killed his stepmother and infant stepbrother by locking them in his kennels and siccing his hounds on them. The only thing that makes this scene slightly more palatable (other than the fact that the deaths are, thankfully, not shown, merely heard) is knowing that Ramsay himself would eventually suffer the same fate. \n2. A host committing suicide by smashing his own head in, Westworld \nThe head-smashing trend was a big one this year. In the Westworld episode \"The Stray,\" the titular host goes rogue and wanders off his intended course, eventually committing the robot equivalent of suicide by repeatedly smashing his head in with a rock. \n1. Negan killing Abraham and Glenn, The Walking Dead \n... Duh. There's no contest as to the grisliest TV moment of 2016 -- and maybe ever. The Season 7 premiere of The Walking Dead left fans stunned, heartbroken, angry and, well, grossed-out. As if the notion of smashing not one, but two people's skulls in with a barbed-wire-covered baseball bat isn't disgusting enough on its own, the show offered viewers a close-up look at Glenn's popped-out eyeball, resting among the gruesome remains of what was once his head. \nWhat TV moments grossed you out the most in 2016?",

      "text": "No Peace, No Pussy: A Brief History of Political Sex Strikes \nWell, there's a bit of a craze emerging, brought to us – I'd imagine – by the same people who introduced yoga, meditation and other new-age mysticism to the western world. It's called a \"gong bath\", and despite the name there is no water or nudity involved. Instead, a group of people lie on the ground while a shaman-like leader bangs gongs over you. The Independent called it \"the zen new craze\" last month, and the New York Times said the practice is moving \"from the metaphysical to the mainstream\". If you needed further proof, Robert Downey Jr, Charlize Theron and Robert Trujillo of Metallica are all reportedly bang into it. \nTo me, a gong bath is of particular appeal because it taps into my hippy inner-core. In my day-to-day life I take pride in a bitchy cynicism that guides both my work and personal life. But I spent much of my youth with my weekend-hippy parents, going to festivals called things like \"Earth Spirit\" to hang out in drum circles and drink chai out of melamine cups. I feel a certain affinity with the hippy-nonsense community; when I see group of patchouli-smelling, middle-aged stoners bashing on a djembe, it feels a bit like home. \nSo instead of my normal afterwork practice of throwing my bag down in the hall, kicking my shoes across the front room and settling in for a night of tortellini and Transparent , I instead headed to a community centre in Peckham to see if a gong bath could chill me out. \nI arrived at Bosse & Baum gallery in Peckham, where mats had been arranged on the floor and there was hot ginger tea awaiting us. Already my inner hippy felt sated. We needed the tea because it was the coldest day of the year, and two gas burning heaters were doing little to heat the space. Our leader would be Leo, who quietly assembled his two impressive-looking gongs at the front. \nAfter everyone arrived the lights were switched off and we all took a mat. Before we began in earnest, Leo explained to us what we'd be doing. Despite my preconceptions, Leo was not a new-age type in the traditional sense: he was wearing a scarf and had thick, slick hair. Also, he was as posh as posh can be; every time he spoke about the positive energy in the gong I felt like he was really saying, \"I've made some life choices that make my parents feel absolutely sick.\" \nLeo says that a gong bath is like a shortcut to meditation, which sounded great to me, because I really don't have the patience or temperament for meditation. Then he said that, before the bath, we would do 30 minutes of yoga to get us in the right frame of mind, which sounded bad to me, because of the effort it would take. \nAfter a few breathing exercises we were told to shake with our arms in the air – to shake with wild abandon, non-stop, for half an hour. Leo took the shaking very seriously: \"KEEP YOU ARMS STRAIGHT!\" he would shout, \"CHALLENGE YOURSELF! IF YOU GET COMFORTABLE CHANGE HOW YOU SHAKE, NEVER GET COMFORTABLE!\" It quickly became apparent that constantly shaking is incredibly tiring, but also does a weird thing to your brain where you can't really think about anything else but the shaking, because it's taking all your energy just to keep moving. In that moment it was impossible to want to check my phone or worry about work, because I had someone screaming \"MOVE YOUR BODY IN UNEXPECTED WAYS!\" at me. \nI felt brilliant after the shaking: energised and exhausted and weirdly calm. When it finally ended there was a sense of sweet relief, and then we lay down on the mat and started to hear the music. Leo, it turns out, has the voice of an angel, and sung with the gongs and various other accordions, creating this weird harmonic sound that seemed to reach inside you. \nI realised then that you have to be incredibly musical to lead a gong bath, because this guy was like emulating the different harmonics it was making with his voice. For about three minutes I started to see cool patterns as the different sounds passed around the room. I thought what everyone must think in these situations: 'This would be very cool if you were high.' \nThen I must have fallen sound asleep, because the next thing I knew Leo was holding the gong directly above me and banging away. Suddenly the mystical properties didn't feel so strong as I tried to work out how long I'd been out for and if everyone had heard me snoring. I must have been dead to the world for a while because, about ten minutes later, it all finished. We took a final few minutes to breathe and then the lights came on. \nAfterwards, I spoke to Leo about how he got into gonging. \nVICE: How did you get into this? Doesn't seem like something you can quickly pick up. Leo: Five years ago I went to this amazing workshop – they were teaching yoga, but at the end they did a gong bath, and I actually preferred that to the yoga. I thought, 'I need to get one of these.' So I got a little one and just played on my own, and did that for quite a while on my own – about ten months. It's done a lot for me; it's had a massive impact on my nervous system, my movements, the way I think. \nWhat's one thing that's changed since the introduction of the gong into your life? I feel much more fluid. It reminds me of the element of water. The vibrations are so strong and, for me, the gong is quite feminine. I was much more angular before; now I think I round things off more. I'm calmer. Even though it's a wall of sound and you feel like you have every single note at the same time, somehow, in my composition skills, it's improved them – it's made me more creative. It's stopped me trying to be clever, because you can't be clever: it's just a disc that you strike with a mallet. \nI thought this would be more of a mystic thing or a new-age thing, but your background is more musical. I think healing therapy with music is very old, if you look at ancient shamans who sing and chant for hours. But it's also very fashionable at the moment. And these gongs are not from South East Asia; they're European musical gongs. The gongs you get in Bali tend to produce one note. These guys, when you strike them, you get so many notes. That's what makes them amazing, in my opinion. \nSo it can be quite linked to music therapy? Other practices are heavy on the yoga and you get a little bit of gong at the end. I focus more on the gong because there tends to be less bullshit. Words can only take you so far. That's why sound is so cool, because it's beautiful. \nSometimes when I do something like this I just think, 'Well, is this properly working? Am I relaxed, or am I just trying to be relaxed? Oh shit I'm thinking so hard about being relaxed.' Well, I mean, I don't think it's possible to have no thoughts. Some people go places and don't realise. They fall asleep and they don't realise they were. I think it's a bit of a dark area, and it's better not to over-analyse the experience. It's beneficial regardless of what the mind wants to say. Leo \nDo you have thoughts when you do it? I have lots of thoughts. Whether I'm playing or receiving, because my partner is trained too, so we give it to each other and that's really nice. But with several sessions you do learn to let go and ease into the sound as well. \nYou said at the beginning that it was a shortcut to meditation. I can see why that would be appealing – meditation seems like a lot of hard work. I disagree with the idea at having to work at meditation. There's a lot of pressure around that word. I don't think anyone in London knows how to meditate. There are probably a few people in the world who really know how to meditate, but before that comes concentration – being able to focus your mind. I can't really do that; I don't think some of my teachers can do that. So this really is a fast track to observing some of the feelings that you have. It's really like we're throwing you in a cage with some wild animals and there's nothing you can do. You're really courageous in a way, because it can be quite intense, it really comes over you. § \nI didn't feel thrown in a cage, and when I left the gong bath I wasn't sure I was really feeling any different. But then, that evening, I managed to process all the stuff I had to do the following day in a clear way, I felt kind of calm in myself; I didn't have that grizzly post-TV-binge feeling. Even days later, I think I felt more positive about life. \nPerhaps you wouldn't be able to bring yourself to do this; perhaps your inner cynic is just too strong. Perhaps you think there's nothing three pints of Guinness and a Westworld before bed can't sort. But I say: embrace your inner-hippy. Lie on the floor in a cold community centre and see how it makes you feel. Maybe you'll find out that you've never known true relaxation until a man in a scarf shouts \"KEEP SHAKING, WITH YOUR ARMS, SH KING!\" at you.",

      "text": "Netflix Updates App with More Efficient Mobile Encodes for Downloads GO Both the Android and iOS apps have been updated Dec 6, 2016 05:15 GMT · By Andrei Vlad · Share: It's been less than a week since Netflix introduced the option to download its shows so you can watch them offline, and now another major update brings some improvements to this specific new feature. Since the offline download feature is mostly meant for those who prefer to watch movies and TV shows on their smartphones/tablets while on the move , Netflix thought it would be great to improve the download speed or shrink the size of the files needed to be downloaded. The latest update for Netflix is focused on delivering more efficient video encodes targeted towards low-bandwidth Internet connections. Basically, Netflix introduced two new types of mobile encodes: AVCHi-Mobile and VP9-Mobile. These new encodes will only be available when watching or downloading movies on mobile devices. According to Netflix, the improvements in the new bitstreams fall into three categories: new video compression formats, more optimal encoder settings, and per-chunk bitrate optimization. Thanks to the new changes combined, Netflix users should get better video quality for the same bitrate compared to the service's current streams (AVCMain). But there's more, as Netflix has announced that the latest update also brings a new set of optimal encoder settings. These new settings will allow Netflix's engineers to further improve compression efficiency. VP9-Mobile streams One of the new improved encoder settings refers to increased random access picture period, which is a parameter that trades off encoding efficiency with granularity of random access points. Also, there are more consecutive B-frames or longer Alt-ref distance, which should allow the encoder to flexibly choose more B-frames in H.264/AVC or longer distance between Alt-ref frames. This is especially beneficial for slowly changing scenes. Lastly, there's more exhaustive mode evaluation, which allows an encoder to evaluate more encoding options at the expense of compute time. Netflix confirmed that it has started to re-encode its catalog last month, in order to generate the new mobile bitstreams, but it hasn't yet finished. The good news is the new mobile encodes are already being used in the downloads feature, but in the not so distant future they will be used for mobile streaming as well.

      "text": "I Did a Gong Bath to See If It's a Better Way to Chill Than Gorging on Netflix By Sam Wolfson \nExecutive Editor \nDecember 6,   \nThis article originally appeared on VICE UK. \nAs a young person, there can be a lot to worry about. Soaring rents , low-pay , shitty jobs , mental health problems , romantic disasters and a sinking sense that we'll never make anything of ourselves, to name a few. \nWe all have a lot on our plates right now, and for that reason we all regularly need time to chill out. We give this cute names, like \"duvet day\" or \"me time\", but basically we just mean microwaving some dinner, lying flat on the sofa and watching Netflix until it prompts us to tell it that yes, we are still alive and yes, we would like to continue streaming the current episode of How Clean Is Your Crime Scene . \nTV binging feels like it should be good for your temperament, but often leaves you feeling sort of empty and alone. As you pull yourself off the sofa and into bed after four hours of watching old 30 Rock , you feel guilty, like you just had a wank over some particularly grizzly porn. And this isn't just a weird feeling; a study released earlier this year found that people who binge watch TV are more likely to experience anxiety, depression and stress. \nSo if having a relaxing night in isn't actually relaxing, what are the other options? I know some people read books in the bathtub, but who are those people, really? Mums and nerds. What about the rest of us? What's a good way for us to properly unwind?",

      "text": "luke cage season netflix marvel More It was basically a foregone conclusion, but Marvel Entertainment and Netflix made it official this week: Luke Cage will be back for a second season.\nOne of the most-watched original series on Netflix, and the recipient of extremely positive reviews from critics and general audiences, Luke Cage debuted September 30 on Netflix and was the third solo series to come out of Marvel’s partnership with the streaming video service. Although the announcement video that confirmed the series’ return didn’t reveal the exact date when star Mike Colter will return as the titular, steel-skinned superhero, it did offer a nice reminder that Pop’s Barber Shop — a central location in the Harlem-based show — is indeed staying open for business.\nMore: Everybody’s always smiling in ‘Luke Cage: Family Matters’ sitcom mashup video\nAlways forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr\n— Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016\nAlong with Colter in the lead role, Luke Cage also starred Simone Missick ( The Road to Sundance ) as Misty Knight, who will return for the upcoming crossover miniseries The Defenders . That series will bring together many of the main characters and supporting cast from Daredevil , Jessica Jones , Luke Cage , and the upcoming Iron Fist series.\nThe first season of Luke Cage also featured Emmy-nominated House of Cards actor Mahershala Ali as the first season’s villain, Frank Whaley ( Pulp Fiction ) as police detective Rafael Scarfe, Theo Rossi ( Sons of Anarchy ) as Shades, and Alfre Woodard ( Cross Creek ) as Mariah Dillard. Rosario Dawson, who appeared in both Daredevil and Jessica Jones , reprised her role as Claire Temple.\nCheo Hodari Coker ( Notorious , NCIS: Los Angeles ) served as the showrunner on the first season of the series and also penned the scripts for the first two episodes, but it’s unknown whether he’ll return for the second season.\nThe next series to debut in the shared universe of Marvel’s Netflix shows will be Iron Fist , which will be available March 17, 2017.\n'Stranger Things' director/producer Shawn Levy enters 'Uncharted' territory Sweet Christmas!

      "text": "by Terry Diamond\nThis past week the CW had their huge four night crossover event. Crossing over all of their DC T.V. shows turned out to be a huge ratings success. CW/DC have been crossing over the shows on the network ever since the debut of the Flash in 2014, but never to this magnitude. For CW’s fan service of a four night crossover (where we saw heroes pitted against each other and aliens), the network received a reward of a krypton like explosion in ratings. No matter your view on each episode, what cannot be denied are the huge jump in ratings for each of the shows. Not everyone who tuned in for the crossover event will return for the following episodes, but keeping even a fraction of those viewer would be a continued victory. DC’S four night crossover had as many flaws as easter eggs, but it is their effort that is to be commended. So the question is; why is Marvel/ABC/Netflix not giving fans the same reason to rush to the T.V, sets?\n Now Agents Of Shield has tried its hardest in the name of fan servicing, appearances from Samuel L. Jackson, references to the larger MCU, and this year a story arc that includes Ghost Rider. However it seems Marvel/ABC is missing out on a huge ratings grab by not having a crossover event with the majorly successful Marvel/Netflix Defenders series. We will most likely never see the likes of Robert Downey Jr, or Chris Evans jump over to AOS, but I could easily imagine the Netflix & ABC stars popping up on the others shows. The results could be a cross platform mega success, with Netflix viewers jumping to ABC, and Netflix getting a subscription bump from network viewers discovering characters like Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Punisher, and Daredevil for the first time on the small screen. What do you all think, would you want to see a AOS/Defenders crossover? Is Marvel T.V. dropping the ball by not bringing these shows together?\n Don’t forget to catch new episodes of the Panel Of Amateurs podcast every Monday on YouTube, FaceBook, and Soundcloud!!!\nFollow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/panelofamateurs\nFind us on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuv2eADbjEHlOcIHTrLX-6A",

      "text": "Netflix becomes top-grossing iOS app after offline viewing switch Netflix becomes top-grossing iOS app after offline viewing switch Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + For the grand relief of carriers worldwide, Netflix finally went on a limb and allowed offline viewing of certain content from its platform on your mobile devices. After all, the forecast for the average monthly mobile data consumption predicts it to hit 20+ GB in the not-so-distant future, mostly due to the proliferation of Netflix streaming and the like. Downloading a few episodes of your favorite show to watch on the go via your home or office Wi-fi will certainly relieve some of the carrier networks' pressure, and go a long way towards saving your data caps for another day. It's barely been a week since the offline download happened, and Netflix was the top-grossing app in the App Store for the first time the other day, beating such stalwarts like Candy Crush Saga, and other subscription heroes like Spotify. Granted, a big part of this Netflix achievemnt is the fact that Apple introduced in-app subscriptions a year ago, and Netflix has grown from $55,000 to the whopping $2.9 million in weekly revenue from the App Store. Back in June, Apple said that it will cut its piece of the pie to 15% if the subscribers keep it going for at least a year, too.",

      "text": "Netflix Is The Top Grossing App In The US After Announcing Offline Playback  09 PST \nAfter hinting at their plans to look into offering offline playback functionality , Netflix went ahead and did it by launching the feature towards the end of November . Basically what this means is that users can now save shows to watch offline, meaning that on the plane or when they’re traveling without access to the net, they’ll still be able to enjoy their videos. \nTurns out it was a great move by Netflix because according to the data from SensorTower (via 9to5Mac ), it seems that Netflix has managed to become the top grossing app for iOS devices in the US. This is the first time that the app has managed to achieve this status and it has been suggested that the offline playback functionality helped launch the app into that number one spot. \nWe suppose it is possible that many users were resisting subscribing to the service as it did not offer the feature when other services did. Of course it is also possible that there are other reasons why the app managed to hit the number one spot, such as its original programming and the upcoming launch of new original TV series. In fact Netflix recently announced their plans to double the number of original programming come 2017 . \nFiled in Apple > Cellphones > General . Read more about Apps and Netflix . Related Articles",

      "text": "Netflix Details the Tech It Uses to Optimise Quality, Size of Video Downloads The download feature was introduced last month Netflix has become top-grossing iPhone app in US for the first time Company devised new encoding technique to reduce file size \nLast month, popular video streaming service Netflix announced that it will allow users to download select videos and watch them offline. This feature had been requested by users for a long time but it seems like the company delayed it in order to make sure that the size of the downloaded content doesn't end up consuming too much storage on the user's device, whilst also maintaining quality. \nIn order to reduce the size of the videos that are available for download on most Android devices, Netflix is making use of Google's open source video codec named VP9, as reported by Variety . The video codec used by Netflix for its streaming service is H.264/AVC but the company opted for VP9 as it allows the same video quality to be delivered for significantly less data. However, things turned out to be much difficult for Netflix when it came to iOS devices, which don't support the VP9 video codec, as the company had to use a different codec altogether (i.e. H.264/AVC). In order to reduce file size, the company devised a technique in which it divides each video into one-to-three-minute-long segments that are further analysed by computers and encoded according to the complexity of their visuals.\nEven though this technique is complicated, it allows the videos to take around 19 percent less space and effectively allow users to store more content on their iOS devices. In case of Android devices, the file size is reduced significantly by around 36 percent due to the use with VP9 codec. \nThe company has reportedly said that the same approach will also enable it to reduce data usage while streaming the content when it is implemented in next few months. However, as per a report by 9to5Mac, Netflix has clarified that this technique doesn't always reduce the storage size but ends up improving the video quality in those cases. \nInterestingly, Netflix became the top-grossing iPhone app in the US for the first time right after the introduction of the offline download feature, as per a report by data analytics firm SensorTower. \"Netflix has seen its app's revenue increasing steadily, even as it faces challenges in growing its user base in the US,\" the report said.

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nHere’s your Peak TV update if you haven’t been keeping up: in 2016, over 450 scripted shows aired on broadcast, cable, premium, and streaming networks combined. In 2017 that’s projected to go over 500. Netflix isn’t helping. The giant streaming service currently has 30 original series, but their Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos recently said at a conference for UBS Global Media & Communications that Netflix plans to add 20 more shows in 2017. \nAccording to Variety , that number will include both scripted and unscripted. Sarandos said that their upcoming original content will expand 1,000 hours from where it is currently, but “that’s a conservative measure right now.” \nNetflix made some waves recently by announcing that it would be spending $6 billion in 2017 to help fund this push for more original content, which is pretty mind-boggling. The company has said its aim is to have 50% of its library be original works. It also recently announced that it would be allowing subscribers to download its TV shows and movies, which is huge. Image via Netflix \nSo what does all of this mean for Peak TV? Conceivably, as more people would rather pay for Netflix than cable or even other streaming services, Netflix could become your only content provider. With a move to include more unscripted shows — especially ones based on international hits like Ultimate Beastmaster — Netflix could be a one-stop shop for entertainment. But as part of the larger ocean of television right now, it just feels like oversaturation. However, \n“Unscripted television is a very interesting business,” Sarandos said, saying the company is focusing on shows that are “more likely to travel internationally.” For example, “Ultimate Beastmaster” will feature athletes and announcers from six different countries (the U.S., Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Germany and Japan). “When ‘Beastmaster’ hits in Korea, they’ll never have seen anything like it.” \nOverseas licensing is a huge presumed source of income for Netflix. But Sarandos also talked about why Stranger Things was such a unique hit for them because it was developed in-house and produced fully by Netflix. \n“I don’t want to get trapped in that model” of producing every original series or film in-house. He cited the Netflix reboot of “Gilmore Girls,” which was licensed from Warner Bros. “Warner Bros. owned the IP. There was no model I could do that myself. We had a unique ability to do it,” Sarandos said. “What we try to do is take very measured swings for the fences, if that’s possible.” \nAs far as live or sports-related coverage, Sarandos says that’s not of interest at the moment because Netfilx’s platform isn’t set up for that. “Today, don’t look for us to be bidding for league rights,” he said. But in the most Netflix-way possible, added: “league creation might be interesting.” Related Content",
