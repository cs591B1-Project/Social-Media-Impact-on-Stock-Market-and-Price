Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "2 hours ago ) Netflix has announced on Twitter that it will release three new comedy specials from Dave Chappelle . No release dates have yet been revealed. One of the specials is an original set filmed exclusively for Netflix, while the remaining two are from “Chappelle’s personal comedy vault” and were filmed at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Paladium. The comedian’s last special, Dave Chappelle: For What It’s Worth, was released in 2004. Chappelle recently mounted a comeback, hosting “Saturday Night Live ” and delivering a scathing monologue about Donald Trump as well as resurrecting several of his “Chappelle’s Show” characters in a “ The Walking Dead ”-themed skit. News: 3 new Dave Chappelle comedy specials, coming soon. pic.twitter.com/OzrDukBPk6 — Netflix US (@netflix) November 21, 2016",

      "text": " Google+\nScott Roth/Invision via AP\nDave Chappelle.\nAP November 21, 2016\nNEW YORK (AP) — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017.\nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials ‘‘come directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault,’’ Netflix said.\nAdvertisement\nChappelle’s comedy career includes movie roles in ‘‘The Nutty Professor,’’ ‘’Con Air’’ and ‘‘Blue Streak.’’ In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, ‘‘Chappelle’s Show,’’ until his abrupt exit in its third season.\nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC’s ‘‘Saturday Night Live,’’ mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.",

But there’s light among the dark clouds, home theater PC lovers: Microsoft announced today that Windows 10 now supports 4K Netflix streams, just in time for the new Gilmore Girls reboot.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth . \nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura , Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" \nNetflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock , who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com ",

Luckily, the folks at Netflix are throwing up some decent content to accompany me on self-imposed hiatus from the outside world. I saw Gabriel Iglesias live a few months ago, so I’m definitely looking forward to his new special dropping on the 20th, and obviously I’ll be binging the new season of Fuller House .

(Photo: NBC, Will Heath, NBC) \nThree new Dave Chappelle specials are coming to Netflix in 2017. \nEarlier this month, the comedian made his return to TV, hosting Saturday Night Live on Nov. 12. On Monday, Netflix announced the release of three new specials with Chappelle, with premiere dates yet to be announced. \nFor the first special, Chappelle will reunite with director/producer Stan Lathan, who led the comedian's past hits, Killin’ Them Softly (HBO) and For What It's Worth (Showtime), for an original stand-up special exclusively on Netflix. \nThe second two concert specials, also directed by Lathan, represent Chappelle’s first concert specials in 12 years, containing previously-unseen footage from two shows at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium, and will be released simultaneously by Netflix. Watch: Dave Chappelle gives an iconic 'SNL' monologue, wishes Trump luck \nThe three Netflix projects are Chappelle's first TV specials since For What It’s Worth aired in 2004. Since his controversial departure from Chappelle's Show in 2005, the comedian has resumed touring, performing over 500 concerts since 2013. His recent SNL hosting stint earned the show its highest ratings in three years. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fLtmS6",

Obviously, the company is expecting a colossal sized return on their investments and they expect Rock, as well as Chappelle’s shows to bring in major numbers. \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital and now more than ever, essential,” said Netflix’s VP Lisa Nishimura. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.” \nSo far, there hasn’t been any word on when we’ll see the specials, but hopefully at least one will be released in the first half of 2017.

      "text": "Fans of the TV show “Gilmore Girls” are already excited that the show’s revival miniseries “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” airs this week. \nBut this Netflix-only series may not be the end of Lorelai and Rori. \nThe two actresses who play the main characters revealed as much in an interview with Metro, saying they’re refusing to rule out another round of episodes. \n“It’s hard to say,” Lauren Graham, who plays Lorelai, told Metro. “I love it so much that I would just want to do what’s best for the show. I think what we’ve done was such a great piece, this miniseries to me was incredibly gratifying.” \nShe also said that the show’s creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, always planned for the show to fit a “Sherlock” style show, where the plot moves throughout time and doesn’t stay stuck to one constant story model. \n“Amy always had the Sherlock model in mind,” Graham said, according to Metro. “Some years it’s three, some years it’s one, some years they go back in time. So perhaps we need to go back in time? I don’t know, it’s hard to say.” \nBut there may be some more evidence out there that “A Year in the Life” won’t be the end. \nThe show’s creator always intended on finishing the show with four final words that were to be spoken at the end of the series finale. But Sherman-Palladino left the show after its sixth season, and the four words were never spoken in the seventh season finale , according to Hello Giggles, a social news website. \nSherman-Palladino returned to the helm for the Netflix series, so her plans could finally be realized. She said on a press tour in July that she hopes people don’t fast-forward to the end of the story to hear those final four words. \n“It would be great if people who wanted to see the last four words first got some therapy first and got rid of that inclination,” she said during a panel at Netflix’s TCA press tour. “It really is a journey. It’s going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page. I would hope that people would want to take the whole trip. It’s a fun trip. It’s worth it.” \nBoth Alexis Bledel, who plays Rori, and Graham said that the final four words weren’t included in the script. \nBased on the mystery surrounding those final four words, fans are holding their breath about what may happen after the Netflix miniseries ends. \n“Of course this all depends on how 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' ends and what those fated four last words reveal,” according to HelloGiggles. “Perhaps things will get all tied up or perhaps things will be left open for more visits to Stars Hollow.” +",

      "text": "Hosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth . Dave Chappelle \nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock , who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12.",

Save Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images \nAfter stepping off the Saturday Night Live stage, the return of Dave Chappelle includes three comedy specials for Netflix . The streaming service announced today that three selections from the popular comedian would be released together in 2017. While details are somewhat scarce for now, Netflix did reveal one of the shows will be a new stand-up special while the other two will be unreleased material from performances at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium. \nThis announcement comes on the heels of reports that Netflix shelled out $40 million for two stand-up specials from Chris Rock. It's also home to comedy material from Dana Carvey, Aziz Ansari , Patton Oswalt, Ali Wong, Hannibal Buress and many others. The streaming service has been keen on adding fresh stand-up material to its library of original content for some time now and the addition of Chappelle will certainly boost viewership next year.

      "text": "Dave Chappelle to release 3 Netflix comedy specials in 2017 ASSOCIATED PRESS \nASSOCIATED PRESS Enlarge \nNEW YORK — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials “come directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault,” Netflix said. \nChappelle’s comedy career includes movie roles in “The Nutty Professor,”‘‘Con Air” and “Blue Streak.” In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, “Chappelle’s Show,” until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "Video-streaming services continue to push and shove each other in a battle for the most original programming. While each has its fair share of original TV series and feature-length films, Netflix has run away with the crown for at least one sub-genre of content: stand-up comedy. As if the service doesn't already have enough stand-up specials, now Netflix is going all-in by inking a deal with Dave Chappelle.\nThe deal, announced very simply via a Tweet on Monday, appears to include three stand-up comedy specials, as opposed to any sketch-based programming like Chappelle's popular Comedy Central series. According to a Variety report , two of those specials have already been taped and are sitting in Chappelle's vault: one from an April 2015 performance at Austin City Limits Live and the other from March 2016 at the Hollywood Palladium.\nVariety reports that those two will be released simultaneously at some point next year, while the third special will be a newly recorded performance with no scheduled Netflix release date.\nThe announcement follows Netflix's exclusive deal with comedian Chris Rock in October for two of his own stand-up specials, the first of which will be taped sometime in 2017. This one-two punch of stand-up deals is particularly notable since these comedians exploded in part because of riotous, widely circulated stand-up specials that originally aired on HBO. Netflix is clearly gunning for the crown that HBO once held uncontested during the premium-cable era. And while that channel has held up pretty well in a video-streaming era, its stand-up output has become anemic in the past two years, with only Amy Schumer and Louis CK specials coming to HBO in 2016.\nFor the most part, Chappelle has been publicly silent since the dramatic end of his Comedy Central series ten years ago. His brief dalliance with social media ended in 2012 with an official Twitter sign-off, for example. Still, Chappelle remains an American cultural force, as evidenced by quick sell-outs of his few, recent stand-up comedy tours and his brilliant return to sketch comedy in the first SNL episode that aired after the US Presidential election. Chappelle's tours have included strictly enforced rules about audience recordings and heckling (so YouTube can't satiate fans 'til these specials arrive), but those restrictions didn't stop a dirtbag attendee from throwing a banana at the comedian the week before his Austin City Limits special was filmed. We'll have to wait until next year to see whether Chappelle's jokes about the fruit-chucker made that Netflix special's final reel.",

      "text": "Stumble \nNEW YORK -- Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years -- a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials “come directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault,” Netflix said. Dave Chappelle upset his stand-up comments were taken as pro-Trump \nChappelle’s comedy career includes movie roles in “The Nutty Professor,”‘’Con Air” and “Blue Streak.” In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, “Chappelle’s Show,” until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics. © 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nIn case you needed a friendly reminder that Disney’s deal with Netflix is the gift that keeps on giving, the streaming service announced that Captain America: Civil War will be dropping on the platform at the end of December. Excelsior! \nEarlier this year, the two companies struck a deal that would make Netflix the exclusive pay-TV home of Disney movies — from Disney Animation to Pixar to Marvel. Zootopia premiered on the platform earlier this year, and now Civil War , Marvel’s superhero extravaganza, is next in line. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story will also follow suit, as Lucasfilm is part of the deal. \nIn case you don’t live and breathe Marvel, there are some other titles coming to Netflix in December, too. The Angry Birds Movie (if you didn’t feel like spending money on a theater ticket, now’s your chance to watch it), season 1 of Guillermo del Toro ’s Trollhunters , and the Barack Obama biopic Barry are a few. \nWatch a highlight reel of the new additions and see the full list below.

      "text": "\nOrigin stories are still en vogue these days despite both the general tiredness of the genre and there being fewer and fewer heroic subjects whose pasts-as-prologue we haven’t seen retold in dramatic fashion.\nSo while we are all intimately acquainted by this point with how Bruce Wayne became the Dark Knight (seriously, if I have to see that ‘pearls-falling-on-pavement while gunshots ring out and the Waynes get murdered’ scene one more time, I will officially abandon any and all caped crusaders), you might be less familiar with the backstory of America’s first black president, Barack Obama.\nAnd given the new president about to take up in the Oval (and no doubt gild it beyond all recognition), now might be a great time watch the origin story of ‘Barry’ before he became President Barack Obama. \nVia Netflix:\nA young Barack Obama, known to his friends as “Barry,” arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. In a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates.Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later.\nWatch the trailer below and check out the film which starts streaming on December 16.\n\nThe post Watch ‘Barry’ Before He Became the First Black President in Trailer for Netflix’s Barack Obama Biopic appeared first on Towleroad .\n",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Shares of Netflix ( NFLX ) are higher by $3.32, or 3%, at $118.53, after Brean Capital ’s Alan Gould initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating, and a $145 price target, writing that the company “has created an unstoppable lead in the internet TV business and is positioned to dominate the business long term.”\nThe company’s vast spending — it will spend $25 billion annually in five years from now, he estimates — will be a “content moat” to competition, and though it looks expensive as a stock now, after 15 years, it will have 300 million users around the world and $19 in revenue per user, for a 29% Ebit margin and $25 per share in EPS.\nJust think of how much they’re spending:\nNetflix will add almost $9 billion of content to its streaming library this year, up from less than $4 billion in 2014, and we project the company could be spending over $25 billion annually in 10 years. The company is trying to capture a global first mover advantage providing the best content and service. Netflix has entered the virtuous circle that HBO used to claim – the more subscribers it has the more it can spend on great content, leading to more subscribers, which in turn, allows it to spend even more on content, and so on. Netflix can now amortize that content over 83 million paying subs, growing to over 100 million next year and a projected 200 million in the next decade. To put the $9 billion in context, Time Warner is spending an estimated $12.4 billion this year on programming costs between HBO ($2.2 billion), Turner ($4.1 billion) and Warner Brothers at ($6.1 billion); CBS (CBS $60.00, Buy) will spend about $6 billion including approximately $1.2 billion on the NFL and $0.4 billion on March Madness; Disney (DIS $98.24, Hold) will spend about $14.8 billion including an estimated $5 billion on sports; and Amazon is reportedly spending an estimated $3 billion on content. IHS Technology estimates global TV program expenditures were $130 billion last year with a little more than one third from North America. NFLX reportedly spent $10 million per episode for The Crown, similar to the reported budget of HBO’s Game of Thrones, and with cost overruns Baz Luhrmann’s The Get Down reportedly cost $16 million per episode, or $190 million for the 12-episode first season that NFLX is splitting between 2016 and 2017. CEO Reed Hastings compares the $100 million per hour that studios spend on the most expensive theatrical movies with the top $10 million per hour TV shows and speculates what a $20 million per hour TV show would look like. We recognize that great story telling is more important than costs, but if there is a discernible difference to spending more, NFLX could begin to create a competitive edge. \nJust like Amazon.com ( AMZN ), this stock is being valued on long-term potential of earnings, he thinks:\nIn the US market, it has captured a 45% share of broadband homes in nine years and should generate $1.8 billion of contribution profit. In the five international territories in which it launched service between 2010 and 2013, all are profitable and in aggregate they should generate $500 million of operating profit this year. Based on that history and the fact that its content library is improving and becoming more economical with scale, we have confidence that NFLX should be able to execute as it builds on its global launch from earlier this year. The company has a very flexible model, the more it invests, the less near-term profit it generates but the larger long-term market share it should be building. Not unlike AMZN, we assume the Street will be paying a multiple not on NFLX’s near-term or even medium-term earnings, but more on its long-term earnings potential. Specifically, we look out 15 years and believe NFLX will have 300 million global subscribers, paying about $20 per month, generating a 40% contribution margin. \nHis only real concern, he writes, is, in fact, Amazon’s own spending:\nOur primary competitive concern is Amazon, which provides the content for free as part of its Prime package. Amazon operates in the US, UK, Germany, Japan and is entering India and announced it will release The Grand Tour worldwide. It is reportedly spending $3 billion this year on content vs. NFLX’s estimated $4.8 billion on a P&L basis and $8.8 billion on a cash basis. While we believe NFLX’s higher planned spending should differentiate its service from AMZN and others, we note that AMZN did outbid NFLX for the high profile The Grand Tour with the stars from Top Gear reportedly spending $250 million for 36 episodes, 12 per year for 3 years, or $7 million per episode. In addition to AMZN, there are all of the traditional content and distribution players including HBO, Sky TV as well as consortiums such as Hulu.",

With the shenanigans of this year, we've all earned it.Whether you're pouring your umpteenth mug of hot cider or popping some bottles of Champagne, Netflix has a compelling new selection of original movies and shows to discuss at the dinner table. Skip the Trump talk or election banter: Let's all take a moment to appreciate that there's another Barack Obama biopic headed our way. This one comes in the form of Barry , Netflix's original movie chronicling the coolest president 's college life. Also headed to the streaming service is the Sundance breakout White Girl , season two of Fuller House , and Captain America: Civil War. With this batch of arrivals, we might be able to see 2016 through to its bitter end. See December's arrivals, below. Arriving December 1 Angels in the Snow (2015) Beverly Hills Cop (1984)",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle to unleash 3 Netflix comedy specials in 2017 Updated 1 hr ago ( … ) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "Morgan Baila Long before Netflix existed, I was binge-watching Cinderella as the older sister of a Disney-obsessed sibling. (Okay, I was also into it.) Right after the moment \"Happily Ever After\" scrolled across the screen, I would pop out the tape and put it in our VHS rewinder. Then, we’d shove it back into the VCR and settle down to watch Cindy's rags-to riches-transformation all over again. My fond memories of that era have since been overwritten by the realization that all those princess narratives may not have had the most positive impact on our young brains. Earlier this year, Refinery29 readers told us about their favorite Disney princesses : Coming in first place was the ass-kicking Mulan, followed by the intelligent Belle, and then, the curious Ariel. This trio stands apart from the rest of the bunch because of their strength, independence, and drive. But they also wound up with their own princes charming. In the end, were they really good role models for little girls? I don’t have a fully formed answer to that. Aside from their role-model status, though, I’m wondering just how relatable these characters were. So as a self-described millennial cynic, I decided to consider whether or not seven of the Disney Princesses lead post-fairy-tale ending lives I would actually want to lead. I evaluated their existence based on wardrobe (because clothes tell a lot about a woman), squad (trustworthy sidekicks are crucial), and the presence of an arch frenemy (Haven't we all dealt with someone who has been inherently evil?). I'm putting their love interests aside ( Beast is least relatable bae, obvi ), because this is about the women and their lives.Let's see how they fairest of them all really fared.

(Photo by Scott Roth/Invision/AP, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials “come directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault,” Netflix said. \nChappelle’s comedy career includes movie roles in “The Nutty Professor,””Con Air” and “Blue Streak.” In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, “Chappelle’s Show,” until his abrupt exit in its third season. Earlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "The cast of the Netflix adaptation of \"A Series of Unfortunate Events.\" Joe Lederer | Netflix \nThe many, many, many misfortunes of the Baudelaire children will soon be on Netflix. \nThe media company released a full-length trailer for its adaptation of \"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\" last week, giving fans a taste of what's to come. The children are plucky, the color scheme is Tim Burton-esque and Neil Patrick Harris is reveling in the devilish Count Olaf character. \nThe show is based on the bestselling 13-book children's series, which relates the many bizarre woes of the Baudelaire orphans: Violet, Klaus and Sunny. \nAfter their parents' mysterious deaths, they are sent to live with Olaf, who is determined to steal the fortune they're destined to inherit. The children spend book after book escaping his grasp, and he leaves a trail of murder, arson and other crimes in his wake as he hunts them down. \nOn its face, it doesn't sound like a place for whimsy, but author Daniel Handler has heavily dosed the books with humor and elaborate plots of secret societies and hidden identities. \nHow it will all translate to the screen remains to be seen. In 2004, Nickelodeon Movies made a feature film covering the first three books, starring Jim Carrey as the sinister Count Olaf. It performed well at the box office, but a sequel never materialized and the child actors outgrew their roles. \nNetflix's crack at translating \"Lemony Snicket\" will be released all at once on its streaming service on Jan. 13, 2017. \nThat gives you plenty of time to read the books first. \nSign up to get an exclusive weekly book pick, literary news and event details.

Two of the shows will come from the comedian’s personal comedy vault, from shows that were taped at Austin City Limits and The Hollywood Palladium, respectively. For the third, Chappelle will produce a brand-new special exclusively for Netflix with director Stan Lathan, who worked with Chappelle on two of his previous stand-up specials. This will mark Chappelle’s first concert specials since 2004’s Dave Chappelle: For What It’s Worth. \nPresumably, Netflix waited to see if Chappelle actually showed up for Saturday Night Live last week before making the announcement: Even musical guests A Tribe Called Quest weren’t sure that the host was going to show up . But he did, and Chappelle’s appearance marked a season high for the sketch comedy series and showcased Chappelle (who obviously had a heavy hand in the writer’s room) performing his signature mix of silly and socially relevant comedy. \nTwo of the specials are slated for a simultaneous release in 2017. A release date for the third, yet-to-be-taped special has not been announced. \nSend your Newswire tips to",

Email * 'SNL' Election Skit: Dave Chappelle And Chris Rock Laugh At 'Most Shameful Thing America Has Ever Done' \nFresh off Dave Chappelle’s post-election appearance on Saturday Night Live , Netflix announced Monday it would air three new specials from the comedian in the coming months. \nNetflix did not provide a release date for the new specials. However, Netflix representatives did confirm the specials would be available to stream in Canada. \nAt this point, it's not clear if the new Chappelle specials will focus on new material, look back to classic sketches from Comedy Central's Chappelle's Show, or be some combination of the two. Entertainment Weekly reports the specials will consist of one original stand-up special and two older, never-before-seen shows from Chappelle's \"personal vault, filmed in Los Angeles and Austin. \n“Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix,” said Lisa Nishimura, Netflix’s vice-president of original documentary and comedy, in a press release. \nWhat do you want to see from Chappelle's Netflix specials? Are you surprised by the announcement? Let us know your thoughts in the comments. ",

      "text": "21 Nov 2016 | Rasmus Larsen | To date, the highest possible video quality you could get from Netflix on a PC was 1080p HD. That changes today if you have Windows 10, the Edge browser, and a PC with the most recent Intel processor. Requires Intel Kaby Lake Netflix has offered 4K streaming quality on TV devices such as UHD TVs, media streamers, and more recently game consoles for a few years now. The company also recently introduce HDR10 and Dolby Vision streaming quality.However, PC users have been left out in the cold due to piracy concerns. It is simply too easy to capture a video stream on a PC with the right software.That changes today, says Microsoft. The companys Edge browser will be the first to support Netflix streaming in 4K resolution.- Your binge-watching favorites on Netflix are now available in 4K exclusively on compatible PCs and 2-in-1 devices, on Windows 10. Check out the new streaming experience with Microsoft Edge, the only browser that supports Netflix 4K content, says Microsoft.Besides the Edge browser you also need a PC with a 7th generation Intel Core processor (Kaby Lake). Chances are that you have an older Intel processor in your PC unless you have bought a new one in recent weeks. HEVC decoding and DRM The 7th generation Intel processors come with native HEVC decoding that Netflix is using for 4K, and have the proper DRM mechanisms to lock down video streams.The news was announced by Microsoft and Netflix has not commented on whether other browsers will start supporting 4K streaming later, too. To enjoy Netflixs 4K streams you also need the most costly Netflix subscription plan.Netflix is not the only company who wants to take advantage of the stronger DRM protection in the new Intel processors. Sony recently announced that its Ultra streaming service can be enjoyed in 4K on PCs starting in Q1 2017.If you want a much cheaper solution look for a device such as Chromecast Ultra or Roku.",

The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth.

After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \n  Dave Chappelle About Us",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle is Making Three Stand-Up Specials for Netflix by Dana Eisenberg | 3:27   \nFresh off a hosting gig at Saturday Night Live , Dave Chappelle is going to keep the party going. Netflix announced that they will be releasing three stand-up specials which will be produced by and, of course, starring him. \nIn a statement to Variety , Lisa Nishimura, Netflix’s VP of original documentary and comedy said, “Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential… Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.” \nThat they will be. Chappelle hasn’t done a television special in 12 years, and his SNL performance showed us that he’s definitely still got it. It earned the show its highest ratings in years. \nOne of the specials will be a Netflix original, while the other two are from Chappelle’s own vault. The performances from the vault were filmed at the Austin City Limits venue and the Hollywood Palladium. The specials that have already been filmed will be released next year- the original special does not have a date yet. \n[image via screen grab]",

(Photo by Scott Roth/Invision/AP) Scott Roth Previous Next \nNEW YORK (AP) — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\"''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "Dave Chappelle has cut a deal with Netflix for three new comedy specials.\nThe projects will mark Chappelle’s first standup TV specials in 12 years, and it marks another aggressive push by Netflix in the standup comedy arena.\n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” said Lisa Nishimura, Netflix’s VP of original documentary and comedy. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.”\nThe deal calls for Chappelle and director Stan Lathan to produce an original special for Netflix. Two other unreleased projects will come from Chappelle’s vault — one produced out of the Austin City Limits Live venue, the other from a performance at the Hollywood Palladium.\nThe projects from the vault are set for release simultaneously next year. There’s no premiere date yet for the new special.\nChappelle is coming off a strong performance earlier this month as host of “Saturday Night Live,” which generated the show’s highest ratings in three years. He is among the most prolific and successful touring comics in country, staging some 500 shows during the past three years.\nNetflix made headlines last month by setting a $40 million deal with Chris Rock for two new comedy specials.\nRelated stories\nNetflix's Young Barack Obama Biopic 'Barry' Full Trailer Released (Watch)\nNetflix VP on 'Gilmore Girls' Revival: 'Wherever They Lead, We Will Follow'\nAmazon Gives Quiet Launch to Prime Video in Australia\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

There’s absolutely tons to pick from and with the lineup dominated with Netflix Originals along with top TV and movies, there’s going to be something for everyone on Netflix this Christmas. \nAs always, we’re going to start with a few of our picks as to what you should be looking out for and beyond that we’ll include the complete list of titles coming to Netflix in December 2016. December 2016 Netflix Release Highlights New Movies Highlights \nNetflix dubbed summer 2016 to be the summer of movies and while we’re not quite getting the quantity of what arrived during the summer, we’re certainly seeing as much quality. \nLet’s start off with the big gun. The most recently released Captain America: Civil War will be coming to Netflix on Christmas day bringing with it one of the biggest fight scenes in Marvel history along with Spiderman’s epic reintroduction in the Marvel franchise. \nWe’re also seeing the return of classic movies such as Beverly Hills Cop , Honey I Shrunk the Kids and Toys starring Robin Williams. Speaking of kids, one of the big animation movies of the year in the form of The Angry Birds Movie will also be coming to Netflix streaming in December. New TV Series Highlights \nWhile most of the TV series that are coming to Netflix in December are in the form of Netflix Originals, we’re still getting a few decent third party titles too. Let’s start with the raved about TV mini-series The Eighties which aired on CNN but was actually partly produced by HBO. Yes, that’s right a HBO title (sort of) is coming to Netflix. \nUSA Network’s newest show from this year, Colony will be making its way to Netflix in December too. We’ll also be getting season 5 of the wacky show Comedy Bang! Bang! . New Netflix Original Highlights \nPlenty of variety in the Netflix Original lineup this month. Let’s start with the most anticipated series which is undoubtedly the second series of Fuller House . We’ll once again be returning to the Tanner residence for Christmas and they’ve got plenty in store for us. \nAnimation fans will be happy as Ajin is getting its second season and Guillermo Del Toro’s first Netflix Original title in the form of Dreamworks Trollhunters will be arriving towards the end of the month.

      "text": "Dave Chappelle Is Bringing Three Stand-Up Specials to Netflix  17 PM TV Guide \nHosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth. Dave Chappelle\" data-image-credit=\"Lester Cohen, WireImage\" data-image-alt-text=\"Dave Chappelle\" data-image-credit-url=\"\" data-image-target-url=\"\" data-image-title=\"Dave Chappelle\" data-image-filename=\"161121-news-dave-chappelle-hp-lg.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2016/11/21\" data-image-crop=\"\" data-image-crop-gravity=\"\" data-image-aspect-ratio=\"\" data-image-height=\"506\" data-image-width=\"740\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"\" data-image-watermark=\"\" data-lightbox=\"\">\nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \n  Dave Chappelle About Us",

      "text": "WSFA Public File Dave Chappelle to unleash 3 Netflix comedy specials in 2017 \nNEW YORK (AP) - Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years - a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "share Marvel If Netflix’s additions for next month are anything to go by, December is a time for hot chocolate, celebrating the holidays and watching Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. go head-to-head in Captain America: Civil War . Out of all the new releases hitting the streaming service, Civil War is without question the biggest. The film, which was both a financial and critical success , is a part of Disney’s relatively new deal with Netflix which gives the streaming service exclusive rights to the films after they’re released. Going forward, other Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm movies, along with Disney originals, will also be available to stream exclusively on Netflix. There is a surprising lack of holiday content being added to Netflix, but if you’re looking for some corny, poorly acted, feel-good family programming, Fuller House is set to return for its second season. The continuation of Full House , Fuller House follows eldest Tanner sibling DJ as she, younger sister Stephanie and best friend Kimmie come together to help DJ raise her kids. The first season of the show premiered earlier this year in February, and according to Netflix, quickly became one of its most watched . Although, that statistic was never proven because Netflix refuses to release any actual numbers on any of its series or films. Unfortunately to make room for new movies — and Fuller House — Netflix is also removing some content. American Beauty, Top Gun, and Holes will no longer be available to stream as of next month, so if you’re looking to get in a last minute Shia LaBeouf fix, now’s the time to do it. Here’s everything that’s coming to and leaving Netflix next month. Coming to:",

The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth.

After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \n  Dave Chappelle About Us",

The legendary comedian’s career looks to have been rejuvenated as well, as he and Netflix are teaming up for three TV specials — Chappelle’s first in over a decade. \nAs Variety reports, one special will be an original produced by both Chappelle and the streaming company; a release date hasn’t yet been confirmed. The two others will be unearthed from Chappelle’s archives and are set to premiere on the same date sometime in 2017. \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” said Netflix VP of original documentary and comedy Lisa Nishimura in an official statement. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.” \nChappelle’s last TV special was 2004’s Dave Chappelle: For What It’s Worth , which came just one year before he left the Chappelle Show to pursue other priorities in his life. \nBelow, revisit his hilarious SNL parody of The Walking Dead : \n",

      "text": "Saeed Adyani/Netflix November 21, 2016 | 01:00PM PT \n“Gilmore Girls” is returning to TV via Netflix on Nov. 25, with four new 90-minute episodes titled “ Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life .” Variety spoke with the cast about their favorite “Gilmore” memories and what we can expect from the new episodes. \nWhen Sean Gunn first stepped onto the “Gilmore Girls” set more than 15 years ago, he was just happy to have a role as a DSL installer on a show he had only read, not seen — though the pilot had been shot, the show hadn’t aired yet. \n“The agent I had at the time had recommended I pass on the audition,” Gunn told Variety . “But my manager said it was cool. I understood the tone of the show just from reading it.” The scripts for regular 45-minute episodes of “Gilmore Girls” were 80 pages long, full of long stretches of rapid-fire dialogue. \nBut that didn’t scare Gunn, and thus was born the character of Kirk Gleason — of all the Stars Hollow townies, perhaps the quirkiest. He held every sort of odd job, popped up in every scene that needed a jolt of weird humor. For Gunn, the return of “Gilmore Girls” means the return of all those strange little side stories Kirk would get wrapped up in. “It was a joy to read the new scripts and get excited about all the new little Kirk adventures,” Gunn said. Related Review: ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life’ on Netflix \nThose new adventures remain under wraps until Nov. 25, but Gunn is able to rattle off an impressive list of older ones from memory. “I think my favorite one of all is when Kirk plays Tevye in ‘Fiddler on the Roof,’” he said. “In addition to being super fun for me to do and just really funny, it’s a moving episode where Luke and Lorelai start to really understand they love each other. And they’re waiting in the wings as Kirk’s singing this song.” \nAnd though he was always more of a side player in the original series, trailers for the new episodes have shown a healthy dose of Kirk, indicating a bigger role. “I had a lot of good stuff to do,” is all Gunn will say. \nDon’t expect Kirk to have undergone a total transformation in the eight years since we last saw him: “Kirk is emphatically still Kirk,” Gunn said. \nThe world is a little different, though. Social media, somewhat nascent even when “Gilmore” was ending its initial run, has now been woven into the fabric of everyday life. A character like Kirk would seem to be ripe for some sort of commentary on the subject. “I can’t tell you for sure if Kirk tweets,” Gunn says with a laugh. “I can tell you if Kirk had a Twitter account he would be obsessed with how many followers he has and who is or isn’t following him.” Filed Under:",

      "text": "As President Obama prepares to leave office after eight years, Netflix is presenting Barry , a movie dramatizing the 44th president of United States as a 20-year-old college student in New York City.\nThe movie, set to debut on Netflix on Friday, Dec. 16, stars Australian actor Devon Terrell as the young Obama arriving at Columbia University in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year — a pivotal moment in his life that laid the foundation for his views on race, government, and what it means to be an American. Barry depicts Obama struggling to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates.\nIn the trailer, a fellow student tells Obama that because he’s of mixed race, he can fit in anywhere. “I fit in nowhere,” Obama responds.\nNetflix acquired rights to Barry after its premiere at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. The film’s director, Vikram Gandhi (Kumaré, HBO’s Vice ), who is a Columbia University grad, approached fellow alum Adam Mansbach (author of Go the F— to Sleep ) on the project and Mansbach penned the script.\nVariety ‘s Owen Glieberman called the movie “at once moving and revealing” in his review . “The film is rooted in the murky, drifting, sleep-late-and-get-stoned-and-do-whatever nature of college life that the movies almost never get right,” Glieberman wrote. “This one does, and that’s one reason it feels bracingly authentic.”\n“Barry” is a joint production between Black Bear Pictures and Cinetic Media, produced by Cinetic’s Dana O’Keefe and Black Bear’s Teddy Schwarzman and Ben Stillman. The movie is the first production for Jon Sloss’ Cinetic.\nThe cast of Barry includes Ashley Judd ( Divergent , Double Jeopardy ) and Jenna Elfman ( Friends With Benefits , Big Stone Gap ), along with Anya Taylor-Joy ( The Witch ), Jason Mitchell ( Straight Outta Compton ), Ellar Coltrane ( Boyhood ), and Avi Nash ( Learning to Drive , Silicon Valley ).\nRelated stories\nNetflix VP on 'Gilmore Girls' Revival: 'Wherever They Lead, We Will Follow'\nAmazon Gives Quiet Launch to Prime Video in Australia\nNetflix's 'A Series of Unfortunate Events' Trailer Promises Lots of Misfortune, Neil Patrick Harris (Watch)\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle Is Bringing Three Stand-Up Specials to Netflix Monday Nov 21, 2016 at 3:30 PM Nov 21, 2016 at 6:17 PM TV Guide \nHosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth. Dave Chappelle\" data-image-credit=\"Lester Cohen, WireImage\" data-image-alt-text=\"Dave Chappelle\" data-image-credit-url=\"\" data-image-target-url=\"\" data-image-title=\"Dave Chappelle\" data-image-filename=\"161121-news-dave-chappelle-hp-lg.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2016/11/21\" data-image-crop=\"\" data-image-crop-gravity=\"\" data-image-aspect-ratio=\"\" data-image-height=\"506\" data-image-width=\"740\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"\" data-image-watermark=\"\" data-lightbox=\"\">\nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com Dave Chappelle About Us",

      "text": "1 / 6 This image released by Netflix shows Lauren Graham, left, and Alexis Bledel in a scene from, \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life,\" premiering Friday on Netflix. (Saeed Adyani/Netflix via AP) LOS ANGELES (AP) — The familiar voices float softly from a black screen, as if in a dream.\nThere's Luke, gruffly: \"How many cups have you had this morning?\"\nAnd this parent-child banter: \"Did you do something slutty?\" Rory teasingly asks her mom. \"I'm not THAT happy,\" shoots back Lorelai.\nThankfully, it's not imagined. It's the reality of \"Gilmore Girls,\" returning Friday after a nine-year absence, during which longtime fans pined for what they'd lost and newcomers discovered what they'd missed through reruns.\nOpening-credit snippets of the show's hallmark dialogue kick off Netflix's sequel to the 2000-07 broadcast series with a promise: the characters, their snappy banter and the show's key notes will be honored.\nBut the four-part \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" is aimed at more than true believers, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino said in an interview.\n\"We want it to be something that fans are going to know, but if you haven't watched 'Gilmore' you can come to it fresh and take it on face value: It's a story of three women, an intergenerational, multigenerational story, and you are catching them at times that each of their lives is changing.\"\nThat trio around which the universe rotates consists of devoted single mom Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham), her equally devoted daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) and stern grandmother Emily (Kelly Bishop). As the first chapter opens, Lorelai and Rory are still the belles of fictional Connecticut hamlet Stars Hollow — so perfect, quips Lorelai, it belongs in a snow globe.\nLuke (Scott Patterson), Lorelai's on-again, off-again love is here, as are the supporting characters who gave the show, well, character. That includes official town nudge Taylor (now lobbying for a sewer system); reliably idiosyncratic Kirk (he's just launched Ooober, a non-app version of Uber) and even, in one episode, buoyant chef Sookie (courtesy of film star Melissa McCarthy's return to her TV roots).\nWhatever bliss viewers find in the girl-power dramedy's resurrection may be exceeded only by that of Sherman-Palladino, who wrote and produced it with Dan Palladino, her husband and creative partner on the sequel and the original.\n\"It was literally like no time had passed,\" Sherman-Palladino told a TV critics' news conference. \"It was joyous. It was fun. It was exhilarating. It was the old show. ... It was just like it was meant to continue.\"\nGraham sees \"Gilmore Girls\" as a welcome refuge from hard-edged TV and our prickly modern reality in general.\n\"I think it's because it's extremely comforting in a world that is lacking comfort and has a great choice of shows available that are stressful — great, but stressful, and so this kind of stands out in the way that it did then,\" she said.\nThere's a sad shadow, however, cast by the passing of family head Richard Gilmore. That reflects the December 2014 death of Edward Herrmann, the respected actor who played him in the original series.\n\"We all really felt his loss, and he would have loved it (working on the sequel) so much,\" Graham said in an interview. \"But I think the way the story is handled is a really nice tribute to him.\"\nThe 90-minute episodes follow the seasons and are titled for each, starting with \"Winter.\" While Lorelai and Emily face Richard's death in their own way, they also find their relationship affected by it.\nRory's romantic past is a factor as all of her ex-boyfriends appear in the series \"one way or another,\" said Bledel. So is the character's journalism career, and while Bledel is aware that her character's love life intrigues viewers, she'd like them to consider the complete young woman.\n\"There is so much more to her character that it's great when people focus on those things, on her ambition and her accomplishments and her goals,\" the actress said.\nGiven that all the episodes will be made available at once on streaming service Netflix, Sherman-Palladino sees trouble on the horizon.\nAfter holding close the four words she's long said should end the Gilmore saga (she wasn't in charge of the show's last season on the CW network), she wants viewers to avoid spoiling the experience, either by posting the phrase or by impatiently jumping to the final scene.\n\"It's going to mean a lot more if you've taken the journey, and it's going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page. ... It's a fun trip. It's worth it,\" she said.\nRead More And does it end with \"A Year in the Life\"? Sherman-Palladino plays verbal dodgeball with the question: \"It's what it is right now. We put these together. We told these stories. And now we throw them out to the universe.\"\nLeave it to Kirk — OK, actor Sean Gunn, who plays him — to provide a skewed ray of hope that, perhaps, there will be more \"Gilmore Girls.\"\n\"I don't want to start any rumors, because I don't know,\" Gunn cautioned. \"But to take a step back and address that as a fan of the show, if the interest is there and we can get the scheduling right and Amy and Dan want to do it, I don't know why we wouldn't be able to, really.\"\nSo the miniseries' ending leaves an opening?\n\"The Earth does not get destroyed by a meteor at the end,\" he said, wryly. \"So the possibility of more must live out there somewhere.\"\n___\nLynn Elber is a national television columnist for The Associated Press.

Two of the three specials will feature “never-before-seen” footage “from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault,” while the third one will be an original stand-up performance.

      "text": "In following up on last month’s first look , Netflix returns with the official trailer for Barry . Barry focuses on the college years of Barack Obama, as played by Australian actor Devon Terrell.\nA 20-year-old Barack Obama, known to his friends as Barry, took to New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. Thrust into the middle of a racially-charged environment, a young Obama in turn found himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates.\nAfter initially debuting at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival, Barry will be landing on Netflix on December 16.\n\n",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) - Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years - a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017.\nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said.\nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season.\nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Watch the Trailer for Netflix's New Barack Obama Biopic, \"Barry\" by Jessica Fu • Nov 21, 2016 at 1:08 pm Tweet \nNetflix has released the trailer for its new Barack Obama biopic, Barry . Set in the 1981, the film depicts the college-age president-to-be, played by Devon Terrell, as he moves to New York City and begins his junior year at Columbia University. Featuring an unassuming title and a handsome cast, the movie will present formative moments of young Obama's life and suggest how they shaped the politician he became. \nHere's the synopsis: \nIn a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates. Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later. \nLocal connection of note: Actress Ashley Judd plays Obama's mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, who grew up on Mercer Island. \nBarry is the second Obama biopic of 2016, the president's final year in office. Back in August, the Michelle-Barack rom-com Southside With You gave us a fictionalized account of the first couple's first date. Sydney Brownstone described it as the story that America needed in the midst of the 2016 election. \nThat election is now over and Barry is another opportunity to cast light on Obama's legacy—one that is currently being overshadowed by the generally horrible behavior of his successor . \nThe film premieres December 16 on Netflix.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Shares of Netflix ( NFLX ) are higher by $3.32, or 3%, at $118.53, after Brean Capital ’s Alan Gould initiated coverage of the stock with a Buy rating, and a $145 price target, writing that the company “has created an unstoppable lead in the internet TV business and is positioned to dominate the business long term.”\nThe company’s vast spending — it will spend $25 billion annually in five years from now, he estimates — will be a “content moat” to competition, and though it looks expensive as a stock now, after 15 years, it will have 300 million users around the world and $19 in revenue per user, for a 29% Ebit margin and $25 per share in EPS.\nJust think of how much they’re spending:\nNetflix will add almost $9 billion of content to its streaming library this year, up from less than $4 billion in 2014, and we project the company could be spending over $25 billion annually in 10 years. The company is trying to capture a global first mover advantage providing the best content and service. Netflix has entered the virtuous circle that HBO used to claim – the more subscribers it has the more it can spend on great content, leading to more subscribers, which in turn, allows it to spend even more on content, and so on. Netflix can now amortize that content over 83 million paying subs, growing to over 100 million next year and a projected 200 million in the next decade. To put the $9 billion in context, Time Warner is spending an estimated $12.4 billion this year on programming costs between HBO ($2.2 billion), Turner ($4.1 billion) and Warner Brothers at ($6.1 billion); CBS (CBS $60.00, Buy) will spend about $6 billion including approximately $1.2 billion on the NFL and $0.4 billion on March Madness; Disney (DIS $98.24, Hold) will spend about $14.8 billion including an estimated $5 billion on sports; and Amazon is reportedly spending an estimated $3 billion on content. IHS Technology estimates global TV program expenditures were $130 billion last year with a little more than one third from North America. NFLX reportedly spent $10 million per episode for The Crown, similar to the reported budget of HBO’s Game of Thrones, and with cost overruns Baz Luhrmann’s The Get Down reportedly cost $16 million per episode, or $190 million for the 12-episode first season that NFLX is splitting between 2016 and 2017. CEO Reed Hastings compares the $100 million per hour that studios spend on the most expensive theatrical movies with the top $10 million per hour TV shows and speculates what a $20 million per hour TV show would look like. We recognize that great story telling is more important than costs, but if there is a discernible difference to spending more, NFLX could begin to create a competitive edge.\nJust like Amazon.com ( AMZN ), this stock is being valued on long-term potential of earnings, he thinks:\nIn the US market, it has captured a 45% share of broadband homes in nine years and should generate $1.8 billion of contribution profit. In the five international territories in which it launched service between 2010 and 2013, all are profitable and in aggregate they should generate $500 million of operating profit this year. Based on that history and the fact that its content library is improving and becoming more economical with scale, we have confidence that NFLX should be able to execute as it builds on its global launch from earlier this year. The company has a very flexible model, the more it invests, the less near-term profit it generates but the larger long-term market share it should be building. Not unlike AMZN, we assume the Street will be paying a multiple not on NFLX’s near-term or even medium-term earnings, but more on its long-term earnings potential. Specifically, we look out 15 years and believe NFLX will have 300 million global subscribers, paying about $20 per month, generating a 40% contribution margin.\nHis only real concern, he writes, is, in fact, Amazon’s own spending:\nOur primary competitive concern is Amazon, which provides the content for free as part of its Prime package. Amazon operates in the US, UK, Germany, Japan and is entering India and announced it will release The Grand Tour worldwide. It is reportedly spending $3 billion this year on content vs. NFLX’s estimated $4.8 billion on a P&L basis and $8.8 billion on a cash basis. While we believe NFLX’s higher planned spending should differentiate its service from AMZN and others, we note that AMZN did outbid NFLX for the high profile The Grand Tour with the stars from Top Gear reportedly spending $250 million for 36 episodes, 12 per year for 3 years, or $7 million per episode. In addition to AMZN, there are all of the traditional content and distribution players including HBO, Sky TV as well as consortiums such as Hulu.",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle to unleash 3 Netflix comedy specials in 2017 11/21/16 1:16 PM \nNEW YORK — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials “come directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault,” Netflix said. \nChappelle’s comedy career includes movie roles in “The Nutty Professor,””Con Air” and “Blue Streak.” In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, “Chappelle’s Show,” until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.",
