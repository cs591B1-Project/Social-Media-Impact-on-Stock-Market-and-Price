      "text": "The 8 Worst Things You Can Do at Starbucks, According to a Barista By Brian Beckwith / Spoonuniversity.com \nThe frustration has been brewing inside me. \nThis story originally appeared on Spoonuniversity.com . \nI’ve been working as a Starbucks barista on my campus for over a year now. Don’t get me wrong — I love my job. There are few things that make me happier when someone asks for a suggestion and then ends up loving it, or comes back to thank me because their drink came out great. \nWith that being said, though, there are a handful of things Starbucks customers do that really grind my gears, and I’m sharing this article with the hopes that you can spare your barista the grief and avoid doing them as well. \nRelated: 13 Recipes That Prove You Can Eat Pie for Every Meal of the Day 1. Not saying what size \nI get it, you’re at Starbucks because you need your daily fix of caffeine, and if you’re anything like me, you’re like a zombie before you get it. With that being said, though, more people than you would think don’t say what size drink they want — probably about a third of all customers don’t. \nEven if you don’t know the Starbucks lingo, you can ask for a “large” and we’ll know what it means, but, please, don’t give us some really complicated order without saying what size so we can actually mark the cup as you say it. It just gets really repetitive having to ask customer after customer what size drink they want while trying to remember their orders. 2. Ordering while on your phone \nAlso with ordering, please have the courtesy to get off of your phone for two seconds to communicate your order. Not only is it incredibly rude to be on the phone or glued to your text when trying to order, but chances are we won’t be able to understand you and you won’t be paying attention to us if we ask you a question. So please, hang up with mom before getting in line. 3. Dumping coffee into the trash \nWhen we ask you if you want room for cream in your coffee, it is so that there is space in the cup to put milk in if you wish. That’s not such a hard concept, is it? If not, then why do people ask for no room but then go over and dump half a cup of hot coffee into the trash to add milk? Please stop doing this. The trash bags are already disgusting when we get around to changing them, and dumping liquid in them just makes it worse. 4. “I wanted that iced” \nWe all make mistakes, but if I had a penny for every for every time I heard this one, I could afford all the Starbucks my heart desires. Unless you specify, all of our espresso beverages are made hot. I don’t care if it’s the middle of summer; you need to let us know if you want something iced. We’re happy to remake it for you but it messes up our flow and slows us down, and this could all be avoided by specifying when you order. \nThis also applies to, “I wanted that with soy,” or, “I didn’t want whip on that.” We are baristas, not psychics. \nRelated: “Eating in Moderation” Isn’t as Healthy as You Think 5. “Frappé” \nA “frappé” is a drink at McDonald’s. Starbucks does not have “frappés.” If you order a “frappé” instead of a Frappuccino, you will sound stupid and your barista will judge you, no questions asked. 6. “Is this mine?” \nYou just ordered a small hot drink one minute ago, so, no, this large iced drink is not yours. I don’t get this. You think that all of these people that have been waiting here longer than you are just standing around for fun? This venti Frappuccino with whipped cream is not your tall hot chai tea latte. We make drinks in order, so your order is not going to be ready right after you pay. 7. Being in a hurry \nThis one goes along with the last one. We make drinks in order, so we are not going to prioritize yours just because you are in a hurry. It’s extremely rude to ask the barista to make your drink first because you need to make it across campus in 5 minutes. It’s not our fault that you thought that would be enough time to order Starbucks and make it to your meeting. \nRelated: A Nutrition Student Shares Her Top Picks for Breakfast 8. Iced Caramel Macchiato \nMy last pet peeve is probably the one that bothers me the most. Macchiatos are not supposed to be iced. Macchiato in Italian means “marked,” meaning that your milk is marked with espresso, creating a strong coffee flavor at first that gradually fades into sweet milk. When you order it iced and drink it through a straw, this is already going to be backwards since you are starting at the bottom. \nAnd to make things worse, a piece of me dies every time I watch someone stir their iced caramel macchiato after they get it, combining the layers. Or worse, order it “upside down”. That isn’t a caramel macchiato anymore. It’s an iced latte. If that’s what you want, order that, but why am I wasting my time making a macchiato if you’re just going to mess it up? \nIt’s clear that nobody actually knows what a caramel macchiato is and that they are just ordering it because it sounds cool, but please don’t. If you want to know what a drink is, ask your barista. We love to share our knowledge. \nLong story short, I ask you to please avoid doing these things, in attempt to help keep your barista sane amidst all the crazy, caffeine-deprived people we encounter on a daily basis.

      "text": "1 / 2 Starbucks Debuts 13 New Red Holiday Cups for 2016 Season: Watch! Starbucks just debuted 13 new red holiday cups for the 2016 season — watch the amazing video! More to love! Starbucks just debuted 13 new holiday cups for coffee lovers everywhere — and they are all red. The company released a video of the festive designs via Twitter on Thursday, November 10.\nPHOTOS: Celebrities' Family Holiday Traditions\n\"We crafted coffee. You made it art. Cups warm a hand, beauty warms the heart. #RedCups,\" Starbucks' official Twitter account posted alongside the video.\nThe new cups came from the #RedCupContest last year. \"Last year, we made the red cups. You made them the holidays,\" the clip says. \"Introducing the 2016 Starbucks red cups. Created by our customers all around the world.\"\nPHOTOS: Kardashians' Christmas Cards Over the Years\nFor those upset that last year's plain red cups weren't festive enough for the holidays, these new designs may be more your style. Some of them feature hand-drawn snowflakes, Christmas lights, reindeer, tree ornaments and Santa Claus riding his sleigh. (The 13th cup, which is not shown, is for cold drinks.)\nSo far, the reaction has been positive. \"Love it!\" one commenter wrote. A second added: \"Amazing.\"\nPHOTOS: Celebrities in the Kitchen: Stars Who Love to Cook!\nStarbucks cups have caused outrage before. Most recently, some customers were displeased with a new green cup that featured a mosaic of more than 100 people drawn in one continuous stroke. Many took to social media asking why Santa couldn't be featured instead. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said in a statement that it was meant to create a symbol of unity amid the divided election.\nWatch the new Starbucks video above! And tell Us : What do you think of the new red cups?\nRelated Content: Michael Buble 'Will Not Sing Again Until His Child Is Well,' Says Pal David Foster Donald Trump Reacts to Nationwide Anti-Trump Protests as Portland Police Declare Demonstration a 'Riot' Blac Chyna's First Pic With Daughter Dream, as Rob Kardashian Says Baby's an 'Exact Copy' of His Late Dad and Jokes About 'Kris Jenner Hair'",

      "text": "On the evening of Monday, July 18, Jarrett Hill was in a Starbucks working on his laptop and halfway listening to the Republican National Convention. A job interview earlier in the day had not gone well and Hill, at the time an unemployed journalist, was feeling blue. His last full-time job in television news, as a producer and reporter at WFTS-TV’s The Now Tampa Bay, had ended in April 2015. Hill’s small interior design business was busy, but he strongly desired to get back in the newsroom.\nHowever, with no other prospects on the horizon, things looked grim.\nThen, Melania Trump, wife of Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump, walked out on the stage and said these words:\n“Because we want our children — and all children in this nation — to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.”\nThe phrase instantly struck a nerve with Hill. Not because Trump’s delivery was so profound but because he’d heard them before – eight years ago when first lady Michelle Obama spoke at the Democratic National Convention.\nHill tweeted the comparison and his life instantly changed. In a matter of hours, he went from an obscure, out-of-work newsman to an international sensation and media darling.\nHill is now a correspondent for entertainment outlet The Hollywood Reporter. He returns to Tampa Thursday as the guest speaker at the Tampa Bay Association of Black Journalists’ annual Griot Drum Awards, which recognizes the best journalism on issues related to people of color. Hill, who attended Kennesaw State University, recently spoke with Tampa Bay Times correspondent Kenya Woodard about that tweet and his thoughts about a Trump presidency.\nYou’re a progressive and supported Hillary Clinton. What was your reaction as the election results pointed toward a victory for Donald Trump?\nI had little expectation of his winning the presidency but knowing it was a possibility, obviously. I was at a Hillary watch party. The tone of the room was like watching a house burn down slowly. I say that because there was still hope. Like, “oh, we can still be saved.” By the end of the night … there was a wide range of sadness and confusion and frustration – all rooted in pain. I was very grateful to not be on TV (the night of the election). I was glad to not be on a camera.\nNow that Donald Trump is president-elect, what are your thoughts about a Trump presidency?\nI think no matter who was president, we we’re going to have a scandal-laced administration. We’ve been spoiled by a scandal-free presidency. Donald Trump is wildly unprepared for this job. He’s going to be under intense scrutiny. That is setting in to him right now. It’s going to make for an interesting four years. It’s now more interesting than we thought.\nSo what were your thoughts at the exact moment when you realized that Melania Trump had lifted passages from Michelle Obama’s speech?\nI was listening to her but I was kind of tuned out. I didn’t know Michelle Obama’s speech. I knew the Quote: . If she had never said the plagerized part, I would have never noticed. I immediately knew. It was like, “I know that speech.” I thought it was bizarre but I didn’t realize how much had been plagerized. I then knew this was a story.\nWhen you tweeted the comparison, did you expect it to garner so much attention?\nI got nervous when I saw it was a being retweeted. I was getting picked up so quickly and it was going so far so fast. I started second-guessing myself because I may have been retweeted half a dozen times before. (The tweet about the speech) was growing exponentially. I was so scared because I was like, “What if I’m wrong?” Then I saw it on CNN. I knew it wasn’t wrong. By 10 p.m., I had emails from BBC News, from (news outlets in) Ireland. Before I went to bed, I did six national and international interviews.\nIn the last year, you worked primarily on building your design business. Did you always know you’d return to television?\nMy dad always recalls the story of me being 5 years old and finding me in the bathroom looking in the mirror talking to a hairbrush like a TV reporter. I’ve had the blessing and curse of knowing what I’ve wanted to do and what I wanted to be. When I step out of that, the universe does an overreach like, “Not that, that’s not what you’re supposed to be.” One part of (career success) has been persistence and the other is the universe.\nI look at all of this as creative. When producing a show…you’re putting together different elements to tell a story. With a client, I have to go in and figure out who they are and what they want – putting together those elements to give the client what they want.\nWhat’s been your experience going from covering the news to being part of it?\nIt was surreal that the people who were my colleagues and bosses are producing me as talent. My experience as a producer and a writer has made me a better guest and host. It’s a great weight and responsibility because I’ve had so many people say, “We’re so proud of you.” I didn’t anticipate that. There’s an ownership that comes along with that and a responsibility that come with people’s pride in you.\nIt feels amazing.\nSunday Conversation is edited for brevity and clarity.

      "text": "ard yes , contact Skype: sell.egiftus (Sell Gift) I have questions about your Starbucks cards. Do they come from cracked accounts? Do you have any trial amounts that I can add to my account to make sure everything is working? Are they PIN numbers or accounts? Ill probably add your skype too. Thanks! Added the OP on skype and started talking with him/her. The OP told me that I could buy starbucks gift cards if I wanted, with a PIN and Card Number. However, I told him/her that I wanted to use it for personal use, and the OP told me to buy an account instead because the cards \"die fast\" while the accounts \"don't die.\" This makes me wonder about the legitimacy of these cards, I personally think these come from cracked accounts, although OP said they are accounts in his/her possession. If you have to \"wonder about the legitimacy of the accounts\" you are in the wrong place.",

The Dunkin Donuts in town is a joke and everyone complains about it. Please consider opening a Starbucks in Northford, CT. The town needs your presence. Regards, A loyal Starbucks enthusiast",

      "text": "Starbucks reaches out, sort of Published on Print \nStarbucks introduced a “unity” cup in the run-up to the election. It says it wants to bring people together. We might need that unity cup now more than ever. \nBut someone forgot to tell the company that to bring people together, you reach out to the people who are not already together with you. Thus, for example, if you are a secular, left-wing company, you need to reach out to religious people on the right. \nLast year, Starbucks introduced a holiday cup that was bright red, except for the logo, which was green and white. It got accused of waging war on Christmas because there were no Christmas-themed designs. Nevertheless, on Tuesday, the same day it introduced its holiday-season beverages, it introduced a new cup that not only lacked reference to Christmas, but was green — the Islamic color, a British anti-Shariah activist noted. Naturally, this reminded some people of the “war on Christmas.” \nThe “unity” cup shows many people, all drawn with a single line, signifying connection. “During a divisive time in our country, Starbucks wanted to create a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values and the need to be good to each other,” CEO Howard Schultz said in a news release. \nClick through from that news release to the website of Shogo Ota, who drew the art, scroll down, and you’ll find another piece that looks an awful lot like the one on the cup. At the bottom, the line forms the words “Stronger Together.” \nThat was Hillary Clinton’s campaign slogan. \nMr. Schultz is right that this was a divisive election, and wanting to remind people of our common bonds at this difficult time is a noble impulse. But if you want to reinforce those common bonds and bring people together, you need to focus on bringing Clinton supporters and Donald Trump supporters — and maybe even supporters of third-party and independent candidates — together. \nSummoning shades of the war on Christmas, that perennial pseudo-battle in which some cultural conservatives take offense and some cultural progressives delight in mocking cultural conservatives, is not the way to do that. \nAnd artwork that could be mistaken for something promoting one of the candidates doesn’t cut it either. Starbucks is widely seen as a progressive company. If it wants to work for unity, it needs to reach out to conservatives, political and cultural.

      "text": "Summary \nShares of Starbucks are down 10.78% year over year - 6.5% year to date. \nFiscal Q4 numbers were solid, and the store count in China will be more than doubling to 5,000 by 2021. \nStarbucks is growing its physical presence and its share value with a presence in 75 different countries. \nIt has been one of the best-performing U.S. equities since the Great Recession, up over 500% since 2009. Shares are a still a long-term buy here at around $54. Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) shares closed at $53.91 on Friday, up 4.17% from their 52-week low of $51.77 on November 3. Over the last few weeks, the stock has been moving relatively similar to the market as a whole, but remains down over 10.7% year over year. I recently published an article on Seeking Alpha discussing the fundamental growth in coffee consumption among the U.S. population. Americans are consuming roughly 400 million cups of coffee per day, with a growing number of those beverages being specialty drinks such as espressos and Frappuccinos, Starbucks' specialty. Investors have had mixed interpretations of Starbucks' growth potential despite the stock returning over 500% in the last 7 years. Click to enlarge The company is acting to counterbalance those concerns as shares of SBUX are still down about 6.5% year-to-date. Stiff competition on both the selection and pricing fronts from big chains like McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) and Dunkin' Donuts (NASDAQ: DNKN ) have hit Starbucks hard right at a time when investors had grown accustom to holding one of the biggest - if not the biggest - winners in U.S. equities markets since the Great Recession. The company reported its fiscal Q4 results on November 3, right after the stock hit its 52-week low. During that conference call , a lot of numbers were thrown out, and investors have mostly had a positive response to them. Concerns over domestic sales have tapered, and international growth prospects begin to look promising. Let's take a look into earnings results, guidance and the company's strategy moving forward. From there, we'll get a clearer picture of short-term results and how that plays into the bigger picture long term. Store Openings and Sales Figures Are Up Starbucks uses a metric known as comparable store sales to report year-over-year sales numbers. What's included in the figure are stores opened longer than 13 months. Overall, comparable store sales were up 4%, which included a 6% increase in ticket and 1% decline in transactions. Starbucks' Kevin Johnson says that 1% decline is expected and indicates customer behavior moving away from order splitting by customers walking in as groups (of 2 or more) and toward order consolidation due to a change made to Starbucks' rewards program, which has recently changed from a per-purchase reward to a per-amount spent structure. Because of that change, rewards membership was up 18% year over year, which has led to a 5% increase in mobile payment transactions from fiscal Q4 2015. During Q4, the company added a net of 690 new stores, bringing the worldwide total to over 25,000 stores - 25,085, to be exact. Comparable store sales in China are up even more at 6%. However, that's down from the 7% year-over-year growth figured reported for the third quarter. Despite the decline, the country remains a key element of Starbucks' growth plan. The company plans to more than double the number of stores it has on the Chinese mainland to 5,000 (currently around 2,400) by the year 2021 and remain focused on tea sales. Coffee sales are growing in China, but tea sales still outnumber coffee purchases 10 to 1. CEO Howard Schultz seemed genuinely excited about Chinese growth perspectives. According to Schultz , \"Perhaps nowhere in the world has the Starbucks experience come to life more powerfully and been embraced more enthusiastically than in China, a country we first entered 17 years ago. I personally observed this again firsthand on my visit to the market just two weeks ago. Starbucks Stores in China are among our most elegant, efficient and profitable of any stores in the world... By building the foundation of our business in China carefully, methodically and respectfully, we are creating a growth and profit engine that will continue to accelerate for decades to come.\" On top of that, the conference call highlighted that Starbucks has recently entered the 75th country it does business in, which in and of itself is impressive for a coffee shop. The company plans to open 2,100 new stores globally in 2017, an 8.4% growth in new stores for the global brand. Revenue and EPS Are Also Up Year-over-year revenue is up 16%. That's a 9% increase in growth from fiscal Q3's 7% reported increase in growth. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.56, up 26% from Q4 2015, although it is important to note $0.06 of that was due to an extra week in the length of Q4 2016 as compared to Q4 2015. Quarter over quarter, EPS is up 12%. Non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) EPS adjusted to include that extra week was $0.50, which is up 16% year over year. In terms of guidance, the company is expecting 4-6% growth in comparable store sales in fiscal year 2017. It's important to note, however, that shares are trading at roughly 28x P/E, which is a bit on the higher side. Bottom Line Starbucks has been facing stiff competition in the United States. On top of that, there have been some economic and political uncertainties that have affected the share price. With markets reacting positively to the results of the recent presidential elections and Starbucks reporting increases in same-store sales, revenue, EPS and future store openings, the stock has a solid chance of recapturing the 6.5% it shrugged this year. Year over year, the company reported increases in new store additions, revenues, operating income, operating margin and earnings per share. Over the next 4 years, it'll open more than 2,500 more stores in China, and it now have a presence in 75 different countries across the globe. U.S. equities are at all-time highs, but shares of SBUX are just starting to come off of their lows. Since reporting Q4 numbers, the stock has picked up, but is still down 10.78% from where it was trading at a year ago. Price-to-earnings is somewhat high, but Starbucks appears to be growing both in terms of its physical presence as well as its share price. All other things equal, it's hard to see a long-term disappointment if you're buying SBUX here below $54.

He told me that in every evening, when it's time to close the store, the patries and sandwiches all the food can be taken by them free or it will be thrown. I think it's a kind of waste. If the Starbucks have an activity to help the homeless, I mean to give out the rest food to the homeless people, to whom the food is more necessary, it would be better than waste.",

      "text": "(Before It's News) “Christmas Creep” By Peter Funt “A sign on the door at Starbucks advised that hours on Christmas Day will be 4:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Good to know-but 60 days in advance? Inside the Paso Robles, California, store coffee was being served in festive green cups, although outside it was 82 degrees on a sunny fall afternoon. Channel 4 in New York City was running a commercial for Radio City’s Christmas Spectacular: “A mesmerizing holiday tradition.” The mall in Tempe, Arizona, was playing “Holly Jolly Christmas.” An email from the NBA offered free shipping on basketball shirts from the “2016 Christmas Day Collection.” A full-page ad by Lord & Taylor heralded the “unveiling” of its holiday windows. The Hallmark Channel was pumping out Christmas programming 24/7. Too much, too soon? Humbug. There’s no stopping the retail-driven juggernaut to New Year’s Day that we now refer to as The Holiday Season. It used to be that Christmas decorations went up the day after Thanksgiving, confining the merriment to roughly a month. Nowadays, on home shopping cable-TV channels it runs about six months, beginning with Christmas in July. For some retailers it starts after Labor Day, while the Scrooge-like holdouts wait until after Halloween. The polling firm Penn Schoen Berland surveyed 1,000 consumers in late August and found that one-third of them had already started Christmas shopping or planned to by Labor Day. Among parents the figure was 50 percent. Many factors contribute to what is known as Christmas creep, but clearly the condition is commerce-based, rather than being tied to faith or family. As more holiday buying takes place online-and 2016 might be the first year in which the figure reaches 50 percent of all sales-it has the unintended consequence of pushing the start of retail sales even earlier. Trying to compete with online merchants, Walmart has already added “holiday helpers” to assist shoppers along with “selfie stations” and in-store toy demonstrations. Target has a “Wondershop” with several thousand seasonal items. Kmart and Toys R Us are promoting holiday deals designed to compete with online bargains. As retailers expand the calendar their ads permeate newspapers and TV, adding to a premature holiday buzz. The shopping mall, which in many communities is the new Main Street, supports the merchants’ wishes by rushing holiday decorations. Kids see it all unfold, and the creep becomes a mad dash. It’s axiomatic that people tend to expand a task to fill the time available to complete it. Given four months of holiday promotions, some shoppers willingly take four months to accomplish what might ordinarily get done in a week. Moreover, does the commercial creep impact the interpersonal side of Thanksgiving, Christmas and Hanukkah? At minimum it dilutes the holidays, blurring their deeper meanings. The online site CreditCards.com did some research in September and found that about one million Americans had already completed their holiday shopping for 2016. Yet, the rush to buy is clearly leaving some folks conflicted if not downright depressed about Christmas creep. The same research found that 74 percent of shoppers are annoyed that holiday sales start earlier than ever before. A pharmacy in Sacramento pulled its Halloween merchandise two days early this year to meet a corporate directive about Christmas decorations. That, you’ll agree, is rather creepy.”\n- http://www.cagle.com/ Ahh, the frenzy as the sheeple stampede the stores in desperation of missing something…",

      "text": "Starbucks' Red Christmas Cups for 2016 Probably Won't Offend Anybody (Probably) Wintry spirit is back after 2015's minimalist take By Gabriel Beltrone November 14, 2016, 9:01 AM EST Starbucks wants consumers to know it's heard their deep concerns about its Christmas cups, and has worked hard to rectify the situation. Last year, the coffee chain sparked the world's most absurd controversy by stripping holiday imagery like snowflakes and reindeer from its disposable red drinking vessels. Some very adult Christian audiences took that move—meant to set an inclusive tone—as a personal affront, in the form of persecution against their religion, and a sign of the unbearable tyranny of political correctness. Now, Starbucks and agency 72andSunny have returned to typical form by restoring the wintry spirit to the cup, using designs consumers drew onto the plainer 2015 versions. This year's versions include the aforementioned snowflakes, and reindeer, as well as images like evergreen trees, Christmas lights and Christmas tree ornaments. Other cups feature more neutral patterns. They are pretty, and like plain red cups, relatively harmless (though people seem to get riled up about pretty much any Starbucks cup these days). The fact is, though, it probably doesn't matter much, either way. Starbucks can count on sleepless Americans buying a lot more coffee this December, regardless. And by the way, if you think Starbucks didn't love last year's cup controversy, have a look at the teaser video below, released earlier last week for the new cups. The chain clearly knows the PR value of a good consumer freak-out. Get the The AdFreak Daily newsletter: \nThanks for signing up! Check your inbox for a confirmation email.",

I don't want to reboot my system 3 times just to connect to the Internet. \nIf anyone knows a solution to this problem I would appreciate it.",

      "text": "Starbucks Is Outperforming Peers In The 'Oligopolistic Premium Grocery Coffee Market' \nA marriage of soft and hard drinks may not be unthinkable after all. A report that appeared in U.K.'s Telegraph over last weekend broached the possibility of U.S. beverage giant The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO ) being considered as a target by Belgian-Brazilian brewing giant Anheuser Busch Inbev SA NV (ADR) (NYSE: BUD ), which acquired U.K. brewer SABMiller plc recently. Thirst For Pepsi \nEarlier in 2014, before Anheuser Busch negotiated a deal with SABMiller, it was believed the former, which has grown itself primarily through the inorganic route, was considering making advances toward PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP ). \nAnheuser Busch reportedly studied the possibility of buying Pepsi, with analysts even going to the extent of suggesting that the former may look to divest the snacks business of Pepsi, which does not fit into its vision of evolving into a drinks company. \nAt that time, Anheuser Busch was even speculated to be considering bids for companies such as Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ: MNST ) and Keurig Green Mountain Inc (NASDAQ: GMCR ). SABMiller Deal Done And Dusted \nWith Anheuser Busch finally agreeing to buy SABMiller in October 2015, the M&A talks of the company gulping down beverage companies were put to rest. The completion of the deal in late October 2016 following a long-winding process has set the tongues wagging on another mega-deal the company may be considering to fuel growth. Beer–Beverage Tie-Ups \nAmong the other beer–beverage flings in the past, Japanese brewer Kirin Holdings announced in 2009 a bid for Coca-Cola Amatil , an Australian soft drink maker in which Coca-Cola has a majority stake. The deal was never consummated. \nFrench dairy giant Danone announced the sale of its drinks subsidiary Frucor , based in Australia and New Zealand, to Suntory , a Japanese company, which has since then divested its food & beverage business, for over 600 million euros in cash. This deal was announced in February 2009. Coca-Cola Interest: A Long Shot? \nThe speculation has a lot to do with the company's revelation of \"Dream 2020\" through its recent Form 20-F filing. The plan calls for revenues of $100 billion by 2020, a long way from the $43.6 billion generated in 2015. If the company achieves the target, the top 65 managers will share \"6 million options with a strike price of $121.89, which will vest five years after date of the offer letter.\" If it fails to hit the target in 2020, \"there are two more bites at the cherry in 2021 and 2022.\" \nThe newfound speculative interest of Anheuser Busch in Coca-Cola comes at a tough time for the company. Recently, the company trimmed its full-year revenue growth per hectoliter forecast to be in line with inflation from the previous expectations of above-inflation, citing weakness in the Brazilian market. In the third quarter, beer volume in Brazil slid 4.1 percent and the United States didn't fare any better, with a 2.5 percent drop. \nTo stem the macroeconomic-induced rot in some geographies, the company is now acquiring craft beer makers , which are small breweries making beer in a traditional or non-mechanized way. Craft beer is now the flavor of the town. Mass market beer sales are stagnating even as craft beer is going great guns, given consumer preference for it. \nGoldman Sachs said in a note in early October that it expects Anheuser Busch to acquire again in 2020 — a $80 billion deal that could add 8 percent to 2020 earnings per share estimate. The company has a free cash flow yield of 5 percent estimated for 2017 compared to 4.4 percent for European staples. \nGiven that Anheuser Busch has only recently completed the arduous processes involved in consummating a mega-merger and picked up several small craft beer companies along the way, the probability of it seeking merger, especially a horizontal one, looks remote. However, you never can tell, a be(er)hemoth such as Anheuser Busch could spring a surprise, given its ravenous appetite for bulking up. At Time Of Writing ... Anheuser Busch was slumping 4.58 percent to $102.90. Coca-Cola was down 0.32 percent to $40.90. PepsiCo was losing 1.91 percent to $101.22. Latest Ratings for BUD",

      "text": "Instagram Downloads \nHunger exists in every county in the U.S., affecting 42 million Americans including 13 million children according to a 2016 report by the United States Department of Agriculture . \nDuring National Hunger and Homelessness Awareness Week, Starbucks is inviting customers to purchase a Power Lunch and in return, the company will donate a Power Lunch to the Feeding America® network of local food banks.* This Buy One, Give One Power Lunch offer will be available from November 15-21 in participating Starbucks® stores across the U.S. \n“Every day all around us there are people who don’t know where their next meal is coming from,” said John Kelly, senior vice president, Global Social Impact. “This is a way for Starbucks to work in collaboration with our customers and partners to provide a lunch to someone in need on their behalf.” \n“People are more likely to give during this time of year and Starbucks support is particularly important because it amplifies and reinforces our message about hunger in our community,” said Nicole Suydam, CEO, Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County, a Feeding America member food bank. Building on an Existing Relationship \nIn March 2016, Starbucks announced a collaboration with Feeding America to launch Starbucks® FoodShare , a program where partners (employees) can donate ready-to-eat meals to food banks from its 7,800 company-operated stores in the U.S. Since launching a successful pilot of the program in San Diego last summer, Starbucks has added new markets including Orange County, Las Vegas, Denver and Colorado Springs. The company is scheduled to complete its rollout of Starbucks® FoodShare by 2019 and build upon the more than 345,000 nourishing meals that have been delivered to people in need to date. \n“Our partners understood how important it was for us to donate surplus food back to the local community and they were the catalyst behind the FoodShare program,” said Kelly. “We were so inspired by Feeding America and all of its network partners that spend each day trying to get food to the people who need it the most. Now we can help address hunger together.” \n“Launching this partnership with Starbucks has been a watershed moment for our food rescue efforts,” said Diana Aviv, CEO of Feeding America. “We are committed to identifying innovative solutions for sourcing food. Programs like FoodShare are a step in the right direction. Thanks to Starbucks contributions, more families and children will have access to a variety of nutrient-rich food.” The Power of Lunch \nBased on its relationship with Feeding America, Starbucks determined that it could do even more to get food to those in need by introducing the Power Lunch Buy One, Give One offer and encouraging customers to participate. \n“We have a quality lunch menu that we’re pleased to provide to our customers and with this offer, we can donate nourishing meals to families in need as well,” said Ka Bao Lee, product manager Starbucks Lunch. “With Thanksgiving upon us, we think this is a particularly impactful time for such an effort.” \nAlthough the offer lasts for one week, the lunches will be donated over a 90-day period. This will allow for a continuous flow of nourishing Starbucks meals that will meet the needs of local food banks for several weeks. Starbucks anticipates donating at least 50,000 Power Lunches with the help of its customers. \n“The additional food from the Power Lunches will help our agencies feed children, families and seniors at a time when there are many demands on financial resources and when people are often unable to find enough food for their next meal,” Suydam said. \n*Donations will be distributed in California, New York, Arizona and Colorado.

      "text": "A Google drone might deliver your Chipotle burrito, but it looks like it won't deliver your Starbucks coffee. The Project Wing drone delivery program, now a part of Google parent company Alphabet, has scrapped a Starbucks partnership as part of a cost-cutting move, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The budget cuts also mean a hiring freeze and an attempt to shift employees to other projects, according to the report. The company still believes in the technology. \"Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world,\" the X group said in a statement. \"What we're doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems. While there's still a lot of work to be done, we believe that opening the skies to faster, more efficient transportation of goods is a moonshot worth pursuing.\"",

Reader reactions in email and across social media span spectrum in election aftermath Myron B. Pitts Buy Now AP photo \nRed paper cups, for hot drinks, are stacked next to plastic cups at a Starbucks coffee shop in the Pike Place Market on Tuesdayin Seattle. Starbucks' minimalist new holiday coffee cup has set off complaints that the chain is making war on Christmas. \nI received lots of response from across the political spectrum on my post-election columns about Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton. \nAmong other things, I wrote about the importance of family, and how that comes before whoever serves as president. \nEd Pollard, who lives in Raleigh and grew up in Fayetteville, emailed: \"I enjoyed your recent column on dealing with the aftermath of the election. \nI am on the other side of the spectrum from you - I lean to the right politically but I recall how I felt after President Obama was elected and then re-elected. He was not 'my guy' on many issues. But we have to move on and continue to try to contribute constructively in whatever way we can.\" \nI have seen my share of outrage and fear on Twitter, and it's no surprise with the kind of campaign we've had. \nMy way to move forward is to remain optimistic but vigilant. \nOther readers thanked me for my tone. I tried to strike a balance, because I figure folks are riled up enough. \n\"I did want to encourage you,\" wrote Jodie Bailey. \"It seems like a small, vocal percentage of people on both sides take great pleasure in beating one another to pieces. You and I don't agree politically on a lot of things ... but being able to disagree is an American freedom we've begun to take for granted. Being able to listen instead of screaming at each other is another thing we need to learn to do again. Civil discussion would be nice, wouldn't it? Open minds, too.\" \nI will say that the comments section of articles about the election are not necessarily the place where you're going to have a civil discussion. \nThat's in part because the format attracts trolls and bomb-throwers who want to mingle in amongst the regular people and sew dissension. \nOne of my friends on Facebook suggested, rather than make assumptions, or call people out on Facebook, why not just ask someone in your life why they voted the way they did - and actually hear them out. \nNovel idea. \nMeanwhile, I've heard my share of grief this week, too. \nOne woman thanked me via email for my column, but added, \"I will try to move on, but this is hard.\" \nPresident-elect Trump met with President Obama last week and more meetings are planned. Oprah Winfrey tweeted out she was encouraged by it, but then had to explain further when many of her fans thought she was too sunny about it. \nI'm going to give Trump a chance. I know what he said, but let's see what he does. There are early signs he may be a Rockefeller Republican with a Rush Limbaugh mouth. \nObama said after meeting with him: \"We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.\" \nAs for people who are frightened, their concerns are real. There are incidents across the country where people are being harassed because they are Muslim or Latino or of color, and this includes schoolchildren. \nWe can all take a stand against hate. \nColumnist Myron B. Pitts can be reached at or 910-489-3559. TRENDING VIDEOS",

      "text": "Buy Now AP photo \nRed paper cups, for hot drinks, are stacked next to plastic cups at a Starbucks coffee shop in the Pike Place Market on Tuesdayin Seattle. Starbucks' minimalist new holiday coffee cup has set off complaints that the chain is making war on Christmas. \nI received lots of response from across the political spectrum on my post-election columns about Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton. \nAmong other things, I wrote about the importance of family, and how that comes before whoever serves as president. \nEd Pollard, who lives in Garner and grew up in Fayetteville, emailed: \"I enjoyed your recent column on dealing with the aftermath of the election. \nI am on the other side of the spectrum from you - I lean to the right politically but I recall how I felt after President Obama was elected and then re-elected. He was not 'my guy' on many issues. But we have to move on and continue to try to contribute constructively in whatever way we can.\" \nI have seen my share of outrage and fear on Twitter, and it's no surprise with the kind of campaign we've had. \nMy way to move forward is to remain optimistic but vigilant. \nOther readers thanked me for my tone. I tried to strike a balance, because I figure folks are riled up enough. \n\"I did want to encourage you,\" wrote Jodie Bailey. \"It seems like a small, vocal percentage of people on both sides take great pleasure in beating one another to pieces. You and I don't agree politically on a lot of things ... but being able to disagree is an American freedom we've begun to take for granted. Being able to listen instead of screaming at each other is another thing we need to learn to do again. Civil discussion would be nice, wouldn't it? Open minds, too.\" \nI will say that the comments section of articles about the election are not necessarily the place where you're going to have a civil discussion. \nThat's in part because the format attracts trolls and bomb-throwers who want to mingle in amongst the regular people and sew dissension. \nOne of my friends on Facebook suggested, rather than make assumptions, or call people out on Facebook, why not just ask someone in your life why they voted the way they did - and actually hear them out. \nNovel idea. \nMeanwhile, I've heard my share of grief this week, too. \nOne woman thanked me via email for my column, but added, \"I will try to move on, but this is hard.\" \nPresident-elect Trump met with President Obama last week and more meetings are planned. Oprah Winfrey tweeted out she was encouraged by it, but then had to explain further when many of her fans thought she was too sunny about it. \nI'm going to give Trump a chance. I know what he said, but let's see what he does. There are early signs he may be a Rockefeller Republican with a Rush Limbaugh mouth. \nObama said after meeting with him: \"We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed, then the country succeeds.\" \nAs for people who are frightened, their concerns are real. There are incidents across the country where people are being harassed because they are Muslim or Latino or of color, and this includes schoolchildren. \nWe can all take a stand against hate. \nColumnist Myron B. Pitts can be reached at or 910-489-3559. TRENDING VIDEOS",

The representative declined to comment further. \nUndecidable Labs, based in San Francisco, had raised less than $1 million in financing, according to a person with knowledge of the startup. They asked not to be identified talking about private matters. \nEdwards spent two years as an engineering director at Apple, No. 2 in the Internet Retailer 2016 Top 500 Guide , after the iPhone maker purchased her app search engine, Chomp, in 2012. She formed Undecidable Labs in early 2015. The company had yet to release a product. \nStefanie Kraus , a designer listed as an employee of the startup, described its effort on her website as creating a \"purchase research tool\" for online shoppers. \n\"By introducing a filtering system that takes `nice to have' and `ideal' into consideration, we make sure that the products are presented in a meaningful way,\" Kraus wrote on her website. \nLi Fan, who previously led engineering efforts for Google image search, left the company in September.

      "text": "Email \nStarbucks’ Pumpkin Spice Latte made pumpkin spice famous more than ten years ago. Now you’ll find it added to everything from soup to nuts! But do those products actually taste good? Consumer Reports put several to the test. \nConsumer Reports’ expert food panel started with 20 products to find the tastiest. Some are not so great. Putting “pumpkin” on the label didn’t make Blue Diamond almonds irresistible. The candy-like brown-spice coating masked the taste of the nuts. \nBut there were some standouts. Noosa Finest Yoghurt Pumpkin is full and creamy, with real pumpkin and a hint of pumpkin pie spices. It’s made with whole milk and is pretty rich, so watch your portion. Or you can start your day with Pumpkin Spice Cheerios. They taste mostly of cloves but also have hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. \nSnack on Pumpkin Spice Flax Crunchy Granola Bars from Kashi, with 4 grams of fiber. They have pumpkin and flax seeds, and taste of honey and brown spice. The tasters agreed on Imagine Organic Creamy Pumpkin Soup; it is thick, smooth, and slightly sweet, with some pumpkin spices. \nAnd last, have a glass of water ready for Trader Joe’s Fall Harvest Salsa. Testers said the heat overpowered the flavors of pumpkin, apples, and squash, but the salsa was still tasty. While pumpkin snacks can be yummy, not all are healthy. Take a look at the label to make sure those traditional spices don’t also come with a load of added sugars. \nComplete Ratings and recommendations on all kinds of products, including appliances, cars & trucks, and electronic gear, are available on Consumer Reports’ website.

Starbucks chose the winning designs from an Instagram contest that included submissions from more than a dozen countries. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nIt’s been a year since Starbucks rolled out solid red holiday cups with a minimalist logo, unwittingly sparking a backlash on Twitter as people accusing the Seattle company of waging a “war on Christmas.” It's September, when does the War on Christmas start? Get ready @Starbucks pic.twitter.com/8Id9YW5kAl \n— (((tramosUSA))) (@voteblue16) September 7, 2016 \nLed by “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them. \nStarbucks is sweetening the rollout of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between November 10-14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. See the full rules here . \nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday: (Starbucks) ",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Photos: Starbucks' healthy menu options For kids – Here are the best Starbucks options if you're focused on healthy choices within the limits of the menu. A breakfast of egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich and organic low-fat plain milk box are the best options for kids. Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: Starbucks' healthy menu options For vegetarians – For vegetarians, a strawberry Greek yogurt parfait has 14 grams of protein and provides 15% of your daily calcium needs. A café latte with soy milk adds 7 grams of protein and another third of your daily calcium. Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Starbucks' healthy menu options For Vegans – The multigrain bagel helps vegans slow the post-meal rise in blood sugar, contributing to sustained energy throughout the morning. A Caffé Misto with steamed soy milk will keep you warm in the winter. Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: Starbucks' healthy menu options For calorie-counters – If you are looking to shed pounds and are keeping a close eye on calories, you can't go wrong with the classic whole-grain oatmeal. And the lowest-calorie options at Starbucks include unsweetened iced coffee with nonfat milk.

Hide Caption 10 of 10 Story highlights One of the most appealing aspects of Starbucks' menu is that you can customize your beverage Here are the best options if you're focused on healthy choices within the limits of the menu (CNN) You can't go too far these days without running into a Starbucks. The chain is so ubiquitous, it's almost like having an outsourced pantry staple available within a 5-mile radius (or a few city blocks) all day. You can always count on it for coffee, tea and some tasty bites to fuel you up in the morning or to tide you over until lunch or dinner. But if we can count on Starbucks to be \"there\" for us, what are the most nutritious options among so many different beverages, mini-meals and snacks? Starbucks makes it easy for us, especially when it comes to deciding what to drink. One of the most appealing aspects of Starbucks' menu is that you can customize your beverage to your liking. To order even a simple drink at Starbucks is to participate in some level of customization, when you take into account the size, temperature (hot or iced) and fat content of the milk. We really like this level of personalization, considering we all have different nutritional needs and preferences. JUST WATCHED MUST WATCH Healthy fast food switches that will surprise you 01:22 When it comes to calories in Starbucks beverages, the count varies greatly. The lowest-calorie options at Starbucks include unsweetened coffee and tea. For example, a tall (12 ounce) brewed coffee has 5 calories, and the same size brewed tea has zero calories. The same size nonfat cappuccino has only 60 calories, mostly from the milk. Read More In general, if you want to enjoy some sweetness in your beverage but don't want to over-consume calories, you can ask for less syrup (i.e. fewer \"pumps\": Most hot espresso beverages contain three, four and five pumps of syrup for tall, grande and Venti, respectively). Even better, order your beverage \"skinny,\" which means it will be made with nonfat milk and sugar-free syrup and without whipped cream. For example, a grande (16 ounce) vanilla latte with whole milk has 290 calories and 11 grams of fat (6 grams saturated). But the skinny version, with nonfat milk and sugar-free syrup, has 120 calories and 0 grams of fat. Other lighter cold beverages include a tall Teavana Shaken Iced Passion Tango tea or an iced coffee, which are lightly sweetened and contain only 60 calories (both have zero calories if you omit the sweetener). Dunkin' Donuts' menu, as curated by a nutritionist Finally, if you are not willing to part with syrups or whipped cream -- or full-fat milk, for that matter -- choose the smallest size. A Venti (24 ounce) mocha Frappuccino containing whole milk, whipped cream, syrup and mocha sauce contains 520 calories and 10 grams, or about half a day's worth of saturated fat. But the mini size (10 ounce) version contains 190 calories and 4 grams of saturated fat. Still not dietetic, but significantly skinnier. Though you can customize a beverage to your liking at Starbucks, the same does not hold true for the chain's food. You can ask a barista to take something off of a sandwich -- bacon, for example -- and bagels and oatmeal are customizable with toppings and spreads. But that's about it when it comes to personalizing meals and snacks. Aside from breakfast foods and bakery items, Starbucks offers salad bowls; bistro boxes that contain fewer than 500 calories and are suited for different palates; and yogurt parfaits, which have fewer than 300 calories and provide 13 to 14 grams of protein. And it is trying to help. The chain reduced sodium by 20% for all breakfast sandwiches; however, some still have a lot fewer milligrams than others. And by the end of 2017, the company claims that all beverages will be free of artificial flavors. It is also committed to reducing average added sugar in some of the more indulgent beverages by 25% by the end of 2020. Here are the best Starbucks options if you're focused on healthy choices within the limits of the menu. We break it down by our picks for kids, athletes, drivers, vegetarians and vegans, as well as low-calorie, low-sugar, low-salt, gluten-free and low-carb options. For kids Breakfast: Egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich Lunch: PB&J on wheat bistro box Snack: Chocolate cake pop Beverage: Vanilla crème with nonfat milk (8 ounces) or organic low-fat plain milk box (Horizon) We're not surprised to see that there is no specific children's menu at Starbucks. After all, kids generally don't go to Starbucks to eat -- or to consume coffee, for that matter. But if you find yourself needing a caffeine boost with kids in tow, there are some nutritious, kid-friendly options to consider, and they don't include items from the bakery section. We really like the egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich and the PB&J on wheat bistro box, which has apple slices, string cheese and veggies with Greek yogurt dip. (We don't think kids will mind the chocolate-covered raisins, either). If your child is craving a sweet treat, the chocolate cake pop will be sure to please, and it won't top the calorie charts. When it comes to kid-friendly beverages, on a cold day, consider a vanilla crème with nonfat milk in lieu of hot chocolate. An 8-ounce cup has fewer calories (100) and more calcium (25%) than the same size nonfat hot chocolate without whipped cream, which has 140 calories and 20% calcium. We also like the organic low-fat milk boxes from the ready to drink cooler section of the store. For vegetarians Breakfast: Strawberry Greek yogurt parfait, or egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich Lunch: Roasted tomato and mozzarella panini Beverage: Café latte with soy milk (12 ounces) or unsweetened iced coffee with nonfat milk (16 ounces) Vegetarians can choose from a variety of protein-rich options at Starbucks. The Evolution Fresh Greek yogurt parfaits and the egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich each have 14 grams of protein and provide 15% of your daily calcium needs. For lunch, we like the tasty roasted tomato and mozzarella panini with spinach and pesto. We would recommend the cheese and fruit bistro box too, since it's so portable, but it does contain about half a day's worth of saturated fat, from the cheese (10 grams). Pair any of the above with a tall (12 ounce) caffé latte with soy milk, which delivers 7 grams of protein and a third of your daily calcium needs. In warmer weather, an unsweetened iced coffee with nonfat milk will keep you cool. Note that you need to specify \"unsweetened\" iced coffee: A standard tall iced coffee contains three pumps of simple syrup; most syrups contain about 20 to 25 calories per pump. If you want some sweetness without extra sugar calories, you can ask for just one pump or sugar-free syrup instead. For vegans Breakfast: Hearty blueberry oatmeal or multigrain bagel Lunch: Hearty veggie and brown rice salad bowl Snack: Hippeas far out fajita Beverage: Caffé Misto with soy milk (12 ounces) or unsweetened iced coffee with coconut milk (12 ounces) Chipotle's menu, as curated by a nutritionist When it comes to options for vegans, the hearty blueberry oatmeal tops our list. It provides 5 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber, which helps slow the post-meal rise in blood sugar, contributing to sustained energy throughout the morning. We are also impressed with the multigrain bagel, with 17 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber from ingredients including oats, flax and sunflower seeds. For comparison, Starbucks' plain bagel has 9 grams of protein and 2 grams of fiber. However, you will have to enjoy your bagel sans spreads, as there are no dairy-free spreads available to pair it with. The chain is testing an avocado spread in two markets, but it's not available nationwide just yet. For lunch, we highly recommend the hearty veggie and brown rice salad bowl, a fiber and antioxidant-rich medley with butternut squash, beets, kale, broccoli and roasted tomatoes. If you avoid honey, skip the lemon-tahini dressing. If you are in the mood for a snack, try \"hippeas\": protein-rich chickpea puffs that are certified vegan. To sip, a Caffé Misto with steamed soy milk will keep you warm in the winter. In summertime, an iced coffee with coconut milk is low in saturated fat and contributes 80 calories; however, save 60 calories by ordering it unsweetened. Note that while foods may be free of ingredients of animal origin, the chain is cautious about calling foods \"vegan\" unless they are packaged and \"certified vegan,\" as foods are subject to cross contamination. For calorie counters Breakfast: Classic whole-grain oatmeal or reduced-fat turkey bacon and cage-free egg white breakfast sandwich Lunch: Zesty chicken and black bean salad bowl Beverage: Nonfat cappuccino (12 ounces) or unsweetened iced coffee with nonfat milk (12 ounces) If you are looking to shed pounds and are keeping a close eye on calories, you can't go wrong with choosing the classic whole-grain oatmeal. Without any toppings, it has 160 calories, 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of filling fiber. We recommend adding a bit of dried fruit to boost sweetness. The reduced-fat turkey bacon and cage-free egg white breakfast sandwich with reduced-fat white cheddar cheese is also a filling, calorie-controlled option, with 16 grams of protein and only 230 calories. Panera Bread's menu, as curated by a nutritionist For lunch, the zesty chicken and black bean salad bowl is under 400 calories and offers a satisfying combination of protein and carbs, but we particularly like the fact that it has 8 grams of fiber, which fills you up without providing additional calories, as well as some appetite-suppressing spice from its chili vinaigrette. When it comes to beverages, the lowest-calorie options at Starbucks include unsweetened coffee (5 calories for a tall, or 12 ounces) and tea (zero calories, even for unsweetened Iced Passion Tango tea). Additionally, a tall café Americano has only 10 calories. It also depends how strictly you are watching calories. If you are on a 1,400- or 1,600-calorie diet, we understand you might prefer to eat your calories instead of drink them. However, if you have a little more wiggle room, a tall nonfat cappuccino has only 60 calories and delivers 20% of your daily calcium needs. Additionally, a tall iced coffee with nonfat milk that is lightly sweetened (with 3 pumps of syrup) has 80 calories, but if you order it with one pump of syrup, the count goes down to 35 calories. The unsweetened version is the lowest, at only 20 calories. And if you enjoy a flavored latte, order it \"skinny,\" which means it will be made with nonfat milk and sugar-free syrup (the \"skinny\" definition also implies no whipped cream, where appropriate). For the sugar-sensitive Breakfast: Reduced-fat turkey bacon and cage-free egg white breakfast sandwich or classic whole-grain oatmeal Lunch: Roasted tomato and mozzarella panini Beverage: Café Americano (12 ounces) or unsweetened Teavana Shaken Iced Passion Tango tea (16 ounces) The first step in slashing sugar calories at Starbucks is to skip over the bakery items, Venti (20-ounce) flavored lattes and Frappuccinos. The next step is to check out the hot breakfast menu, which offers some of the lowest-sugar options at the chain, such as the egg and cheddar breakfast sandwich, with 2 grams of sugar, and the reduced-fat turkey bacon sandwich, with 3 grams of sugar. The classic whole-grain oatmeal has zero grams of sugar without any toppings, but you might want to add some dried fruit or nuts, which are optional. There are many low-sugar options for lunch at Starbucks, but the sodium levels are too high for our comfort level. We recommend the tomato and mozzarella panini, which has only 3 grams of sugar. Pair it with unsweetened coffee, espresso or tea to keep sugar grams at a minimum. And when it comes to sweet drinks without extra sugar calories, choose \"skinny\" or light versions of your favorites. For the salt-sensitive Breakfast or lunch (mini-meal): Fresh blueberries and honey Greek yogurt parfait Snack: Seasonal harvest fruit blend Beverage: Café latte with nonfat milk (16 ounces) or iced skinny flavored latte (16 ounces) If you are looking for a mini-meal and watching salt intake, Starbucks' Greek yogurt parfaits come in tasty blueberry, strawberry and dark sweet cherry combinations and are by far the lowest-sodium menu items at the chain, ranging from 65 to 75 milligrams per parfait. We especially like the blueberry and honey parfait, as the blue fruit is loaded with anthocyanins, which protect against aging. The yogurt is also rich in potassium, which can help to blunt the blood pressure-raising effects of sodium. The classic whole-grain and hearty blueberry oatmeals are also low-sodium breakfast options, with 125 milligrams each. When it comes to lunch, there is nothing on the Starbucks sandwich, panini and salad menu that is under 600 milligrams of sodium, and bistro boxes range from 460 to 830 milligrams of sodium, so the yogurt parfait is still the best option if you are closely watching sodium intake. For a snack, the seasonal harvest fruit blend is sodium-free and is a healthful add-on to any meal, as it contributes antioxidants and fiber, for only 90 calories. To sip, we like the grande (16-ounce) nonfat latte, as it offers almost half of our daily calcium needs and adds even more potassium to the meal. An iced skinny latte is a sweet, calcium-rich option during warmer months. For the gluten-sensitive Breakfast: Hearty blueberry oatmeal or strawberry Greek yogurt parfait Lunch: Hearty veggie brown rice and salad bowl Snack: Kale chips, zesty nacho Beverage: Nonfat latte macchiato (12 ounces) or iced café latte with nonfat milk (16 ounces) You won't find much success if you are specifically looking for \"gluten-free\" items at Starbucks. The only gluten-free-labeled product we could find is a gluten-free marshmallow dream bar. There is no dedicated section for allergen information on the company's website, so you have to navigate carefully if you are allergic to gluten, or wheat or milk, for that matter. Starbucks cautiously maintains that its food is handled in an open environment and is subject to cross-contamination. However, some meals such as the hearty blueberry or classic whole-grain oatmeal, Greek strawberry yogurt parfait, or hearty veggie brown rice and salad bowl are nutritious options that do not have gluten-containing ingredients. Additionally, if you are avoiding gluten, you won't be surprised to learn that the chain's scones, cakes and muffins are off-limits. But you can enjoy a bag of zesty nacho kale chips, which have 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber to keep you satisfied. Since gluten is generally not an issue when it comes to beverages (that is, except for the java chip Frappuccino, which contains cookie crumbs), we decided to list some of our favorites, such as the nonfat latte macchiato and the nonfat iced café latte, for their bone-building calcium. For the athlete Breakfast: Spinach, feta and cage-free egg white breakfast wrap or hearty blueberry oatmeal Lunch: Egg salad sandwich Beverage: Organic low-fat chocolate milk box (Horizon) or strawberry smoothie with non-fat milk (16 ounces) Starbucks' spinach, feta and cage-free egg white breakfast wrap offers 19 grams of protein, which is a welcome dose for weight lifters, and has plenty of carbs to fuel a light cardio workout. Athletes can also fuel up with the hearty blueberry oatmeal. For lunch, we like the protein and iron-rich egg salad sandwich. The sandwich delivers 42 grams of carbs, which is especially beneficial post-workout. When it comes to a post-workout beverage, the choice depends on the intensity and duration of the workout. For a low-intensity workout, like a brisk walk, Pilates or yoga, water is fine. For a morning jog, low-fat chocolate milk offers adequate carbs and protein, along with electrolytes lost in sweat, like sodium and potassium. If you are training for a marathon, feel free to grab Starbucks' strawberry smoothie, which provides a generous amount of carbohydrates to replenish muscle glycogen stores, as well as 16 grams of protein, which provides amino acids for muscle building and repair. For the road warrior Breakfast: Ham and cheese savory foldover Lunch: Protein bistro box Snack: Kind bar, blueberry vanilla and cashew Beverage: Café latte with nonfat milk (12 ounces) or cool lime Starbucks Refreshers beverage (12 ounces) If you are on the road, our guess is that you might want to grab a quick bite from Starbucks' bakery counter. If that's the case, consider the ham and cheese savory foldover. Unlike many of the chain's bakery items, this croissant has fewer than 300 calories and offers 13 grams of protein, which will satisfy you for a morning road trip. We are also pleased to see it has less than 500 milligrams of sodium). For lunch, we like the protein bistro box that is packed with easy-to-nibble foods including a hard-boiled egg, apple slices, cheddar cheese, muesli bread and peanut butter. For long drives, grab a Kind bar, which will come in handy when hunger pangs begin to distract. For a road trip on a hot summer day, a tall lime Starbucks Refresher is a welcome treat: It has a third of the calories of a typical lemonade and is lightly caffeinated with green coffee extract to keep you alert on the road. For the carb-conscious Breakfast: Protein bistro box (minus the muesli bread and grapes) Lunch: Protein bistro box (minus the muesli bread and grapes) Snack: Squirrel Black truffle almonds Beverage: Caffé Misto with nonfat milk (12 ounces) or iced café Americano (16 ounces) If you're on a low-carb diet, Starbucks is not going to be at the top of the list for a bite to eat. The lowest-carb foods we could find on its food nutrition menu is the Frappuccino cookie straw, at 14 grams, and the petite vanilla bean scone, with 18 grams of carbs. Join the conversation \nSee the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter . So your best bet is to get the protein bistro box with a hard-boiled egg, cheddar cheese and peanut butter. Feel free to enjoy some apple slices too, but the muesli bread won't make the low-carb cut. If you subtract both the bread and grapes from the meal, the carb count goes down from 37 grams to 11 grams. For a low-carb snack, heart-healthy almonds are available, though if you are watching calories too, stick to a half portion, as a full serving contains 270 calories. When it comes to drinks, keep in mind that any beverage containing milk will include carbs from naturally occurring lactose, and we encourage you to include milk in your morning beverage to get an that calcium boost. A tall (12-ounce) Caffé Misto with steamed nonfat milk has only 8 grams of carbs and delivers 20% of your daily calcium needs. If you are looking for a low-carb beverage without milk, a café Americano (hot or iced) will satisfy. You can add a pump of sugar-free syrup and whipped cream without making a dent in the carb content, though in that case, we recommend a tall size, as doing so boosts calories and saturated fat.

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nCommodities have been in flux over the past few months and it has hit Starbucks' margins pretty hard. \nWith its input costs rising and considering it is a consumer discretionary spending item it is highly likely that the consumer will curtail their spending at “The Third Place”. \nWith these troubles ailing the stock I wanted to employ a bearish options strategy in the name to make a profit. Since President Elect Donald Trump has been on the campaign trail urging for retailers to bring Christmas back and outright asking his supporters to boycott Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) the stock of coffee brewer from Seattle has been dropping. But drop in the stock price can't be all attributed to the boycott calls of Mr. Trump. The company has had some of its own difficulties along the way. Commodities have been in flux over the past few months and it has hit Starbucks' margins pretty hard. Their main commodity is obviously coffee and price of those beans has been skyrocketing of late. There has been a huge drought in Brazil which has not allowed farmers to grow their crops like normal this time of year which has contributed to the spike in prices. This is anticipated to be Brazil's worst coffee harvest for quite some time . Next year's crops are bound to have some trouble producing anything as well if the drought continues. Brazil is the largest producer of coffee beans and following them is Vietnam who has also been experiencing its own coffee crop issues this year. With its input costs rising and considering it is a consumer discretionary spending item it is highly likely that the consumer will curtail their spending at \"The Third Place\". Coupled with rising input costs the stock itself trades at a fairly rich valuation at 22x next year's earnings estimates. When we take a look at a chart below of the stock relative to the S&P 500 and the Consumer Discretionary ETF (NYSEARCA: XLY ) we see that it has been a relative loser over the past year. Click to enlarge With these troubles ailing the stock I wanted to employ a bearish options strategy in the name to make a profit. What I did was I wrote the November $50 put for $0.73 and used the proceeds to purchase the November $52.50 put for $1.25. In aggregate, the trade cost me $0.52 but it looks like the market is about to turn over again after our brief presidential election rally and I hope to turn it into a profitable trade. The trade was profitable until the company reported earnings and has since found support here at around $54. The stock however is down nearly 13% from its 52-week high while the Dow Jones Industrial keeps making record highs. The earnings growth is still there with next year's earnings estimated to grow roughly 15.3% from 2016 but with November as the expiration date I selected that shouldn't matter. I have until the end of the week for this strategy to play out to my favor so only time will tell. Thanks for reading and I look forward to your comments! Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future. These are only my personal opinions and you should do your own homework. Only you are responsible for what you trade and happy investing! Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.   it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

      "text": "Starbucks turns to customers for annual holiday cup designs DALLAS (AP) -- The slowly improving economy could boost travel over the Thanksgiving holiday to levels not seen in nine years. AAA forecasts that 48.7 million Americans will travel, the busiest Thanksgiving period on U.S. roads and skies since 2007, the year before the global financial crisis plunged the U.S. economy into a deep recession. The auto club AAA said Tuesday that it expects 1 million more Americans to venture at least 50 miles from home, a 1.9 percent increase over last year. The forecast was assembled at research firm IHS, which said it considered jobs, household net worth, the stock market, prices for gasoline and airline tickets, and other factors. The researchers did their number crunching in mid-October, about three weeks before the surprising outcome in the presidential election. The AAA forecast predicts that from Wednesday, Nov. 23, through Sunday, Nov. 27, about 43.5 million Americans will take long car trips, 1.9 percent more than last year. AAA expects 3.7 million will travel by air, a 1.6 percent increase. Bus and train trips will grow less than 1 percent, the auto group said. An airline-industry trade group is a bit more bullish. Airlines for America predicts that air travel will rise 2.5 percent over last year's holiday, although the group considers Thanksgiving travel spanning a 12-day period that begins Nov. 18. AIR TRAVEL TIPS Planes are likely to be packed over the holiday, and bad weather or airline computer malfunctions can slow things to a crawl. If the unexpected happens, be ready to react quickly. -Arrive early. At some airports, including Dallas-Fort Worth International and Dallas Love Field, garages and other facilities are under construction, making matters worse. -Pack smart. Don't put anything you really need - medicine, passport, other important papers - in your rollaboard bag; or remember to remove it if the airline orders you to gate-check your bag, which happens when flights are full and bins are overstuffed. -Customer assistance. If your flight is canceled, get in line to talk to an airline customer rep but call the airline too. You might have better luck reaching an overseas number - look up the numbers before your trip.",

      "text": "Starbucks turns to customers for annual holiday cup designs NEW YORK (AP) -- Thanksgiving is traditionally a day for gathering with your family and eating turkey, but there's a twist on the holiday as a purely social gathering, and it's called Friendsgiving. The menu might include anything from beer and cheese fries to cocktails and salmon. But instead of the host slaving away for hours in a hot kitchen, it's more likely to be a party-style potluck. The trend is also turning up in ads, charity promotions, Evites and even on a cruise ship, with Royal Caribbean's Harmony of the Seas ship hosting a Friendsgiving celebration for passengers two weeks before Thanksgiving this year. This fall's premiere issue of The Magnolia Journal, a magazine from HGTV's \"Fixer Upper\" stars Chip and Joanna Gaines, also featured a story about Friendsgiving. And while Americans have long celebrated Thanksgiving with friends when they couldn't be with family - whether they were living abroad, at college or in the military - Friendsgivings aren't usually replacements for traditional family gatherings. Instead, Friendsgivings are held in addition to the traditional Thursday turkey dinner, specifically scheduled on a different day so as not to conflict with family get-togethers. New Yorker Hannah Redfield says she and her 20-something friends are \"really into\" Friendsgiving, which they've celebrated since 2014. She calls it \"a millennial-driven interpretation of Thanksgiving. This demographic of people isn't as concerned with preparing the traditional Thanksgiving meal but is looking for an excuse to celebrate friendship. In my experience, people aren't necessarily expected to show up with solely mashed potatoes, stuffing, cranberry sauce, etc.\" Instead, they bring everything from cheese fries to spaghetti squash - \"whatever they could muster or afford with entry-level salaries.\" Nina Foley of Chicago agrees that Friendsgivings offer an opportunity to break traditions: \"While a family Thanksgiving would never allow for anything other than traditional canned cranberry, creamed corn casserole or green beans, because it's Friendsgiving, we have the freedom to get creative.\" One friend in her group went to culinary school and includes ingredients with his gourmet turkey that \"none of us ever saw on our plates as kids - figs, preserved oranges, fried sage!\" Friendsgivings are also often more like parties than staid sit-down dinners. There are Friendsgiving pajama parties, and themed events with arts and crafts or games. Michelle Platt is hosting her third Friendsgiving this year - a potluck - in Briarcliff Manor, New York, for friends from college who are now in their 40s. \"We almost all have kids, so I hire a babysitter to watch them so we can have some adult time,\" she said. Platt uses the online invitation service Evite for her Friendsgiving and noted that \"the first year was slim pickings for invite designs, but now there are a lot to choose from.\" Evite reports a 29 percent increase this year over last in the number of events that its Friendsgiving designs are being used for, totaling in the thousands. Some Friendsgivings double as fundraisers, with hosts inviting guests to support a good cause. A charity called No Kid Hungry, which focuses on ending childhood hunger by connecting kids to the meals they need, offered a Friendsgiving fundraising option last year and raised $28,000 from some 50 participants. This year, No Kid Hungry has registered 1,400 Friendsgiving fundraisers, raising $78,000 so far. Hosts ask guests for donations or charge for a specific cocktail or treat. Kory Stamper, associate editor for Merriam-Webster, says the term \"Friendsgiving\" hasn't yet made it into the company's dictionary, but \"it's a good candidate for future inclusion.\" She says Friendsgiving started being used around 2007, with boosts from a 2011 Bailey's Irish Cream ad and also from a \"Real Housewives of New Jersey\" episode. Branding expert Nancy Friedman said on her blog, Wordworking.com, that Friendsgiving first turned up online in 2004 and was popularized in part by a 2013 Taco Bell promotion. Some people think the term is connected to the TV sitcom \"Friends,\" which was famous for its annual Thanksgiving-with-friends episodes, but Friedman doesn't think the word was ever used on the show, which ended in 2004. Danielle Paleafico, 29, started hosting Friendsgiving five years ago in one of her first apartments after college, and now it's grown into an all-day, drop-in event for 30 to 40 friends at her home in Morristown, New Jersey. \"We watch football, I make turkey, all the usual side dishes, homemade pasta and meatballs, dessert, etc.,\" she said. \"Everyone usually brings a dish and a bottle of wine or beer and we all just come together casually, watch the games, catch up and enjoy each other.\" Timing is important: She picks a date before the real Thanksgiving, and then \"we all go our separate ways for the holiday and give thanks with our own families.\"",

      "text": "By Aditi Shah | MUMBAI MUMBAI The board of Tata Global Beverages, which co-owns and runs Starbucks coffee stores across India, has replaced Cyrus Mistry as its chairman, the first Tata group company to depose him since his removal last month from the helm of parent holding company Tata Sons.Mistry said in a statement the manner in which he was replaced as chairman of Global Beverages was \"inaccurate and illegal,\" intensifying the high-profile power struggle at the Tata group.In a boardroom coup last month Mistry was removed as chairman of Tata Sons, the holding company for the $100 billion steel-to-software Tata empire in which Mistry's family hold a minority stake. Patriarch Ratan Tata is now back in charge as a bitter public row ensues.Despite being removed as chairman of Tata Sons, and now Tata Global Beverages, Mistry still remains chairman of some of the group's major companies like Tata Motors and Tata Steel, where Tata Sons does not have majority ownership. Tata Sons has called shareholder meetings at these companies to get Mistry ousted from those boards.\n\nThe post Tata Global Beverages ousts Cyrus Mistry as chairman\n| Reuters appeared first on Firstpost.",

      "text": "Starbucks' Newest Drink is Inspired by the Holiday Season By: Mishal Omar   starbucks & birminghammail Starbucks is one of the biggest players in terms of product offers and marketing during the holiday season and this year's newest fudge hot chocolate drink is likely to appeal to its loyal customers. The beverage is similar to the brand's hot chocolate with the addition of one significant ingredient -- fudge. It contains a fudge syrup that is added to the brand's basic hot chocolate drink and also features fudge whipped cream. The beverage is topped with gold chocolate curls -- giving it an appearance that is highly relevant to the holiday season while also making it appear luxurious and indulgent. This fudge hot chocolate beverage is the quintessential holiday drink and serves as a reminder of Starbucks' continued relevance throughout this consumption-focused season.",

      "text": "More than a decade ago, Starbucks' (NASDAQ: SBUX) ubiquity was often the butt of jokes. The Onion wrote that a Starbucks had opened in the bathroom of an existing Starbucks, and comedian Lewis Black said he had seen the end of the world -- a Starbucks across the street from another Starbucks.\nThough it seems that the leading coffee chain long ago reached cultural saturation, it keeps finding new ways to grow. The company's taking over China, where CEO Howard Schultz said he expects there to one day be more stores than in the U.S. It's grown profits through its channel development segment, which includes consumer products such as K-cups and bagged coffee, and it continues to find new ways to expand its footprint even in its home market. Its partnerships with Target (NYSE: TGT) , for example, now has 1,300 Starbucks cafes inside its stores. The company is also licensing its brand in places like college campuses and expanding to new neighborhoods that it might have avoided earlier in its history.\n\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "Instagram Downloads \nAbout 4,200 miles after the first of 62 teams departed from Seattle’s Space Needle, the Old Glory Relay ended on Veterans Day in Tampa, Florida. \nTeams of 800 runners, walkers and cyclists carried an American flag from the Northwest to the Southeast in an effort to raise awareness of veterans service organizations and their work supporting veterans. The route started in Washington state on September 11, heading south through Southern California before turning east and continuing through the Southwest and the Gulf Coast, ending in Tampa on November 11. \nTeam Red, White & Blue , a nonprofit that strives to enrich the lives of America’s veterans by connecting them to their communities through physical and social activity, presented the Old Glory Relay for the third consecutive year. Starbucks and the Schultz Family Foundation are among the event’s supporters and a number of Starbucks partners (employees) participated in the relay. \n“Starbucks is proud to partner with Team Red, White & Blue to bring veterans, their families and American citizens together to support the Old Glory Relay,” said Virginia Bergin,   Impact. “Running and cycling under the American flag for 4,000 miles across the country is a great way for veterans and civilians to come together for a shared purpose. Our Military Family Stores are designed to build a stronger connection between the military and communities and served as an ideal connection point between partners and relay teams to host Hail and Farewells.” \nMelissa Ochs, district manager for the region around Camp Pendleton, was at a Starbucks Military Family Store in Oceanside, California, late in the morning of September 30 when she and two-dozen others waiting to greet the participating athletes heard U.S. Marines chanting as they neared the store with the flag held high. \n“It gave me chills,” Ochs said. “The runner who they gave the flag to was an older gentleman. He was a veteran and he grabbed the flag and was out. The pride that every single person holding that flag or being a part of it demonstrated was heartwarming.” Starbucks Allies with Veterans Service Organizations \nThe partnership between Starbucks and Team Red, White & Blue reflects the company’s commitment to creating opportunities for veterans as they transition from military service to civilian careers. Starbucks, which has hired 8,000 veterans and military spouses toward a goal of hiring 10,000 by the end of 2018, also partners with Team Rubicon, which deploys veterans to provide disaster relief; Blue Star Families, which addresses challenges to military families; and The Mission Continues, which empowers veterans adjusting to civilian life through community service. \n ",

Have you begun planning your organization's holiday social media campaigns yet? \nDuring this hectic time of year, it's easy to rely on tired, overused holiday-themed posts, but an infographic from MDG Advertising challenges you to spice things up a bit this year. \nThe graphic shares seven ways to freshen up your social media posts that will not only grab your audience's attention, but also close the gap between social media and sales. [ RELATED: Attend the Big 5 social media boot camp, with presentations on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram. ] \nHere are a few of the ideas: 1. Develop custom Snapchat geofilters: Using these tools can be a strong word-of-mouth tactic, as they publicize that users are interacting with your brand. 2. Use Pinterest rich pins: This feature enables you to include purchase links, app downloads and other call-to-action tactics in a Pinterest pin. 3. Showcase gift ideas in Instagram carousel ads: These ads enable you to include three to five images and links to external sites in one Instagram post. \nGet more information on these tactics and more in the infographic below:",

      "text": "9.1% Click to enlarge The combination of Starbucks' latest giant payout hike, plus the market's irrational slide this past year has resulted in a fantastic opportunity to get Starbucks at its all time high-yield (note that the below chart hasn't had time to update the yield due to the dividend hike being too new). SBUX Dividend Yield (NYSE: TTM ) data by YCharts Better yet, because long-term total returns are driven by yield + dividend growth , today's investors can buy Starbucks at a price that promises to crush the market's historical 9.1% CAGR since 1871. In fact, given the remarkably cyclical nature of Starbucks' yield, I wouldn't be surprised to see it hit a price of $120 to $125 by the end of 2018; which would represent a 52% CAGR from today's share price. Not that I necessarily recommend anyone partake in this kind of long-term technical analysis mind you, and I'm not saying that Starbucks' yield will always move in such perfect rhythm. However, no matter how you slice it, this blue chip dividend growth champ is well on its way to delivering superior long-term returns for investors. Risks to watch for There are two main risks that I'm watching for going forward. First, the strong 2016 global comps were pretty much all due to increased pricing, with flat or even slightly negative traffic. While this pricing power is indeed impressive, and shows the strength of the loyalty rewards program, at the same time long-term comps growth, and thus dividend growth, will require higher foot traffic over time. Fortunately, improving economic conditions, including rising wages, and stronger consumer retail spending should help to alleviate some of this risk in 2017. Of course, such positive short-term trends can quickly reverse themselves, and if the US were to enter a recession then Starbucks might struggle to post positive comps at all. Even if the best case scenario does play out, in which US economic growth continues to accelerate, raising consumer confidence, and Starbucks' store traffic, a stronger economy would likely result in higher interest rates. That in turn would likely cause further strengthening of the dollar and result in stronger negative currency headwinds just as Starbucks is doubling down on its store growth abroad. We've already seen long-term treasury yields rise by about 50 basis points since the shocking results of the election. And that's just on the market's rising inflationary expectations from the Trump administration's potential fiscal stimulus plan (infrastructure spending + tax cuts). Click to enlarge Source: CME Group Add in the near certainty that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term rates in December, and that Janet Yellen's replacement in February of 2018 is likely to be more hawkish, and a rising dollar might end up as one of Starbucks' biggest growth headwinds in the coming years. Bottom line: If you are a dividend growth investor and you don't own Starbucks you're doing it wrong I'm not going to lie to you and say that this is the bottom for Starbucks, or that the last year's underperformance guarantees market thumping returns in 2017 or even 2018. In the short-term the market can be crazy, and totally unpredictable. BUT what I can tell you is that Starbucks is blessed with visionary management with a solid plan for how to keep the growth, and rising margin train rolling along for many years to come. Which is likely to mean continued dividend growth excellence, and over the long-term, potentially spectacular total returns. Disclosure: I am/we are long SBUX.

      "text": "Starbucks is a company that sells an addictive product. \nStarbucks has a growing global footprint. \nStarbucks has a growing dividend payment. As a relatively new investor who's interested in a growing income stream that builds over time, I'm looking for companies that have an opportunity to help me toward that goal. Popular companies that have iconic brands and revenue streams that have the opportunity to grow are some of the best places to start when combined with relatively low dividend payout ratios. One of the companies that has caught my interest over the past year has been Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ). This company, which started in Seattle with a single coffee shop way back in 1971 has seen quite a bit of exponential growth over nearly a half-century in existence. A Massive Growth Story When Starbucks went public in 1992, it had 165 stores in operation. From this relatively small start, the coffee giant has grown to more than 22,500 stores at the end of 2015, which included an increase of more than 1,100 stores in the past year (Source: Starbucks Company Timeline ). In 2014, the company had a goal of having 30,000 stores in operation within five years. This is some pretty substantial growth in a short amount of time. The company's main product is coffee, which is a relatively addictive product. I know people who come to work with a cup of Starbucks coffee on a regular basis. There is no doubt that the product is pretty popular. Additionally, it sells at a premium to the coffee that many other companies sell, which tends to lead to higher profitability. This addictive product is the first reason that I'm investing in SBUX. The second reason is the growing international footprint that the company has. I have been to several different countries throughout the world in the past decade or so. In every major city that I've visited in the time, I've seen at least one, and usually multiple Starbucks. This goes from Prague, to Paris, to Tegucigalpa. Much of the growth that the company has experienced has been overseas. This provides geographical diversification through a single American-based stock, as revenue is coming from many different areas of the world. Included in this growth is an intended 1,400 new stores in China that should be opened between 2016 and 2019. The Chinese economy has been growing rapidly in recent years, and there is hope that new additions to the middle class in China and other developing nations will spend their money on the addictive nectar. Growing Revenue and a Growing Dividend My final reason for investing in Starbucks is the rapidly growing dividend payment. Over the past five years, going back to FY2012, the revenue that Starbucks has been able to bring in has gone up every year. Revenue has grown from $13.3 billion in FY2012 to $21.32 billion in the most recent fiscal year. This is a CAGR of slightly more than 12 percent, which most people will be pretty happy with should it continue over the long term. Additionally, net income has more than doubled over the same 5-year period from $1.38 billion to $2.82 billion. This is a CAGR of more than 19 percent between 2012 and 2016. It should be noted that net income in 2013 was only $8.8 million, but all of the other years in the sample were very profitable. (Source: MarketWatch ) While this revenue and income growth alone would be a great reason to invest in SBUX, there is also the issue of the dividend. As a dividend investor who likes to see the dividend grow over time, Starbucks has not failed to impress on this front, either. The coffee giant paid its first dividend a little more than six years ago in March 2010, and the first payment was $0.05 on a split-adjusted basis. From this small start, in which an investor who owned 100 shares at the time would have earned a mere $10, SBUX recently raised its dividend to $0.25 per share, a 25 percent increase on a year-over-year basis. This increase, if continued, would result in a doubling of the dividend in slightly less than three years. The investor who would have held 100 shares and earned $10 back in March 2010 would now own 200 shares after the 2-for-1 split that took place in April 2015 and receive a dividend payment of $50 each quarter. The dividend has grown five-fold since its inception. Even after all of this dividend growth in just over six years, the dividend payout ratio on a trailing 12-month basis is at 56 percent. This will likely change when the annual report is released. The current yield is 1.83 percent. Both of these metrics are higher than they have been previously, but should revenue and income continue to grow, there is no reason to believe that Starbucks will not be able to grow the dividend into the future as well, albeit at a slower rate than it has grown in the past six years. This is the main reason that I'm nibbling at SBUX and planning to build up a position over time. Disclosure: I am/we are long SBUX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

      "title": "Starbucks: Challenges Ahead",
      "text": "We are concerned that rising coffee prices could impact margins over the next 12 months. \nFurthermore, the strong U.S. dollar and weakening yuan could impact its earnings growth next year. \nWith its stock trading at 28.5 times earnings, any sign of slowing growth could cause a sell off. \nWe believe investors should stay clear of the coffee giant until at least its first quarter results. Click to enlarge Global coffee giant Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is easily one of our favorite companies to own and when the price is right you'll almost certainly find it in our portfolio. Although its stock is down 9% this year and looks to be much better value than in recent times, there are a number of challenges ahead that could mean it's better for investors to hold off making an investment. Click to enlarge Sourced from Finviz The first challenge will be rising coffee prices. Despite the fact that coffee prices have fallen since the election due to a strengthening U.S. dollar, we don't see prices falling much lower. As demand continues to grow at a quicker rate than supply, we expect this deficit to keep prices higher for longer. Earlier this year the USDA predicted that demand for coffee would reach its highest levels ever in the United States, China, India, and Japan this year Unfortunately for coffee buyers though the supply just isn't there to cope with this demand. This has led to coffee stockpiles falling for eleven straight quarters. According to Bloomberg this is the longest run of declines since records began in 1995. As a result the USDA has forecast for global coffee inventories to drop to a four-year low this time next year. This is not good news for Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts (NASDAQ: DNKN ), and UK-based Costa Coffee operator Whitbread ( OTC:WTBCF ). All three are likely to see margins negatively impacted by rising prices. As you can see above, prior to inventories sinking to extreme low levels four years ago, coffee prices rose strongly. When you factor in the incredible rise in demand since then, it does make you wonder how far prices could rise this time around. This makes going long with the iPath Dow Jones-UBS Coffee ETN (NYSEARCA: JO ) a very tempting proposition in our view. Although these companies will of course hedge in order to avoid rising prices. There's only so long you can hedge prices before they impact you. With no sign of the coffee deficit coming to an end next year and demand expected to rise, Starbucks and its peers may have to adjust to life with higher coffee prices. As we have previously pointed out, in fiscal year 2012 Starbucks noted how the high coffee prices were negatively impacting its performance in its 10K . The company explained that: \n\"… the impact of higher commodity costs, mostly coffee, which negatively impacted operating income by approximately $214 million for the year, equivalent to approximately 160 basis points of impact on operating margin.\" The next concern we have is the strong U.S. dollar (NYSEARCA: UUP ) and the effect this will have on its international earnings. Since Trump won the race to the White House the U.S. dollar index has surged higher. Although it has given back a bit recently, we don't see it dropping much further moving forward. Especially with a rate rise in December looking almost inevitable now. Whilst the Americas segment is still the number one contributor to revenue, with its U.S. stores providing the bulk of the sales, in the fourth quarter Starbucks pulled in almost 31% of its revenue from international markets. The big worry in our opinion is China's decision to devalue the yuan. As you can see below the U.S. dollar has appreciated in value against the yuan considerably in the last few months. Scarily the chart above is out of date as well, with China letting its currency weaken to an eight-year low of 6.87 overnight. That's an almost 8 percent decline in value in the space of 12 months for the yuan. With Starbucks pinning a great deal of its growth on the China market, we fear the significant FX headwinds it will face next year are going to result in lower-than-expected earnings growth. At present analysts expect earnings to grow 15.6 percent on last year's result (excluding the 53rd week) to $2.14 per share. But we're not sure it will deliver on this. So with its stock trading on a price to earnings ratio of 28.5, we do feel it is at risk of further declines over the next couple of quarters if its earnings growth is lacking. Because of this we think it would be prudent for investors to stay clear of Starbucks until at least its first quarter result. By then we should be able to see if coffee prices and the strong dollar are impacting its performance. If Starbucks escapes unscathed then we see it being fair value right now. But if it doesn't, a rerating down to a price to earnings ratio of 20 to 25 might be appropriate. Until then, best of luck with your investments!

      "text": "NEW YORK – If President-elect Donald Trump is going to go soft on climate change regulations, big business is going to put up a big stink. In an open letter on Wednesday, Starbucks, Gap, Nike, L’Oreal, and hundreds of other American businesses joined together to tell Trump that they are committed to fighting global warming. And they implored the future president — who has called climate change a hoax —to keep the current low-carbon policies championed by President Obama.\n“We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy,” they wrote, adding “failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.”\nMore than 300 businesses signed the letter. It was announced in a press conference during the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) currently being held in Morocco.\nTrump said during his campaign that he would pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Climate Agreement. The 175 signatories to the non-binding treaty, including the United States, are committed to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases as a way of fighting climate change.\nBusiness leaders are not the only ones concerned over Trump’s climate change stance. Scientists have questioned what a refusal of the Paris Agreement would mean for the environment, and have expressed concern over Trump’s signaling that he will place climate change deniers in top White House positions.\nBy Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN\n",

      "text": "TWEET Starbucks , Nike and more than 360 other businesses and investors have called on President-elect Donald Trump and other world leaders to remain committed to the Paris agreement on climate change. \"Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness,\" the group said in a statement released and presented at United Nations climate talks in Marrakesh, Morocco, on Wednesday . Other signers include conglomerate Unilever, chemicals giant Dupont, and technology company Hewlett Packard. The Paris treaty was signed by nearly 200 countries to try and restore greenhouse gas emissions to sustainable levels by the year 2100 . A major goal is to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. A number of the world's largest companies are urging President-elect Trump to remain in the Paris Agreement. Source: Mark Lennihan/AP Backers of climate change action are concerned because there's good reason to expect that the United States might try and walk back its efforts to limit emissions in Trump's administration. The president-elect has called climate change a \" hoax ,\" promised to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency , and appointed Myron Ebell — who has argued greenhouse gas emissions could actually be beneficial — to lead his EPA transition effort. Even Exxon Mobile, the oil and gas multinational that has had a fraught relationship with climate change activists in the past, backs the Paris agreement. Suzanne McCarron, Exxon's vice president of public and government affairs, tweeted about the company's ongoing support of the treaty on Nov. 10, the morning after the election. \nThe Paris agreement is an important step forward by governments in addressing the serious risks of #ClimateChange https://t.co/X7JubyyArv Of course, other countries in the agreement may fight back in the event that the U.S. tries to back out. Former French President Nicholas Sarkozy — who will also likely be his center-right party's nominee for President — has floated the idea of imposing a tariff on U.S. imports to make up for reneging on the Paris agreement's financial commitments. That would need to be approved by other countries in the EU for it to have the desired effect, although it would pack a punch — Europe is still the United States' biggest trading partner. The clock is ticking: September 2016 was the hottest September in 136 years , as long as records have been kept. Like us on Facebook: ",

Often an institutional trader will ask for a \"picture\" to figure out what the actual supply and demand balance is before buying a stock. \n\"Ever since the Trump rally began, there have been buyers lurking underneath. They remain, even when the S&P 500 futures might drive stocks down off of whatever ails the market on any given day. They prop up the stocks that they are lurking under,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \nHowever, once the patience wears off, the buyers step up and end up competing with one another and the price of the stock rises. Cramer attributed the lurking buyers underneath propelled stocks like Disney , Starbucks and NVIDIA on Wednesday. \nJust a week ago, Disney shares fell amid concerns that ESPN is losing subscribers. However, Cramer noted that on the conference call, CEO Bob Iger said he was feeling more bullish about ESPN lately, which was an encouraging sign. \nSure enough, Deutsche Bank upgraded Disney to a buy from a hold on Wednesday because of those encouraging signs. This prompted buyers to step up. \nEven when the market turned down, the buyers underneath continued to buy stock. \n\"The opportunity was just too great, and they didn't want to miss it,\" Cramer said. \nLikewise, two weeks ago there was lukewarm praise for the quarter Starbucks reported. After an initial rally, the stock retreated down near where it was when rumors surfaced that it could report a weak quarter. \nStarbucks rose to $55 a share on Wednesday. Momentum is now with the bulls, and buyers lurking are now willing to pay up for the stock on a down tape, according to Cramer's colleague at Real Money, Bruce Kamich. Whatever investors disliked about Starbucks is now less relevant than all of the good things that are going on, especially in China, Cramer said. \nOn Tuesday, Cramer highlighted NVIDIA as the \"new Intel of this generation.\" Even after the stock's 30 percent gain in the past month, lurking buyers surfaced and took it up another 6 percent on Wednesday. \n\"Buyers just can't wait for this market to come down. They are stepping up each day for a host of stocks. The result? I always say there is a bull market somewhere and right now there are almost too many to count,\" Cramer said. \nQuestions for Cramer?

      "text": "By AARON CLAVERIE   Updated: 5:51 p.m. Gas station, Starbucks planned for Gateway project in Temecula Related article » \nThere's a new \"gateway\" to the city of Temecula. \nThe City Council this week approved the \"Gateway to Temecula\" project, a shopping center that will feature a Starbucks, gas station and an LA Fitness location. \nThe center is slated for land at the northwest corner of La Paz Road and Temecula Parkway, a long vacant parcel that a couple of years ago was being fitted for a new hotel and an upscale restaurant . \nIf the hotel/restaurant plans were ever a serious possibility, they appear to have been jettisoned some time ago. \nAccording to the designer of the project, Irvine-based Creative Development & Management, Inc. , the team worked with a nearby homeowners association for \"several years\" to craft a \"lifestyle center\" that \"enhances the quality of life for Temecula residents.\" \n\"From the color of the paint to the types of water-wise plants to the dark skies lighting fixtures, the 'Gateway to Temecula' has been painstakingly designed. Its architecture, signage, and way the businesses operate, all fit together with the Los Ranchitos Community,\" CDM posted on its website. \nDuring the meeting, there was a long discussion about a proposed upgrade to the intersection at La Paz and Ynez road, which is served right now by an overworked stop sign. \nTo deal with the traffic the center is expected to generate, the city imposed conditions on the developer to either pay their fair share toward building a roundabout at that intersection or contribute to a traffic signal there before tenants will be allowed to set up shop. \nThe council, which eventually OK'd the project in a 5-0 vote, was convinced by both staff and the applicant that the conditions were sufficient to address a host of contingencies that included the possibility of the developer being unable to secure right-of-way to build the roundabout. \nIn that scenario, the developer would work to install a traffic light as a sort of Plan B. \nWith the vote, the council signed off on a zone change from professional office to community commercial for the project, which features around 61,000 square feet of commercial space on an 8.79 acre site. \nAt the corner there will be signage that denotes the project's \"gateway\" status, which will take the form of words to that effect next to the sign the gas station will use to display prices.",

      "text": "Read Article \nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz may have spoken for many corporate CEOs when he said in a memo to employees that he was “stunned” about the election outcome last week. \nBut a week later, as the news of Trump’s win gave way to planning for his transition, the reality appears to be taking hold, and corporations are navigating how to respond in the aftermath of a historic election that proved explosively divisive. On the campaign trail, Trump bashed several U.S. companies. Rhetoric about women and minorities from Trump’s campaign, his supporters or his past create a minefield for corporations that tout their diversity and inclusion policies. Some CEOs or corporate officials who have spoken out have seen calls for boycotts of their brands on social media. \n“They’re clearly not as vocal, and in many cases are laying low and waiting to see what really is generated through the Republican-controlled Congress,” says Thomas Cooke, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business. \nHOPING FOR TAX REFORM \nYet that Republican-controlled Congress is also expected to usher in pro-business changes such as tax reform, infrastructure plans and regulatory changes that have some in the business community excited, said John Engler, a former governor of Michigan and the president of the Business Roundtable, which represents CEOs of the largest public corporations. \n“The reaction from the election has simply been ‘let’s get ready to take advantage of this opportunity that’s presented itself,'” he said in an interview. CEOs, he says, “are interested in growth. They awakened a week ago and said ‘wow, what was not possible is possible.’” \nIn its aftermath, the chief response from CEOs speaking out about the election included congratulations, calls for unity and commitments to diversity. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon wrote to his employees “we have just been through one of the most contentious elections in memory, which can make it even harder to put our differences aside.” Apple’s Tim Cook quoted Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and reminded employees that “our company is open to all … regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.” \nTRADE DEALS AT STAKE \nSome CEOs are starting to publicly offer more policy-oriented remarks or advice for Trump as the focus shifts from the results of the campaign to how he will govern. On Tuesday, General Electric’s Jeff Immelt, who had written an initial blog post to employees last week, suggested in a CNBC interview that Trump might actually find himself benefiting from trade deals. “I think what the president will learn,” the GE CEO said, “is that as he travels the world, trade deals give him power. … If the president of the United States travels around the world and has nothing to offer from a standpoint of economic connection, you lose half of your negotiating power. This guy is a negotiator, he’s a dealmaker. So I think let’s just wait and see what he does.” \nIn a letter to Trump released Tuesday, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty had a few proposals of her own. “I am writing to offer ideas that I believe will help achieve the aspiration you articulated and that can advance a national agenda in a time of profound change,” Rometty wrote. She suggested working together to scale up vocational “new collar” IT jobs, voiced support for a more competitive tax system, and recommended infrastructure projects incorporating technology and artificial intelligence.

Started in 1997, the initiative over the years has seen designs ranging from the modern, using whimsical brushstrokes in bold colors, to the nostalgic, featuring mistletoe and ornaments.\nFor this Christmas, Starbucks has further introduced new designs.

From traditional Christmas lights and ornaments, to snowflakes and winter landscapes, the red cups are inspired by the holiday stories of customers from around the world. A total of 12 designs will appear on hot cups, and there is one design on cold cups.\nStarbucks holiday cups will be served in the more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries around the world.\n“Christmas is a very special time for us at Starbucks and we are delighted to welcome the holiday spirit into our stores.

      "text": "Starbucks looks to go after the \"bigger is better\" crowd this holiday season with the 138-oz Giant Classic Mug as a potential Christmas gift for the Starbucks fan in your life.\n\nWhile the picture doesn't really give you a sense of the scale of the cup, it measures 9.84\" H x 12\" W (with handle) and carries a hefty price tag of $94.95.\n\nAt 138 ounces, the mug is big enough to fill up with a little over eight Grandes (their 16-oz cup size). Interestingly, it isn't biggest cup Starbucks has ever offered. Last year, they offered the the Big Logo Mug measuring 14.57\" H x 15.75\" W (with handle) over in Japan (pictured below). Also, apparently, back in 2001, for their 30th anniversary, they put out 1,000 5-gallon (640 oz) mugs for promotional display.\n\nUnfortunately, for those hoping to drink 128 ounces of coffee from the mug in one sitting, it's labeled as being \"for decorated purposes only,\" which means it is probably not coated inside to hold liquids. While you might chance a drink or two, I wouldn't use it for a regular cup (although I suppose you can glaze/seal it yourself...). Also, the Giant Classic Mug is already sold out online , although there's always they chance that they'll restock as Christmas approaches.\n\nPhotos via Starbucks & Starbucks Japan, respectively.

However, Trump ‘s victory in the U.S. election last week has overshadowed the event.\nTrump has threatened to tear up the U.S. commitment to the accord.\nThe 360+ group called on U.S. leaders to continue to participate in the Paris Agreement, support the continuation of U.S. commitments on climate change and continue to invest in low-carbon solutions at home and abroad.\n“Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness,” the group said, in the statement presented at U.N. climate talks being held this week in Marrakesh, Morocco.\n“Implementing the Paris Climate Agreement will enable and encourage businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars in existing low-carbon investments into the trillions of dollars the world needs to bring clean energy prosperity to all,” the group added.",

So I'm just standing there, and when one of the girls in the group gets her drink, she looks over to me and says \"Hey, **** Trump! Haha yeah!\" I don't miss a beat and say \"Okay then, get a room\". She walks away telling her group \"I did not expect that, that is not how I expected that to go.\" That's all really, just thought it was funny. Thought back on it and it mighta been better if I'd said \"Well it's about $170 for a night at the Marriott in downtown, but I doubt you're his type...\" Se la vie.",

Follow @rawstory \nA Donald Trump flew into a racist tantrum when his Starbucks order took longer than he believed it should have. \nThe man was caught on video hurling insults at employees and customers at a coffee shop near the University of Miami campus, reported the Miami New-Times . \nHe started hurling Trump’s name at black employees, who he accused of “anti-white discrimination” because his coffee was delayed, witnesses said. \nRelated: Trump-loving coffee shop owner insists he is not racist after threatening to hang black ‘monkeys’ \nAnother customer called the man an “assh*le,” and he replied “f*ck you, b*tch”— and that’s when Jorge de Cárdenas began recording. \nHis video captured the man, who has not been identified, calling a black employee “trash” and demanding a refund. \n“I voted for Trump! Trump!” the man said. “You lost, now give me my money back.” \nThe man demands the black employee’s name and continues insulting her, and another customer asks him to be more respectful or leave. \nThe Trump supporter then turns his fury on the other customer, and he threatened to punch the other man before storming out of the coffee shop. \nCárdenas said he didn’t understand why the Trump supporter was so angry. \n“The funny thing, besides just the concept of ‘anti-white discrimination,’ is just yelling ‘Trump!’ for no reason,” Cárdenas said. “Like dude, you won.” #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n— jorge de cárdenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 About the Author",

      "title": "Starbucks, Nike, and hundreds of other companies beg Donald Trump to fight climate change",
      "text": "Starbucks , Nike and more than 360 other businesses and investors have called on President-elect Donald Trump and other world leaders to remain committed to the Paris agreement on climate change.\n\"Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness,\" the group said in a statement released and presented at United Nations climate talks in Marrakesh, Morocco, on Wednesday .\nOther signers include conglomerate Unilever, chemicals giant Dupont, and technology company Hewlett Packard.\nThe Paris treaty was signed by nearly 200 countries to try and restore greenhouse gas emissions to sustainable levels by the year 2100 . A major goal is to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\nA number of the world's largest companies are urging President-elect Trump to remain in the Paris Agreement. Source: Mark Lennihan/AP Backers of climate change action are concerned because there's good reason to expect that the United States might try and walk back its efforts to limit emissions in Trump's administration.\nThe president-elect has called climate change a \" hoax ,\" promised to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency , and appointed Myron Ebell — who has argued greenhouse gas emissions could actually be beneficial — to lead his EPA transition effort.\nEven Exxon Mobile, the oil and gas multinational that has had a fraught relationship with climate change activists in the past, backs the Paris agreement.\nSuzanne McCarron, Exxon's vice president of public and government affairs, tweeted about the company's ongoing support of the treaty on Nov. 10, the morning after the election.\nThe Paris agreement is an important step forward by governments in addressing the serious risks of #ClimateChange https://t.co/X7JubyyArv\nOf course, other countries in the agreement may fight back in the event that the U.S. tries to back out.\nFormer French President Nicholas Sarkozy — who will also likely be his center-right party's nominee for President — has floated the idea of imposing a tariff on U.S. imports to make up for reneging on the Paris agreement's financial commitments.\nThat would need to be approved by other countries in the EU for it to have the desired effect, although it would pack a punch — Europe is still the United States' biggest trading partner.\nThe clock is ticking: September 2016 was the hottest September in 136 years , as long as records have been kept.",
