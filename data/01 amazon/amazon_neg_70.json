      "text": "Data Centers Amazon unveils new data center hardware to get you securely into the cloud At the 2016 re:Invent conference, AWS CEO Andy Jassy unveiled two new products, the Snowball Edge and Snowmobile, to make it even easier to get your data into the cloud. By Conner Forrest | November 30, 2016, 11:56 AM PST \nAmazon's Snowmobile is a 45-foot long container that is transported via semi truck. Image: Conner Forrest/TechRepublic \nAmazon will do whatever it takes to get your data to the cloud, including driving a semi truck to your data center and transporting it back to Amazon Web Services (AWS) HQ to migrate it for you. \nAt the 2016 AWS re:Invent conference on Wednesday, AWS CEO Andy Jassy unveiled the aforementioned semi truck, Snowmobile, and an updated version of its secure Snowball appliance called the Snowball Edge. While positioned for different scales of data, both products share the same goal of getting more of your data to the cloud, even faster. \nFor those with a lot of data to migrate, AWS has the Snowmobile. And yes, it is literally transported on a semi truck. The 45-foot long rugged container is capable of transporting up to an exabyte of data. AWS will drive the truck to your data center, take in the date, and drive it back to AWS for migration. \nTo transport an exabyte of data using a 10Gbps dedicated connection, it would take you around 26 years to complete. With a few Snowmobiles, Jassy said, it would only take six months. Each Snowmobile container is 100 PB. Data Center Must-Reads Ebook: IT leader’s guide to making DevOps work \nOn the smaller side of things, the Snowball Edge is a standalone appliance that holds up to 100 TB of data. Amazon originally introduced the Snowball back in 2015, but the new version has many updates. According to a press release from Amazon, the Snowball Edge \"has four times the network speed, built in Wi-Fi and cellular wireless communication, and a Network File System (NFS) interface with an Amazon S3-compatible endpoint that allows the Snowball Edge to connect to the cloud and pass data back and forth with Amazon S3.\" \nThe Snowball Edge also has AWS Greengrass, a new software for embedding Amazon Lambda compute on connected devices, included standard. The software integration will make it easier for firms to collect IoT and sensor data on the appliance and move them to the cloud. \nThe updating of the Snowball product and the announcement of the Snowmobile mark an interesting shift for Amazon toward data center hardware. It also shows that Amazon is recognizing the need enterprises have for in-between and hybrid solutions before they are ready to go fully to the cloud. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Amazon launched a new version of its Snowball product called Snowball Edge, and a massive data transport service called Snowmobile. Both new products exist to help move customer data to the cloud. These hardware products show that Amazon is willing to meet customers where they are, even if they aren't ready to go fully to the cloud.

      "title": "Amazon Developing a New Echo Speaker with a 7-inch Touch Screen, To Take On Google Home",
      "text": "Comment Bloomberg has reported that according to some sources, Amazon is developing a new Echo-like speaker with a 7-inch touch screen display. It does not have a cylindrical design like the online retailer's other smart home devices. Scott Lewis / Flickr \nAmazon is stepping up its game by developing a new \"premium Echo-like speaker\" with a 7-inch touch screen display. It is said to work with the online retailer's digital assistant Alexa. This move is more likely Amazon's take on the recently launched Google Home and Apple's yet to be released own smart home device. \nAccording to Bloomberg , sources familiar with the matter revealed that this new device will be announced in the first quarter of next year. Unlike its popular signature cylindrical smart home gadgets, it does not function solely upon voice commands enabled by Alexa. They shared that the touch screen display can be used to control the new Echo-like speaker. This means that you can now easily access content that includes weather forecasts, calendar appointments and news. \nOne of the sources added that the speaker is actually larger and the screen can be tilted upwards. Furthermore, it is equipped with high-grade speakers that are not present in current Echo devices. Naturally, this upcoming Amazon gadget will provide a way better sound . It should be able to \"play high-quality audio at all volume levels,\" one of the sources said. \nThis new Amazon product will use an \"optimized version of Fire OS\", the same one that Fire tablets and Fire TVs are running on. Users should still expect a response from the new device with regards to verbal commands and spoken questions. Amazon might also integrate a feature that will let users \"to pin items such as photos\" on the new speaker's screen. With all these in mind, it's highly probable that the speaker with a touch screen will cost more than the existing ones. Amazon is yet to confirm this report. Apparently, the online retailer declined to comment. \nIt's not surprising that Amazon is building this innovative smart home device. This is considering the fact that it is facing growing competitions like Google and Apple, according to the Business Insider . It's not only the battle of smart speakers but of digital assistants as well. The Google Home was introduced alongside the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL flagship smartphones back on Oct. 4. It was released in the US on Nov. 4. The Google smart home device is equipped with Google Assistant compared to Echo's Alexa. \nOn the other hand, Bloomberg and The Information had previously reported that Apple was working on \"an Echo-esque smart home device\". The tech giant will use its own digital assistant, Siri. As companies further invest on perfecting artificial intelligence, it will translate into more innovative features as far as gadgets are concerned.",

      "text": "Cloud Computing Here's what your hardware needs for the AWS Greengrass IoT service Amazon's Greengrass offline IoT service will work on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 410c board and should work with Raspberry Pi 3 U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 30, 2016 2:10 PM   \nQualcomm's Snapdragon 410c developer board can be used to make robots, drones and IoT devices. Credit: Qualcomm 2016 State of The Cloud \nAmazon is bringing a bit of its AWS magic to devices and board computers with its Greengrass IoT service, which will help boost offline data collection and analysis. \nThe goal of Greengrass, an AWS software tool, is to make IoT devices and maker boards smarter. Even underpowered devices collecting data won't be \"dumb\" anymore, Amazon says. \nAmazon has kept in mind that smart devices can't always be connected to the cloud for data analysis, and Greengrass brings some AWS software tools to devices to aid in better collection and analysis of data. MORE ON NETWORK WORLD: 12 Free Cloud Storage options \nDeveloper boards are strongly tied to cloud services, which add more functionality to smart devices. Data collected from sensors are typically dispatched and collected in the cloud, where it can be analyzed and can define the next steps. \nSmarter sorting of data on IoT devices could speed up the analysis, and ensure the right data is sent to the cloud. Sending loads of useless IoT data to cloud services can eat up bandwidth and cost money. \nFor example, data from sensors in industrial equipment can be analyzed to improve manufacturing or cut down on injuries. In the petroleum industry, sensors can be used to collect data that could effectively nail down the geographic location of oil reserves. \nA robot or drone operator could offload basic training models to the devices to help in movement and navigation without being connected to the cloud. \n\"Code running in the field can collect, filter, and aggregate freshly collected data and then push it up to the cloud for long-term storage and further aggregation,\" Amazon said in a blog post . \"Further, code running in the field can also take action very quickly, even in cases where connectivity to the cloud is temporarily unavailable.\" \nMany developer boards are being used for IoT. Raspberry Pi started off as a hobbyist board but is now tied to cloud services like Microsoft's Azure and IBM's Bluemix. Greengrass will work with a large number of developer boards. \nGreengrass has some hardware requirements. It requires minimum memory of 128MB of memory and a 1GHz ARM or x86 CPU. A user needs to run the Amazon Linux or the Ubuntu OS. Qualcomm has said Greengrass will work on its Snapdragon 410c chip, and the offline IoT service likely work on Raspberry Pi, which meets the minimum requirements. \nOther major developer boards like Orange Pi and Pine64 also meet the minimum requirements. Samsung's Artik developer board is tied tightly to Artik Cloud but is not friendly to other cloud services. \nAmazon said Greengrass will work on Intel hardware. However, the company could not immediately say if Intel developer boards like Joule would work with Greengrass. \nQualcomm said it believes Greengrass will be used by large-scale manufacturers making devices that rely on AWS cloud. \nAWS cloud services are wildly popular, and with Greengrass, more IoT devices could rely on the company's cloud.

      "text": "  13:40 PM EST Amazon Rolls Tractor Trailer Truck Up to Your Data Center, Called ‘Snowmobile’ Amazon.com ’s ( AMZN ) cloud computing conference in Las Vegas today offered up a Vegas-worthy stunt, a tractor-trailer truck that rolled up on stage, to much applause. Andy Jassy , CEO of the company’s cloud computing service, brought the truck, called “ Snowmobile ,” on stage toward the end of his keynote address. Snowmobile is an offering for companies that need to move “Exabytes” of data, he said, which turned out to be more companies than one might think. The trunk is a follow-up to a data appliance that Amazon already offers called “ Snowball .” Snowball is a stand-alone computer that companies can take into the field to collect data, which later gets uploaded to their Amazon AWS account. Snowmobile is for companies that want to move huge amounts of data. Snowmobile drives to a customer location, plugs into the data center computes of the customer via a fiber-optic cable, and carts the data back to Amazon’s AWS facilities.",

      "text": "Amazon announces 3 artificial intelligence tools for AWS Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos. @chris_griffith \nAmazon has announced three mind blowing artificial intelligence services that will bring speech processing to retailing, the media and its cloud customer base. \nAmazon Lex, the technology that powers its Amazon Alexa home assistant, will be available to developers wanting to build conversational user experiences for web, mobile, and connected device apps. It will be available today as a preview. \nA speech recognition engine known as Amazon Polly that reads text will see apps talk with 47 voices in 24 languages. \nAnd image recognition software known as Amazon Rekognition will empower developers to add image analysis to applications, using deep learning-based image and face recognition. \nIn announcing its new AI tools, Amazon has joined the ranks of IBM, Google, and Microsoft in seeking to redefine human interaction online around speech. Instead of just mainly typing and texting, we face a future internet shaped increasingly around services delivered using speech interaction with bots. \nFurther, the computing giants are offering these tools as part of their regular cloud services in what is a highly competitive market. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are emerging as core offerings in the cloud. Developers will be able to use Amazon’s tools with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to build their applications. \nIn its announcement, Amazon said it would use Polly to generate audio versions of stories that run online with The Washington Post., which Amazon founder John Bezos bought in 2013 for $US250m. \nPolly will work with Amazon’s video creation platform called GoAnimate to give voice to characters animated on its platform. “The speech from Amazon Polly is integrated seamlessly with our rich set of pre-animated assets, which reinforces GoAnimate’s ease of use and affords our customers both efficiency and speed to market,” Amazon says in a statement released overnight \n“Amazon AI services are fully managed services so there are no deep learning algorithms to build, no machine learning models to train, and no upfront commitments or infrastructure investments required. \n“This frees developers to focus on defining and building an entirely new generation of apps that can see, hear, speak, understand, and interact with the world around them,” Amazon says. \n“AWS (Amazon Web Service) is home to some of the most innovative and creative AI applications in use today,” said Raju Gulabani, VP, Databases, Analytics, and AI, AWS. \n“The combination of better algorithms and broad access to massive amounts of data and cost-effective computing power provided by the cloud is making AI a reality for application developers.” \n“Thousands of machine learning and deep learning experts across Amazon have been developing AI technologies for years to predict what customers might like to read, to drive efficiencies in our fulfilment centres through robotics and computer vision technologies, and to give customers our AI-powered virtual assistant, Alexa. \n“Now, we are making the technology underlying these innovations available to any developer in the form of three fully managed Amazon AI services that are easy to use, powerful, and cost effective.” \nAmazon says bots built using Amazon Lex can be used anywhere: from web applications, to chat and messenger apps like Slack and Facebook Messenger, or through voice in apps on mobile or connected devices. \nIt names US financial services provider Capital One, healthcare organisation OhioHealth and marketing and sales software company HubSpot as early adopters of Lex. \nMicrosoft similarly has announced beefed-up AI tools for its Azure cloud based platform. They include Azure Bot services which lets developers build, deploy and manage bots on the Azure cloud and Cortana Intelligence Suite, for building applications that store large amounts of data, process it, and create intelligence from it.

Add A Comment Amazon Web Services today revealed more information about their EC2 Elastic GPUs support they are working to implement in the cloud. Amazon's Elastic GPUs will be offered in four different tiers and range in GPU memory capacity from 1GB to 8GB. They also revealed their work on an Amazon-optimized OpenGL library for Elastic GPUs. They shared that initially there is just Windows support for OpenGL but they are working to support Amazon Linux AMI with their OpenGL implementation. They are also looking at Vulkan support (and DirectX too, sadly). With the Amazon EC2 OpenGL support they are promoting their acquired NICE Desktop Cloud Visualization software for showing renderings via HTML5 web-browsers. Those curious about Amazon's EC2 OpenGL plans can be found via this aws.amazon.com post . Will be interesting to hear more technical implementation details when available.

      "text": "Alexa, Tell Me Where You’re Going Next Amazon’s VP of Alexa talks about machine learning, chatbots, and whether industry is strip-mining AI talent from academia. In the Game of Thrones -like artificial intelligence competition between Houses Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, the company most reticent to speak about its technology has usually been the one that ships planeloads full of stuff to consumers, hosts thousands of companies in its data centers, greenlit Catastrophe , and has a breakaway hit product that answers questions, plays music, and 4,998 or so other things. Yes, for some time, Amazon has been even more shrouded than the famously secret Apple, which opened up about its machine learning programs earlier this year. Lately, however, Amazon’s head scientist and vice president of Alexa, Rohit Prasad, has been speaking up in public, making the case for his company’s prowess in voice recognition and natural language understanding. Alexa, of course, is the conversational platform that supports that aforementioned hit product, Echo .\nToday Prasad is giving an Alexa “State of the Union” address at the Amazon Web Services conference in Las Vegas, announcing an improved version of the Alexa Skills Kit , which helps developers create the equivalent of apps for the platform; a beefed-up Alexa Voice Service , which will make it easier to transform third-party devices like refrigerators and cars into Alexa bots; a partnership with Intel; and the Alexa Accelerator that, with the startup incubator Techstars , will run a 13-week program to help newcomers build Alexa skills. Prasad and Amazon haven’t revealed sales numbers, but industry experts have estimated that Amazon has sold over five million Echo devices so far.\nPrasad, who joined Amazon in 2013, spent some time with Backchannel before his talk today to illuminate the direction of Alexa and discuss how he’s recruiting for Jeff Bezos’s arsenal without drying up the AI pipeline. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nSteven Levy: You’re in charge of Alexa. Tell me where things stand with it in 2016. \nRohit Prasad Rohit Prasad: We’re excited about where things are. We did several device launches and also expanded internationally. And we’ve made huge progress in teaching Alexa to better understand you, both in terms of the surface area Alexa covers, as well as accuracy within search material. For instance, think about music as a domain: We have new capabilities [for] you [to be] able to search for or play a song, based on its lyrics. And lastly is the speed at which third-party skills are being built. Earlier this year we had only a few hundred, and now we are in the 5,000 range.\nWhat are the conversational aspirations for the Alexa platform? Are our Echos something we should be talking to, or talking with? \nAlexa is already providing a large set of utilities and experiences, where a few one-shot intents work with very high accuracy. From a conversational aspect, I think there a lot of trade-offs on doing it right. Alexa shouldn’t come back and ask you [needless] questions. That would be really frustrating. But Alexa should always ask a question when needed, and the ability to have a conversation is super important as well. Are you aware of the Alexa Prize competition?\nThis is the $2.5 million challenge to computer science students that you announced in September? \nYes. In academia it’s hard to do research in conversation areas because they don’t have a system like Alexa to work with. So we are making it easy to build new conversational capabilities with a modified version of the Alexa skills kit. This grand challenge is to create a social bot that can carry on a meaningful, coherent, and engaging conversation for 20 minutes.\nWould that be a Turing-level kind of conversation, do you think? \nNo, the Turing test comes down to human gullibility — can you fool an outsider into thinking it’s a human? If you think about certain tasks, Alexa is already better than a human. It’s super hard for a human to play a particular song out of millions of catalog entries within a second, right? If you ask Alexa to compute factorial of 60, that’s hard for a human. So we definitely did not want it to be like a Turing test. It’s more about coherence and engagement.\nWhat are people going to be talking about in these 20 minute conversations with Alexa? \nWe are giving topics. Like, “Can you talk on the trending topics in today’s newspaper?” We expect the social bot to be able to chat with you on topics like scientific inventions, or the financial crisis.\nHave you had a lot of responses to the challenge? \nWe got an overwhelming number of applications, hundreds and hundreds. We are providing funding to university students — these are grad students who are also taking time off from their research, or hopefully it’s very aligned with their research, so we wanted to make sure that they have sponsorship for the compelling application of speech. We got so many that we couldn’t decide on the original ten we had planned, and we ended up funding twelve teams .\nBecause of the huge demand in corporations for the best students in AI and machine learning, there’s worry that academia might lose its core talent. \nIt is a concern. This is one of the reasons that I was motivated to start the Alexa Prize. We want to build the next generation of machine learning and AI scientists, and academia plays an important role in that. I think it would be very myopic and very scary if every professor moved to companies like us.\nOn the other hand, you are obviously hiring AI talent, competing with with Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and even traditional companies. What’s the pitch that you give potential recruits to come to Amazon? \nI don’t think I should answer that, because those other companies will copy it.\nActually, if you answer it well, those people might read it here and apply to work at Amazon .\nWhat’s unique about research in a company like Amazon is the combination of data, computing power, and the best minds in the world all coming together to solve a customer-facing problem. Working on a customer-facing problem doesn’t take away the innovation — it actually accelerates innovation. The problems we try to solve at Amazon are all super, super hard. When Alexa started, solving speech recognition and natural language understanding across many different domains was clearly a very, very hard problem.\nToday you are announcing new tools that will help developers, right? \nYes. One of the key things we want to make simple for developers is what we call “built-in intent” and “slot types.”\nExplain, please. \nIn most skills, people will want to say things like, “Alexa, stop.” Or “cancel.” You want those commands, or intents, to be exposed to the developer, rather than trying to tell developers to build customized versions of things like the cancel/stop intent. Slot types are things like city names, vocabulary items. We had previously done a handful of them, things developers use quite often — around 10 intents and 15 slot types. So as part of third-party skills we’re announcing a larger set of hundreds built-in functions — slot types — across different domains, like books, video, or local businesses. And also a large set of intents as well, which help answer queries that people ask Alexa.\nSo in other words, if I’m the developer, I can rely on your built-in vocabulary and your interpretation of synonyms, in order to make my skill smarter off the bat. And you’re doing more. \nExactly. It gives you a much better starting point for interaction with skills. We’re announcing this as a developer preview, because of two reasons. One is, we want to see how people use these in their intents, because we have a certain mindset of how these intents and types should be used. But the developer may have a slightly different mindset. And the customer may use it slightly differently as well. We want to make sure that we get some feedback from the developers and continually improve these, and we will keep adding more and more built-ins.\nRight now, when users invoke a skill on Echo, the mind of Alexa, to some degree, gets turned over to that developer. So what you’re implementing today is a step toward a standard Alexa vocabulary and means of execution that developers will plug into? \nYou’re absolutely right, this creates a common vocabulary which works for sharing and for helping Alexa itself to become better and better. Developers can integrate this new functionality so that they don’t have to recreate the same things.\nMy issue with Alexa is I’m just overwhelmed by what is available. Generally, you have to know that a skill exists in order to invoke it. Now that you are at 5,000 skills and counting, how can a user keep up? \nWe definitely want Alexa to tell you how to accomplish your query through a third-party skill, even if you don’t have knowledge of the skill. We haven’t done it yet, but definitely that’s something on our roadmap. Having a common vocabulary helps get us to that connection.\nAmazon is only one of several companies using AI to build a conversational interface. What’s unique about your approach? \nThe hands-free ability is key. That’s the killer application for speech. If you think about Alexa and Echo in particular, there was no cop-out in terms of solving the hard problem of interaction without a screen. So our thinking, from the get-go, was very different from other companies in terms of how conversation interface should be. It wasn’t like on a phone; it was a completely dedicated device which didn’t have a screen. We had to solve the hard problem.\nWhat about people who are concerned about having an open mic in the home? What can you tell people who are worried about, “Oh my god, Amazon is listening to me all the time!” \nPrivacy is important, and we are being very, very transparent about how we are approaching this. The cloud is not listening to you. It’s only on the device, acting as a detector, not a recognizer recognizing all words. It’s detecting whether Alexa is spoken versus something else. Once it determines Alexa was spoken to the device at a very high confidence, only then do we start streaming to the cloud.\nWill Alexa become proactive like Google Now or Apple notifications? Maybe telling me, if it hears me knocking around the house, that I should leave because I’m late for an appointment? \nWe’ve definitely thought about it. Because there’s no screen on Echo, there are some new [challenges] to it. We want to do things right with anything in terms of the kind of notifications you’re talking about. But right now I can’t reveal our exact approach to that.\nRight now, people pretty much have to choose one conversational interface for their assistant. Will we ever see some mashup where Alexa, Cortana, Google Home, or Samsung Viv, or whatever, all work together? \nIt’s very early days in these conversational settings. Having seen this for 20-plus years I still feel that the [intellectual property] of Alexa and Echo are revolutionary material, specifically in terms of interface. I think it remains to be seen; every company has a different set of offerings so you can imagine that there would be multiple AIs. But in terms of interoperation, it’s too early to tell.\nEcho, and the Alexa technology, seemed to come as a surprise to a lot of us, and at first people thought it was intended as a quick way to buy products from Amazon. Now it’s one of Amazon’s most popular products and a significant platform. Has your mission shifted? \nI wouldn’t say the mission has shifted. We are still very much doing things that we said three years back we should be doing. Right now there’s just a lot to do to make Alexa even more magical for our customers.",

      "text": "amazon / istock Like us on Facebook \nIf you're a LEGO fan or have a brick enthusiast on your list, there's a good chance you'll be picking up some LEGO sets this holiday season. And as experience shoppers know, paying for LEGO bricks can be almost as painful as stepping on them. Luckily, Amazon is running a limited-time Cyber Week deal on some popular Star Wars , Disney , and Marvel Super Heroes sets on top of some great DC Super Heroes bargains. Finding a LEGO deal can be tough, but whether you're looking for a big Millennium Falcon or Prince Elsa's Sparkling Ice Castle , Amazon has you covered with discounts of up to 20 percent off. We've found a few sets that are particularly great buys. \nMental Floss has affiliate relationships with certain retailers and may receive a small percentage of any sale. But we only get commission on items you buy and don’t return, so we’re only happy if you’re happy. Thanks for helping us pay the bills! STAR WARS DEALS",

      "title": "Amazon unveils Dash button for AWS IoT with twice the battery life of the original",
      "text": "During the busiest week of the year for the public cloud infrastructure provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS) today said that it has developed a new version of its IoT (internet of things) button with twice the battery capacity as the original, which made its debut in May .\nIt appears that this news is completely unrelated to the announcements coming out of AWS’ re:Invent conference in Las Vegas. The AWS IoT service was not mentioned during the keynote earlier today. That service, which was unveiled last year , lets customers integrate Internet-connected devices with their applications.\nThis button is a more programmable version of the Dash button that Amazon offers its customers to order Goldfish, condoms, Ziploc bags, and other products from home with the push of a button. Tech-savvy people can use AWS IoT to make the button set a variety of actions. As AWS says online:\nYou can code the button’s logic in the cloud to configure button clicks to count or track items, call or alert someone, start or stop something, order services, or even provide feedback. For example, you can click the button to unlock or start a car, open your garage door, call a cab, call your spouse or a customer service representative, track the use of common household chores, medications or products, or remotely control your home appliances. \nThe button can be used as a remote control for Netflix, a switch for your Philips Hue light bulb, a check-in/check-out device for Airbnb guests, or a way to order your favorite pizza for delivery. You can integrate it with third-party APIs like Twitter, Facebook, Twilio, Slack or even your own company’s applications.\nThe original model had enough battery to handle 1,000 button actuations. The new one is able to support more than 2,000, Amazon says in the description for the new product . It costs $19.95 like the original, and it will be officially released on February 2, 2017 — only Prime members will be able to purchase it, like the original.\nIf you don’t want to wait for the new one to become available, you can buy the first generation version and Amazon will give you $20 in AWS credits, according to a blog post .\nAlso notable: There is now an app for Android and iOS that simplifies the process of setting up and programming AWS IoT buttons.\n",

      "text": "Amazon \nSome epic struggles need no setup or backstory. If the story involves a knight and a dragon, then it’s usually fairly clear who must be slayed and who is doing the slaying. There’s certainly a need to establish the setting for such a struggle. Sometimes that setting is as big a part of the story as the proverbial dragon-slaying. When it comes to the X-men and the Inhumans, the setting for a conflict is basically a formality at this point. \nThis is a setup that doesn’t need to be belabored. The events of Death of X , as well as the various events that unfolded in the pages of Extraordinary X-men and Uncanny X-men, make it abundantly clear that these two teams are going to try and kill each other. It’s just a matter of when, where, in what circumstances, and how unbalanced it’s going to be. \nSince the conclusion of Secret Wars , the tension between the X-men and Inhumans is anything but balanced. Once side has the benefit of movie rights and an ongoing TV show. The other side’s movie rights are being held hostage by a rival company who managed to help Josh Trank ruin his directing career. Logistically speaking, there’s no way this conflict can ever be balanced. \nJeff Lemire and Charles Soule have an impossible task with the Inhumans vs. X-men event. With Inhumans vs. X-men #0 , they can at least put the pieces in place on the proverbial chessboard. The first shot isn’t fired, yet. The first ultimatum isn’t issued, yet. Nobody from the X-men or Inhumans even beings to trash talking one another on social media—yet. However, the story makes clear that these two teams are on a collision course and Emma Frost has her foot on the gas pedal. \nIn essence, Inhumans vs. X-men #0 is both a setup issue for a larger conflict and an Emma Frost story. It acts as a continuation of the events that unfolded in Death of X . In wake of Cyclops’ death, she’s the one who carries on the fight that he began. However, this is not one of those conflicts where a few extra hours in the Danger Room and a few team-ups with Deadpool can will equip the X-men for the coming battle. \nEmma Frost doesn’t try to be Cyclops in this story. She’s going to fight his battles, but she’s going to do it her way. That means using her wit, her cunning, and her willingness to do immoral things for moral reasons. It’s what makes her the White Queen. It’s what makes her a dangerous enemy and a questionable ally. Most importantly, though, it helps add some level of balance to the coming conflict. \nIt’s still not balanced by any objective measure, but Emma Frost navigates this narrative in a manner that makes clear this won’t be a simple shouting match between Storm and Medusa. This won’t be a battle that Black Bolt can end just by whispering, either. She gathers allies, makes deals with shady characters, and even trains herself to be ready in case her cunning and deceit just isn’t enough. In the grand scheme of things, Emma Frost is the only one in the X-men who is actually prepared for a battle with the Inhumans. \nHer story in Inhumans vs. X-men #0 carries the bulk of the dramatic weight and provides most of the substance. The role of the other characters involved, however, aren’t quite as engaging. If anything, they reinforce the ongoing imbalance between the X-men and the Inhumans. It gives the ominous impression that one side still has way too many advantages for this to be a fair fight. \nThroughout the narrative, the Inhumans carry themselves with an aura of selfish arrogance. They seem less concerned about helping an entire population of innocent mutants and more concerned about the possibility that they might have to fight a larger war with the X-men. They give the impression that they’re more worried about being inconvenienced than saving lives. Even without the inherent imbalance between the two sides, it’s hard to root for the Inhumans, given how they conduct themselves. \nThat’s not to say the X-men are any easier to root for. Other than Emma Frost, Beast plays a major role in setting up the conflict, albeit indirectly. He’s the only other character besides Emma who contributes to the drama, but his story is far less effective. His efforts to work with the Inhumans to resolve this conflict without violence are entirely noble in terms of intentions. Those intentions, however, clash with the unforgiving imbalance between the two sides. He’s not the only one realizes that either. \nMedusa, the current ruler of the Inhumans, goes so far as to adopt some of Emma Frost’s tactics. She also understands that a conflict between the Inhumans and X-men is inevitable and that concerns her far more than any suffering the Terrigen Mists are inflicting. Even if her intentions are ethically suspect, her understanding of the situation is every bit as pragmatic as Emma’s. Whether or not she can be as cunning as the former White Queen remains to be seen, but it definitely adds some intrigue to the coming conflict. \nInhumans vs. X-men #0 does succeed, albeit in a limited capacity, in creating some compelling stakes for the coming conflict. Both sides are preparing. Neither side wants to be caught off-guard. However, the issues that manifested in Death of X remain. \nThere are still inconsistencies between the events surrounding this conflict and the events that have unfolded in other X-books since Secret Wars . The strange and unwarranted hatred of Cyclops that seemed to fuel the X-men’s narrative remains unexplained, which makes the conflict and the setup surrounding feel incomplete and lacking in context. \nIn addition, characters not named Emma Frost do little to stand out. As a result, the impact of Inhumans vs. X-men #0 doesn’t offer anything novel or groundbreaking—it just reinforces the inevitability and imbalance of a clash between the X-men and the Inhumans. One is poised to thrive. One is poised to die. One has Marvel’s unconditional support in the form of movie rights. One remains stuck under the thumb of Rupert Murdoch. At this point, it a sentiment that need not be reinforced. Inhumans vs. X-men #0 \nRating: Jack Fisher is an aspiring writer and novelist.

      "text": "last » \nAWS wants to motivate its partners to get bigger Internet of Things deals with a new AWS Competency for IoT, Amazon's professional certification for specialized businesses. \nThe new competency, unveiled Tuesday at the company's re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, aims to draw partners closer to AWS' IoT efforts with new business, technical and marketing efforts. \n\"The AWS IoT Competency showcases industry-leading AWS partners that provide proven technology and implementation capabilities for a variety of use cases including … intelligent factories, smart cities, energy, automotive, transportation, and healthcare,\" said Kate Miller, Strategic Communications Manager for the AWS Partner Network, in a blog post. \n[Related: AWS Channel Chief: New AWS Competencies Will Help Channel Partners Stand Out, Meet Customer Demand ] \nIoT competency partners receive specialized differentiation from others with a dedicated brand and logo that they can use in their marketing materials, preferred access to market development funds and other resources. \nScott Udel, vice president of IoT Solutions at Boston, Mass.-based Cloud Technology Partners – one of the consulting partners to receive the designation – said that the competency was a \"stamp of approval.\" \n\"This is a strong recognition of our work around IoT, and it will help us gain traction in the marketplace,\" he said. \"We're excited that AWS is recognizing the importance of IoT. There's a lot of noise in the market, and this will help AWS customers navigate through all that noise to find who really has the expertise, leadership and skills.\" \nTo become an IoT Competency Partner, solution providers need to provide use case-specific customer references and complete a third-party audit of their IoT solution or practice. \nChris Wegmann, Managing Director for the AWS Business Group at Accenture, told CRN the IoT Competency would help his business stand out with customers. \n\"Overall, we see this competency as a recognition of our skills in the IoT area,\" he said. \"Partners with competencies have early access to the technology and product managers at AWS. We can now bring that back to our customers and have that differentiation.\" \nAccenture, which specializes in IoT solutions in the insurance and connected home verticals, is continuing to build out its AWS service offerings around IoT as interest in the space grows, said Wegmann.

      "text": "LAS VEGAS–-Amazon.com Inc. debuted new services intended to help coders build web-based applications that tap into the retail giant's artificial-intelligence capabilities.\nThe company's cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, unveiled the offerings at its annual conference here. Amazon Rekognition will let software developers write programs that detect the number of people in a photo, spot their gender and identify objects. It can also match faces, which could be useful in comparing two images to confirm, for example, a person's identity.\nThe company also launched Amazon Polly, which converts text to speech. It lets programmers transform text input, such as \"The temp in WA is 75 degrees F,\" into spoken output that says, \"The temperature in Washington is 75 degrees Fahrenheit.\" This feature, available in 27 languages, could be used to build conversational applications.\nAnother new offering, Amazon LEX, affords access to the Alexa artificial-intelligence service that runs on the company's Echo device. LEX understands spoken input, enabling developers to build software that answers questions. A pizza company, for example, could build a web-based program that asked users what toppings they wanted when they ordered a pizza. Such an application could keep track of previous orders so the system could ask customers if they wanted the same toppings again, said Andy Jassy, chief executive of Amazon Web Services.\n\"A lot of companies don't realize the heritage that Amazon has in the machine-learning space,\" Mr. Jassy said, referring to the area of artificial intelligence that makes such services practical.\nThe online retailer has thousands of employees focused on artificial intelligence, he added, from services that show customers who bought a particular item other items they might like to Echo's Alexa AI assistant.\n\"We do a lot of AI at the company,\" he said, something Amazon Web Services customers asked to tap into.\nWrite to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nNovember 30, 2016 15:15 ET (20:15 ",

      "text": "11/30/16 AT 5:28 PM Close \nAmazon and Seagate teamed up to bring an automatic cloud-syncing hard drive, it was announced Wednesday . \nThe Seagate Duet syncs all data on the drive to the cloud, providing a secure dual backup for customers. Users can access their documents, files, photos and videos in the device anywhere by using Amazon Drive. \n“With the Amazon Drive mobile app, people can easily back up files from their smartphone or tablet to the cloud,” Seagate said in a release . “With the Seagate Duet drive, they can view and back up their favorite memories and files stored on their computer as well as on their smartphone or tablet using the Amazon Drive mobile app.” Related Stories Amazon Developing New Alexa Echo-Like Speaker With Touchscreen \nThe “extremely user-friendly” 1TB storage drive is a black, slim, lightweight device and offers fast local transfer speeds and offline access, Seagate says. Customers can drag and drop files from their Mac or PC to the drive, which are then automatically synced to the cloud. \nThe drive is now available for pre-order only in the U.S. on Amazon.com for $99.99. The device will be released on Dec. 10, according to the website. \nWith the purchase of the Seagate Duet, customers will benefit from a one free year of Amazon Drive unlimited storage, which normally has an annual cost of $59.99. \nThe drive is good news for those who prefer dual backups, especially since Apple has allegedly halted its production of the AirPort Time Capsule . The Time Capsule router backs up data wirelessly with OS X Leopard or later and is sold at $299 or $399, depending on the storage.

      "text": "November 30, 2016, 3:28 PM Amazon grabs a giant chunk of holiday weekend web traffic growth By Stefany Zaroban Director of Research A new look at web traffic patterns between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday shows that total visits to the top 100 shopping sites increased 14% during the period compared with last year. \nBy nearly all accounts, the big weekend of the 2016 holiday season was a success for online retail. One estimate from Adobe Digital Insights pegged total e-commerce sales at $12.8 billion during the five-day period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday—a 15.2% increase compared to last year. \nThe bad news for many online retailers is that it appears that a lot of the gains went to web leader Amazon.com Inc., No. 1   500 Guide , according to an Internet Retailer analysis of web traffic data from SimilarWeb . \nA look at total visits to Internet Retailer’s list of Top 100 holiday-oriented shopping sites during the five-day period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday (the Monday after Thanksgiving), shows that consumers worldwide visited these sites a total of 1.41 billion times. That’s a 14.3% increase compared to 1.23 billion visits during the comparable five-day period last year. \nHowever, Amazon.com comprised 57.6% of that growth, as the site experienced 101.6 million more visits from desktop and mobile users this year than last year. That’s nearly 10 times as much incremental traffic generated by the next highest gainer, Best Buy Co. Inc. (No. 12). Consumers visited BestBuy.com 10.8 million more times from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday this year versus last year. \nDespite the industry’s overall increase in holiday traffic and sales, 29 of the 100 holiday-oriented retail sites experienced traffic declines this year compared to last year’s five-day holiday weekend. The biggest declines came from such big-name web-only merchants and bricks-and-mortar retailers as K-Mart (part of Sears Holdings Corp., No. 14), Old Navy (part of Gap Inc., No. 20), Gilt Groupe (part of Hudson’s Bay Co., No. 75), Gap and QVC Group (No. 10). \nThe gap between Amazon and the rest of the major holiday-shopping web merchants is even more stark when it comes to mobile traffic. Smartphone and tablet visits to the Top 100 holiday shopping sites reached 723.6 million from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday this year. That’s a 9.4% increase compared with 661.2 million visits during the comparable period last year. \nHowever, Amazon.com experienced 47.4 million more mobile web visits this year—accounting for more than 75% of all gains on mobile web traffic for the 100 holiday merchant sites tracked by Internet Retailer. Moreover, mobile app visits are not included in this analysis, and multiple studies show that Amazon dominates mobile app purchases. \nModest traffic gains for many retailers during this period do not necessarily mean that online sales for the same merchants were a disappointment during the long holiday weekend. In general, visits to shopping sites are not growing on a year-over-year basis as much as they have in previous years, though online sales growth has remained steady over the past few years at around 15%. This suggests that online retailers are getting better at converting existing traffic, as opposed to driving sales increases with more traffic to their sites. In addition, holiday shoppers are more focused in their browsing, preferring sites that they have shopped during previous holidays, rather than searching among multiple sites to compare prices. \nUltimately, Internet Retailer estimates that Amazon comprised nearly 40% of retail purchases in the U.S. during the period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday.

      "text": "CNN Classifies White Victims Of Hate Crimes As “Other Attacks” In Study \nAfter a lot of outcry, Amazon took down the offensive item. However, they have not taken down many Christian items that could be considered just as offensive, such as doormats with crosses on them, and this magnetic Jesus with changeable clothing. \n“You can dress J.C. in anything from traditional garb (white robe, cross) to surfer dude (tie-dyed shirt and surfer shorts). There are also loads of props such as loaves, fishes, chalices, hats, and tools from his carpenter years,” read the description of the product. \nNow, to a devout Christian, this item would be unbelievably offensive (not to mention just really cheap and cheesy), but you don’t see Amazon rushing to take it down. Advertisement - story continues below \nThis isn’t the first time Amazon has removed a religious doormat after an outcry. The Huffington Post reported that back in June, Amazon removed doormats that depicted Hindu deities after receiving complaints. \nAmazon also drew the ire of many Republicans last summer when it took down all Confederate flag merchandise, Time reported. \nOnce again Islam is being treated with kid gloves, while Christianity is treated with indifference. If you’re going to remove a religious item that is offensive to members of that religion, remove all items that offend members of all religions. \nYou can’t just selectively remove things that offend members one religion and not remove items that offend members of another religion without exposing yourself as a massive hypocrite.

      "text": "Amazon is bringing Alexa’s brainpower to its cloud business Amazon unveiled voice-enabled AI, image recognition and text-to-speech services for developers. share Amazon Today, Amazon announced three new artificial intelligence tools for developers that use Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud division. Drawing on the artificial intelligence that powers Amazon’s popular home assistant Alexa, the new tools will allow developers to build apps that have conversational interfaces, can turn text into speech and use computer vision that is capable of recognizing faces and objects. Amazon’s latest push follows moves from Google and Microsoft, both of which have cloud computing platforms that already use artificial intelligence. Google’s G Suite , for example, uses AI to power Smart Reply in Gmail, instant translation and smart scheduling functions in its calendar. Likewise, Microsoft recently announced it’s bringing artificial intelligence to its Office 365 service to add search within Word, provide productivity tracking and build maps from Excel with geographic data. Here are the new Amazon tools available to developers: Amazon Lex is for building conversational interfaces with the same voice recognition behind Alexa, the voice-enabled AI that lives inside the Echo speaker. Essentially, Lex allows developers to build advanced chatbots using Amazon’s artificial intelligence. Then there’s Amazon Polly. Polly is a text-to-speech recognition service that reads in a natural sounding voice. It supports 47 different voices in 23 languages. Finally, Amazon shared its new Rekognition service, which uses deep learning to recognize faces, objects and scenes.According to Amazon, Rekognition can detect someone’s facial expression (happy or distressed, for example), can count how many people are in a picture and even discern objects within an image, like a couch in a photo of a living room. Both Microsoft and Google have been offering this kind of image analysis for over a year, reported Fortune . Still, enterprise software remains a rather untapped market. At Recode’s Code Enterprise conference earlier this month , Diane Greene, the head of Google Cloud, noted that Amazon and Microsoft, her company’s biggest competitors, only serve 5 percent of the enterprise market. And as Google, Microsoft and Amazon continue to make their products smarter and businesses continue to move their work to the cloud, the competition among software giants to become the next cloud-based workplace standard is starting to ramp up. recode_divider",

      "title": "Amazon Uses Trucks To Drive Data Faster -- update",
      "text": "Amazon Uses Trucks To Drive Data Faster -- update  34:  Jay Greene By Laura Stevens \nLAS VEGAS -- In Amazon Web Services, Amazon.com Inc. has built one of the most powerful computing networks in the world, on pace to post more than $12 billion in revenue this year. \nBut the retail giant on Wednesday proposed a surprising way to move data from large corporate customers' data centers to its public cloud-computing operation: by truck. \nTo the sound of throbbing heavy-metal music and flashes of strobe lights, Amazon drove a big rig onto the floor of the Sands Expo & Convention Center during the company's annual customer conference. \nThe tractor-trailer hauls a massive storage device, dubbed Snowmobile, in the form of a 45-foot shipping container that holds 100 petabytes of data. A petabyte is about 1 million gigabytes. \nTransporting data from companies to cloud providers has become immensely time-consuming as corporate data storage has ballooned from terabytes to petabytes to exabytes, each step a factor of roughly 1,000 larger than the last. \n\"When we started AWS [in 2006], the notion of an exabyte of data just seemed completely out there,\" AWS Chief Executive Andy Jassy said. \"Today, an exabyte of data is much more common.\" That is equivalent to about 250 million DVDs or one trillion books of 400 pages each. \nAmazon plans to drive Snowmobiles to its customers' offices, extract their data, then cruise to an Amazon facility where the information can be transferred to the cloud-computing network in far less time than it would for so much data to travel over the web. \nThe company, however, isn't promising lightning speed. Ten Snowmobiles would reduce the time it takes to move an exabyte from on-premises storage to Amazon's cloud to a little less than six months, from about 26 years using a high- speed internet connection, by the company's calculations. \nDuring a press conference, Mr. Jassy declined to disclose the cost of each Snowmobile unit but noted that the company has \"several\" of them. The trucks are currently available and customers are using them, he said. Snowmobile will cost half a cent per gigabyte per month of use, or about $500,000 a month to use its full capacity. \nThis isn't the first time Amazon has circumvented the web to move data faster. Last year it introduced a suitcase- sized data-transfer service appliance known as Snowball. Amazon on Wednesday upgraded that gadget, doubling its capacity to 100 terabytes. \nBut for customers who sought to move petabytes or even exabytes of data, the larger Snowball wouldn't be enough. \n\"The first thing we thought was, 'We're going to need a bigger box,' \" Mr. Jassy said. \nThe truck and the suitcase-sized device are part of the retail giant's bid to woo large corporate customers, who have invested heavily in their own data centers, to move to Amazon's cloud. Many have shifted key computing operations to cloud providers, but a significant number continue to run some jobs in their own facilities, even as they take advantage of public cloud providers, an arrangement known as hybrid cloud. \nRelatively rapid data-transfer methods such as Snowmobile and Snowball may spur them to move faster to use Amazon's services. \nNonetheless, Mr. Jassy acknowledged that the majority of companies likely would keep some computing operations in- house. \"Most enterprises are going to operate in hybrid mode for many years to come,\" he said. \nThat is one reason why Amazon announced a partnership last month with VMware Inc. to allow VMware customers to take advantage of AWS services without abandoning their data centers. \nVMware Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger joined Mr. Jassy on stage Wednesday and called the response to the joint offering \"overwhelming.\" \nAt the conference, Amazon also debuted new services intended to help coders build web-based applications that tap into the retail giant's artificial-intelligence capabilities. \nAmazon Rekognition will let software developers write programs that detect the number of people in a photo, spot their gender and identify objects. It also can match faces, which could be useful in comparing two images to confirm, for example, a person's identity. \nThe company also launched Amazon Polly, which converts text to speech. It lets programmers transform text input, such as \"The temp in WA is 75 degrees F,\" into spoken output that says, \"The temperature in Washington is 75 degrees Fahrenheit.\" This feature, available in 27 languages, could be used to build conversational applications. \nAnother new offering, Amazon Lex, affords access to the Alexa artificial-intelligence service that runs on the company's Echo device. LEX understands spoken input, enabling developers to build software that answers questions. \nA pizza company, for example, could build a web-based program that asks users what toppings they want when they order a pie. Such an application could keep track of previous orders so the system could ask customers if they wanted the same toppings again, Mr. Jassy explained. \n\"A lot of companies don't realize the heritage that Amazon has in the machine-learning space,\" Mr. Jassy said, referring to the area of artificial intelligence that makes such services practical. \nThe online retailer has thousands of employees focused on artificial intelligence, he noted. This could be used for services that show customers who bought a particular item; what other items they might like purchase or Echo's Alexa AI assistant. \n\"We do a lot of AI at the company,\" and Amazon Web Services customers wanted access to that, Mr. Jassy said. \nWrite to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com  161934ET   Technology",

      "text": "Amazon just added the artificial intelligence behind its Echo speakers to the list of services it offers to businesses.\nThe company introduced a new service Wednesday called Lex , which allows developers and businesses to tap into the AI smarts that power Alexa for their own bots.\nSEE ALSO: This trick will get your Amazon Echo and Google Home stuck in a loop\nLex is currently in a preview phase, open to developers in Northern Virginia, but Amazon plans to expand its reach in the future.\nThe service allows developers to create conversational bots for Facebook Messenger (and soon Slack and Twilio) that are powered by the same speech recognition and natural language processing used for Alexa in Amazon's Echo devices. It also ties into other Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools so developers who are already using Amazon-hosted services can more easily create a bot experience.\nAmazon says Lex is free for the first year (up to 10,000 text requests and 5,000 speech requests per month) and developers will be charged a flat rate based on the number of text and speech requests a month afterward ($4.00 per 1,000 speech requests $0.75 per 1,000 text.)\nFor Amazon, Lex offers a few benefits. In terms of competing with Google and others, the service offers a way for Amazon to increase its AI footprint (and profits) even if people don't buy their hardware. It also gives Amazon a foothold in the growing bot ecosystem, which has so far been dominated by Facebook. By providing an enterprise-level service that can easily plug into Facebook or other consumer platforms, Amazon is better positioned to secure an early (and potentially lucrative) spot powering businesses’ bots as companies look to take advantage of chat-based applications.\nThe news also comes on the heels of reports that Amazon is working on a new premium Echo device with a 7-inch touchscreen that will cost more than its current $180 flagship speaker.\nBONUS: Google Home answers the mind-boggling questions Google uses in job interviews",

      "text": "By Jay Greene By Laura Stevens\nLAS VEGAS -- In Amazon Web Services, Amazon.com Inc. has built one of the most powerful computing networks in the world, on pace to post more than $12 billion in revenue this year.\nBut the retail giant on Wednesday proposed a surprising way to move data from large corporate customers' data centers to its public cloud-computing operation: by truck.\nNetworks can move massive amounts data only so fast. Trucks, it turns out, can move it faster.\nTo the sound of throbbing heavy-metal music and flashes of strobe lights, Amazon drove a big rig onto the floor of the Sands Expo & Convention Center during the company's annual customer conference.\nThe tractor-trailer hauls a massive storage device, dubbed Snowmobile, in the form of a 45-foot shipping container that holds 100 petabytes of data. A petabyte is about 1 million gigabytes.\nTransporting data from companies to cloud providers has become immensely time-consuming as corporate data storage has ballooned from terabytes to petabytes to exabytes, each step a factor of roughly 1,000 larger than the last.\n\"When we started AWS [in 2006], the notion of an exabyte of data just seemed completely out there,\" AWS Chief Executive Andy Jassy said. \"Today, an exabyte of data is much more common.\" That is equivalent to about 250 million DVDs or one trillion books of 400 pages each.\nAmazon plans to drive Snowmobiles to its customers' offices, extract their data, then cruise to an Amazon facility where the information can be transferred to the cloud-computing network in far less time than it would for so much data to travel over the web.\nThe company, however, isn't promising lightning speed. Ten Snowmobiles would reduce the time it takes to move an exabyte from on-premises storage to Amazon's cloud to a little less than six months, from about 26 years using a high-speed internet connection, by the company's calculations.\nDuring a press conference, Mr. Jassy declined to disclose the cost of each Snowmobile unit but noted that the company has \"several\" of them. The trucks are currently available and customers are using them, he said. Snowmobile will cost half a cent per gigabyte per month of use, or about $500,000 a month to use its full capacity.\nThis isn't the first time Amazon has circumvented the web to move data faster. Last year it introduced a suitcase-sized data-transfer service appliance known as Snowball. Amazon on Wednesday upgraded that gadget, doubling its capacity to 100 terabytes.\nBut for customers who sought to move petabytes or even exabytes of data, the larger Snowball wouldn't be enough.\n\"The first thing we thought was, 'We're going to need a bigger box,' \" Mr. Jassy said.\nThe truck and the suitcase-sized device are part of the retail giant's bid to woo large corporate customers, who have invested heavily in their own data centers, to move to Amazon's cloud. Many have shifted key computing operations to cloud providers, but a significant number continue to run some jobs in their own facilities, even as they take advantage of public cloud providers, an arrangement known as hybrid cloud.\nRelatively rapid data-transfer methods such as Snowmobile and Snowball may spur them to move faster to use Amazon's services.\nNonetheless, Mr. Jassy acknowledged that the majority of companies likely would keep some computing operations in-house. \"Most enterprises are going to operate in hybrid mode for many years to come,\" he said.\nThat is one reason why Amazon announced a partnership last month with VMware Inc. to allow VMware customers to take advantage of AWS services without abandoning their data centers.\nVMware Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger joined Mr. Jassy on stage Wednesday and called the response to the joint offering \"overwhelming.\"\nAt the conference, Amazon also debuted new services intended to help coders build web-based applications that tap into the retail giant's artificial-intelligence capabilities.\nAmazon Rekognition will let software developers write programs that detect the number of people in a photo, spot their gender and identify objects. It also can match faces, which could be useful in comparing two images to confirm, for example, a person's identity.\nThe company also launched Amazon Polly, which converts text to speech. It lets programmers transform text input, such as \"The temp in WA is 75 degrees F,\" into spoken output that says, \"The temperature in Washington is 75 degrees Fahrenheit.\" This feature, available in 27 languages, could be used to build conversational applications.\nAnother new offering, Amazon Lex, affords access to the Alexa artificial-intelligence service that runs on the company's Echo device. LEX understands spoken input, enabling developers to build software that answers questions.\nA pizza company, for example, could build a web-based program that asks users what toppings they want when they order a pie. Such an application could keep track of previous orders so the system could ask customers if they wanted the same toppings again, Mr. Jassy explained.\n\"A lot of companies don't realize the heritage that Amazon has in the machine-learning space,\" Mr. Jassy said, referring to the area of artificial intelligence that makes such services practical.\nThe online retailer has thousands of employees focused on artificial intelligence, he noted. This could be used for services that show customers who bought a particular item; what other items they might like purchase or Echo's Alexa AI assistant.\n\"We do a lot of AI at the company,\" and Amazon Web Services customers wanted access to that, Mr. Jassy said.\nWrite to Jay Greene at Jay.Greene@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com\n 19:34 ET (00:34 ",

Wang Lung is on his deathbed in the house of his fathers, and his three sons stand ready to inherit his hard-won estate. One son has taken the family's wealth for granted and become a landlord; another is a thriving merchant and moneylender; the youngest, an ambitious general, is destined to be a leader in the country. Through all his life's changes, Wang did not anticipate that each son would hunger to sell his beloved land for maximum profit.\n",

      "text": "nasa amazon alexa skill opportunity mer b or mars mission roundup More NASA\nYou’ve got questions and Alexa’s got answers. Now, in addition to news about the weather, traffic, football scores, and other earthly information Amazon’s smart assistant can offer, she will also start educating you on … grander topics. Specifically, those concerned with Mars. It’s all thanks to NASA, which announced at the AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas that it had added its own skill to the popular artificial intelligence-based assistant , marking the first time the space agency collaborated with Alexa.\nTom Soderstrom, the chief technology officer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory , unveiled Alexa’s newest skill, noting the impetus behind the decision was to spark further interest in Mars. Of course, it would seem that there is interest aplenty already — after all, Elon Musk is trying to colonize the Red Planet, which no longer seems like as far fetched of a dream as it might have just a few years ago.\n“Tomorrow you’ll be able to use Amazon Dots and your Amazon Echos, and you can ask questions about Mars,” Soderstrom said Tuesday. “This is all about exploring and getting crowdsourcing and getting people to understand and care about Mars and ask new questions.”\nMore : NASA wants SpaceX to help it survey the Earth’s water surface\nWhile Alexa already has some basic knowledge about Mars (thanks, Google), the NASA skill certainly broadens (and deepens) its knowledge base. Once users have enabled the NASA Mars skill, they can make requests like, “Alexa, open NASA Mars,” or, “Alexa, ask NASA Mars: Why is Mars red?”\nBut that is not all NASA has in the works when it comes to Alexa. Soderstrom suggested that ROV-E, a smaller version of NASA’s exploration rover whose blueprints will be made widely accessible to schools and museums, will also be controllable by way of Alexa commands and capable of answering your most probing questions about one of our nearest celestial neighbors.\nSo get curious — there has never been a better time to have questions about the universe.\nWhat can’t she do? The best ways to use Amazon’s Alexa around the house Here’s what happened when we asked Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home a bunch of questions As billionaires ogle Mars, the space race is back on",

      "text": "Overnight Tech: Issa declared winner in House race | Tech's nationwide impact | Amazon cracks down on fakes By Ali Breland - 11/28/16 06:20 PM EST © Getty \nTECH ISN'T JUST ON THE COASTS: A new report from the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a think tank in Washington, D.C., says the tech industry's reach isn't just on in hotspots like Silicon Valley, New York City or Austin, Texas. The report finds the tech sector affects every congressional district to some degree, with three-quarters of all districts having had 1,000 or more patent filers. \n\"The myopic view that the high-tech economy is only Silicon Valley and a few other bright spots like Boston or North Carolina's Research Triangle is flat wrong,\" said Robert D. Atkinson, ITIF's president. \"Even worse, that misconception undermines support for broad-based, bipartisan policies to spur further innovation and growth across the nation.\" ADVERTISEMENT \nAccording to Atkinson, tech is often layered on top existing industries and structures in areas that might not be thought of as technologically driven. \n\"In some places, it's because long-established industries such as agriculture, mining, or manufacturing are rapidly evolving into tech-enabled industries,\" he said. \"In others, it's because new developments such as cloud computing and ubiquitous access to Internet service allow innovators to create new, IT-enabled enterprises in any small town or rural area they may choose.\" \nThe study found correlations between the number of works in STEM [Science, technology, engineering and math] occupations and federal research and development funding. In total, the tech sector employs 13 million nationwide and within the last two years over half of all congressional districts have received over $50 million in federal research funding. \n\"This serves as a signal to every Member of Congress that tech matters to their state and district,\" Atkinson said. \nPlease send your tips, comments and college football playoff predictions to Ali Breland ( ) and follow us on Twitter: @alibreland and @HilliconValley . \nISSA FINALLY WINS REELECTION BATTLE: Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) has finally been named the winner of a tough race in California's 49th district. Issa made himself an ally of tech -- he played a significant part in the 2012 fight against the Stopping Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and defended Apple when they refused to help the FBI unlock an encrypted iPhone after the San Bernardino shootings. Tech companies took notice, donating to his now successful 2016 reelection effort. \nTECH EXECS TO ADVISE LONDON'S MAYOR: Five tech executives will advise London Mayor Sadiq Khan on advancing the city's economy in the wake of the Brexit, reports Morning Consult. Tech members on the panel include Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook's vice president of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Debbie Wosskow, the chief executive and founder of Love Home Swap, a home-sharing service similar to Airbnb. \nAT&T STEPS INTO STREAMING: AT&T subsidiary DirecTV will now offer video streaming services to consumers. The company is entering a nascent but crowded marketplace with established streaming options like mainstay Netflix along with Dish's similar streaming effort, Sling TV. Per a company release , DirecTV will offer four tiers of plans at various costs corresponding to the number of channels. \nAMAZON CRACKS DOWN ON COUNTERFEITS: Amazon is now tackling its rampant problem of counterfeiters distributing fake products on its platform, reports Bloomberg. According to the report Amazon has been aware of the growing problem, despite not publicly saying much about it. The company is building teams in the U.S. and Europe to work with major brands to create a registry to keep fake products off the site. After companies register, even those who don't sell on the website will have to approve every merchant's request to sell their products online. \nON TAP: \nThe Federal Communications Bar Association (FCBA) Wireless Committee is hosting a brown bag lunch at the FCC at 12:15 p.m. on Tuesday. \nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT: \nUber drivers are slated to participate in nationwide labor protests tomorrow. \nDonald Trump Pelosi shows power with leadership win Trump mulling GOP senator for intel chief: report How the Electoral College changes the value of a person, a bit like slavery did MORE 's appointments to his FCC presidential transition team.

      "text": "0 \nWe’re now well past Black Friday and Cyber Monday , but that doesn’t mean that the deals are done. \nAmazon is now offering solid discounts on Google’s OnHub routers. The ASUS model is available for $105.99 , a whopping 47 percent discount off its normal list price. Meanwhile, the TP-Link version is available for $115.99 , which is 42 percent off its normal price. \nOne detail worth noting is that while the ASUS OnHub router is ready to ship as of this writing, the the TP-Link model is on backorder and won’t ship until December 8. \nWe haven’t heard much about Google’s OnHub routers lately, with the company placing its focus on its new Google Wifi mesh network routers . However, the OnHub routers are still solid devices with companion apps to help you manage them from your smartphone. So if you’re in the market for a new router and ease of use is a priority for you, these OnHub routers may be up your alley. Source:",

      "text": "Nov 30, 2016 Sunset colors cut through the smoky haze in the Brazilian Amazon in 2015. NPR \nAn annual study released by the Brazilian government estimates that the rate of deforestation in the Amazon has increased by 29 percent over last year. \nThat's the second year in a row that deforestation in the Amazon quickened; last year, the pace rose by about 24 percent. \nThe estimated deforestation rate, released Tuesday by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE), is based on satellite imagery. The institute found that from August 2015 to July 2016, the Amazon rainforest was deforested at an estimated rate of 7,989 square kilometers (more than 3,000 square miles). \nThe year before, it was 6,207 square kilometers. Two years ago, it was barely over 5,000 square kilometers. \nINPE acknowledged the increase but noted that \"the current rate represents a decrease of 71%, when compared with 2004.\" That was the year the government implemented a policy designed to curb deforestation; from 2004-2007, the rate of deforestation dropped rapidly. \nBut the rate now detected is the highest for any year since 2008. NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro, who has reported on deforestation in the Amazon, called it a \"huge jump\" in the deforestation rate. \nThe Brazilian newspaper Estadão reports that many observers had been prepared to see an increase in deforestation, but not one this high. Here's more from the newspaper, translated from Portuguese by NPR's Martin Kaste: \"Environmentalists working in the region had already been sounding the alarm, and in recent months the federal government had already been working on the assumption that the loss of forest would increase above the average of the last years, which has been below 6,000 km^2. But this number came as a surprise. ...\n\"The policy director of Greenpeace, Marcio Astrini, says among the causes of the increased deforestation were actions taken by the federal government between 2012 and 2015, such as the waiving of fines for illegal deforestation, the abandonment of protected areas — that is, 'conservation units' and indigenous lands — and the announcement, which he calls 'shameful,' that the government doesn't plan to completely stop illegal deforestation until the year 2030.\" \nEstadão also notes that the rise in deforestation is raising concerns about Brazil's ability to meet its commitments as part of the international Paris Agreement on combating climate change. \nDeforestation is a major contributor to climate change, and Brazil's success in reducing deforestation from 2004 to 2014 was seen as a model for other developing countries, Estadão writes. \nAlso on Tuesday, Reuters reported that a lack of funding has hampered the organization that's tasked with stopping illegal logging efforts. \nThe Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, or Ibama, has struggled with budget cuts as Brazil grapples with a recession, Reuters writes: \"Hampered by poor radios with a maximum range of just 2 km (1.3 miles) and pick-up trucks easily recognised by those who cut down the forest, the exhausted Ibama agents were too often chasing shadows.\n\"'The loggers are better equipped than we are,' said Uiratan Barroso, Ibama's head of law enforcement in the state capital, Santarem. 'Until we have the money to rent unmarked cars and buy proper radios we won't be able to work.' ... \n\"A 30 percent cut in Ibama's budget has meant fewer operations this year. Helicopters and jeeps have been idle due to a lack of fuel. \n\"'We haven't even had enough money to pay for aptitude tests to allow our agents to carry guns,' said Barroso, adding the tests only cost 200 reais ($60).\" \nThe news on your schedule from MPR News Update Email Address* MPR News Update AM Edition MPR News Update PM Edition \nSee our Privacy Policy .

      "text": "TV Nov. 30, 2016, 5:38 p.m. Amazon makes a series out of Sid & Marty Krofft's revamped 'Sigmund and the Sea Monsters' pilot Jevon Phillips \nAmazon Studios has picked up the Sid & Marty Krofft-produced series “Sigmund and the Sea Monsters”– a remake of their classic children’s TV show from the 1970s – after the show had been presented to viewers as a pilot. \n“Sigmund and the Sea Monster” centers on two brothers, Johnny and Scotty, who along with their cousin Robyn befriend Sigmund, a friendly young sea-monster. David Arquette stars as Captain Barnabus, a sea-going villain-type who relentlessly pursues the mini sea monster. The show will be part of Amazon’s Prime Video lineup. \nAs chronicled in an article earlier this year , the Krofft brothers have been on a bit of a roll lately. They have a successful ongoing kids program in “Mutt and Stuff” on Nickelodeon. Their action show, “Electra Woman & Dyna Girl,” launched online on Fullscreen. They are also looking to revive other past hits “The Bugaloos,” “H.R. Pufnstuf” and a new reinvention of “Land of the Lost.” Latest updates",

      "text": " NGCodec\nLAS VEGAS AWS re:Invent 2016, – NGCodec® ( Sunnyvale, CA ), a pioneering company focused on FPGA-based H.265/HEVC video codec development, today announced that it will use the new Amazon EC2 F1 instance in the development of RealityCodec ™ for hardware-accelerated AWS Cloud-based video encoding and VR / AR processing.\nAWS customers will be able to buy RealityCodec when it becomes available in the AWS Marketplace and run it on Amazon EC2 F1, offering ultra-high-performance video compression (at up to 4K resolution) and ultra-low sub-frame latency cloud-based VR and AR. By running the compute function in the cloud, customers can send only the graphics pixels in the form of a video feed to the HMD (Head Mounted Display), achieving higher performance, lower cost, and longer battery life for the consumer VR/AR hardware.\nNGCodec's RealityCodec technology runs on NGCodec AMI, which runs on Amazon EC2 F1 in the cloud, presenting significant advantages compared to traditional software encoding, including:\nMassive acceleration and efficiency compared to traditional CPU/GPU instances Higher-quality video for live encoding Lower running costs and flexibility / upgradability, just like traditional software \"AWS is breaking ground as the first public cloud to add FPGA-enabled instances with Amazon EC2 F1, which offers significant acceleration over CPU and GPU instance types,\" said Oliver Gunasekara , CEO & co-founder, NGCodec Inc. \"Many large media workflows, including on-demand and live streaming content, are moving to the AWS Cloud. These can now have all the benefits of FPGA acceleration in the AWS ecosystem.\"\nNGCodec will demonstrate using cloud-based FPGA acceleration for live H.265/HEVC video encoding on December 1, 2016 11am at the AWS re:Invent 2016 event in Las Vegas, Nevada . (CMP317 Session)\nAbout NGCodec\nNGCodec® has been in passionate pursuit of next generation video compression since 2012. With the support of investors including Xilinx and NSF, NGCodec's agile startup team has created RealityCodec™, a compressor-decompressor technology optimized for ultra-low latency, high-quality applications. Headquartered in Sunnyvale, California , NGCodec licenses its H.265/HEVC video codec silicon intellectual property (IP) to semiconductor and equipment manufacturers around the World.

      "text": "AWS cloud costs: Amazon hopes these tools can help fight budget blowouts \nAmazon plans on beating these businesses by offering customers Amazon Web Service (AWS)-based virtual private servers (VPSs) for prices starting at $5 a month. That's a price that many hosting and VPS customers will find very attractive. \nUnlike AWS, where pricing and customization can become very complicated, Lightsail looks to be easy for experienced VPS system administrators. \nAmazon claims customers can get started with just three clicks . You can simply choose a virtual private server image from a menu of over 10 images. These include a basic Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python (LAMP) stack, WordPress, Drupal, and others. Bitnami , the leading provider of ready-to-run cloud and container application instances, created these images. \nThese aren't bare-boned instances. They include all the default software you need to really put a server application to work. For example, the Nginx web server development environment comes also bundled with phpMyAdmin, SQLite, ImageMagick, FastCGI, Memcache, GD, CURL, PEAR, PECL, and other components. \nUsers then select one of five server sizes. These range from the beginner $5 a month model. This includes 512MBs of RAM, a one-core processor, a 20 GB solid-state-drive (SSD), and one Terabyte (TB) per month of data transfer. That may not sound like much, but it's enough to run most low-usage LAMP server applications. At the $80 a month high-end, you get 8GBs of RAM, a two-core CPU, an 80 GB SSD, and 5 TBs of transfer. That's enough to power many small businesses. \nAll Lightsail's VPSs come with a static IP address, secure shell (SSH) connectivity, DNS management, and server monitoring. It also includes a web-based management console. \nOnce you've picked out your image, Lightsail automatically launches the VPS, attaches the SSD-based storage, and sets up the security groups. It then creates a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and makes it easy to set up your VPS's DNS and IP addresses. \nDaniel Lopez, Bitnami's CEO, told me in an online discussion, \"Lightsail is the logical step for Amazon to continue to expand their footprint among developers. It is easy to get started but if you need to scale you have the full power of AWS offering and eosystem that cannot be matched by VPS providers.\" He's not wrong. \nOn the other hand, Linode CMO Casey Smith said in an email: \"We're flattered to see AWS create an offering similar to our own. There is great value in simplicity, which is why we've stuck with offering our services in this way since 2003. AWS's entry into this market just reinforces that value.\" \nSmith continued, \"The developer and small-business communities stand to benefit the most from this competition, and we welcome it. As for Linode, we will continue to differentiate ourselves as we always have -- in server performance and quality of support and with our position as a hosting provider built for developers, by developers.\" \nLightsail is already available. If you already have an AWS account, you can create a Lightsail VPS today. \nRelated Stories:",

      "text": "Amazon, Intel partner on smart speaker reference design for Alexa products At re:Invent, Amazon illustrated how the Alexa ecosystem is flourishing, make voice the next commonplace user interface. | Topic: Artificial Intelligence \nCommitted to making voice the user interface of the smart home, Intel and Amazon are working together on a reference design for Alexa-based products, the two companies announced at the re:Invent conference in Las Vegas. \nThe first products based on the reference design will hit the market in the first quarter of 2017, said Gregory Bryant, corporate vice president and GM at Intel. \nIntel is on a mission to help deliver highly-responsive, near-autonomous conversational AI within the home, he said. \"We're on the threshold of making that a reality.\" \nIntel is making two big bets, he said, that will help accomplish that: Rearchitecting the home network over the next five years that can support the exploding number of connected devices, as well as developing SOCs, platforms and reference designs that sit on top of that network. \nFor Amazon, Intel's help will accelerate the growth of Alexa ecosystem. At Alexa's initial release in November 2014, it had just 13 Amazon-built skills. Now, there are more than 5,000, said Alexa Head Scientist Rohit Prasad. The popularity of smart home functions, he said, was one of the biggest surprises to the Alexa team in its early days. \nNow, however, as technology advances the number of services consumers interact with, it becomes almost \"unimaginable\" to do so through traditional interfaces like a desktop or even smartphones, Prasad said. \nAmazon announced other steps it's taking to nurture the Alexa ecosystem, including the expanded Alexa Skills Set \"built-in\" library. In the coming weeks, Amazon will make available hundreds of new \"built-ins\" to help developers build in common requests into their Alexa skill sets. The \"built-ins\" comprise intents (such as \"Stop\" or \"Help\") and slot types (such as Date or City). \nPrasad also announced the Alexa Accelerators program, in which new companies will be matched with mentors from Amazon and the startup accelerator Techstars.

      "text": "Amazon's Cloud Conference Spotlights Its Competitive Edge By crm \nThe competition might be making some noise, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) is still in a league of its own in terms of the features and services its public cloud infrastructure can provide to customers of all sizes and backgrounds. That was the message AWS chief Andy Jassy made sure to drive home early during the lengthy keynote address he gave on Wednesday at Amazon's ( AMZN ) annual AWS re:Invent conference. \nJassy then proceeded to back up his claims by announcing a plethora of new offerings that should collectively be well-received by AWS' many enterprise clients. He also got some help from from a few notable guest speakers, some of which had announcements of their own to make. \nThe full list of new services unveiled by Jassy appears to be longer than that for the many services he announced via last year's AWS re:Invent keynote. The highlights include: Several new high-performance cloud computing instances, including ones optimized for memory, I/O activity and CPU resources. Amazon also launched an instance supporting programmable chips (FPGAs) that can be optimized for tasks such as machine learning and video-processing, and made it possible to add GPUs to any computing instance. Lightsail, a cheap and easy-to-use service for running virtual private servers. Plans range from $5 to $80 per month, and take aim at web hosting services from GoDaddy ( GDDY ) , Rackspace and many others. Athena, a service for quickly running queries against large amounts of data stored via Amazon's S3 cloud storage service. It complements Amazon's data warehousing and big data project services. New AI-powered image-recognition and text-to-speech services for developers, along with one for enabling \"natural, conversational interactions in voice and text.\" These are areas where Alphabet /Google ( GOOGL ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ) have been seen as having a lead. A version of Amazon's Aurora managed database service that's based on the enterprise-friendly PostgreSQL database. It complements a version of Aurora based on the MySQL database, and is promised to cost a fraction as much as databases from the likes of Oracle ( ORCL ) and Microsoft. Greengrass, a solution that allows AWS services to be locally run on Internet of Things (IoT) devices in places with limited or expensive web connectivity. Intel and Qualcomm are among the chip makers supporting the technology; hardware makers on board include Philips and Technicolor. Snowball Edge, an updated version of Amazon's Snowball appliance for transferring large amounts of data to an AWS data center. Unlike its predecessor, Snowball Edge has built-in computing abilities (including Greengrass support) that allows for more immediate processing of data that's headed for AWS. Snowmobile . This one needs to be seen to be believed. For enterprises that need to ship a lot more data than can be moved by the Snowball appliances, Amazon is providing a 45-foot semi-trailer that can house 100 petabytes (that's 100,000 terabytes) of data. The company's logistics teams must be proud. Amazon's Snowmobile semi-trailer. Source: GeekWire. \nAmid these announcements, execs from McDonald's, Italian utility giant Enel, financial agency Finra and cloud HR and financials app leader Workday ( WDAY ) discussed their companies' embrace of AWS. Enel, which has been in talks with Amazon to convert some of its old power stations into data centers, is relying on AWS to provide IoT services for its many field devices, and plans to move all its apps to the cloud by 2018. Workday, which to date has typically run its apps in its own data centers, has named AWS its \"preferred\" public cloud provider for running production workloads. This follows a May deal between AWS and cloud CRM software leader Salesforce.com ( CRM ) that's reportedly worth $400 million over four years. \nA recurring theme among these talks: The execs felt no public cloud could match the breadth of AWS' offerings. Finra CIO Steve Randich declared AWS is \"several years ahead\" of rivals. Workday engineering exec David Clarke says his company performed \"a very detailed technical assessment\" of its cloud options, and concluded AWS' feature set, geographic reach, scalability and security made it the best choice. \nTo help make the same argument about AWS' breadth, Jassy claimed AWS is set to launch about 1,000 new capabilities in 2016, up from 722 in 2015 and 516 in 2014. He also highlighted the feature set edge AWS has in areas such as database support and access controls, and stated there are now over 3,500 solutions offered by third parties via the AWS Marketplace . \nJassy highlights the breadth of AWS' offerings. \nAll of this is clearly aimed at winning over enterprises asking whether they should shutter some or all of their data centers and move their contents to the cloud. Such companies need to feel confident that AWS will meet all of their needs if they choose to migrate everything , rather than just specific workloads, and that any future needs will also be addressed. \nAmazon's recent partnership with virtualization software leader VMware to enable hybrid clouds featuring AWS and on-premise servers jointly managed by VMware's software also fits with its goal of convincing businesses it can be an end-to-end solutions provider. As does the launching of Greengrass and Snowball Edge, which bring AWS' computing services outside of its data centers for the first time. Microsoft has long talked up the hybrid cloud support of its Azure cloud platform. \nThese kinds of moves are crucial to keeping AWS' sales growth (55% in the third quarter) at heady levels as it closes in on a $15 billion revenue run rate. The days when AWS could deliver strong growth just by landing deals with start ups and specific corporate departments are over. The company needs to keep winning deals that involve Global 2000 companies and public sector organizations embracing the cloud in a big way. \nAt this year's re:Invent conference, Amazon has done a good job of making the case that AWS is the best choice for companies looking to make that kind of cloud commitment. Rivals can sometimes have an edge for specific use cases -- for example, Google's AI services are arguably unmatched, and Azure can be a good choice for firms with a lot of on-premise Microsoft software that they plan to keep using. But for anyone looking to shut down large data centers handling numerous apps and services, there's Amazon and then there's everyone else.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nYou’ve got questions and Alexa’s got answers. Now, in addition to news about the weather, traffic, football scores, and other earthly information Amazon’s smart assistant can offer, she will also start educating you on … grander topics. Specifically, those concerned with Mars. It’s all thanks to NASA, which announced at the AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas that it had added its own skill to the popular artificial intelligence-based assistant , marking the first time the space agency collaborated with Alexa. \nTom Soderstrom, the chief technology officer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory , unveiled Alexa’s newest skill, noting the impetus behind the decision was to spark further interest in Mars. Of course, it would seem that there is interest aplenty already — after all, Elon Musk is trying to colonize the Red Planet, which no longer seems like as far fetched of a dream as it might have just a few years ago. \n“Tomorrow you’ll be able to use Amazon Dots and your Amazon Echos, and you can ask questions about Mars,” Soderstrom said Tuesday. “This is all about exploring and getting crowdsourcing and getting people to understand and care about Mars and ask new questions.” \nMore : NASA wants SpaceX to help it survey the Earth’s water surface \nWhile Alexa already has some basic knowledge about Mars (thanks, Google), the NASA skill certainly broadens (and deepens) its knowledge base. Once users have enabled the NASA Mars skill, they can make requests like, “Alexa, open NASA Mars,” or, “Alexa, ask NASA Mars: Why is Mars red?” \nBut that is not all NASA has in the works when it comes to Alexa. Soderstrom suggested that ROV-E, a smaller version of NASA’s exploration rover whose blueprints will be made widely accessible to schools and museums, will also be controllable by way of Alexa commands and capable of answering your most probing questions about one of our nearest celestial neighbors. \nSo get curious — there has never been a better time to have questions about the universe.

      "text": "It appears that Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN - Free Report ) has finally decided to come down hard on counterfeits in a bid to clean up its marketplace.\nThe retail giant has reportedly intensified its fight against counterfeits and has made this a major goal for 2017.\nBloomberg reported on Monday that Amazon is in the process of developing teams in the U.S. and Europe that will work with major brands to put a bar on the registry of fake products on its website.\nA Vicious Cycle\nSo far, the brands selling on the platform would notify Amazon of the presence of a counterfeit product. Though the process was a long drawn one, Amazon was quick to respond and suspended the counterfeiters immediately.\nBut that didn’t help matters much as new accounts could be opened quickly, taking advantage of Amazon’s simple registration procedure. Alibaba ( BABA - Free Report ) and eBay ( EBAY - Free Report ) are also facing similar challenges.\nThe New Registration Process\nIt appears that Amazon has realized the fact that its registration method is overly flexible. The company is reportedly making the method stricter by making it mandatory for marketplace merchants to prove that they have the brand’s approval to sell them online.\nThe report also stated that the initiative will try and cover thousand of companies by 2017 including even those who do not sell on Amazon. The company has already begun experimenting with the new system with Nike and a few others.\nRecently, Amazon teamed up with one of its sellers to sue three people for selling counterfeits on its site. The company has also sued a counterfeit racket based on similar allegations.\nThe retail giant recently said in a statement that “Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,” and that it was “aggressively pursuing bad actors.”\nAMAZON.COM INC Price\nAMAZON.COM INC Price | AMAZON.COM INC Quote:\nTo Conclude\nThe growth of the e-commerce industry, with consumers increasingly buying things online, is a dynamic going in favor of Amazon. While the big brands may build their own online stores over time, a platform like Amazon allows discovery of new buyers.\nSmaller players are far more dependent on Amazon as they don’t have the resources to invest in technology and fulfillment to generate the kind of reach that Amazon can deliver. Amazon’s platform is currently being used by more than 2 million independent sellers.\nMoreover, the market is in the early growth phase (considering opportunities in international markets), so the company’s high growth rates are likely to be sustained over the next few years.\nBut that should not make Amazon overly confident about its online business. When brands hit by counterfeits lose sales and potential customers, the ripple effects will be felt by Amazon as well and earn it a bad name.\nNotably, the National Football League and Major League Baseball who were planning to sell merchandise on Amazon pulled out fearing Amazon’s lack of control over fakes. So an initiative like this was necessary before things went out of control..\nZacks Rank & Share Price Movement\nCurrently, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here .\nShares of Amazon have been steadily treading higher on a year-to-date basis. The stock generated a return of 12.82% compared with the Zacks Electronic Commerce Market gain of 9.94%.\nStock to Consider\nA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA - Free Report ) , sporting a Zacks Rank #1. For the current year, the consensus estimate for NVIDIA has increased 33.3% in the past 30 days.\nZacks' Top Investment Ideas for Long-Term Profit\nHow you like would to see our best recommendations to help you find today’s most promising long-term stocks?

      "title": "Amazon cloud desktops get browser support with WorkSpaces Web Access",
      "text": "Your passport to AWS re:Invent 2016 Reporting and analysis from IT events Amazon cloud desktops get browser support with WorkSpaces Web Access by Ramin Edmond News Writer Users can access their cloud desktops and applications from any PC through a browser with the new Web Access feature in Amazon WorkSpaces, the company's DaaS platform. CONFERENCE COVERAGE: Conference Section you're in: News and analysis from AWS re:Invent 2016 More articles from this section:   Sponsored News Where Workspaces Work –SearchVirtualDesktop.com \nBusiness users can now access their Amazon WorkSpaces apps and desktops through a web browser, but some features don't stack up to competing DaaS offerings. \nWith the new Amazon WorkSpaces Web Access, the browser on a PC becomes the client for cloud-based virtual apps and desktops, giving employees more options for accessing corporate resources. Amazon's main competitors in desktop as a service (DaaS) , VMware Horizon Air and Citrix Cloud, already offer browser-based access, and Amazon lags behind those when it comes to mobile and browser support. \nAmazon WorkSpaces Web Access is available for Windows, Apple Mac and Linux PCs -- not mobile devices -- and it only supports the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers. \n\"That could be a deal breaker for lots of folks who don't have the ability or rights to run those browsers,\" said Matt Kosht, an IT director at a utility company in Alaska. \nIn comparison, both VMware and Citrix support Chrome, Firefox, Apple Safari and Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer, and they work on Windows, Apple macOS and iOS, and Google Android and Chrome. Browsers bring drawbacks \nWorkSpaces Web Access provides users with a URL where they can access their Amazon cloud desktops and apps. Users visit the Amazon WorkSpaces web portal and enter their user names and passwords after IT sets up their accounts. They do not install anything, and nothing is saved locally. The Amazon Web Services cloud hosts the virtual desktops and apps, allowing IT to offload some management and maintenance tasks. Being able to go on the web to access apps is more of the norm. We are used to this now. Robert Young analyst, IDC \nBrowser-based virtual desktops may cause a downtick in performance, however, because they can't rely on CPU power from the endpoint as they typically would with VDI. \n\"Traditional VDI leverages compute power from the client side, and you can't do that in a web environment,\" said Robert Young, analyst at research firm IDC. \"The performance usually takes a hit. You won't get the same type of fast performance you would on typical VDI when on HTML5.\" \nAmazon cloud desktops can also take a hit when it comes to bandwidth . DaaS gets flexible \nWith browser-based clients such as Amazon WorkSpaces Web Access , users can access their virtual content without being at a managed workstation. For example, a user could log in from a family member's computer at home or work from a public library. \n\"This is great for unmanaged devices,\" Young said. \"There is no plug-in required and no download on the device itself.\" \nModern end users have grown accustomed to accessing apps -- Microsoft Office 365 applications, or collaboration tools, such as Slack or Box, for example -- through browsers. \n\"Most folks want to use their own device,\" he said. \"Being able to go on the web to access apps is more of the norm. We are used to this now.\" \nRemote workers, such as telecommuters, and temporary or part-time employees, such as consultants, can especially benefit from Amazon cloud desktops, said Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research in Westminster, Mass. \n\"It's not for everyone, but for these types of people it's of high value,\" he said.

      "text": "Amazon’s image recognition AI can identify your dog down to its breed The Verge 4 hrs ago Natt Garun © Provided by The Verge We’ve all had a lot of fun playing around with image recognition machine learning AIs from the likes of Google and Microsoft . Today, Amazon’s getting in the game with the launch of its own tool, Amazon Rekognition , which aims to provide deep-learning services to developers.\nWhile the tool isn’t public-facing like Google’s drawing game or Microsoft’s age-guessing bot , Amazon Rekognition does appear to do much of the same: it can look at photos and recognize human faces, identify their emotions, and label objects. In a sample photo of a dog, the AI identified it as “animal,” “pet,” and even specifically labels it as a “Golden Retriever.”\nThe API will be available to all AWS users, even those on the free tier. Developers can use it to add facial recognition as a layer of security to their app, sort through large collection of photos to tag and index them, or “build ‘smart’ marketing billboards that collect demographic data about viewers.” Hey, Amazon’s idea, not mine.\nRekognition is free to use today in limited regions: Northern Virginia, Oregon, and Ireland. The company also released a few other machine learning AIs alongside Rekognition: Amazon Polly , which converts text to speech, and Amazon Lex , a tool used to build conversational chatbots (Lex currently powers Alexa, the assistant within the Echo).\nToday’s announcement comes just two weeks after Google made its own big AI push for its cloud services , offering tools that can detect sentiment in multiple languages and a Jobs API that can help companies match job vacancies with potential hire. As companies begin offering more of the same machine learning tools, it may come down to just preference over which cloud service you like building off from than which AI is the smartest.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Amazon Rekognition Is An Image Recognition Service By Amazon   19:25 PST \nOne of the basic features of artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability to recognize images and process them. Companies like Microsoft and Google have debuted tools to show how accurate their image recognition platforms are. Now it seems that Amazon wants in as well as they have announced Amazon Rekognition . \nThis is an image recognition service that is part of a suite of deep-learning services that Amazon has recently announced for developers. For the most part it does what most image recognition services do, which is to identify human faces, identify emotions, and label objects just by looking at it. In fact it seems to be smart enough to not only tell that a dog is in a photo, but the breed of the dog as well which is pretty specific. \nAccording to Amazon’s CTO Werner Vogels, “Amazon Rekognition democratizes the application of deep learning technique for detecting objects, scenes, concepts, and faces in your images, comparing faces between two images, and performing search functionality across millions of facial feature vectors that your business can store with Amazon Rekognition.” \nAs to who might be taking advantage of Amazon’s Rekognition service remains to be seen, as well as the various applications that it might be used for. However it is an alternative to some of the other products out there from the likes of other companies such as Google. \nFiled in General . Read more about ai and Amazon . Related Articles",

Few of its major competitors disclose detailed information, but according to Synergy Research, AWS controls 31% of the global cloud infrastructure market, compared to 24% for the next three largest players combined.\n\nImage source: Amazon.\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "E-mail \nMove over Foxconn, there’s a new king of Kafkaesque, oppressive-working conditions-driving-employees-to-suicide company: Amazon.com. A distressed Amazon employee jumped off the company’s Apollo building in Seattle in a bid to express frustration with the working conditions there. This was made clear in the man’s e-mail sent to thousands of his co-workers, including CEO Jeff Bezos according to investigators. Although it is not a matter of a lack of compensation this time, Amazon’s work environment has been highly criticized by many of its former employees as oppressive and mentally abusive. An in-depth news expose from the New York Times in 2015 brought to light how the competitive environment pits many of its employees against each other and back up many of these claims. \nThe man who jumped was recently put in what is called a “Performance Improvement Plan” after putting in a request to be transferred to a different department. “P.I.P” to an Amazon employee is euphemism for the company’s pending pre-termination waiting list and many claim that it is used as a tool to terrorize or to unfairly force employees to resign who upper management see as a threat to their own success. \nFortunately for the jumper, the 12-story fall off the top of Amazon’s Apollo building did not result in a fatality and was shortly taken to a nearby hospital to recover. \n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover, He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” acording to a statement released by Amazon.com. \nIn the UK, it has been revealed by a BBC investigative report three years ago that Amazon expects their warehouse workers to collect orders every 33 seconds, a rate that many experts believe is unhealthy physically as well as mentally. At that time, Amazon rebuffed concerns and officially stated that their workplace passed all safety inspections and that their employees’ risk of mental and physical discomfort is on par with other similar jobs and industries. \nThere are also many anecdotes from former employees across social media including Reddit where many regularly post about their work experience as former Amazon employees, all echoing the same sentiment.",

      "title": "A Modest Test Of Amazon's Sponsored Products Ads 11/30/2016",
      "text": "I heard an interesting statistic on TV this week. At least half of the remarkable $3.45 billion in sales on Cyber Monday can be chalked up to Amazon. Half. Last year, the most common figure cited was 36%. Best Buy, the closest retailer, gets only about 5-6% of Cyber Monday sales. Looking at a chart on fortune.com yesterday, I found it remarkable to see mighty Walmart reduced to a pathetic also-ran in this cyber sweepstakes.\nAn NRF survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that 122 million consumers were expected to buy, or at least shop, on Cyber Monday. Amazon says that it sold two million toys in the first half of the day. According to Yahoo! Finance, “Amazon says it’s offering 75,000 deals this week. Last year, Amazon customers bought 54 million items on Cyber Monday — a record-breaking 629 items per second. Amazon expects to top that record this year.”\nTry to imagine a parallel in a brick-and-mortar store — 629 items a second? How could even a huge chain of actual stores handle that? There aren’t enough minimum wage workers available. It’s mind-boggling.\nSo that begs a question: If Amazon is going to completely dominate cyber sales, how well are advertisers taking advantage of Amazon’s programmatic promotional opportunities?\nPerhaps Amazon’s most prominent ad opportunity is its Sponsored Products offer, which places product listings on search results, and works on a pay-per-click basis. Amazon says that during last year’s holiday rush, conversion rates (people who clicked on a Sponsored Products Ad and then bought the product) climbed 16% on Black Friday and 27% higher on Cyber Monday, while mid-December conversions were 42% higher. Return on Ad Spending (ROAS) on Cyber Monday was an average $13 in ad sales revenue for every dollar spent on Sponsored Product ads.\nAmazon also claims that 94% of U.S. consumers plan to shop on it over the holidays and 22% do not plan any in-store shopping this season, according to BloomReach’s “State of Amazon 2016” and the Rubicon Project’s “Millions of Consumers Have Already Begun Holiday Shopping,” respectively. Seventy percent of buys were via smartphones, we’re told.\nWe decided to test Amazon’s Sponsored Products ads for ourselves. Since I have a professional connection to the rare book industry, I tried the search term “19th century books.” Amazon correctly linked me to two products “inspired by your purchases” — two sizes of Sobo Premium Craft and Fabric Glue, which my wife buys for me on Amazon. The glue, and the kind of tape we use, also appeared on the home page when I signed on. I was impressed that they got it right.\nOn the other hand, the books they offered up were not so well chosen —  19th Century Patchwork Divas’ Treasury of Quilts ? Even clicking on “19th century” in the links on the left titled “Historical Time Period” didn’t help, as it still gave me 21st century books with 19th century in the titles. On the other hand, Amazon offered a link to a book by a friend of mine, L.A.-based Greg Goldin, Never Built New York . It's as if they were reading our email exchanges or something. That was impressive. Or scary, depending on your point of view. I chose to be impressed.",

      "text": "Tech Amazon unveils artificial intelligence products for cloud This Sept 28, 2011 file photo shows the logo for Amazon during a news conference, in New York. Photo: AP Tweet Published: 11:10 AM, December 1, 2016 \nLAS VEGAS — Amazon introduced an image recognition program, a speech-to-text service dubbed Polly, and tools for building conversational apps, highlighting its push to add artificial intelligence to its cloud-computer offerings. \nMr Andy Jassy, chief executive officer of the Amazon Web Services unit, unveiled the new products on Wednesday (Nov 30) at the company’s fifth annual re:Invent conference, which drew 32,000 people from diverse industries to Las Vegas. He pitched Amazon’s wide breadth of services and ability to customise them for clients, while poking fun at competitor Oracle, which Amazon dismisses as a cloud pretender. \nThe event attracted people from financial services, health care, gaming and other industries interested in learning more about how to use cloud computing, and let Amazon flex its muscles as a market leader in the fast-growing industry. Public cloud spending is expected to increase almost 17 per cent to US$204 billion (S$292.3 billion) this year, according to researcher Gartner. \nAmazon is trying to maintain its lead over Microsoft, Alphabet’s Google, IBM and Oracle as more companies transition from using their servers to renting computing power and data space hosted remotely, which they access via the Internet. Movie-service Netflix is a prominent example of a web company powered by Amazon Web Services. Capital One Financial announced on Tuesday it would transition more of its data to Amazon, highlighting growing interest of the financial sector in the speed and flexibility of cloud computing. \nSpat With Rival \nThe feud between Amazon and Oracle heated up in September when Oracle Chairman Mr Larry Ellison, introduced new cloud products during his company’s OpenWorld keynote address and said, “Amazon’s lead is over.” \nA slide in Mr Jassy’s presentation highlighted the “ability to see through the hand-waving and bombast”, and featured a photo of Mr Ellison popping up intermittently. Another slide proclaimed Amazon freed users from “customer hostile database vendors”, showing part of the red Oracle logo as the letter o in hostile. \nThe competition will increase with Amazon’s announcement on Wednesday that its database tool Aurora will be compatible with additional open-source databases, said Mr Al Hilwa, who directs software development research at IDC. \nIn the third quarter, Amazon had about 45 per cent of the market for infrastructure as a service, where companies buy basic computing and storage power from the cloud, according to Synergy Research Group. Amazon’s revenue is more than twice that of the next three players combined, Synergy said. \nGreater Profit \nAmazon’s Web Services division is the Seattle-based company’s fastest-growing and most profitable source of revenue, offsetting regular quarterly losses from its e-commerce operation. Cloud computing revenue is projected to top US$10 billion this year. \nThe new AI services will let customers create applications hosted on Amazon Web Services that understand what’s displayed in photos and, with a program called Lex, develop conversations in a manner similar to Amazon’s Alexa voice-activated technology. Microsoft offers the ability to bake similar artificial intelligence into applications run on its Azure cloud services and Google earlier this year launched business tools and products based on its own AI technology to entice more companies to rent its cloud-computing services. \nThe company also introduced an expanded version of its data-transfer product called Snowball, a suitcase-sized device. In addition to the new service called Snowball Edge, Mr Jassy unveiled snowball-on-steroids, a 45-foot-long (14m) shipping container dubbed Snowmobile, which is capable of moving massive amounts of a customer’s data to the cloud. The container, pulled on a tractor-trailer bed, rolled toward the stage in the Las Vegas convention centre to cap Jassy’s keynote address. \n“We needed a bigger box,” he said, as the truck moved through simulated smoke and attendees snapped photos.

      "text": "This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in 1997 Not to alarm you but you're missing out on an important event. Motley Fool Staff Nov 30, 2016 at 10:04PM Image source: The Motley Fool. \nRenowned investor David Gardner (whose Stock Advisor newsletter was reported in The Wall Street Journal as one of the best performing in the world*) revealed his next great stock ideas. \nAnd something very particular about one of David's picks has some investors buzzing with excitement. \nDavid issued a rare \"buy\" alert on a stock that, at the time, had just recently held its IPO and went public . \nHere's why this is such an important (and rare) move: \nIn Stock Advisor 's 14 year history, there have been only 4 occasions David Gardner has recommended shares of company that held its IPO within 5 months of his \"buy\" alert. \nThat's incredible! Only 4 times has David looked at a brand new stock and IMMEDIATELY believed he found a winner. \nUsually, David likes to wait and see a company prove itself in the public markets for a few years before recommending investors buy shares, but sometimes , on rare occasions, he believes in a company so much, he pounds the table for investors to act fast and grab shares. \nPerhaps no example better highlights this rare conviction like David's September 1997 recommendation of Amazon.com. Amazon was a small-cap stock that had just gone public on May 15, 1997 when David Gardner first published his detailed, 4,250 word \"buy\" report on Amazon 's ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) stock AND added shares to his portfolio. \nDavid predicted Jeff Bezos's vision for Amazon. David told investors \"Amazon is about more than just books.\" \nAmazon had been public for just 4 months when David issued this bold \"buy\" recommendation but boy, did it pay to listen . \nA mere two weeks after David recommended buying shares of Amazon, the stock had already surged more than 41%. \nMany investors would be elated with a 41% pop and sell out. Not David . \nDavid refused to sell -- fast-forward to today, Amazon's stock is up a mind-boggling 20,000% -- turning every $5,000 invested in Amazon into nearly $1 million today. \nWhile you can't go back in time and invest in Amazon alongside David Gardner, I believe I'm offering you the next best thing... \nWhich brings me back to the newly IPO'd company David recommended – a company with strikingly similar traits to what made David first issue his Amazon call. \nFirst, with a market cap of around $4 billion, this stock is essentially still a small-cap. \nAnd like Amazon, this company has been growing like gangbusters! \nThe company has grown the size of its user base by 63% annually for the past 4 years – giving it more than double the market share of its next closest competitor. \nEven more exciting, management still believes they've only captured 11% of the potential market for their product. \nThat's the type of growth and market opportunity that gets David Gardner's heart pumping. \nRemember the old saying, \"the early bird gets the worm\" – an ageless mantra reminding us early movers often have the best chance of success. \nThat's exactly why David recommended investors buy shares. \nBut please note : as of right now, you could miss out because you may not be eligible to access David's pick. \nYou see, David Gardner only releases these recommendations to members of his service, Motley Fool Stock Advisor . \nLucky for you, it's not too late to join, so I'm going to show you the simple steps to secure access today. \nIt's very telling that David couldn't wait any longer to recommended a newly IPO'd stock with these unmistakable traits. \nAnd while I would never guarantee David's newest recommendation will produce Amazon-like returns, this stock is already up over 55% since David first recommended it-and up more than 10% with his most recent rerecommendation. \nEven though timing isn't everything, history shows that it can pay to move early on stocks like this one -- especially when you consider David's average pick in Stock Advisor is up 174%! (And yes, that includes all his winners and losers!) \nDon't miss out. There's still plenty of time to get the full story on this remarkable company. \nThe Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon.com.

      "title": "The new information super-highway: Amazon hauls 100 petabytes of data on a truck",
      "text": "amazon snowmobile data migration cloud storage truck More Amazon\nNeed to move lots and lots of data into the cloud but don’t have the time and money to pump all that information across the internet? Look no further than Amazon’s new Snowmobile for its Amazon Web Services platform. Despite the bitter cold, free-riding name, this data migration solution is a secure data ‘truck’ that can store up to 100 petabytes of data for moving “exabytes” of data across the nation’s real highways to Amazon’s cloud in a matter of weeks. Ten-four, good buddy.\nAmazon describes its new Snowmobile as a “ruggedized, tamper-resistant shipping container” measuring 45-feet long, 9.6-feet high, and 8-feet wide. The container is both climate-controlled and waterproof and consumes around 350KW of power just for the cooling system alone. It can be parked in a covered or uncovered area at the customer’s datacenter, and Amazon will even supply a generator if customers can’t provide enough power to juice the container.\nMore: Amazon fed up with fakes, taking aggressive action to banish counterfeits\n“Each Snowmobile includes a network cable connected to a high-speed switch capable of supporting one terabit per second of data transfer spread across multiple 40 gigabits per second connections,” Amazon’s Jeff Barr wrote in a blog post on Wednesday . “Assuming that your existing network can transfer data at that rate, you can fill a Snowmobile in about 10 days.”\nBarr indicated that the Snowmobile is aimed at customers in the scientific, media and entertainment, financial services, and other industries. It attaches directly to the company’s network and appears as a local, Network File System (NFS) storage device. Customers can use their own backup/archiving tools to transfer all their data to be stored using Amazon Glacier or Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).\nUsing a Lego-inspired example, Barr suggested Snowmobiles are ideal for aging data centers that still rely on racks full of disk and tape drives storing “precious, mission-critical” data. Thus, by moving all that data onto current storage technologies via the cloud, enterprises are spending less time and money trying to squeeze additional performance out of aging hardware.\nAWS customers can call to set up a meeting to discuss how the data can be moved to Amazon’s cloud using a Snowmobile. Once the 18-wheeler shows up with the container, AWS Professional Services does all the work in connecting the container to the customer’s network. The customer then initiates the data transfer and when the process is finally complete, the 18-wheeler hauls the container back to Amazon to import the data as specified by the customer.\nFor now, Snowmobiles will only be used to migrate data into Amazon’s cloud. However, the company is quite aware that many customers may want to export their data from the cloud in disaster recovery cases. Barr didn’t say when the latter service will become available, nor did he have any info to share regarding the overall cost of using one or more Snowmobiles. However, this new truck-based storage transfer service is available in all AWS Regions.\nTo see Amazon’s new Snowmobile container, head over to Twitter and have a peek at the company’s coverage stemming from its annual Re:Invent conference that is currently under way in Las Vegas.\nTransferring data to your shiny new PlayStation 4 Pro is a piece of cake Don’t lose your email!

      "text": "In a day full of major news for Amazon’s Alexa, today the company shared plans to beef up the Alexa Skills Kit with a library of hundreds of built-in commands within the next few weeks.\nIntents are used to understand the most basic commands from users. Earlier this year Alexa only had 15 intents and slots types for commands like “Stop,” “Cancel,” or city names.\nAmazon offered few details on the kinds of intents and slot types coming, though Prasad told Backchannel today that people should expect book, video, and local business slot types.\nThe news was announced by Amazon Echo evangelist David Isbitski said in a blog post today, and addressed by Alexa vice president Rohit Prasad in an Alexa State of the Union address delivered at the AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas.\nEarlier in the day at re:Invent, Amazon announced the launch of its first AI services , the launch of the Alexa bot framework Lex, and the creation of the Alexa Accelerator, a 13-week startup accelerator that will be run with Techstars.\n“With the new built-in intents library, weather becomes an object that Alexa knows a lot about, both weather itself and its attributes, but also how a person may ask for the weather,”Isbitski wrote. “Our interaction model now can be done with no sample utterances and a single intent! We call this new type of interaction an Intent Signature and it includes actions, entities and properties . There are numerous Intent Signatures available for use in your Alexa skills across all sorts of categories.”\nNew intents will initially only be available for Alexa users in the U.S.\nThe number of Alexa skills in the Alexa Skills Marketplace has grown from around 100 at the beginning of the year to more than 5,000 today, Isbitski said.\n",
