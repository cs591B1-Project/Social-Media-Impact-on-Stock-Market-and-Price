      "text": "Microsoft joins the Linux Foundation, launches test build of Visual Studio for Mac A decade ago, this would have been blasphemy on Nov 16, 2016, 6:00 PM TechSpot \nMicrosoft, a company that for decades built its business on proprietary, closed-source software, announced on Wednesday at its Connect developer event in New York City that it has joined the Linux Foundation alongside other esteemed Platinum Members such as Samsung, Cisco, IBM and Intel, just to name a few. \nIt’s a development that would have been unfathomable a decade ago under the old regime but Microsoft’s way of doing things has changed entirely under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella. \nAs TechCrunch highlights , today’s Microsoft is one of the biggest open source contributors around. Over the last few years, for example, the Redmond-based company has made PowerShell open source and brought it to Linux, expanded SQL Server to run on Linux and open-sourced the engine behind its Edge browser and brought it to Linux. \nMicrosoft and Linux were bitter enemies for many years – so much so that Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin believes there will be some skepticism around the move, adding that there is a natural anti-establishment sentiment in open source. Zemlin notes that Microsoft has been “walking this talk” for a long time now, essentially meaning that Microsoft’s decision to join isn’t trivial or just for show. \nIn related Microsoft news, the company has launched the first preview of Visual Studio for Mac and a nearly-final version of Visual Studio 2017 for Windows. Microsoft officials tell ZDNet that the final / general availability version of Visual Studio 2017 should be ready by early 2017. Related Reads",

      "text": "Reddit \nAs expected , Microsoft today made its Visual Studio developer environment available on macOS. The first preview of Visual Studio for Mac is live now, with Microsoft hoping that the cross-platform availability will push more developers to build for Windows. \nPreviously, developers interested in building for Windows were required to use a virtual machine, a dedicated Windows computer, or BootCamp. Now, however, developers can work directly in macOS \nVisual Studio for Mac takes many design cues from its Windows counterpart and many core tools are there, such as IntelliSense and some of Xamarin’s cross-platform development tools. Microsoft acquired cross-platform development company Xamarin earlier this year, and it’s using much of the company’s technology to bring Visual Studio to the Mac. \nVisual Studio for Mac supports both C# and F# languages, using the same under-the-hood tools as the Roslyn Compiler Platform and MSBuild. \nThe launch of Visual Studio for Mac comes a year and a half after Microsoft launched Visual Studio Code for Mac , a cross-platform code editor for developers. \nThe Mac edition of Visual Studio is available currently in a preview build, but as Microsoft said earlier this week, its ultimate goal is to make the Mac version of the app a direct counterpart to the Windows version. Interested devleeoprs can download Visual Studio for Mac for free here . Guides",

      "text": "last » \nAs Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab looks to take on Microsoft for alleged antitrust violations, some other antivirus vendors say they are watching the situation closely to see if they also need to step in. \nLate last week, Kaspersky Lab came out swinging against Microsoft, saying that its latest operating system updates allegedly prioritize Windows Defender over third-party antivirus vendors in a way that shuts them out illegally. In a blog post , CEO Eugene Kaspersky accused Microsoft of \"gradually squeezing independent developers out of the Windows ecosystem,\" something he said was to the detriment of customers who want more effective security solutions. \nOn Friday, the Russian antitrust authority opened an investigation into the issue, saying it will look into whether Microsoft violated country laws that prohibit companies from using their market position to prevent competitors from operating against them. \n[Related: Kaspersky Takes Aim At Microsoft, Alleging Antitrust Violations Around Anti-Virus And Windows 10 Updates ] \nIn an email to CRN, Symantec General Manager and Executive Vice President, Norton, Fran Rosch said the company has been watching the evolving situation with Microsoft very closely. \n“We’ve been looking into this situation for months and what we’re seeing is concerning for consumer choice and protection,\" Rosch said. \nRosch said customers are demanding best-in-class security solutions and should be allowed the freedom of choice when it comes to selecting vendors. \n\"We believe that consumers should have the flexibility to freely choose their security solutions. Norton is taking action to ensure our customers continue to have the best protection and security performance available,\" Rosch said. \nIn an email to CRN, Sophos Senior Vice President, Enduser Security Group and Network Security Group Dan Schiappa said that U.K.-based Sophos, which sells anti-virus solutions among many other products, will be watching the situation between Kaspersky and Microsoft closely. \n“I am sure there is more to this story than meets the eye – on both sides. We will watch with interest,\" Schiappa said. Pages",

      "text": "Markets Today Nvidia's Deals with IBM, Microsoft and Google Strengthen Its Artificial Intelligence Lead Though competition abounds, Nvida's GPU investments and software ecosystem are big advantages in a booming market for powering AI tasks. Eric Jhonsa Nov16,20165:35PMEST \nNvidia's ( NVDA ) spectacular earnings and guidance last week provided good evidence that the GPU leader is on its way to making the powering of artificial intelligence workloads a 10-figure annual business. \nSince then, it hasn't wasted time announcing moves that grow its AI ecosystem and could help keep hungry rivals at bay. \nOn Monday, Nvidia and IBM ( IBM ) announced the latter is rolling out a software toolkit called IBM PowerAI for IBM servers containing Nvidia's Tesla accelerator cards, which are widely used to handle a popular type of AI known as deep learning. \nIBM also rolled out a new server, the Power S822LC, that's optimized for AI and other high-performance computing (HPC) workloads: It pairs Big Blue's mammoth Power8 CPUs with Tesla accelerators and Nvidia's NVLink high-speed GPU interconnect. \nThat day, Nvidia also announced it's teaming with Microsoft ( MSFT ) on a solution that lets businesses create AI workloads by using Microsoft's Cognitive Toolkit software on systems containing Tesla GPUs. The solution is available both via Microsoft's Azure public cloud platform, and for corporate data centers through Nvidia's Tesla-powered DGX-1 HPC system. \nAnd on Tuesday, Nvidia and Microsoft disclosed Azure server virtual machines (VMs) that feature Tesla GPUs are now generally available to Azure cloud computing users, four months after launching in preview mode. This comes less than two months after Amazon ( AMZN ) unveiled cloud computing VMs that support up to 16 Tesla GPUs. Prev 0 of 3 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "  \nSharePoint was released on iOS less than a month ago , and it’s already getting significant updates and feature additions. In today’s update to SharePoint, Microsoft added in “news posts.” This feature lets people post reports to keep people updated on the status of projects, share meeting notes and do just about anything else that would fall under the umbrella of news. \nHere’s the description of the feature from the patch notes: \nYou can now create news posts in the app! Within a team site, tap the new ‘add’ option to start creating your news post. You can add rich text, photos, or documents to your posts. Publish team status, trip reports, important documents, and more…now from your phone. If you don’t see a news tab in your SharePoint app, the news service hasn’t rolled out to your organization yet. But, it is coming, so stay tuned! Available for SharePoint Online only. \nThe update is still in the middle of rolling out, so some users may not necessarily have this feature available at the moment. If you open up SharePoint and don’t see the new “add” option in your team site, just give it a while, and you should get the update sooner or later.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft is helping those who were forced to interrupt their education return to the classroom and fulfill their educational potential long after leaving school.\nKing5.com reports that Microsoft has committed $1.5 million to support a program, Reconnecting Youth by United Way which over the last two years has already helped place 3,000 mature students in various educational programs throughout Kings County. United Way hopes to reach half of the 15,000 school drop-outs in the county by 2020, allowing them to return to class and improve their prospects.\n“I wanted a career,” said 19-year-old November Mcvea, who dropped out in 10th grade, and who returned to class with the help of the program and is now one quarter away from graduating.\nMicrosoft’s donation will help fund more teachers, more case workers and more one-on-one support, essential to keep the students engaged.\n“I feel like they really want me to succeed just as much as I want to,” said Mcvea. “So it’s more motivation for me to come and to know that I have someone to talk to.”\nReferring to Microsoft’s motivations for donating, Jared Erlandson, director of communications for United Way of King County said “They care about having a workforce that is able to deal with the realities of the world with technology. They know in order for business to succeed, their community needs to succeed.”\nBesides corporate donations, Microsoft employee charitable donations exceeded $125 million in 2015.\nLearn more about Reconnecting Youth here .",

      "text": "News New Visual Studio Versions Target Windows, Mobile and Mac Developers, Boost DevOps Microsoft Corporate Vice President Scott Guthrie kicked off the Connect(); conference with an action-packed keynote where he revealed significant tooling improvements impacting mobile app development, containerized app dev, cross-platform mobile DevOps and serverless compute architectures, and more. By Michael Desmond 11/16/2016 \nThe Microsoft Connect(); conference in New York kicked off today with an action-packed keynote headlined by Corporate Vice President Scott Guthrie. The keynote revealed significant tooling improvements impacting mobile app development, containerized app dev, cross-platform mobile DevOps and serverless compute architectures. The keynote also highlighted the aggressive open source strategy at Microsoft, marked by the announcement that Microsoft is now a Linux Foundation Platinum Member. \nPerhaps most notable were the announcements around Microsoft's Visual Studio platform, which stand to have the most impact on the broad developer ecosystem. Microsoft at the Connect(); event announced three new products: the flagship Visual Studio 2017 IDE for Windows--available as a release candidate--the preview version of the new Visual Studio for Mac, and the upcoming preview of Visual Studio Mobile Center. \nVisual Studio 2017 offers a host of productivity and performance improvements over Visual Studio 2015. Kasey Uhlenhuth, Microsoft program manager on the .NET and Visual Studio teams at Microsoft, provided a demo of the IDE and showed how developers can use features like advanced code navigation and IntelliSense filtering to streamline activities. She also showed how live unit testing provides real-time feedback within the code editor, while Run to Click debugging eliminates the need to set temporary breakpoints when running sections of code. \nJames Montemagno, principal program manager at Microsoft, explained how Visual Studio 2017 extends support for mobile native app development across Android, iOS and Windows devices. Support for Xamarin.Forms XAML-like UI code means developers can share both app and UI code across mobile platforms. In his demo, Montemagno showed how the Xamarin.Forms Previewer renders a live visualization of the app page as updates are made to the UI code--a demo that drew cheers from the audience. \nThe IDE includes a mobile test recorder to capture actions for test. These can then be uploaded to Xamarin Test Cloud where actions and code can be tested against an inventory of thousands of real devices hosted in the cloud. Microsoft touts performance improvements in the Visual Studio 2017 release, with reduced memory consumption and startup and solution load times that are two to four time quicker than in previous versions. \nAlso announced today was Visual Studio for Mac, which melds the Visual Studio and Xamarin Studio IDEs to bring the Visual Studio developer experience to MacOS-based developers. The IDE supports mobile app development for iOS and Android, .as well as development for both .NET and Azure. The Visual Studio for Mac user interface complies with MacOS UI conventions while retaining the Visual Studio user experience. \n\"Visual Studio has always been a deep source of inspiration for Xamarin Studio and MonoDevelop, so we didn't need to make any fundamental changes, but there were lots of little details to get right and we had to strike a balance between feeling like Visual Studio and feeling like a Mac app,\" says Mikayla Hutchinson, senior program manager for the Xamarin Platform at Microsoft. \n\"Xamarin is all about providing a polished, native user experience -- it's something everyone on the team cares about, and we'll be refining it further.\" The new IDE is available to anyone with a Visual Studio subscription license at no extra cost, while a free Community Edition is available for download for all developers to work with. The Preview Edition of Visual Studio for Mac is available today for download from Microsoft at visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac . \nThe third new product debuted in the Visual Studio family at Connect(); is Visual Studio Mobile Center, a DevOps tool that draws together build, test, distribution and monitoring activities for cross-platform mobile apps running on iOS and Android. Nat Friedman, corporate vice president for Mobile Developer Tools at Microsoft described the tool as \"mission control for mobile app development.\" \nMobile Center pulls together important homegrown and acquired solutions, including HockeyApp, Xamarin Insights, Xamarin Test Cloud, Azure App Service and CodePush. Thomas Dohmke, group program manager for Visual Studio Mobile Center and co-founder of HockeyApp, says he is particularly excited about two features in Mobile Center--Build and Tables. \n\"With Build, developers can build iOS and Android apps with just a few clicks; so much simpler than with Visual Studio Team Services, and many customers will love that they don't need a Mac,\" Dohmke says. \"With Tables, developers can integrate an Azure backend and enable offline sync without a single line of backend code--just add our SDK, define the table, and your app is ready to sync data with the cloud.\" \nIntegration with GitHub simplifies the task of onboarding existing and new GitHub projects, and makes it possible to automatically run a suite of tests each time project code is committed. Developers can set rules for automatic distribution to project collaborators for preview builds, while integration of Xamarin Test Cloud enables testing across thousands of cloud-hosted physical devices. \nFriedman says a preview of Visual Studio Mobile Center will be made available for download in the near future.

      "text": "  @05:05PM from the smoothing-things dept. Microsoft has offered concessions to EC competition regulators in the hopes of smoothing the way for its planned acquisition of LinkedIn . From an article on TechCrunch, submitted by an anonymous reader: An EC spokesperson confirmed it has received \"a commitments proposal\" from Microsoft but declined to comment further. Commitments, in EC antitrust nomenclature, refers to remedies a company can offer if the Commission has concerns a merger/acquisition may significantly affect competition. These can include proposing certain modifications to the project to guarantee continued competition on the market. The news comes two weeks after Salesforce (which itself tried to purchase LinkedIn ) urged EU to take a closer look at Microsoft's takeover of LinkedIn.",

      "title": "Microsoft demonstrates its commitment to open source by joining Linux Foundation - Digital Trends",
      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nMicrosoft has gone through a number of massive changes since it began transitioning from the Windows company to the “cloud-first, mobile-first” productivity solutions company. For one thing, it has gone cross-platform with its applications, supporting iOS and Android along with Windows. For another, it has embraced open source in a way that would have been inconceivable just a few years ago. \nOne beneficiary of Microsoft newfound respect for open source software has been Linux, which for the longest time was considered an almost evil movement that went against Microsoft commitment to proprietary software. Now, Microsoft provides significant support for Linux and on Wednesday, the company announced it joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member, Ars Technica reports . \nMore: Cortana, machine intelligence, and cross-platform take the lead at Build 2016 \nMicrosoft’s support for Linux is not quite as robust in terms of its productivity solutions — for example, there is no Office 365 for Linux as of yet. Instead, Microsoft aimed more at supporting developers and organizations that use Linux. One example is building a Linux subsystem into Windows 10 that was officially introduced at Microsoft’s Build 2016 event. Another example is supporting SQL Server for Linux and the Docker open source container platform. \nBy joining the Linux Foundation, Microsoft can hope to meet head-on some of the skepticism that has surrounded its recent support of Linux. As Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, says, “Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people.” It is likely that taking a more active role in the Linux community will demonstrate Microsoft’s commitment to open source in a way that merely offering software that works with it can accomplish. \nIn a Microsoft blog post announcing the move, Cloud and Enterprise Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie said, “We want to help developers achieve more and capitalize on the industry’s shift toward cloud-first and mobile-first experiences using the tools and platforms of their choice. By collaborating with the community to provide open, flexible and intelligent tools and cloud services, we’re helping every developer deliver unprecedented levels of innovation.” \nClearly, the company recognizes the importance of open source software generally, and Linux specifically, to developers. Highly visible actions like joining the Linux Foundation should work hand in hand with efforts closer to the ground such as improving Hyper-V support for Linux to convince the community Microsoft is serious in its new approach to open source. It is now obvious that being a fan of Microsoft no longer means being anti-Linux. Also watch: Microsoft adds a robot guards, ushers in Sci-Fi apocalypse",

      "text": "Microsoft offers EU concessions over its $26bn LinkedIn bid November 16, 2016 - 18:16   Microsoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn , the European Commission said on Wednesday, November 16, as the U.S. software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal, Reuters reports. \nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week. \nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. \nMicrosoft declined to comment. The LinkedIn acquisition will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn makes most of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nU.S. rival Salesforce, which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn, has warned of the threat to innovation and competition and urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before clearing the deal. \nMicrosoft however sees competition from social network Facebook and wants regulators to take that into account, people familiar with the matter said.

      "title": "How Much Will Xbox’s Project Scorpio Cost?",
      "text": "Xbox head Phil Spencer prepares gamers for a potential shock when Microsoft announces the price of next year’s high-end gaming console, Project Scorpio. When Microsoft first announced Project Scorpio most gamers were intrigued, maybe even excited, by the prospect of a more powerful current-gen console. With current consoles struggling to match PCs in terms of power, fidelity, and frame rate, Scorpio promised to bridge that gap and, in turn, deliver impressive gameplay to the console space.\nBut soon after that initial enthusiasm wore away, many gamers began to consider Project Scorpio not as a console but as an expense. Considering how powerful the machine was looking to be , most figured that it would carry a premium price tag. And today Xbox head Phil Spencer confirmed those assumptions.\nWhile it was no big secret that Project Scorpio would be expensive , it seems like Spencer’s comments are meant to prepare gamers for the inevitable Scorpio price announcement. For a while now gamers have been growing accustomed to $350 consoles or cheaper, but very soon that will change. For starters, according to Spencer, Project Scorpio will cost more than the Xbox One S .\nAs far as how expensive the Project Scorpio console will be, Spencer would not say. He did put things into perspective, though, highlighting that a high-end gaming device will likely carry a high-end price tag. Much like PC gaming, if gamers want the most powerful devices they will have to except the premiums.\n“Scorpio will be a premium console. It will cost more than S, obviously, that’s how we are building it. We have not announced the pricing yet, but I want to make sure that the investment we are putting into the product of Scorpio meets the demands of the higher-end consumer and that will be a higher price.”\nThat being said, Project Scorpio is still a closed system and therefore doesn’t carry one of the key benefits of PC gaming: upgrading. Unless Microsoft goes completely rogue with their console design, the Scorpio console will still be locked at a certain performance level and gamers will be unable to upgrade if they so choose. PC Gamers, on the other hand, have the freedom to upgrade at their bank account’s discretion.\nSo, assuming Project Scorpio will be a closed console system the question then becomes: how much will it cost? Based on what Phil Spencer is saying, a $500 price point seems like the bare minimum, and we wouldn’t be surprised if the console was even more expensive. Delivering the types of gaming experiences that Microsoft is touting typically costs a $1000 PC at least, but a device that expensive is unlikely to get much interest.\nIf Microsoft wants the Project Scorpio to sell it will need to find a price point that justifies the manufacturing expenses but is not so high that gamers will simply go off and buy a PC. What exactly that price point may be is unclear, but chances are the folks at Microsoft are debating that right now.\nSource: Level Up (via Gamepur )",

Share story Mike Rosenberg Seattle Times business reporter \nA global real estate investor has spent nearly $300 million to gobble up several buildings in Microsoft’s Redmond headquarters campus and an Amazon-occupied office in downtown Seattle. \nNew York-based Blackstone Real Estate Partners, which bills itself as the largest real estate private equity firm in the world, bought the buildings from Houston-based Hines, county sales records released Wednesday show. \nThe sale includes two purchases of low-rise complexes in Microsoft’s Redmond campus: $110 million for the Laguna property along 15011 NE 36th Street and 14980 NE 31st Way, and $94 million for the Daytona property on 14999 NE 31st Way. The properties include nine office buildings totaling 712,000 square feet, and also includes an office outpost for Honeywell, an industrial products company. \nHines, which i s selling off all its real estate investments, bought the properties in 2007 and is selling them for nearly double the $112 million combined assessed value.

      "title": "Xbox Project Scorpio: Everything you need to know about Microsoft’s newest console",
      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThis year’s Electronic Entertainment Expo — aka E3 — saw the reveal of several hotly anticipated games, as well as new trailers and gameplay footage for titles that had previously been announced. From the dragon-centric Scalebound to dystopian thriller We Happy Few , Microsoft’s press conference was loaded with new IPs and returning favorites that Xbox One owners — and Windows 10 users, thanks to Microsoft’s new Xbox Play Anywhere initiative — will undoubtedly be excited to get their hands on. \nMore: Destiny dropping support for legacy consoles with release of Rise of Iron \nThe games were just a side dish for Microsoft, though. Xbox head Phil Spencer bookended the 90-minute conference with the announcement of two new consoles, including a new Xbox One model that will be capable of streaming 4K content upon its debut. Then, after an hour of game-focused programming, Spencer returned to the stage to announce the next iteration of Xbox , codenamed Project Scorpio. \nHere’s everything we know thus far. Performance and specs \nWith Project Scorpio, Microsoft aims to set a new standard for console performance. The system, billed by the Xbox team as “the console [that] developers wanted us to build,” promises to deliver four times the graphical power of the current Xbox One. This power — which should allow the console to run games at higher resolutions with better framerates — is measured in teraflops, of which Scorpio supposedly boasts six. A teraflop is essentially a measure of graphical potential, which is largely dependent upon the console’s GPU. \nThe Scorpio, confirmed to use an as-of-yet unreleased AMD GPU, should feature four times as many shaders per compute unit than its predecessor, which, in turn, should render the console capable of running games in 4K resolution at 60 frames per second. We’re proud that @Microsoft has expanded their @Xbox One family with 2 new consoles featuring AMD’s semi-custom SoCs https://t.co/tYi6enSgW4 \n— AMD (@AMD) June 13, 2016 \nIn an interview with USA Today , Microsoft Studios Publishing General Manager Shannon Loftis said that first-party games launching alongside Scorpio will run at a native 4K resolution, instead of being upscaled. \n“Any games we’re making that we’re launching in the Scorpio time frame, we’re making sure they can natively render at 4K,” Loftis said. \nIf this all sounds rather abstruse, that’s because it is. Despite Project Scorpio’s appearance in the coveted final slot of Microsoft’s press conference at E3, few details or specifications have been officially announced. The six-teraflop figure was thrown around quite a bit by Phil Spencer & Co., but it’s still unclear how the console will reach that level of computing power. Team Xbox was fairly transparent about the fact that gamers without a 4K television shouldn’t spend their money on the ultra-powerful Scorpio , but how many gamers do own a 4K TV? \nSpencer also made it clear that Scorpio is intended to exist alongside Xbox One and Xbox One S — and that all games will be available for each console — but it appears developers might be forced to choose which platform their game is optimized for. Do they design a graphically superior title for Scorpio and hope that enough gamers are willing to pony up the cash, or do they settle for a game made to perform well on Xbox One that simply upscales when played on the Scorpio?",

      "text": "\n* Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet boost S&P, Nasdaq \n* Home Depot falls after no change to full-year forecast \n* October U.S. retail sales rise more than expected \n* Oil prices jump as much as 6.4 pct \n* Dow up 0.29 pct, S&P up 0.75 pct, Nasdaq up 1.1 pct (Updates to late afternoon, adds comment, changes byline) \nBy Sinead Carew \nNov 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, with the Dow registering its fourth consecutive record high close as tech stocks rebounded from a post-election battering and energy stocks were boosted by a sharp rise in oil prices. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average extended its rally to seven days after it turned positive in late trading, while oil futures continued their rise and investors kept piling into technology stocks. \n\"Buyers who were waiting to buy technology stocks didn't have an option but to get involved and continue buying the strength. That's propelled them higher as the day went on,\" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. \nThe technology sector was the S&P's biggest gainer, closing up 1.3 percent in a partial rebound from its 3 percent decline since Donald Trump's shock victory on Nov. 8. Investors set aside worries that the sector could be hurt by Trump's immigration and foreign trade policies. \nThe S&P's energy index was the next biggest driver, with a 2.7 percent rise, as U.S. crude oil jumped more than 6 percent from multi-month lows on expectations that OPEC will agree later this month to cut production.. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 54.37 points, or 0.29 percent, to 18,923.06, the S&P 500 gained 16.19 points, or 0.75 percent, to 2,180.39 and the Nasdaq Composite added 57.23 points, or 1.1 percent, to 5,275.62. \nTech giants Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet provided the biggest boost to the Nasdaq, and along with Apple Inc, were the top drivers for the S&P 500. \nOil giant Exxon Mobil rose 1.8 percent, also contributing to the S&P's rise. \nEquity investors have been betting that Donald Trump will live up to his campaign promises to boost government spending, along with lower taxes and lighter regulation. \n\"People view all of this as positive for the economy and positive for the market. That continues to wash through the market. The buying isn't as virulent as it was, but we're still doing well,\" said Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. \nHigh-dividend-paying sectors such as utilities and telecommunications also rose following a steep sell-off in the past few days. \nU.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October as households bought motor vehicles and a range of other goods. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, above the 0.6 percent increase forecast by economists. \nHome Depot fell 2.6 percent to $124.40 after the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain reported strong third-quarter results but kept its full-year sales forecast, implying a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.65-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers. \nThe S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 173 new highs and 32 new lows. \nAbout 8.4 billion stocks changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lighter than Monday's volume but well above the 7.8 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Home News Microsoft Is Now Branding Retail Xbox 360 Games As Backward Compatible GAMING NEWS Microsoft Is Now Branding Retail Xbox 360 Games As Backward Compatible Posted on Wednesday, November 16 @ 17:00:00 PST by Jonathan_Leack Microsoft's move to support backward compatibility is just one of the reasons why it has gained huge momentum during the past year . Consumers like more games to play, and this is just one way of significantly increasing the library volume. In an effort to further market its backward compatibility efforts, Microsoft has begun branding Xbox 360 games as playable on Xbox One. This has arrived on virtually all supported titles, ranging from Fallout 3 to Doom 3 , as seen below: There appear to be at least two configurations for how games advertise this support. Nonetheless, this move has required some investment on Microsoft's part, and it appears that it believes it's well worth it. Microsoft most recently added Skate 3 , LIMBO, and The Orange Box to its list of supported titles.",

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, above the 0.6 percent increase forecast by economists. \nHome Depot fell 3.6 percent to $123.13 after the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain reported strong third-quarter results but stood pat on its full-year sales forecast, implying a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.50-to-1 ratio favored advancers. \nThe S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 144 new highs and 28 new lows.

      "text": "\n* Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet boost S&P, Nasdaq \n* Home Depot falls after standing pat on full-year forecast \n* October U.S. retail sales rise more than expected \n* Oil prices jump as much as 5 pct \n* Dow down 0.11 pct, S&P up 0.31 pct, Nasdaq up 0.72 pct (Updates to early afternoon) \nBy Tanya Agrawal and Anya George Tharakan \nNov 15 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were higher in early afternoon trading on Tuesday as tech stocks were back in demand after a post-election drubbing, while the Dow took a breather following a six-day rally. \nThe S&P technology sector, which had fallen about 3 percent since Donald Trump's shock victory, rose 1.19 percent. \nTech giants Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet provided the biggest boost to the S&P and the Dow. \n\"The underlying fundamentals of the economy hasn't really changed and if the economy is strong that will lead to more capital spending which should benefit tech stocks,\" said Mark Watkins, regional investment manager at the Private Client Group at U.S. Bank in Park City, Utah. \nBoth the S&P and the Dow rallied in the past week since Trump's victory on expectations of higher fiscal spending and lower regulations in the financial and environmental sectors. \nHowever, investors remain uncertain about the details of Trump's policies and are also keeping an eye on key appointments in his administration. \n\"Last week's rally was basically a digestion of Trump's win and now that we're past the digestion phase, the market is taking a bit of a breather and is waiting to see what lies ahead under a Republican government,\" said Watkins. \nAt 12:41 p.m. ET (1741 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 20.82 points, or 0.11 percent, at 18,847.87, the S&P 500 was up 6.67 points, or 0.31 percent, at 2,170.87 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 37.71 points, or 0.72 percent, at 5,256.11. \nSeven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the energy index's 2.11 percent rise leading the advancers. \nHigh dividend paying sectors such as utilities and telecommunications also rose following a steep selloff in the past few days. \nThe financial index, which rose more than 10 percent since the election, fell 1 percent as traders cashed in on profits. \nOil prices jumped as much as 5 percent, bouncing back from multi-month lows on expectations that OPEC will agree later this month to cut production to reduce a supply glut. \nOil majors Exxon and Chevron were up about 1.8 percent, providing the biggest boost to the Dow. \nU.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October as households bought motor vehicles and a range of other goods. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, above the 0.6 percent increase forecast by economists. \nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Tuesday only \"significant negative news\" could derail the Fed's high expectations for raising U.S. interest rates next month. \nThe central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its next meeting in December. Traders have priced in a 91 percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. \nHome Depot fell 2.7 percent to $124.18 after the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain reported strong third-quarter results but stood pat on its full-year sales forecast, implying a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,903 to 1,059. On the Nasdaq, 1,401 issues fell and 1,389 advanced. \nThe S&P 500 index showed 20 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 110 new highs and 19 new lows.

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Pro 5 Latest Specs, Price And Release Date Rumors: Kaby Lake Processor, Windows 10 Redstone 2, And More 16 November 2016, 4:53 pm EST By Sumit Passary Tech Times Microsoft - Here's What You Didn't Know Now Playing The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date remains a mystery at this point, but the device may come running on the Kaby Lake processor. Rumors also suggest that the base model of the Surface Pro 5 could cost $899. Pictured here is the current-gen Surface Pro 4. ( Microsoft ) Advertisement \nMicrosoft's Surface Pro 5 tablet is one of the most anticipated 2-in-1 detachable gadgets in the tech space. Although, rumors of the tablet are rife, info on the release date, specs and price of the Surface Pro 5 remain unknown. \nHere are the latest rumors about Microsoft's next-gen tablet. Specs \nProcessor The Surface Pro 4 included Intel's Skylake processor. But the Pro 5 tablet is highly likely to come running on the successor to the Skylake processor, the Intel Kaby Lake. However, the launch of the Kaby Lake processor has been delayed and it is expected to arrive in the second half of 2017, which means that Microsoft's fifth-generation tablet could come running on Skylake processor. Battery The Surface Pro 4 was plagued with battery drain issues. Many customers complained of its battery draining very quickly. The company did issue a fix, but users would want that such a problem does not arise in the Surface Pro 5. Operating System Microsoft is expected to release a new operating system called Windows 10 Redstone 2 sometime in 2017. The next Surface tablet may come running on the new OS straight out of the box. RAM and Storage A model of Surface Pro 4 comes with 256 GB of internal storage and 16 GB of RAM. It is very likely that the Surface Pro 5 has a model with 256 GB of onboard storage and 16 GB of RAM. USB Type-C The Surface Pro 4 does not support USB Type-C, which offers fast charging. Many other mobile devices do support USB Type-C, and it is rumored that the Surface Pro 5 would also feature USB Type-C ports. Screen The Surface Pro 4 sports a 12.3-inch screen. Rumors point out that Microsoft may introduce a Surface Pro 5 model that has a bigger 13.3-inch display. Price \nThe current-gen Surface Pro 4 has a base price of $999, while the top variant costs $1,799. If rumors are to be believed , then the price of Surface Pro 5 could be between $899 and $1,599. Release \nThe release date of the Surface Pro 5 remains a mystery. The Surface Pro 3 was launched and released in May 2014, while the Surface Pro 4 was announced and released in October 2015. There is no specific month in which Microsoft reveals a new Surface tablet. \nSome rumors claim that the Surface Pro 5 could make an appearance in January 2017. However, other speculations hint that the detachable could make its way to the market in the second half of 2017. \nMicrosoft has not confirmed a release date for the Surface Pro 5, which means customers will have to wait for official news from the company. Until then, all rumors of the Surface Pro 5 should be taken with a pinch of salt.  ",

      "text": "\n* Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet boost S&P, Nasdaq \n* Home Depot falls after standing pat on full-year forecast \n* October U.S. retail sales rise more than expected \n* Oil prices jump 4 pct \n* Dow down 0.29 pct, S&P up 0.11 pct, Nasdaq up 0.46 pct (Adds details, changes comment, updates prices) \nBy Tanya Agrawal and Anya George Tharakan \nNov 15 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rose on Tuesday as tech stocks were back in demand after a post-election drubbing, while the Dow took a breather following a six-day rally. \nThe S&P technology sector, which had fallen about 3 percent since Donald Trump's shock victory, rose 1.29 percent. \nMicrosoft's 1.62 percent rise gave the biggest boost to the S&P and the Dow, followed by Amazon and Alphabet. \n\"The underlying fundamentals of the economy hasn't really changed and if the economy is strong that will lead to more capital spending which should benefit tech stocks,\" said Mark Watkins, regional investment manager at the Private Client Group at U.S. Bank in Park City, Utah. \nBoth the S&P and the Dow had rallied in the past week since Trump's victory on expectations of higher fiscal spending and lower regulations in the financial and environmental sectors. \nHowever, investors remain uncertain about the details of Trump's policies and are also keeping an eye on key appointments in his administration. \n\"Last week's rally was basically a digestion of Trump's win and now that we're past the digestion phase, the market is taking a bit of a breather and is waiting to see what lies ahead under a Republican government,\" said Watkins. \nAt 10:56 a.m. ET (1556 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was down 33.83 points, or 0.18 percent, at 18,834.86, the S&P 500 was up 6.34 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,170.54 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 40.32 points, or 0.77 percent, at 5,258.72. \nSeven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the energy index's 2.14 percent rise leading the advancers. \nThe financial index, which rose more than 10 percent since the election, fell 1.18 percent as traders cashed in on profits. \nOil prices jumped more than 4 percent, bouncing back from multi-month lows on expectations that OPEC will agree later this month to cut production to reduce a supply glut. \nOil majors Exxon and Chevron were up about 1.8 percent. \nU.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October as households bought motor vehicles and a range of other goods. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday retail sales increased 0.8 percent last month, above the 0.6 percent increase forecast by economists. \nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Tuesday only \"significant negative news\" could derail the Fed's high expectations for raising U.S. interest rates next month. \nThe central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its next meeting in December. Traders have priced in an 86 percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. \nHome Depot fell 2.1 percent to $125.13 after the No. 1 U.S. home improvement chain reported strong third-quarter results but stood pat on its full-year sales forecast, implying a weaker-than-expected fourth quarter. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,855 to 1,064. On the Nasdaq, 1,353 issues fell and 1,298 advanced. \nThe S&P 500 index showed 17 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 93 new highs and 13 new lows.

So we may see a lot of this back and forth.\" \nAt 9:47 a.m. ET (1447 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 55.16 points, or 0.29 percent, at 18,813.53, the S&P 500 was up 2.46 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,166.66 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 24.08 points, or 0.46 percent, at 5,242.48. \nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the energy index's 1.65 percent rise leading the advancers. \nThe financial index, which rose more than 10 percent since the election, fell 1.42 percent as traders cashed in profits. \nOil prices jumped more than 3 percent, bouncing back from multi-month lows on expectations that OPEC will agree later this month to cut production to reduce a supply glut. \nU.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October as households bought motor vehicles and a range of other goods.

      "text": "For Java: Eclipse for Java \nIn order to finish the setup you need to follow a few more steps: Open the device manager again and find out on which COM port is the Intel® Edison Virtual COM Port and set the port in the IDE. Load up the blink example and if everything went well so far, the on-board LED should start blinking. To connect with Wi-Fi, open Putty, and once you login, type configure_edison --wifi. Work through the setup process and use the guide to connect to your Wi-Fi network (See Get Started with Intel® Edison on Windows ). Microsoft Azure Setting up an Azure Event Hub \nFor this setup, the free trial version will be used. You need to sign in with a Microsoft account. After signing in, click on Sign up for a free trial. In the next tab, you have to fill in information about yourself, including credit card data. Do not worry, you will not be charged if you do not specifically say so. After clicking the Sign up button at the bottom of the page, the Azure Portal Homepage will appear. Click on New in the top left corner - Internet of Things – Event Hub. First you need to create a namespace, click on Service Bus on the left and then CREATE at the bottom Fill in the required information and then click the check sign Now our namespace was created. Next, we need to create the Event Hub. Make sure you have selected the Service Bus tab on the left and then click on New on the bottom-left Next, select App Services – Service Bus – Event Hub Next, click on Quick create and fill in the required information Now you should be able to see on your screen something like this in your portal, under the Service Bus tab : You will need to further configure your Event Hub. Click on your namespace, and you’ll be prompted with the following window: Click on Event Hubs tab, you will see on your screen your Event Hub: Click on the event hub and then click on Configure You will now need to create a new shared access policy for your Hub, make sure you select Manage from the permissions tab Now you will have to create a consumer group. At your created Hub, click on the Consumer Groups tab and then click on Create. Name your group and click the checkmark Your namespace must also have a key defined, return to the namespace (the Service bus tab on the left), click on Configure and then, under Shared access policies type in a key name and make sure you check Manage Click on the Service bus tab again, then click on Connection information at the bottom (make sure you have selected your namespace) Here you can see your namespaces and their keys: If you return to your Event Hub’s dashboard after you begin sending messages to it from the gateway, you will see something like this: \nThe event hub dashboard is just a way to check if the data was received correctly, see the bandwidth of those messages and check if you are getting errors. To work with the data you will need to read it from the event hub through an application using the many different SDKs that Microsoft offers (for an example see the section below on How to use features of Azure services - Notifications ). Also, a full explanation of how to read data from Intel® Edison board and sending it to the just created Event Hub using an IoT Gateway can be found in the How to take the developed solution from the board to the gateway and to the cloud section. SDKs for Microsoft Azure IoT \nThe most popular language to develop apps for Azure is C# but if you want to use other languages and platforms visit GitHub . Setting up the gateway Wyse* 3000 Series x86-Embedded Desktop Thin Client \nRegulatory model number: N03D \nThe gateway connects legacy and new systems, and enables seamless and secure data flow between edge devices and the cloud. We take data from the Intel® Edison board and send it to the gateway, and the gateway sends the data to the cloud as an event. \nIn the next section we detail the setup process for the gateway. \nThe new Wyse* 3000 Series x86-embedded thin client has a powerful performance at an entry-level price. It has a dual-core Intel processor with 1.6GHz, an integrated graphics engine, and multiple connectivity choices. Its various configuration options support a wide variety of peripherals and interfaces, along with unified communications platforms such as Lync 2010, Lync 2013 and the Skype for Business client for Lync 2015 (UI mode) plus high-fidelity protocols such as RemoteFX and Citrix* HDX. \nIn order to get started, see the quick start guide . To get your thin client up and running, you must do the following: Make sure that the thin client and the monitor are turned off and disconnected from AC power. Place the thin client on the desk after you attach feet for vertical or horizontal position. Assemble the VESA mount with user-supplied screws, and insert the thin client; try to put the cables facing down or to the side. Make all desired connections. In order to connect to a network, you can use a Base-T Ethernet network cable. I f your device is equipped with a SFP slot, use a SFP module, or use an optional Wi-Fi network adapter for wireless networks. Connect the power adapter to the thin client power input before connecting to a 100-240V AC. You must wait until the power button light turns off, and then, for turning on the thin client, you need to press the power button. After the initialization sequence is complete, the activity light changes to green. \nThis article is continued in Industrial Use Case Part 2 . Additional Links",

      "text": "Microsoft offers concessions in EU review of LinkedIn bid  34 pm The concessions may allow the deal to win early-stage approval. Share story Gaspard Sebag Bloomberg News \nMicrosoft submitted concessions to European Union antitrust officials examining its takeover of professional social network LinkedIn, which may allow the deal to win early-stage approval. \nEU spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said regulators extended their deadline to rule on the deal to Dec. 6. The office software giant had until Nov. 15 to submit so-called remedies to the EU’s merger watchdog to allay any potential competition concerns. \nThe EU didn’t provide further details and Microsoft representatives declined to comment. \nConcessions made in the early stage of the EU’s review, including asset sales, can help regulators approve a deal without opening an investigation of at least four months. Microsoft and LinkedIn have said they plan to close the deal this year.   \nSalesforce.com, which was outbid by Microsoft’s $26.2 billion offer for LinkedIn, has urged the EU to take a closer look at the deal. Microsoft’s control of LinkedIn’s “unique data set” of professionals may allow it to cut off rivals’ access to that data, the company said. The EU was also looking at whether artificial intelligence could allow Microsoft to reap key insights from LinkedIn data that would aid sales of its other products. \nEU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has voiced concerns about how technology companies’ control of data might strangle competition. In the Microsoft-LinkedIn review, regulators would look at whether “the data purchased in the deal has a very long durability and might constitute a barrier for others, or if they can be replicated so that others stand a chance to enter the market,” Vestager said in June. “We’ve done that kind of analysis in the past and it’s something we’re generally paying a lot of attention to.” \nMicrosoft escaped extended EU merger probes when it bought Nokia’s handset unit and videoconferencing service Skype.

      "title": "Microsoft Visual Studio Makes its Way to macOS",
      "text": "The rumors were true. Microsoft's developer toolkit, based on the its acquisition of Xamarin, finally arrives on the Mac. Microsoft inadvertently let the cat out of the bag earlier this week when it prematurely posted an announcement on its Microsoft Developer Network website revealing that Visual Studio, the company's \"mobile-first, cloud-first IDE\" (integrated development environment), was making its way to the Mac. Microsoft quickly removed the post, finally reinstating it today after announcing a preview release of Visual Studio for Mac. Microsoft made it official Nov. 16 during an on-stage demo at the Connect() developer event in New York City by showing how developers can use Visual Studio 2017 on Windows PCs, Xamarin and Visual Studio for Mac in their workflows. \"It allows you to develop mobile apps for iOS and Android on your Mac, in C# [C Sharp] with Xamarin. That's great, but we're also supporting cloud and server workloads. You can build .NET Core and ASP.NET Core applications and deploy those to Azure,\" said Nat Friedman, corporate vice president of Microsoft's Mobile Developer Tool unit.Friedman is also the former CEO of Xamarin, on which Visual Studio for Mac is largely based. Microsoft acquired the mobile app development toolmaker early this year for an undisclosed amount.Visual Studio for Mac is available at no extra cost to current Visual Studio subscribers, added Friedman. Microsoft is also readying a free Community Edition. The preview edition of the standalone developer software is available now as a free download via the Visual Studio website . \"Once you're up and running, you'll find the same Roslyn-powered compiler, IntelliSense code completion, and refactoring experience you would expect from a Visual Studio IDE,\" explained Miguel de Icaza, a distinguished engineer at Microsoft's Mobile Developer Tools group and co-founder of Xamarin, in a blog post . \"And, since Visual Studio for Mac uses the same MSBuild solution and project format as Visual Studio, developers working on Mac and Windows can share projects across Mac and Windows transparently.\" Microsoft also used the occasion to announce the availability of the Visual Studio 2017 release candidate for Windows PCs. The new version includes time-saving enhancements like improved IntelliSense filtering, navigation tweaks and live code analysis. The company today also took the wraps off its new Visual Studio Mobile Center, a cloud-based mobile app development and management platform that covers both iOS, Android and Windows and supports apps written in Java, Objective-C, React Native, Swift, and Xamarin. In addition, Microsoft announced the general availability of its collaborative DevOps platform offerings, Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2017 and Azure Application Insights. Of course, for the software developer community, the biggest news to come out of Redmond, Wash. software giant today is that the once-unthinkable had finally happened: Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation . \"This is a good day. There was a time when the software industry in general was defined by rivalry and a zero-sum game mentality,\" Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, told eWEEK's . Sean Michael Kerner. \"The biggest thing that open source and Linux has proven over the last 25 years is that sharing works, and you can better yourself and others at the same time.\"",

      "text": "3 MIN READ Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reveals next stage of Australia’s investment into artificial intelligence \nDuring his first official visit to Australia, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed how the company will be working with a range of local organisations to push the next stage of Australia’s investment into artificial intelligence [AI]. Among the world’s first users of Microsoft’s new high performance virtual and intelligent machines are the Australian Government, Cricket Australia, and Webjet. \nMicrosoft will deliver cloud services to Australian developers that will underpin the next generation of intelligent apps. This comes as the largest Windows 10 deployment in the Asia-Pacific region, and will help companies around Australia generate deeper customer insights and learnings. \nSpeaking at a technology developer’s conference in Sydney on Wednesday, Nadella said the new intelligent technology to be deployed by Microsoft and will allow human-like interactions with complex business systems. \n“At Microsoft, we aim to empower every Australian citizen and organisation to achieve more,” said Nadella. “Core to this is empowering every Australian developer with the most complete platforms and technology to build new applications and experiences that will fuel and accelerate digital transformation in every industry.” \nNadella also announced the public preview of a new Azure Bot service, which enables developers to build, deploy and manage bots on the Microsoft Azure cloud. He revealed that Azure’s virtual machines called N-Series will be available in early December to help customers run compute intensive workloads like AI research, rendering and neural network training in the cloud. \nThe new Azure N-Series is being used by OpenAI, the non-profit AI research organisation founded by Elon Musk, Greg Brockman, Ilya Sutskever and Sam Altman. Together the founders have looked to create N-Series as a safer AI solution for widespread applications. \nDuring his keynote Nadella showcased a number of intelligent and responsive innovations that are already being built in Australia using Microsoft technologies. Already using these services are organisations including the Australian Department of Human Services [DHS] and Cricket Australia. \nIn working with Microsoft, the DHS will pioneer proof of concept to deliver measurable and intelligent consumer experiences, powered by deep learning. Using Microsoft’s intelligent cloud technologies, DHS will infuse bots with deeper human context and conversational understanding, helping agents improve and expand their customer engagement channels. \n“DHS is one of the first organisations outside of North America to implement Microsoft’s latest machine learning, AI platforms, and natural language technologies,” said Pip Marlow, managing director of Microsoft Australia. \n“We recognise that for technology to improve the lives of all, it’s crucial that industry and governments work together. The work undertaken by DHS and Microsoft is an example of this collaboration, and together we are guiding best practice globally around the use of intelligent applications to improve access to services for every individual and organisation.” \nCricket Australia, meanwhile, will use Microsoft Surface devices to give coaches instant access to data visualisations and predictive analysis to fine tune development programs. Cricket Australia will be the first users of the platform, using machine learning to create the world’s best ever sporting teams, events, and officials. \nEarlier this month Webjet and Microsoft announced the creation of a new blockchain proof-of-concept [PoC] solution to transform the travel industry. The solution has the potential to change the way online payments are processed and managed for hotel bookings. Together Microsoft and Webject have the opportunity to capitalise on a US$10 billion market to resolves issues created by data mismatch to boost user experience and reduce costs. \nThis week Microsoft will be be formalising a deal with Cricket Australia to provide cricket teams with intelligent software analytics. Nadella will be also be meeting with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to discuss issues on cybersecurity and how technology can improve prevention, detection and response rates. Image: Satya Nadella.

      "text": "Within that office box? Rajesh Jha Yeah, sure, I mean, I think the heart of our office is what people perceive as the product that runs in their desktop today, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote. But you know now Office of course exists in all the platforms whether it would be iOS, Android, Mac, web, but Office is more than just the client experiences or user experiences. We've got a bunch of services or backend server or services, cloud posted. And these are exchange providing enterprise mailed and calendaring and Yammer providing enterprise social. We got SharePoint, doing portals and team collaboration skype that does conferencing, and meetings and voice and then we’ve added Microsoft teams. So the best way to think about Office is its all experiences, end to end, run on all the devices and delivered either on-prem or in the cloud. And do you think that we’ve done now as expanded Office even more into areas like security and analytics and voice and so on, so it’s a lot of things like you said. Brent Thill There's been a lot of changes just in terms of the product, there’s also been a lot of change at least from our perception of the culture and with Satya coming in now and running. Can you just talk about how things have changed and what you felt maybe over the last couple years as he taken the head leadership role? Rajesh Jha Yeah, sure, I mean I think Satya did a really good job when he came into the role, do first spend some time building deep conviction about our unique mission, our sensibility. Because you know if you got to start there and then figure out what the culture that gets you to the mission. And so I think we have a bold mission today empowering every individual, every organization to achieve more to get to their best potential. So you start with that clarity then you figure out what are the ambition, so what are our strategic thrust that get us there. And so from a culture perspective, I would say perhaps the biggest impact was bringing the mindset, our learning mindset, our growth mindset where it's about being humble, it's about being open minded about being intellectually curious trying soft not being afraid to fail, learn quickly from failure that was a pretty good shift. It seems pretty and obvious thing for us to do, but it was a pretty big shift that he brought to the table and then brought a much sharper perspective on customer obsession being connected to the customer. And then I would say under his leadership that third aspect, I would add, is probably more than ever before, working as one Microsoft. So building on each other and getting the efficiencies from that. And I mean you guys now think so the business model changes so quickly, technology changes so quickly that you've got to have a resilient culture. And so I do feel pretty good about where we are today. Brent Thill When you think about this big move that you had to the cloud, tell us about this journey, tell us about kind of where you think you are, what that had. There's obviously a hybrid world that you guys are still envisioning, but how do we think about the balance between the cloud and the on-prem world? Rajesh Jha Well, I mean, for many years now we've been all in on the cloud. And for a bunch of different reasons, the rate of innovation – now you have the – you have Microsoft investing in upgrade, migration, deployment and you take the friction away from customers who get your newest stuff to the rate of innovation. The ability to provide up the best user experiences because you have customers always up today. You know the ability of democratizing, the availability for products, so SMBs you know small and medium businesses where I describe offices being so many things. Its super hard for small business to go to put up all of that together and with a cloud delivery you make that possible for them to actually get to the same experiences that a big enterprise might get to. So there's a lot of stuff that’s amazing with a cloud and we’re all-in. But the reality is customers are going to have different constraints and how fast they can move to a cloud. We’ve had some customers that say hey you know I would like this regulated entity inside my organization to stay on-prem and everybody else can move the cloud. So they think about hybrid setup for more on a user basis or a department basis or a side office basis, there are other customers that say it's great. Let's get calendaring and mail and conferencing deliver from the cloud, but I want to keep my portals on-prem. So at Office 365, we'll let you do hybrid that way too. So I mean look if you're in the business and serving enterprises, you know one size and fit all. So we want to provide the best possible stuff in the cloud, but we have and we fully support our hybrid configurations more than Office 365 and Azure. And so we continue to build long-term versions of our product, the reality is our cloud versions are getting progressively richer and richer, so the gap does exist, nut we are servicing our on-prem customers as well. Brent Thill Back to tier 1 size doesn’t fit all, you've also taken different skews in office and given best low level features. I subscribed Office 365 for $9.99, believe $10 roughly a month. I don’t have the enterprise E5 skew, which I think brings the price point up to $35 per use per month with a lot of new features sets. Can you just talk about how you think about the go-to market in terms of the availability in I think E5 is relatively new, how is that doing? Rajesh Jha Yeah, it's a great question. So – but at Office 365, we have I would say very, very competitive productivity, communication, collaboration and security infrastructure for all our customers and for enterprises we call that E1. And it is our best set of experiences. We think that's an area we continue to add value all the time. So like we recently launched Microsoft teams and that's available in E1. So we are committed to our E1 customer, our broadest thing. But one of the great things that we've seen happened with our business is how customers have opted in into our premium skews. E3 has been in the market for a few years now. And if you take a look at all our premium skews, I think our skew mix today, our premium skew mix is upward of 60%. And so they see the value in E3. And what do we have in E3, that’s not in E1 – the office client. In E1, you get the web client, where you could bring your own client. In E3, you get all these up to date, cloud updated office client on all the end points to get security compliance features. And then E5 is something that we are very excited about to, it’s still early in E5. Our customers are trialing here and we've seen early interest in all the key pillars of E5, which is advanced, security and compliance, advanced analytics and voice and the loss of capabilities in voice. So that’s how we setup our skews commercially. You could buy a given workload, but most of our customers tend to get the entire suite. They may start with the workload, but they get the entire suite and then we have them – we add value to our premier tiers. Brent Thill The role of AI has been a popular topic and valiant at this conference. And when you start think about all the different applications that your powering kind of knowing each other is doing what’s the role of AI in your initiatives going forward? Rajesh Jha It’s huge. I mean look the first thing when people [indiscernible] (0:11:15) AI, the first thing you’ve got to wonder is do they have unique data, do they have unique signals. In Office, we have billions and billions of data points as our users interact with our products. They are signaling us when I share a document with you, Brent, that’s a signal. If I email – if somebody sends me email, I do out dwell seven or eights on that email versus my typical a minute or two back to signal. And all these signals and all the data, what we do with our Office 365 is we treat them as the customers’ data and customer signals. So, the – what do we do? Now, we have got lots of lots of billion of endpoints of data in signals then you would bring a machine learning and iTechniques natural language processing to give back the end user or the customer unique insights. Let me give you a couple examples. Let's say you're editing a document in Word and you’re preparing a report and then you think maybe I want to reuse a chart from a report, I had seen somewhere in my work group and you didn't quite a member, who had you shared this with you, but you want to reuse one of those charts. So what we have today a feature now in Office 365 is called the words tap, so virtually one tap on to their even and we use the AI technique to bring all the relevant documents that you've seen in the past that may be interesting to the content that you're writing now and the auto bringing those things in show right pane, you can scroll in the right pane, you can tap on the chart that you see in boom, it’s in your word document. And so instead of going leaning board, going and doing a search, trying to filter your search, trying to remember who sent you that thing the AI signals brings it back to the word. I am not going to give you lots and lots examples of these things. So I think with AI, we are helping the users get time back, get value back whether in terms of efficiency or automating their task, but I'm also excited about AI from the IT’s perspective in place that we use AI now in Office 365 is what I call it a security graph. Again, we see tons and tons of malware tone at our customers and I see that in office, my colleagues see that in directory in Azure, we see that in windows. We triangulate all of these signals. And then we overlay that in giving our customers – the IT guys’ insights into what the threats are, who are the most targeted users, which devices may have been compromised, suggesting protections. So when you have loss of data and loss of signals then you have the opportunity to use ML and AI to give value back to the users and customers really excited about what we are doing here and we've got a bunch of ideas here. Brent Thill You've scared a lot of business intelligence users with your Power BI bundle and that into some of the broader solutions. So when you think the standalone BI players to what you’re doing, can you talk about the role of power BI and… Rajesh Jha Yeah, I mean, I think there is lots of interesting work happening in this area of analytics in the industry. And I mean our vision of Power BI is data science, everybody should be a data scientist. We want to democratize what it means to analyze data to filter it, to draw insights. And so Power BI is many ways you should think of that as the next logical step from Excel. I mean you do a lot of analysis in Excel with RBI, you can do rich dashboarding. And you can bind that to the Office data, you can bind that to line of business data. And the speed of our investments in analytics is time back, money back, value back to end users democratized data science. Brent Thill Any stats you can give us just in terms of that initiative you’ve been – I think over the last year you’ve been pushing it pretty harder. Are there any other kind of broad data points you have to kind of support what happens with Power BI option? Rajesh Jha I mean Power BI today is a part of E5. And we are still early with E5 that’s just we are – I would say maybe an year in the market. We are very pleased with the – like I said there are three key visions pillars for E5, one is around advanced security and compliance, the other is around analytics and the third one is around voice. And each one of these three pillars are resonating with our customers. I would say probably security is the one as we’ve seen the most early adoption but I’m really pleased with customer feedback and the opportunity – the market opportunity that each of these three pillars are presenting for us today. Brent Thill Well, we’ve been watching kind of the formation of Dynamics for quite some time with some acquisitions in organic build and it seems like a really exciting business it sounds like you’re spending a lot more time on that business, doubling down. Can you talk about the relationship Office 365 in the Dynamics family? Rajesh Jha Yes, I mean there is a lot, lots of – I’m really excited about Dynamics 365 and its your question about how do they build on each other if you’re in the context of a Dynamics application. You still want to be using the product really to like you are used to selling dynamics, you can embedded excel, you can bind to SharePoint, right inside of the Dynamics experience you are getting Office experience or you can be in Office and have those things reach out the Dynamics data. Another thing that we’ve done which I think is going to be – its going to be super beneficial to our users and customers is common notion of collaboration. So what we have done in Azure Active Directory we’ve plumed in the notion of a group. All of us work in the context of different groups, no body’s today in modern society works alone. You always work in the context of groups. And so we plum that at the lowest layer in Active Directory and now if I have a group for my direct peoples, I have a group for a product launch or I have a group dedicated to a given customer whether you’re in Dynamics, whether you’re in Outlook, whether you’re in a game or whether you’re in Word, the same group namespace shows. So when I go to OneDrive I can quickly filter all the documents that are related to that group. When I go to Dynamics I can still see my entire context filtered to the group. So some of the work that we do in a closed Dynamics and Office is at a pretty deep layer but I think it’s foundational and how experience might change. And some of it is or we made the experience just super well integrated across the two. Brent Thill Skype, its been a – it’s a great asset, you obviously purchased it for a large sum of money. Rajesh Jha Yes. Brent Thill There has been a lot of questions from investors, have you been able to truly take the value of that asset and make it as value as you could, can you walk through your ultimate vision for Skype? Rajesh Jha Yes, I mean   our economic engine with Office 365. I would say our core workloads today are enterprise messaging, calendaring with Exchange and Outlook, we’ve got of course the productivity, suite Office and SharePoint for storage and portals. And Skype is a big one for us I mean we are – I mean you today with E5 especially what you get with Skype, as you get a single experience that spans voice, video, conferencing applications sharing, presence. And if you look at some of the innovation that has come out recently where you’ve seen where – today its an Office 365 feature which as you can do a Skype broadcast, as you can broadcast something out of Skype to your interorganization. But we are going to do transcriptions, the natural language transcription, translation for different languages. And so I’m actually quite pleased with the various innovation and adoption that we have with Skype and how deeply it is integrated into our Office go-to-market. The teams watched a lot of interest obviously your CEO showed up to that. Rajesh Jha He did. Brent Thill Presentation which highlights it’s probably really important thing. There’s been a lot of talk about other collaborative solutions in market whether it’s Slack or HipChat or other solutions. Rajesh Jha Sure. Brent Thill And maybe tell us a little bit what – how I teams different than some of the other products you’ve had in the past or relatively differentiated to some of the competitors who are out there. Rajesh Jha It’s a great question Brent. I first say communication and collaboration is a basic human need, all modern products really, all the economic activity starts with people working together. But then you start to think about how do people work together? And there’s no one-size-fits-all. If you’re in accounting, that’s trying to connect to a bunch of customers and selected people inside of your company and that’s one set of interaction models. If you’re a CEO, and you’re trying to reach your employees and get their feedback, that’s another kind of collaboration communication pattern. If you’re a bunch of folks getting together high energy trying to launch a product or a bunch of developers writing code. So with Office 365 what we want to do? We want to give you the complete toolkit for collaboration. And we believe that with, I talked about the notion of groups that was being plunged at a common level. And so we want to recognize that people collect together in groups, some groups are open, some groups are closed, some groups are super large, some are more private. And so we have a common notion of groups and whether you’re collaborating though mail, you were sharing a calendar or a notebook; whether you have a set of document you’re sharing, we’ve got a common planning. Yammer understands the same set of groups, it lets you connect across your network in a open way. And then with SharePoint, we have the ability to go and have a Internet portal with teams. So what we are doing is we are adding to that toolkit a collaboration with a common fabric. And the team effort is focused on a bunch of people, bringing a bunch of people together, the content together, the applications that they work in together. Again what’s different, and look I mean Slack is an amazing work, and HipChat has been around a long time and it has a loyal following. But what we are doing with teams is actually building out the collaboration to have the full tool kit there. Our Office 365 and it benefits from Office. Day one, it’s going to be in 18 languages in 180 countries. Day one, it is going to be compliant and we’ve got [indiscernible] HIPAA data, we’ve got full compliance. But most of all from an end-user perspective, it brings the tools right into that experience. When you are in the team’s experience, you can pin a SharePoint page, you can pin in an Excel document. We have 150 different integration set of possible, including HootSuite, and Zendesk, and Asana and many others. Rajesh Jha And so overall, I mean just the framing is it’s not about Microsoft teams alone, it’s about making Office 365 the best collaboration toolkit. And for our customers who are there on Office 365 want to make sure they’ve got all the different ways that their teams may be collaborating to have the full tool kit there. One is the great product, maybe hasn’t had the same level of light on it, there’s a lot of Evernote groupies. How do you get the Evernote groupies in just a one note? Brent Thill Yes let me start pushing that a little bit look Office has got a billion users. It’s hard to compare something like a OneNote, or something like Dell, with something like water Outlook with a billion, half a billion users. But OneNote is actually, I mean if – we are seeing great adoption of OneNote in all segments. I mean I’ll just – let me just take edu, for example. I mean if you see the level of inking support in OneNote, where you can do math problems, it auto recognizes formulas, we allow teachers not to auto provision of notebook for every classroom. And so they’re bringing OneNote into the organization actually introducing the rest of the organization to the full Office 365. If you think about the Surface Hub, we’re new not so new anymore, but our collaboration in big-screen interfaces. OneNote that you hear whiteboard application in there and in terms of the migration from Evernote, we release a toolkit sometime earlier this year or maybe late last year and a lot of our users are actually taking advantage of that to move over their digital memories forward into OneNote. OneNote is a pretty key pillar of Office today, the Office client business. Rajesh Jha This probably ties more into the dynamics business but Debbie was here earlier and talked about partnership with moving there infrastructure here. Your back end and when you think about those even marketing automation in terms of you helping users use them. Can you may be talk a little bit about what’s happening with Adobe in that partnership? Brent Thill Yes let me just make a broader point of partnerships, I mean look I mean, we always start with all of these discussions, we always start with a couple of things, I mean obvious things. First is, what’s the best thing for our mutual customers. And the second thing is there a better together opportunity for us to go build out and experience better for both the partners. And with Adobe that was obvious and obvious case was to go do that. Rajesh Jha Another one I would point to is Red Hat. What we have done with the Red Hat is we have allowed our enterprise customers and given them more choice in how they do hybrid environment. And I thing what is really cool is Microsoft and Red Hat got together and we give our customers completely unified support experience. They don’t know whether the support call it being taken by Microsoft or it’s being taken by Red Hat. In the same vein I can talk about the stuff that we’ve done with DocuSign, or SAP, Salesforce.com, Salesforce is well-integrated into our product. So I think I would take the broader look at partnerships and I mean and actually just to build on that a little bit Brent I would say, with Office especially we have a renewed commitment over the last three, four years to have modern extensibility. Office was always extensible, but we added modern extensibility, we allow partners to plug in their experiences to our new add-on interfaces. We have REST APIs for Microsoft Graph that led them connect to Office 365. And so I mean it’s a place where you should expect us to continue to do more. Brent Thill There’s a handful of questions and there’s a common theme around LinkedIn. I know it hasn’t closed so you can’t probably say too much, but it’s pretty powerful when you think about the things you guys can do together and the impact to the Office family. And I look at the impact to my Outlook applications, and example some of these job perhaps get it all populate the data where someone changed their phone number, or email, you’re not seeing this, I’m seeing this. Rajesh Jha So I love this kind of an interview where you’re asking the question and answering that too. I guess just one example, but maybe your perspective on where you think that will have big impact than your franchise. Brent Thill Look I’m very excited about LinkedIn, I really can’t say a lot. I’m happy to come back once this closes we have to let the process play out and be respectful of the process. But I’m very excited about what we can do. Rajesh Jha Okay and I think you’re talking about the benefits [indiscernible]. Maybe a little bit about the E5 adoption what’s driving it? How important has voice been? Brent Thill Yes, I mean I’m not sure I did a good job explaining the tearing in Office and all. So say a customer, moves to our cloud, let’s say they start with mail and calendar. What that does is it generates a lot of their data and their content in our cloud. And if we do a good job serving their needs, and we build confidence for them, they may end up moving something like SharePoint or Skype into the cloud with us, that generates more data that we are the custodians are for them in the cloud. The next thing our customers want to do is they want to do things like eDiscovery, put a legal hold or they want to protect the data, they want to do analytics on the data. And that is what leads them into E3. We do some basic level of data leakage protection and conditional access and of course operational security just built into our Office 365, but you want advance analytics, you want the advance security, with lots what gets them into E3. And then there is stuff like Advanced Threat Protection or voice or Power BI, that gets them into E3. And then there are stuff like Advanced Threat Protection or voice or Power BI, I think [indiscernible] to E5. So I guess what I'm saying is the more usage we have and the more users we have the more data we have; the more data we have the more right we earn to give them premium value as a part E3 or E5. So that’s the basic thesis of how we are adding E5 value. And like I said with E5 we have three trusts, we have security and compliance. And I’m really excited about the fellow stuff that we've been able to bring to our customers there. And then we Power BI and something we call MyAnalytics on the analytic side. So if you – for example, I don't know if you guys have seen this capability, but in Office if you're an E5 user what you'd be able to see, one of the insights that might – for you losing touch worth, so we auto suggest that to you. If you send out a piece of e-mail – how many of you have sent out a piece of e-mail, the large or let’s say more than 30, 40 people, many of you. Wouldn’t you want to know how many times that got read in order to read rate on those things. And we do this in a super respectful of privacy, it took less than five people, we won’t give you that insight, but let's say you send it to 20, 30 people, you'd be able to see what their read rates, how many replied and forwards to their own e-mail. So these are the kind of analytics and insights that the second pillar. And the third one; let me talk a little bit about voice in Office 365 E5. We have lots of voice capabilities that we are very excited about. The first thing we do is we had conferencing in E3 in Office. But the conferencing, we had our customers, you could do voice conferencing completely based on the cloud. But your customers would have to bring their own PSTN conferencing in and now that is built in into E5, so one-stop shop for all your conferencing needs. Another one, that we don't use PBX systems, complicated to manage, complicated to update, can now be run completely into the cloud. So that's the other proposition of voice in E5. The third one is, now Microsoft will actually give you phone numbers and calling plans in many countries. So you think about the value in voice, those are the three components about value. And when we say give your phone number, you can get a phone number from Microsoft, E5 PSTN calling, that’s the feature that we have. Brent Thill This is a good question on the role of the file system. So you launched – I did this with my new Windows 10 machine and launched it, log in, all of a sudden one drive pops up and it has everything, all the authentications saved. Can you talk a little bit about that and the importance of OneDrive and where that’s headed? Rajesh Jha Yes. So, one thing we haven't done a lot is we haven't talked about Office 365 consumer business. We are quite happy with our consumer business. We have 24 million subscribers today for Office 365 on a consumer space and the value that our users’ get there is they get a terabyte of storage in OneDrive, and OneDrive is a great integration as you just mentioned back into the core devices. And then you get on always up-to-date client, all the AI features I’ve talked about, start to show only for our subscribers. AI features are the kinds of things that we can't easily do for on-prem customers, and so that’s another differentiation for us to actually put more value into our cloud. So I think about OneDrive as a core part of the value proposition for an Office user. If you're a consumer, you get a terabyte of storage and up-to-date client as a part of the 365 consumer subscription. If you're in the Enterprise, you get OneDrive for business that has all the compliance, capability, reliability – not reliably, but geo distribution to a multinational and you can choose some set of users for OneDrive to be in Europe, some set of users OneDrive to be in North America. So those are the capabilities we offer in OneDrive in the commercial space. Brent Thill There have been several questions around securing – and specifically right around e-mail security and what you're doing there given that many of these breaches do happen via the e-mail. Rajesh Jha Yes. Now e-mail is the universal communication dial tone. And so there is always risk of abuse through e-mail. So one of the features that's really resonating for us in E5 today is something we call Advanced Threat Protection. And the idea of Advanced Threat Protection is actually quite simple which is, look, Office 365 will protect you against malware of course that is part of E1. But there are a lot of threat that is zero-day that the malware signatures are not updated for or people will send you a bad link. But when the link wasn’t bad when you got it, the link turns bad later; after the fact, so after the malwares work through it, they will go and hack the website and then if you click on the link that's when you get phished. So what the Advanced Threat Protection does is, it basically detonates – I use the word detonate kind of symbolic quest, every attachment and every link in a virtual machine to try and see that there’s nothing malicious; but the other thing that only we can uniquely do you, now ATP is available in the market as another offering from a couple of other vendors, but what is something we can uniquely do. Today, the problem with Advanced Threat Protection is if I send you phishing mail Brent to you now, your mail is probably going to be delayed five minutes, sometimes seven minutes, because the detonation takes time. With our Office 365 we can do is we'll give you the mail right away, and if you're not only – and if you're reading a bunch of mail and you can read the mail right away. If you click on the attachment, the attachment – if you click the attachment before we have been able to detonate and test it, it will say this is being scanned. And if the mail with the document is a prude thing you were looking at changes [indiscernible] finished detonating it and we've gone and updated your inbox – your message in your inbox now have the attachment too. So this we call it as instant delivery. So we deliver it right away. We detonate on the background and we update and we write in your inbox as soon as we got it. This is a kind of integration of security. Why are we in the security business in Office 365 because we have your data, we have your experiences. Let me give you another example, threat protection. It’s easy for IT to tell all of us, hey, you shouldn’t do this, you should do that. But because we have the office surface area, if I'm in Outlook and I'm sending a mail, I’m forwarding an attachment somebody who's not in my organization, Outlook can detect those business rules and right there tell you, hey, this is not – this is not what your IT wants. Do you still want to send this anyway, you'll be audited, those are the kinds of things we can do. So there are lots and lots of examples of security value that we rather than Office at all tier E1, E3, and E5. Brent Thill And I guess there's a number of questions as it relates to the potential partnership and opportunity to work closely with the third-party security vendors like Proofpoint, Mimecast, how’s that relationship working? Rajesh Jha Well, mail is – if you're a customer and if you have some other security vendor that you want to filter your mail, you could do. You can point your MX records to that other vender and then have that mail be routed after the vendor finished and then get routed to Office 365. So that kind of integration is already possible. What is not easily doable of course is the things like talk of the instant delivery where – because you have to be in operationally closed where the detonation is happening and where the mails being delivered, have to be physically close in the given data center. Those are the kinds of things that I think we can uniquely do. But basic level of integration with other vendors is totally possible today through just routing the MX record. Brent Thill The question around – statistics around Dynamics CRM attaching the broader Office 365’s sale. Rajesh Jha Yes. I don't have that off the top of my head, that’s a good follow-up for us. Brent Thill Okay. And the question around subscription versus product, how should we think about this going forward with 365? Rajesh Jha You mean cloud versus on-premise? Brent Thill Yeah. Rajesh Jha It's a really good question. So let me just give you some anecdotal data first. About four years ago, I would say, maybe four years ago I was talking to about a bunch of CIOs and they were thinking about moving to the cloud. And their biggest feedback as well, I can move to the cloud because you don't have feature X, Y or Z in the cloud, and I get it on-prem. Today, the discussion is entirely different today. Today, they look at things like Microsoft teams; they took a look at that Dell; they took a look at the AI, a threat intelligence graph, and none of that accrues to them if they're not on-premise – if they're not in the cloud. So, today, the cloud is so clearly better in terms of a complete solution, but it's not that we – like I said, we are committed to our customers to serve them on-prem and [indiscernible], it is just that there is a bunch of AI and ML stuff that's incredibly hard. AI and ML requires a lot of compute and a lot of access to the data, lots and lots of signal to super hard to lift that cloud infrastructure and move it on-prem. So I think the whole discussion has changed now when I talk to customers the issue is, hey, could you not bring some of the cloud value to me on-prem and we point to a hybrid configurations there. Brent Thill Excellent. Thank you for your time for sharing your insight. Rajesh Jha Thank you, Brian. Yes, thanks guys.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray R.W. Baird ’s Colin Sebastian today reiterates an Outperform rating on shares of Alphabet ( GOOGL ) after attending a press event that the Google division held in San Francisco yesterday, during which it made several announcements about its cloud computing system, and came away reassured in his view “that Google would ultimately be able to differentiate its enterprise offering from competitors by leveraging advanced ML capabilities and monetize ML through a range of business services.”\nOne highlight of the presentation was Google saying it will place a “new Google Cloud Machine Learning group” in the hands of Fei-Fei Li and Jia Li , whom it called “two world-renowned researchers in the subject of machine intelligence.”\nIt also said it would make available several GPU graphics chip offerings from Nvidia ( NVDA ) and Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) for customers who want to do cloud workloads on those rather than on a standard microprocessor. More details are available in a blog post from Google’s cloud team.\nGoogle can have an edge over Microsoft ’s ( MSFT ) Azure and Amazon.com ( AMZN ) with enhancements to machine learning and artificial intelligence, says Sebastian:\nWe believe that Google can enhance the value of GCP by leveraging the company’s advanced ML/AI capabilities, and potentially differentiating enterprise services from competitors such as AWS and Azure. Importantly, Google has demonstrated some of the most advanced applications of ML to-date in areas including core Search, voice recognition, language translation, image recognition, and data center power usage, to name a few. As more companies look to extract value from large data sets, there will be a significant increase in demand for ML functionality, and we believe Google is very well positioned to provide some of the most advanced tool sets.",

      "text": "Bernama | November 17, 2016 Don Carlson of Microsoft Education says the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2013-2025 is quite extensive if compared to those of other countries in the region. \nKUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia has among the strongest visions in education planning in the Asia Pacific region, said Microsoft Education director for Asia Pacific, Don Carlson. \nHe said the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2013-2025 was quite extensive if compared to those of other countries in the region. \n“I look at a lot of (education) blueprints in the region and find that the blueprint that the government produced here (Malaysia) is quite extensive. \n“It is a very strong vision … of where to go and where they see themselves, which is great because it all starts from there,” he told Bernama in an interview. \nThe blueprint suggests 11 strategic and operational shifts, including to provide internet access and virtual learning environments for all 10,000 schools by 2013 and access to 4G networks for all students in the near future. \nInput for the blueprint came from education experts at Unesco, the World Bank and local universities among others. \nCarlson said among the interesting parts of the blueprint was the plan to connect all schools with 4G connectivity, something many countries were striving for. \n“I think given the vision, it enables us to work with them very closely to help envision and enable that,” he said. \nHe stressed the most exciting part for Microsoft was that internet connectivity would subsequently enable the procurement of data analytics, the next “big thing” in digital learning to be put in place. This in turn will enable for a thorough assessment of students, teachers and schools. \n“It’s happening now (implemented in other countries), how we are enabling technology to help students and teachers learn more effectively, understand students, understand how we can make them succeed more in education (via data analytics). \n“The 4G network, as far as I know is already a work in progress (here), if you enable that, you will enable infrastructure like this (data analytics) to be put in place,” he said. \nCarlson said the company was working with the Malaysian Education Ministry on several aspects of the education blueprint. \nThese include the training of teachers, developing teaching content and materials and transforming schools into Microsoft Showcase Schools that offer learning with Microsoft’s products. \n“In Malaysia, we have six showcase schools that may not necessarily have the best technologies, but they have the strongest leaders who can adapt to changes quite strongly. We are working with the ministry on how we can expand the school, probably in the next couple of years.” \nCarlson said Microsoft had placed several key people from the company to engage with the Education Ministry regularly to help the country envision the blueprint, and assist them in fulfilling the requirements in education to achieve developed nation status as targeted by 2020. \n“We have a number of people in the country who engage at different levels within the ministry and in different departments. \n“We have some who work weekly with the teachers development department and we almost have an office there, it’s not like (we are) flying in and out,” he added.",

      "title": "PowerApps Launch",
      "text": "PowerApps Launch Wednesday, 16 November 2016 \nRecently Microsoft discontinued LightSwitch, its almost-no-programming app creation system to replace it by PowerApps, another almost-no-programming app creation system. The PowerApps service is now generally available and we know the price. Is this not just generally available, but generally interesting? \nMicrosoft is doing what it does best, dropping one technology for another not obviously any better. However, PowerApps is designed to make money and get people using Azure. \nThe basic idea is that you can put together a user interface using templates plus a drag-and-drop designer if you want something customizable. You can populate the UI controls using something that resembles spreadsheet formulas and standard data sources. \nGoing a little beyond this, you can use Microsoft Flow which is a sort of an If This Then That type clone and Power BI which displays data. You can create custom data sources and, if you really want to get complicated, you can create a workflow with BizTalk - a service that seemed to be going nowhere until PowerApps rediscovered it. You can also create Power Apps using SharePoint and link into SharePoint lists. \n\n\nWhat is really interesting about PowerApps is the approach taken to run them on mobile devices. You have to download a host app that then runs your Power App on iOS, Android and probably some time in the future on Windows Mobile. \nAlthough there isn't much information on the technology used by PowerApps it seems likely that the host app is a WebView and the system is an implementation of the same approach used by PhoneGap/Cordoba and other similar HTML/JavaScript hosting apps. Examining the list of functions available, there are some that interface with the device, e.g. acceleration reads the accelerometer. \nThis raises the question of why Microsoft isn't making the inner workings available to us? If programmers could get inside the system and build Power Apps using HTML and JavaScript this would be Microsoft's biggest app platform and be closer to being \"universal\" than their Universal Windows Apps, which essentially only run on Windows 10. Perhaps in the future, if Power Apps become a big hit, Microsoft would have the option of opening up yet another alternative way of creating HTML/JavaScript apps that run like native apps. \nIf you you have an Office 365 or Dynamics 365 account, you might be able to sign into PowerApps for free. If you can't then you need one of the two PowerApp plans, $7 per month per user or $40 per month per user. You only get the common data service with the two paying plans and the more expensive option gives you higher allowances on data storage and additional features. There is a 90-day free trial and at some point in the future there may well be a developer plan.",

      "text": "Elon Musk-backed AI startup and Microsoft sign cloud agreement Tue Nov 15, 2016 11:42am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \n(Reuters) - OpenAI, the non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research firm backed by Tesla Motors Inc's (TSLA.O: Quote ) Elon Musk and other prominent tech executives, has signed an agreement to run most of its large-scale experiments on Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O: Quote ) flagship cloud service, Azure. \nOpenAI will use Azure for its experiments in deep learning and AI, and Microsoft will collaborate with the company on advancing research and creating new tools and technologies. \nMusk, along with venture capitalist Sam Altman, co-chairs OpenAI, whose backers apart from Musk include Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O: Quote ) Amazon Web Services and tech investor Peter Thiel and LinkedIn Corp (LNKD.N: Quote ) co-founder Reid Hoffman. \nOpenAI is an early adopter of Microsoft's Azure N-Series Virtual Machines service, which will be generally available from December. \nThese cloud-computing services, which are powered by Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O: Quote ) graphics chips, are designed for the most intensive computing workloads, including deep learning and simulations. \n\"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" OpenAI said in a blogpost. ( bit.ly/2gdxifR ) \nThe non-profit was created last December for the purpose of creating AI that augments human capabilities. \nThe investors have committed $1 billion to the startup, but OpenAI said it expects to spend only a \"tiny fraction\" of that in the next few years. \nOpenAI will continue to release open-source software to make it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud, and will provide Microsoft with feedback to ensure that Azure's capabilities keep pace with its advances in AI. \n(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru) © Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

( bit.ly/2gdxifR ) \nThe non-profit was created last December for the purpose of creating AI that augments human capabilities. \nThe investors have committed $1 billion to the startup, but OpenAI said it expects to spend only a \"tiny fraction\" of that in the next few years. \nOpenAI will continue to release open-source software to make it easier for people to run large-scale AI workloads on the cloud, and will provide Microsoft with feedback to ensure that Azure's capabilities keep pace with its advances in AI. \n(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru) © Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

      "text": "Canonical Announces the Public Preview of Microsoft SQL Server on Ubuntu Linux GO Images are available on Microsoft’s SQL Server website Nov 16, 2016 22:35 GMT · By Marius Nestor · Share: Today, November 16, 2016, Canonical was pleased to announce the availability of a Public Preview of Microsoft's SQL server for the popular Ubuntu Linux operating system. In May this year, we reported on Microsoft's upcoming plans to bring its SQL Server to the Linux platform, providing developers and organizations with freedom of choice for both cloud and local infrastructures when it comes to implementing a powerful database server. And now, it looks like Canonical prepared a public preview of SQL Server on Linux, allowing Ubuntu users to get familiar with it. \"With the next version of SQL Server, Microsoft brings the power of SQL Server on Linux and Windows including support for Docker containers,\" said Canonical in the press announcement . \"Moreover, with SQL Server on Ubuntu, there are significant cost savings, performance improvements, and the ability to scale & deploy additional storage and compute resources easier without adding more hardware.\" Microsoft SQL Server enables choice of data types and development languages We all known that companies dedicated to open source software won't replace the free and powerful MariaDB or MySQL solutions with SQL Server, but it looks like Microsoft's relational database management system promises support for Docker containers and enables choice of data types and development languages. Using Microsoft SQL Server saves costs, adds an extra layer of performance, and improves scalability. If you want to give Microsoft SQL Server a try on Ubuntu, you should know that public preview images are now available on Microsoft's SQL Server on Linux website, as well as on Microsoft Azure and Docker Hub . Don't hesitate to visit www.sqlserveronlinux.com if you want to get started with Microsoft SQL Server on Ubuntu. There, you'll find many other useful resources and documentation to better understand the advantages of SQL Server on Ubuntu.",

      "text": "Microsoft Joins the Linux Foundation as Everyone Now Loves Open Source GO The company joins Linux Foundation as platinum member Nov 16, 2016 20:17 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft announced today that it’s joining the Linux Foundation as a platinum member, no less than 15 years after former CEO Steve Ballmer described the open source platform as “a cancer.” Microsoft has slowly but surely migrated towards the open source world, but the icing on the cake was announced today when Redmond confirmed that it’s becoming a platinum member of the Linux Foundation. Unsurprisingly, the software giant made this announcement with much fanfare and officials of the Linux Foundation applauded Microsoft’s involvement. “By becoming a Linux Foundation Platinum member, Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people,” said Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation. “Microsoft has been a key contributor to many projects, and we see the company intensifying its involvement and commitment to open development.” With Satya Nadella at the helm of the firm, Microsoft gradually increased its focus on Linux and the open source world. Project such as PowerShell, Visual Studio Code, and the Edge JavaScript engine have one by one been open sourced as part of a broader effort that pushed the company closer to a world that it once hated. Furthermore, with Windows 10 Microsoft is stepping closer to Linux, as the operating system comes with Ubuntu built-in. Earlier this year, Microsoft also released SQL Server for Linux. Microsoft says that it started focusing more on the open source community “in part through the popularity of its open source and cross-platform application framework .NET Core.” Google’s surprise announcement Also today, Google announced that it’s joining the .NET Foundation as part of the Steering Group. The surprise announcement was made at the Connect()’ developer conference. “Wednesday’s addition of Google to the .NET Foundation’s Technical Steering Group further reinforces the vibrancy of the .NET developer community as well as Google’s commitment to fostering an open platform that supports businesses and developers who have standardized on .NET,” Microsoft concludes.",

      "text": "Microsoft Releases Windows 7 and 8.1 Preview Update Rollups for December GO Users can try out December updates in advance Nov 16, 2016 12:25 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​Microsoft has rolled out new update rollup previews for Windows 7 and 8.1 to provide users with early access to next month’s patching cycle as per the company’s new approach that came into effect in October. Specifically, Microsoft is no longer releasing individual patches, but rollups that include all updates for every month, and the company is giving users the chance to try out the next month's updates with so-called Security Monthly Quality Rollups available as optional. Basically, these updates are only aimed at users who want to test in advance the company’s latest patches, but also for IT admins who need to prepare for the next Patch Tuesday cycle in their organizations. These updates are released on the third Tuesday of each month and can be downloaded from Microsoft’s Update Catalog. A few hours ago, the company pushed this month’s preview for Windows 7 and 8.1 systems, and if you’re planning to install them, KB3197869 and KB3197875 , respectively, are the ones you should be looking for. What’s in these updates? Individually, KB3197869 is called November 2016 Preview of Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and comes with improvements and bug fixes for the operating system and some of the built-in features - you can check out the full changelog in the box after the jump. Additionally, KB3197875 is the November 2016 Preview of Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 and includes many more changes, all of which are detailed below. According to the official KB page, “this update includes improvements and fixes that were a part of Monthly Rollup KB3197874 (released November 8, 2016). This update also includes these new quality improvements and is a preview of the next Monthly Rollup update.” You can download these updates using the Microsoft Update Catalog, and the direct links are available on the KB page of each of the two patches listed above.

      "text": "Microsoft Working with EU over LinkedIn Deal, Says Facebook Competition Is Key GO The company has offered concessions as part of the talks Nov 16, 2016 11:06 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​Microsoft is seeking regulatory approval in Europe to complete the acquisition of LinkedIn, and according to a new report, the company has offered concessions to make sure it gets the go-ahead from the antitrust body on the Old Continent. Reuters writes that Microsoft executives met with European Union officials last week and discussed the LinkedIn acquisition and the concerns expressed by other companies. The software giant, however, has offered concessions, the report adds, but no specifics are available right now. Rival companies are worried that once Microsoft purchases LinkedIn, the Redmond giant would be able to restrict access to its database, thus impacting competition. Microsoft told the European Union that competition enforcers need to have in mind that Facebook is becoming a rival on this side of the industry, so Microsoft would not become a monopoly. Microsoft vs. Salesforce Salesforce is one of the companies that asked for antitrust bodies to closely look into the deal, explaining that the merger might be anticompetitive. Microsoft, however, said that it already received the go-ahead from several antitrust groups, and the European Union seems to be one last roadblock that the company needs to get through in order to complete the LinkedIn takeover. “Salesforce may not be aware, but the deal has already been cleared to close in the United States, Canada, and Brazil,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s chief legal officer. “We’re committed to continuing to work to bring price competition to a CRM market in which Salesforce is the dominant participant charging customers higher prices today.” An official statement from Microsoft regarding the current talks with the European Union is not yet available, but given the fact that the Commission has until December 6 to announce a decision, expect the software giant to provide more information shortly after that.",

It's no secret that Microsoft is banking on artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver next-generation IT services to its corporate customers as they embark on their digital transformation journey. This week during the SC16 supercomputing conference in Salt Lake City, the company joined computer graphics hardware maker Nvidia to announce they would collaborate to bring AI-enabled business processes and workflows to practically any enterprise. The companies are working together on an AI framework and platform that runs Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, the open-source deep learning solution that mimics how the human brain processes information. According to Microsoft, leading data scientists employ the toolkit, along with the company's own Bing search engine and Cortana virtual assistant.The software is tailored to run to its fullest potential using Nvidia's Tesla graphical-processing units (GPUs), either on-premises or on Microsoft's cloud. In September, Microsoft announced the impending release of N-series Azure virtual machines that tap the processing power of GPUs provided by Nvidia.\"We're working hard to empower every organization with AI, so that they can make smarter products and solve some of the world's most pressing problems,\" commented Harry Shum, executive vice president of the Artificial Intelligence and Research Group at Microsoft, in a Nov. 14 announcement. \"By working closely with NVIDIA and harnessing the power of GPU-accelerated systems, we've made Cognitive Toolkit and Microsoft Azure the fastest, most versatile AI platform. AI is now within reach of any business.\" Microsoft isn't the only IT heavyweight that's exploiting GPUs and their knack for parallel workloads, like AI and machine learning, to help usher in an era of smart applications. Earlier this year, IBM revealed it added Nvidia's blazingly fast Tesla M60 GPUs to its cloud, allowing it to run high-performance computing, machine learning and other complex workloads faster. In September, Fujitsu announced a new technology that boosts the efficiency of neural networks by simultaneously doubling their capability and reducing the amount of a GPU's internal memory required by 40 percent. Fujitsu's technology analyzes neural networks and searches for opportunities in which memory spaces can be reused instead of requesting more resources. Separately, Microsoft and OpenAI, a non-profit AI research organization whose sponsors include Tesla's high-profile co-founder, Elon Musk, announced Azure will be the primary cloud platform to run OpenAI's experiments. Launched late last year, OpenAI's aim is to \"is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return,\" stated the group in a Dec. 15, 2015 announcement. The new alliance increases the likelihood that those advancements will have taken root in Microsoft's cloud. \"Azure has impressed us by building hardware configurations optimized for deep learning—they offer K80 GPUs with InfiniBand interconnects at scale. We're also excited by their roadmap, which should soon bring Pascal GPUs onto their cloud,\" stated OpenAI in a Nov. 15 announcement . \"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train.\"",

      "text": "By Ben Moore Neowin LLC @@benmoore214 · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft continues to position Minecraft as an educational tool. It notably launched Minecraft: Education Edition earlier in November as a teaching platform for classrooms. Now, Microsoft and Code.org have announced a free Minecraft \"Hour of Code\" tutorial that will run during Computer Science Education Week from December 5-11. \nThe program will be available for free on the Code.org website and will teach students to create their own “Minecraft” experience. Participants can program the rules for their projects by using Code.org’s drag-and-drop coding interface. \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a post : \n“I am inspired by the ‘Minecraft’ generation who view themselves not as players of a game, but as creators of the new worlds they dream up. This is the generation that will imagine, build and create our future, and together we can equip them with the computational thinking and problem-solving skills to seize the opportunities ahead.” \nMicrosoft claims that the tutorial will cover computer science concepts such as object-oriented programming, event handlers, and repeat loops. Students will need to complete 12 different coding challenges on their way to building their own simple and shareable game. \nHadi Partovi, co-founder and CEO of Code.org, added: \n“We’re delighted to have the chance to teach students coding with the fun familiarity of ‘Minecraft,’ to engage students of all backgrounds and skill levels.” \nThe tutorial is currently available in 10 languages, including Spanish, but will add support for 50 additional languages before it fully launches. Microsoft says it will also organize “thousands of youth coding events in more than 60 countries,\" during Computer Science Education Week, including workshops at Microsoft Stores.",

      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) Microsoft Surface brand is expected to come out with a mobile phone product soon. \nMicrosoft's Surface Brand has become one of the most-anticipated brands in the gadgets industry. After recently releasing a desktop PC to the products list, hopes for the rumored Microsoft Surface Phone increased. \nNewer reports suggest that Microsoft Surface Phone will be launched in April next year. It is said to replace Microsoft's Windows series phone instead of just rebranding the said phone line. Unlike Microsoft's Surface devices, Windows phone did not do well in the market. \nSupposed leaked information suggests that Microsoft Surface Phone will come in three variants: 4 GB, 6 GB, and 8 GB. It is expected to operate on Windows 10 and run on Intel Kaby Lake processors. It is also reported to come with a 4K display resolution, which will make it an ideal gadget for those who love watching videos as well as those who are into games. \nIt is also reported to be furnished with a 5.5-inch Active-Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode (AMOLED) display, a USB Port, and a liquid cooling technology. Microsoft is also said to have been working on a patented fingerprint reader that will be incorporated on the phone. It is also believed to have a compass, barometer, proximity sensors, and a 20-megapixel Carl Zeiss rear camera. Advertisement \nMicrosoft has been supportive of the \"Bridge solution,\" which aims to let apps run on both Android and iOS gadgets. As such, Microsoft Surface Phone could be equipped with this as well. \nEvent after event, gadget lovers have been waiting for the Microsoft Surface Phone to make an appearance. To date, however, it has not and no official confirmation from Microsoft has been made either. One of the possible delays would be Intel's next-generation processor with shipment still about to happen. \nAfter a laptop and a tablet that could be used either way and a desktop, the market is more than ready to welcome the Microsoft Surface Phone.

      "text": "By Kurt Mackie 11/16/2016 \nMicrosoft put the spotlight on Linux during its Connect() event for developers this week, including an announcement today that it had joined the Linux Foundation. \nMicrosoft is now a Platinum member of that nonprofit organization, according to an announcement today by the Linux Foundation. In addition, John Gossman, a Microsoft Azure architect, has joined the board of directors. The Linux Foundation is an advocacy organization focused on fostering open source development projects as well as Linux education programs. \nThe Linux Foundation's executive director offered a positive statement about Microsoft's new role. \n\"Microsoft has grown and matured in its use of and contributions to open source technology,\" said Jim Zemlin, executive director of The Linux Foundation, in a released statement. \"The company has become an enthusiastic supporter of Linux and of open source and a very active member of many important projects. Membership is an important step for Microsoft, but also for the open source community at large, which stands to benefit from the company's expanding range of contributions.\" \nMicrosoft has contributed to various Linux Foundation-sponsored projects, including \"Node.js Foundation, OpenDaylight, Open Container Initiative, R Consortium and Open API Initiative,\" per the announcement. \nMore Linux Support Microsoft's Linux love also affected its Visual Studio development environment solutions . Microsoft announced a release candidate version of Visual Studio 2017 for Windows, but it also announced a preview of a mobile app dev suite called \"Visual Studio Mobile Center\" for Android, iOS and Windows. The Linux embrace was perhaps best illustrated with Microsoft's announcement today of a new Visual Studio for Mac preview that was built from scratch to support the Mac platform. \nToday, Microsoft also announced it is previewing SQL Server on Linux . It also released Service Pack 1 for SQL Server 2016 on Windows Server. \nAzure Loves Linux The open source love has spilled into Microsoft Azure, Microsoft's datacenter platform serving up compute, storage and orchestration technologies, as well as developer solutions. \nThe Azure App Service, which provides resources for mobile and Web application developers, now lets them use customized containers. Previously, the service just supported default containers. The Azure App Service supports Node.js, PHP and ASP.NET Core containers. The base container for ASP.NET Core is a new addition to the Azure App Service that was announced today, supporting both Windows and Linux. On the Linux side, developers get the benefit of container support. \"The main advantage of running it on the Linux option is that you can deploy to App Service using containers,\" Microsoft's announcement explained . \nMicrosoft Azure represents one good reason why Microsoft's professed love for Linux may fall into the \"true love\" category. Essentially, Azure is how Microsoft monetizes Linux. \nThe Azure love was characterized by Steve Guggenheimer, a Microsoft corporate vice president, who recounted Microsoft's many recent Linux contributions in an announcement today . \n\"These recent announcements are the latest of many investments Microsoft has made over the past several years to make Azure an open and flexible cloud platform, with deep and broad support for open source tools and technologies,\" Guggenheimer stated. \"In fact, nearly one in three Azure virtual machines are running Linux today and 60% of the images in the Azure Marketplace are Linux-based.\" \nGuggenheimer's one-in-three Azure Linux virtual machine statistic is up from the one-in-five figure that was announced last year by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. \nMicrosoft's Linux collaborations have been piling up in recent years. The company delivered . NET Core 1.0 as open source code . It enabled the Linux Bash shell to run on natively on Windows 10. It released PowerShell as open source code for Linux and Mac. In addition, Linux distro provider Red Hat even has a team located on Microsoft's Redmond campus headquarters. Microsoft now claims to be \"a leading open source contributor on GitHub,\" an open source code repository. \nMicrosoft isn't the only cloud service provider that sees reasons to embrace alternative platforms. Today Google announced that it has joined the .NET Foundation and will participate as part of its Technical Steering Group. \n\"We're excited to work with the industry to contribute to .NET as an excellent open platform for developers in the enterprise,\" Google explained in its announcement, adding that \".NET is a key component in the modern enterprise, and the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) team has worked hard to ensure that .NET has first-class support on Google's infrastructure, including excellent infrastructure for Windows .\" \nThe .NET Foundation, in an announcement, described Google as \"one of the most active contributors outside of Microsoft\" to its efforts over the last two years. Google is also fostering ECMA standardization for C#, it added. \nThe .NET Foundation also noted contributions from Samsung, which joined the Technical Steering Group in June. Samsung recently added .NET Core support for its Tizen operating system, along with Visual Studio tools support for Tizen, which is used in Internet of Things types of devices.

      "title": "Microsoft Releases SQL Server 2016 SP1",
      "text": "11/16/2016 \nMicrosoft today announced that the first service pack for SQL Server 2016 is now available. \nThe company announced the availability on stage at its Connect() developer conference, currently being held in New York, and in a follow-up blog. The big change coming to Microsoft's latest SQL Server offering, which was released in June of this year, is a consolidation and addition of advanced features across all versions of the product. \n\"With SQL Server 2016 SP1, we are making key improvements allowing a consistent programmability surface area for developers and organizations across SQL Server editions,\" wrote Parikshit Savjani, senior product manager for the SQL Product Group, in a blog post . \"This will enable you to build advanced applications that scale across editions and cloud as you grow. Developers and application partners can now build to a single programming surface when creating or upgrading intelligent applications, and use the edition which scales to the application's needs.\" \nWhat this means is that with the release of SP1, features like row-level security and dynamic data masking – capabilities only offered in the more-expensive Enterprise version -- will be available in its Standard, Wev, LocalDB and Express versions. Paying for the upgraded versions of SQL Server 2016 will now only grant users better performance and compatibility with specific hardware. \nAlong with the uniform feature set among all versions, Microsoft is also bringing new features and changes to its platform. Some of the highlights include: Database cloning. Microsoft said this new feature was designed for analyzing specific databases by making a copy of the schema, statistics and metadata, and excluding the actual data. The company notes that this feature isn't made to clone an existing database for production, but for testing and troubleshooting. Create or alter controls . This will allow users to deploy or modify stored procedures, user-defined functions, views and triggers. Microsoft noted that this was one of the most requested feature by the public. USE HINT query option . This new query option will change the query optimizer behavior to take in account nine query level hints, including DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_NESTED_LOOP, FORCE_LEGACY_CARDINALITY_ESTIMATION and DISABLE_PARAMETER_SNIFFING, to name a few. Support for tempdb. SQL Server 2016 SP1 will include an error log message notifying the number, sizes and autogrowth of tempdb files. Improved AlwaysOn latency diagnostics and manual change tracking cleanup. \nThe full set of improved and added features can be found here . \nSQL Server 2016 SP1 will also include a rollup of all the cumulative updates, up to the November release. The service pack can be downloaded directly from Microsoft Download Center . \nIn other SQL Server 2016 news from the Connect() conference, the company announced that its Linux version of SQL Server database software, which entered closed preview in March, is now available for public preview.

      "title": "Microsoft's Phil Spencer Confirms Project Scorpio Will Be More Expensive Than Xbox One S",
      "text": "11/16/16 AT 9:36 PM Close \nMicrosoft’s Project Scorpio console has been described as the most powerful console ever made and that it will be able to deliver true 4K gaming. That is why Xbox head Phil Spencer has confirmed that the Xbox Scorpio will be pricier than the Xbox One S. \n“Scorpio will be a premium console. It will cost more than S, obviously, that’s how we’re building it,” Spencer told LevelUp.Com in a recent interview. “We haven’t announced price points for Scorpio yet, but I want to make sure the investments that we’re putting into the product of Scorpio meets the demands of the higher end customer, and that will be a higher price.” \nSpencer also confirmed that the Xbox One S will be Microsoft’s most affordable console come 2017. This also suggests that the company might be planning a price cut for the Xbox One S when Project Scorpio is launched in fall 2017. Related Stories Project Scorpio To Come WIth Xbox 360 Backwards Compatibility \nSpencer also talked about how customers are now able to pick and choose what console they want to fit their needs and budgets. He pointed out that even though the Xbox one S has already been released, there are still those who would much rather purchase the original model which is now more affordable. That being said, Spencer noted that Project Scorpio is for customers who demand “the most that they can get from a console,” justifying the higher price. \nBoth Sony and Microsoft are now changing its strategies when it comes to their respective gaming consoles. Instead of just releasing a new generation console every few years, both companies are now dedicated to releasing refreshes in a shorter period of time. It also allows both companies to offer two variants of their respective consoles: a regular model and a “premium” model. \nSony’s PlayStation 4 Pro was just released this month and currently sells for $399. The PS4 Pro is able to run games and stream online videos in 4K. Microsoft claims that Project Scorpio will be a lot more powerful than the PS4 Pro even claiming that it will be able to run games in “really true 4K.” \nThe Xbox One S starts at $299 for the 500GB model and caps off at $399 for the 2TB model. It’s possible that Project Scorpio could start at $399 with its price going up for models with bigger storage, as pointed out by Gamepur .

      "text": "Microsoft’s .NET Foundation Now Includes Google   Daniel Fuller \nAlmost anybody who has developed a program for Microsoft Windows or a cross-platform effort involving it before is familiar with the .NET Framework. Most Windows users are even familiar with it, since they have to install it to run a huge number of programs. Back in 2014, Microsoft made the decision to make the framework open-source, with an emphasis on opening up the developer community and making the most of .NET’s cross-platform capabilities. To that end, they created the .NET Foundation . Anybody with their nose in the tech world can tell you that they were practically at war with Google during that time, and to a large extent, that’s still the case. Despite this, it seems that Google has been added to the fold, now part of the .NET Foundation’s “Technical Steering Group”, which essentially means that they will help to shape the platform’s standards, uses, capabilities, and public perception. \nA big part of the decision on Google’s part reportedly boils down to ensuring top-class support for .NET in Google Cloud Platform. The relationship is mutually beneficial in a lot of ways that users will end up seeing, of course; Microsoft will see .NET being developed faster and more broadly with Google’s big manpower and big pockets behind the project, and Google will see wider adoption of their Cloud Platform, which is, ironically enough, currently vying for supremacy against Microsoft’s own Azure cloud service, both specks in the shadow of Amazon Web Services. Even more ironically, extending the capabilities of .NET will mean that Azure sees additional features, and thus wins additional market share. \nSince .NET is cross-platform and is working toward being fully open-source, the possibility of seeing current Windows programs and more full-featured apps for other platforms, especially Google’s Android, Chrome OS, and perhaps Andromeda in the future, is very real. While having cross-platform tools available makes porting between processor architectures easier, it’s not magic; don’t expect to be using AutoCAD or playing the new DOOM on your phone any time soon. Likewise, though this move is definitely one of camaraderie under Nadella and Pichai, Windows 10 users will probably still not be able to use OK Google or Google Now in the notification tray like Chrome used to have any time soon, if ever.

      "text": "Microsoft Tries to Woo EU Over $26 Billion LinkedIn Deal   Tom Dawson \nBack in the Summer, Microsoft shocked the technology world by announcing that they were purchasing the “Facebook for Work” in LindedIn for a whopping $26 Billion in cash. Of course, any large deal such of this is subject to a large amount of scrutiny across the globe, and while Microsoft said back during the Summer that they hoped the deal would close quickly, regulations across the Atlantic in Europe might throw something of a spanner in the works. Microsoft is no stranger to the regulatory powers that the European Union wield, having been the subject of their own antitrust case in the past, and now seem keen to woo regulators in Europe to make sure this big deal goes ahead smoothly. \nMicrosoft has been on something of a PR tour throughout Europe recently, and with huge announcements like the firm even joining the Linux Foundation, it’s obvious that Microsoft is looking to end the year on something of a high. The European Commission might get in the way of this, however, as they have expressed some concerns over the deal between Microsoft and LinkedIn, while the Redmond firm is looking to put these concerns to bed. The Commission will come to a decision on December 6th, and if they decide they need more information, they could end up delaying the deal into 2017. For the European Commission, concerns will no doubt take shape surrounding competition and the fear that, should Microsoft be allowed to buy LinkedIn that they will end up with too much power in the technology space. For Microsoft, owning LinkedIn would allow them to further extend the reach of Office 365 and online connected services, leaving few others with the amount of firepower to compete, or so goes the EU’s reasoning. \nOf course, Microsoft is keen to remind the commission that Facebook has already created a monopoly all their own in the social media space, and that with Microsoft’s brand and infrastructure, together it and LinkedIn could mount some sort of counter-attack against the service. Whether or not the European Commission will go for Microsoft’s flattery is unclear, but we might have to wait until December or even 2017 to find out. Post navigation",

      "text": "OpenAI Adopts Microsoft Azure for AI Research OpenAI Adopts Microsoft Azure for AI Research Microsoft hopes to improve its software through AI research while OpenAI can take full advantage of the Azure cloud. \nMicrosoft and OpenAI have partnered to help promote artificial intelligence. \nThe alliance was announced on Tuesday, promising to use AI to \"tackle some of the world's most challenging problems,\" Redmond's Harry Shum wrote in a blog entry . \n\"We're also excited that OpenAI chose Microsoft Azure as their primary cloud platform, to help advance their research and create new tools and technologies that are only possible with the cloud,\" Shum, executive vice president of the Microsoft AI and Research Group, added. \nBy working together, OpenAI will benefit from Microsoft's Azure cloud computing infrastructure which unlocks access to large-scale AI experiments. Microsoft can in return take advantage of OpenAI's artificial intelligence research to improve key services such as real-time translation and voice and conversation recognition. \nElon Musk's nonprofit research firm was drawn to Azure's open-sourced technology, as well as its Batch, Machine Learning, and Cognitive Toolkit capabilities, according to Redmond. The deal also nets OpenAI early access to the software giant's GPU-powered N-Series Virtual Machines , designed for deep learning and other intensive workloads. \n\"In the coming months we will use thousands to tens of thousands of these machines to increase both the number of experiments we run and the size of the models we train,\" an OpenAI blog announcement said . // Related Articles Microsoft Azure to Keep Renault-Nissan Self-Driving Cars Connected \nThe company, co-founded by Tesla CEO Musk and Y Combinator's Sam Altman, debuted in December , backed by industry heavyweights Ilya Sutskever, Reid Hoffman, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Infosys, and YC Research. In June, the group announced plans for three artificial intelligence projects, including a robot butler . \nMicrosoft this week also launched its Azure Bot Service, a new program that allows developers to easily deploy and manage bots on Azure. \n\"We've made major strides in artificial intelligence just in the past five years, achieving milestones many people who have devoted their lives to the field wouldn't have thought possible,\" Shum wrote. \"Now, we have the opportunity to help our partners and customers use these breakthroughs to achieve their goals.\"",

      "text": "zd ^ | November 16, 2016 | Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols \nPosted on 11/16/2016 7:18:31 PM PST by george76 \nYou read the title correctly. Microsoft just joined the Linux Foundation. \nBelieve it or not, Microsoft has joined The Linux Foundation as a Platinum member. \nNo, this isn't The Onion and it's not April Fool's Day. Microsoft has joined The Linux Foundation. \nMicrosoft announced that it was joining forces with The Linux Foundation at the Microsoft Connect developer event in New York. \nYes, yes I know. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer once said, \"Linux is a cancer\". Yes, Microsoft still forces Android vendors to pay for its bogus Linux patents. And, yes, Microsoft and its cronies are still scheming to replace Munich's Linux desktops with Windows 10. So? \n... \nSo did someone put some LSD in current Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's tea? No. \nMicrosoft has changed. \n... \nWhy has Microsoft done all this? Because, in two words: \"Linux won\". \nIt's only on the desktop that Microsoft is still omnipresent. Windows isn't even the most popular end-user operating system. That honor goes to Android. \nEverywhere else -- clouds, supercomputers, and servers -- it's a Linux world. Microsoft could have tried to fight it and hemorrhage red-ink, or they could embrace it and profit. They chose to make money. \nDon't believe me? Look at Azure. In Microsoft's last quarter, Azure revenue was up 116 percent, with compute usage doubling. What do people run on Azure? More and more they run Linux. One in three server instances on Azure are Linux. I'm counting the days until there's more Linux than Windows Server running on Azure. I won't have that many to count.

      "text": "Mahendra Singh ] NEW DELHI: Microsoft founder Bill Gates said on Wednesday that the government's bold move to demonetise high-value denominations and replace them with new notes with high security features was an important step to move away from the shadow economy to a more transparent economy.Gates said digital transactions would rise dramatically, and, in the next several years, India would become one of the most digitised economies not just by size, but percentage as well.The technology czar and philanthropist urged the government to take steps to ease the expansion of its vast internal market by investing in infrastructure, building efficient markets, addressing land and labour issues, and streamlining tariffs and taxes. \"It is fantastic that you took steps to change the GST, but that is just the beginning,\" he said.Gates argued that India needed to develop an innovation ecosystem to build products for the future and meet the challenges facing the world. \"The world is looking to India not just to solve its problems but to address global challenges through innovation,\" Gates said, delivering a speech for the 'NITI-Lectures series: Transforming India' in the presence of PM Narendra Modi and his Cabinet colleagues.Lauding the government's Aadhaar, Startup In dia, and Swachh Bharat initiatives, Gates said that India was trying to do what had never been done before.He said India had a government that was committed to solving its big problems.Pointing out the Digital India and MyGov initiatives, he said much more could be done to streamline the delivery of public services by investing in the digital infrastructure that enables better planning, performance monitoring, and grievance redressal. Ending his speech, Gates said, \"Ye hai mere mann ki baat.\"Arguing that the government must play the role of an effective policy enabler and regulator so that the private sector contributes to the public good, Gates said that the private sector could be a valuable partner in delivering primary healthcare to the most remote regions, and that public-private partnerships could help build the infrastructure and staffing of healthcare facilities quickly and effectively. He pointed out that health financing was regressive, and availability of care mostly determined by the capacity to pay rather than the burden of disease. He said that if he had a wand and could fix one health issue in India, it would be the malnutrition crisis. Pointing out that India had the largest number of stunted children in the world - 44 million children under the age of 5 - he said that while there were states that had made great progress, there were some regions where malnutrition was the norm, not the exception. Gates argued that besides the huge toll malnutrition took on children, it was also harmful to the economy if left unaddressed.",

      "text": " 24 AM EST Nvidia (NVDA) Pops on Microsoft (MSFT) Deal, Here’s the Next Surprise   Nvidia (NVDA) Pops on Microsoft (MSFT) Deal, Here’s the Next Surprise Written by Ophir Gottlieb PREFACE Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has broken out to new all-time highs on what appears to be a ‘surprise’ to Wall Street from its cloud business potential. I’ll save you the suspense, there’s another 'surprise’ for Nvidia on the way. NVIDIA CORPORATION: MOVING ON UP Nvidia is our number one spotlight Top Pick and has nearly tripled since we added it in January of this year for $32.22. Today, the stock broke all-time highs yet again, this time on news of partnership with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). \"On Tuesday, the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant announced a partnership with NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) to accelerate AI in the enterprise, with the use of Microsoft’s commercial cloud platform Azure serving as the hub.\" Source: Investopedia Now, people will write articles about artificial intelligence (AI) and many will have no idea what the actual technology is. Nvidia Corporation is up on the day, and is the best performing stock in the S&P 500 and very well may be the next Intel because this company understands the science and mathematics behind end-to-end machine learning and AI better than anyone else, or close to it. NVIDIA 1-YR STOCK CHART This partnership with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is just one of dozens, if not hundreds, where technology companies are realizing that there’s Nvidia, and basically, no one else. In a premium article posted by Barron’s today, MKM Partners specifically called out Nvidia as 'ready for artificial intelligence’ and then specifically called out AMD as not ready. NEXT 'SURPRISE’ While the investing public is now in utter shock that Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will be playing a huge role in cloud computing, something we at CML Pro joyfully pointed out a year ago, I can already tell you the next breaking news: Nvidia is going to power genomics, biotechnology, life sciences and health care. We dedicated an entire dossier to this segment NVIDIA More Reach. In a study from eLIFE we learned that automation could be used to reduce the cost of drug discovery by approximately 70%. In an article from the Huffington Post we get this: \"It’s an approach that a number of companies are taking to market. For instance, London based start-up Benevolent. AI utilizes complex AI to look for patterns in the scientific literature. They have already managed to identify two potential drug targets for Alzheimer’s that has already attracted the attention of pharmaceutical companies.\" Source: Investopedia We could go on and on about how the rate of drug attrition due to clinical trial failures has risen substantially and how most scientists now are most excited about data-driven strategies which are broadly applicable to many drug discovery methods. Here is a final piece of the story today with Microsoft (note the added emphasis): \"In a statement, the two tech giants pointed out that artificial intelligence has a place in almost every environment, regardless of market. Industries such as health care, life sciences, energy, financial services, automotive and manufacturing are benefiting from deeper insight on extreme amounts of data, the company’s said.\" Source: Investopedia We maintain our Spotlight Top Pick status for Nvidia. The author is long shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and has no position in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). WHY THIS MATTERS Our research sits side-by-side with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and the rest on professional terminals. Of our Top Picks, Nvidia is up 180% since we added it. Ambarella is up 70% since we added it. Relypsa was taken over for a 60% gain and we are already up on Twitter when we added it to Top Picks for $15.60. To become a CML Pro member it’s just $19 a month with no contract. It’s that easy – you cancel at any time, instantly. Each company in our 'Top Picks’ portfolio is the single winner in an exploding thematic shift like self-driving cars, health care tech, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, drones, biotech and more. For a limited time we are offering CML Pro for $19/mo. with a lifetime guaranteed rate.

      "text": "Microsoft Joins The Linux Foundation as a Platinum Member Microsoft is part of a select bunch of platinum members The company open sourced Visual Studio Code recently Google is joining the .NET foundation \nAt its Connect event on Wednesday, Microsoft announced it was joining The Linux Foundation as a platinum member. The news came as a surprise to many considering Microsoft has built itself on closed-source proprietary software, which stands as an antithesis to everything Linux has stood for. \nMicrosoft has been contributing to Linux for several years, according to Ars Technica , and Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin welcomed the company’s decision: “Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people.” \n( Also see: Microsoft Takes on Oracle, Opening Up Database Software to Linux ) \nIt’s clear that the current top executives at Microsoft – under CEO Satya Nadella – are trying to fully embrace open source with the new move, in what marks a clear departure from the old administration. Microsoft has open sourced Visual Studio Code and the JavaScript Engine used in Microsoft Edge, in recent times. And in March, Microsoft even partnered with Canonical to bring Ubuntu to Windows 10 . By joining The Linux Foundation, Microsoft has joined a premium club of sorts, amongst the likes of Cisco, Fujitsu, HP, Huawei, IBM, Intel, NEC, Oracle, Qualcomm, and Samsung.\n( Also see: Microsoft Develops a Linux-Based Operating System - Azure Cloud Switch ) \nGoogle had its own bit of surprising news, too. The search giant is joining the .NET foundation, which oversees .NET languages that are a major competitor to Java, which Google uses on Android. Traditionally, Google has shown minimal interest in .NET but it now plans to support .NET in Google Cloud Platform. \nThe other big news for Microsoft was supposed to be Visual Studio for macOS, which the company ended up spoiling by revealing it on their Developers Network.",

Through the Microsoft CityNext initiative, Microsoft and CTS will help cities do “new with less,” by combining the power of technology with innovative solutions to connect governments, businesses and citizens with services that increase efficiencies, reduce costs, foster a more sustainable environment and cultivate thriving communities. Cubic and Microsoft’s partnership for the CityNext initiative will be on display at the Smart Cities Expo held in Barcelona, November 15-17. \nCubic Transportation Systems (CTS), a business unit of Cubic Corporation ( NYSE:CUB ), today announced its participation in Microsoft CityNext, a global initiative empowering cities, businesses and citizens to reimagine their futures and cultivate vibrant communities. Through the Microsoft CityNext initiative, Microsoft and CTS will help cities do “new with less,” by combining the power of technology with innovative solutions to connect governments, businesses and citizens with services that increase efficiencies, reduce costs, foster a more sustainable environment and cultivate thriving communities. Cubic and Microsoft’s partnership for the CityNext initiative will be on display at the Smart Cities Expo held in Barcelona, November 15-17. \nNextCity™ is Cubic’s coordinated framework for building a smarter tomorrow in the world’s urban centers where increasing populations are resulting in greater traffic congestion, frustrated travelers and lessened productivity – contradicting the very economic excitement cities were designed to inspire. NextCity integrates all travel information and payment, customer experience as well as operations and analytics in the region for all modes of transportation – and the Microsoft Azure cloud platform provides the hosting environment that manages the back office data from participating agencies. \n“Cubic and Microsoft have been working at full speed for several months to introduce our alliance to existing and potential customers, and we have secured projects in North America and Australia,” said Matt Cole, president of Cubic Transportation Systems. “The first is part of our contract with the Miami-Dade County’s Department of Transportation and Public Works to modernize the Cubic-supplied EASY Card revenue management system, including migration of their back office to Microsoft’s Azure.” \nCubic also has an agreement with the University of Melbourne in Australia to create the first urban laboratory supporting testing and implementation of connected transport in a real-world and dynamic environment, along with the critical urban analytics that drive change. Cubic’s solution is integrated with Azure, and this will help empower governments and the wider transportation industry to examine different mobility and transport scenarios in preparing for future smart cities. \nLeveraging a broad portfolio of familiar and security-enhanced consumer-to-business software, partner solutions, devices and services and Microsoft’s history of successful education and social programs, Microsoft CityNext is a collective effort that helps cities anticipate and plan for these changes and challenges, enabling them to meet citizens’ needs, thrive economically and embrace modernity. \n“We’re thrilled to partner with Cubic on Microsoft CityNext. Microsoft prioritizes a people- and partner-first approach across all our initiatives, and this initiative is no different,” said Trudy Norris-Grey, managing director, business development, Worldwide Public Sector, Microsoft. “While cities are feeling the strain from economic challenges, Microsoft CityNext ushers in innovative technology solutions to create opportunities for cities and their citizens, enabling them to accomplish what they never thought possible. We’re inspired by our diverse partner ecosystem and know that working together we can help cities realize their full potential.” \nAttendees of Smart Cities Expo can visit Cubic and Microsoft in Stand D400 at the Gran Via Exhibition Centre in Barcelona, Spain. Follow Cubic Transportation Systems at @CubicTS on Twitter and join the conversation on social media with #NextCity, #MSFTCityNext and #SCEWC16. \nAbout Microsoft CityNext \nMicrosoft CityNext is a global people-first initiative harnessing all the ideas, energy and expertise of a city's people to create modern, healthy, safe, well-educated and sustainable cities for the future.

      "text": "Nvidia's ( NVDA ) spectacular earnings and guidance last week provided good evidence that the GPU leader is on its way to making the powering of artificial intelligence workloads a 10-figure annual business.\nSince then, it hasn't wasted time announcing moves that grow its AI ecosystem and could help keep hungry rivals at bay.\nOn Monday, Nvidia and IBM ( IBM ) announced the latter is rolling out a software toolkit called IBM PowerAI for IBM servers containing Nvidia's Tesla accelerator cards, which are widely used to handle a popular type of AI known as deep learning.\nIBM also rolled out a new server, the Power S822LC, that's optimized for AI and other high-performance computing (HPC) workloads: It pairs Big Blue's mammoth Power8 CPUs with Tesla accelerators and Nvidia's NVLink high-speed GPU interconnect.\nThat day, Nvidia also announced it's teaming with Microsoft ( MSFT ) on a solution that lets businesses create AI workloads by using Microsoft's Cognitive Toolkit software on systems containing Tesla GPUs. The solution is available both via Microsoft's Azure public cloud platform, and for corporate data centers through Nvidia's Tesla-powered DGX-1 HPC system.\nAnd on Tuesday, Nvidia and Microsoft disclosed Azure server virtual machines (VMs) that feature Tesla GPUs are now generally available to Azure cloud computing users, four months after launching in preview mode. This comes less than two months after Amazon ( AMZN ) unveiled cloud computing VMs that support up to 16 Tesla GPUs.",

REUTERS/Stephen Lam \nBlack Friday is the best day in the entire year to shop for electronic devices and gadgets for these products are one of the most superbly discounted commodities after Thanksgiving Day. When it comes to tech-related shopping, Microsoft is definitely one brand on everyone's shopping list. \nIt's a good thing the American software giant has announced its commitment to participate in this year's Black Friday shopping craze by rolling out its discount offers and deals on a wide range of products beginning on midnight of Nov. 24. As such, shoppers won't have to wait for Black Friday to get their hands on amazing offers and deals. \nPer Fox News , its popular Xbox One game console will be offered at the most affordable prices. For instance, the company is offering a $50 price cut on the 1 TB Xbox One or the Xbox One S bundle, both of which are initially offered at $299 from Nov. 20 to 23. Additionally, Microsoft has another $50 discount for those who will buy either the Xbox One or Xbox One S bundle with a price of $249 should they choose to purchase within the Nov. 24–28 period.

The Surface Pro 4 with Intel Core i5 and 256 GB solid-state drive is offered for $999 which is a huge drop in price considering that it is regularly sold at $1,400. Another Surface Pro 4 variety, this time with 128 GB SSD, will go on sale for $799, with a discount of about $200. Meanwhile, the first-generation Surface Book is up for grabs for $1,499. \nCome Black Friday, expect Microsoft to add more to the list of deals, more particularly for gadget accessories and peripherals.

      "text": "SEATTLE -- Microsoft has joined the Linux Foundation, the latest sign that the software giant is embracing open-source technologies it formerly treated with hostility.\nThe foundation helps advise the development of the Linux and other software tools built on open-source terms that allow the public to freely use and modify software. Microsoft on Wednesday said it had joined the foundation on its most expensive tier of corporate membership, alongside the likes of Intel and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Linux, which former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer once called a cancer, was for years one of Microsoft's biggest rivals. The free-to-use operating system was seen for a time as the primary threat to expensive, proprietary Windows.\nWindows won the battle for the personal computer but didn't fare so well in the broader debate about the value of open-source versus proprietary technology.\nLinux-derived Android dominates the smartphone market, and open-source tools are a force in cloud-computing technologies. Many software startups favor open-source software by default.\nMicrosoft teams plugging away on developer tools and server software, realms heavily influenced by Linux, broke with the company line during the last several years in pushing greater involvement with the open-source community.\nWhen Satya Nadella, previously Microsoft's server and tools chief, was named company chief executive in early 2014, the tone shifted companywide. Microsoft, Nadella said at an event in October 2014, loves Linux.\nThe company, headquartered outside Seattle, has since released elements of its own software under open-source terms and announced a version of its database management software, SQL Server, for Linux, among other steps.\nGitHub, an online developer community and repository for software projects, said in September that there were more Microsoft employees contributing to open-source projects than representatives of any other single company.\n(c)2016 The Seattle Times\nVisit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment",

Photo: Jacky Naegelen/Reuters \nMicrosoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26 billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said yesterday, as the US software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal. \nThe move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week. \nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by December 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation. Microsoft sees competition from social network Facebook and wants regulators to take that into account \nMicrosoft declined to comment. The LinkedIn acquisition will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn makes most of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nUS rival Salesforce, which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn, has warned of the threat to innovation and competition and urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before clearing the deal. \nMicrosoft, however, sees competition from social network Facebook and wants regulators to take that into account, people familiar with the matter said. « Italy, five others at risk of breaking EU budget rules  ",

      "title": "Russia Files Lawsuit Against Microsoft For Shady Business Practises",
      "text": "by Sean Adl-Tabatabai \nRussia has filed a lawsuit against Microsoft for its shady business practises against customers using Windows. \nRussia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) filed the suit after receiving a complaint from Kaspersky Lab, Russia’s leading antivirus company. \nMicrosoft is accused of forcing customers to use its Windows Defender antivirus software, which Russia say gives Microsoft an unfair advantage. \n“ Microsoft is the developer of Windows Defender antivirus software, which turns on automatically if a third-party’s software has not adapted in time to Windows 10, and this is an unjustified advantage for Microsoft ,” FAS deputy director Anatoly Golomolzin says. \nRbth.com reports: \nAlso, Kaspersky said Microsoft reduced the adaptation period of third-party antivirus software for OC Windows 10 from two months to six days. The Russian company is also preparing to file a complaint against Microsoft with the European Commission, said Yulia Krivosheina, a Kaspersky spokesperson. \n“Microsoft has created a situation in which competing antivirus producers, including Kaspersky Lab, are unable to completely fulfill their obligations to customers, which leaves the latter helpless, limits their choices and leads to third-party producers incurring financial losses,” said Kaspersky’s general director, Igor Chekunov. \nMeanwhile, Microsoft said it has not received an official letter from FAS, and insists that it is innocent. “Microsoft confirms that it adheres to the principles elaborated in the antimonopoly law,” said a Microsoft representative. \nOther antivirus software producers, however, support the complaints against Microsoft. \n“The problem concerns the whole antivirus software market, where free competition is limited,” said Denis Mateev, head of ESET’s office in Russia and the CIS. “Microsoft promotes its products by using its dominant position on the market, which can lead to users being deprived of a right to choose the best software.” \nBoris Sharov, general director of the Russian company, Dr. Web, said that whenever Windows 10 updates are installed on a computer any antivirus software that was previously there, including Dr. Web, “disappear without a trace,” and are replaced by Windows Defender. \nThe complaint against Microsoft is not the first antitrust case in Russia’s IT industry. In February 2015, FAS filed a lawsuit against Google that was based on a complaint from Yandex and which accused the American company of limiting the promotion of services on the Explay, Fly and Prestigio Android devices. \nIn September 2015, FAS recognized that Google Inc. and Google Ireland Ltd had violated the Competition Protection Law. Google was hit with a fine of 438 million rubles ($6.7 million), and an additional penalty of 1 million rubles (more than $15,000) for late payment of the fine.",

      "text": "SEATTLE -- Microsoft has joined the Linux Foundation, the latest sign that the software giant is embracing open-source technologies it formerly treated with hostility.\nThe foundation helps advise the development of the Linux and other software tools built on open-source terms that allow the public to freely use and modify software. Microsoft on Wednesday said it had joined the foundation on its most expensive tier of corporate membership, alongside the likes of Intel and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Linux, which former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer once called a cancer, was for years one of Microsoft's biggest rivals. The free-to-use operating system was seen for a time as the primary threat to expensive, proprietary Windows.\nWindows won the battle for the personal computer but didn't fare so well in the broader debate about the value of open-source versus proprietary technology.\nLinux-derived Android dominates the smartphone market, and open-source tools are a force in cloud-computing technologies. Many software startups favor open-source software by default.\nMicrosoft teams plugging away on developer tools and server software, realms heavily influenced by Linux, broke with the company line during the last several years in pushing greater involvement with the open-source community.\nWhen Satya Nadella, previously Microsoft's server and tools chief, was named company chief executive in early 2014, the tone shifted companywide. Microsoft, Nadella said at an event in October 2014, loves Linux.\nThe company, headquartered outside Seattle, has since released elements of its own software under open-source terms and announced a version of its database management software, SQL Server, for Linux, among other steps.\nGitHub, an online developer community and repository for software projects, said in September that there were more Microsoft employees contributing to open-source projects than representatives of any other single company.\n(c)2016 The Seattle Times\nVisit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com\n ",

Microsoft makes 'commitments' to EU over LinkedIn deal 0 Share: \nMicrosoft in June bought professional-networking site LinkedIn for $26 billion. Photo by Sergei Konkov/TASS \nMicrosoft made commitments to EU antitrust regulators about its $26 billion acquisition of professional-networking site LinkedIn, the European Commission said Wednesday. \nThe commission declined to provide further details. Microsoft declined to comment. \nThe concessions come after EU regulators expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week, reported Reuters . The commission will rule on the deal by December 6. \nIn June, Microsoft announced plans to buy LinkedIn for $26.2 billion , its biggest-ever acquisition. For Microsoft, the LinkedIn deal furthers its plan to become an essential provider to businesses of cloud-based services, including its Office 365. Salesforce was also reportedly interested in making a bid for LinkedIn. \nMicrosoft submitted its LinkedIn acquisition for EU regulatory approval in October , after already receiving approval from authorities in the US, Canada and Brazil. Its up to the EU Commission to either approve the deal, along with these new commitments, or open a full investigation into Microsoft's purchase. ",

Everyone from the biggest names in tech, like Apple and Google, to the smallest startups are focusing on making software smarter. The vision is making devices think and behave like humans. \nOpenAI is a nonprofit research organization co-founded by Musk, Y Combinator's Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and former Google research scientist Ilya Sutskever. The company said it will use Microsoft's Azure cloud computing technology to run \"most\" of its large-scale experiments. \n\"One of the most important factors for accelerating our progress is accessing more and faster computers; this is particularly true for emerging AI technologies like reinforcement learning and generative models ,\" OpenAI said.

Microsoft makes 'commitments' to EU over LinkedIn deal 0 Share: \nMicrosoft in June bought professional-networking site LinkedIn for $26 billion. Photo by Sergei Konkov/TASS \nMicrosoft made commitments to EU antitrust regulators about its $26 billion acquisition of professional-networking site LinkedIn, the European Commission said Wednesday. \nThe commission declined to provide further details. Microsoft declined to comment. \nThe concessions come after EU regulators expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week, reported Reuters . The commission will rule on the deal by December 6. \nIn June, Microsoft announced plans to buy LinkedIn for $26.2 billion , its biggest-ever acquisition. For Microsoft, the LinkedIn deal furthers its plan to become an essential provider to businesses of cloud-based services, including its Office 365. Salesforce was also reportedly interested in making a bid for LinkedIn. \nMicrosoft submitted its LinkedIn acquisition for EU regulatory approval in October , after already receiving approval from authorities in the US, Canada and Brazil. Its up to the EU Commission to either approve the deal, along with these new commitments, or open a full investigation into Microsoft's purchase. ",

      "title": "Building Apps and Games for Xbox One Using UWP Mobile",
      "text": "For my sins, I was asked back to FutureDecoded again this year to give a talk on the Microsoft UWP platform, specifically about bringing games to the XboxOne using UWP.  By all accounts, the session went well (especially as there was standing room only by the time the talk started). With it being just two days in the London ExCeL exhibition center, not everyone who wanted to make it could, in fact even some people were contacting me on the day saying they were in other sessions at that time but wanted more info.\nSo for everyone who couldn’t make it on the day or missed the session (or for those wanting a recap), I’ve recorded the session at home and published it on my “ Darkside of MonoGame ” Youtube channel. (I just have to hope my MonoGame friends will forgive me for featuring Unity on there for a bit\nYou might also ask “Why all the Fuss?”. Well, the answer is simple, Microsoft just opened up the XboxOne to UWP developers, allowing any retail XboxOne to become a development machine and test / deploy and publish UWP projects to the XboxOne Store.  It’s like Christmas has come again for those of us who remember the Xbox Live Indie Game platform and the thrill of writing your own games and running them on your home Xbox.\nJust What Is UWP? \nI’ve posted a few times about the UWP platform, but to recap, UWP is Microsoft’s latest endeavor to make it even easier for developers to be able to publish on Windows platforms. So much so, that now you only need one project to be able to deploy on to all of their Windows 10 platforms, this includes:\nWindows 10 desktop Windows 10 Mobile Xbox (supported) IoT devices Surface Hub HoloLens Plus, any other devices that Microsoft decides to roll out on to from now on.\nIt pretty much sounds like a multi-platform dream, and it certainly is.  But how does UWP handle all the different variations on its platform? Each device is different and has its own unique characteristics. The answer, in this case, is “Extensions”:\n\nAs you might expect, Windows 10 has a single “core” which runs on all devices, in exactly the same way.  Then for those little extra’s, the UWP platform provides an “Extension” component that is specific to each platform.  However, these extensions are also expressed on all the other platforms, so your code doesn’t break and you write the same code as if you were writing for them all.  Where a device doesn’t support a certain feature (say the Holographic API on an Xbox), then the code simply does nothing, it doesn’t error, it doesn’t crash, your code still works but nothing actually happens. For those platforms with that feature, lights start shining, the bells ring and the choir sings out with joyful praise.\nAlso as part of this “Extension” framework, Microsoft gives you the ability to test if a feature is available or not, allowing you to write different code depending on whether the feature is active, like if you want to use a devices accelerometer if it has one, or use a virtual joystick on a desktop with a touch screen, or fall back to keyboard if hat isn’t available.  Sure, there is a bit of thought to go in to building for “Any” device but that is the trade-off for building one solution.\nBut What About the Games? \nWhen we start looking at building games under UWP, there is a lot of support (that is constantly growing) from third parties. As you can see most of the major engines and frameworks already support the Universal platform out of the box, making it even easier to publish your game as a UWP app.\nStill not see any engine or feature you like, then there is always the ultimate fallback:\n\nUnder the hood, UWP Games are just a DirectX surface and you can write games using native DirectX in either C# or C++, there are even Visual Studio Templates “out of the box” for UWP as well.\nGetting Started With UWP on Xbox \nNow that UWP apps can be deployed / tested and run by anyone with a Retail Xbox, we can go wild and try out our own games to see how they run on the big screen.  Once you lick all the bugs and get it just right, you can publish that game “as is” to the Xbox Store. Well, once you have your project accepted by the ID@Xbox team (which is even easier for UWP developers now)\nSo long as you have a Windows 10 PC and a retail Xbox, you're good to go as everything else is free, the tools, the software, even the ability to switch your retail XboxOne over to a UWP dev kit. All from the comfort of your own home (or hotel room with free wifi)\nThere is one other caveat, that you need to also have a Windows Store developer account.  This normally costs about £19 for an individual, a little more for a company account.  You can either get this yourself, or when you are accepted by ID, you will get this account plus a load of other software completely FREE. Up to you.\nP.S. If you have an MSDN account, you also get a code for FREE, check your benefits.\nSetting Up Your Development Environment \nOnce you have everything ready, getting started couldn’t be simpler and there are only a few short steps. As the slide above shows, you can get up and running with your first project deployed in just 5 Minutes. (if you're using Unity, it might take a little longer )\nIn short, what you need to do is:\n1. Install the “Dev Mode Activation” app on to your Xbox from the Xbox Store. \n2. Launch the “Dev Mode Activation” app. You will be presented with a code and a URL. Navigate to the URL on your PC, sign in with your Windows Account (same one used with your Xbox Live Gamertag) and enter the code to register the Xbox to your Microsoft Account\n3. Once complete, your Xbox will automatically refresh and then ask you to restart.\nThis will now boot your Xbox in to UWP developer mode with a completely separate sandbox inside your Xbox.\nYour Retail settings / apps are still safe on your Xbox, you just can’t access them from developer mode.  You can return to Retail mode at any time.\nOnce you have signed in to your Xbox using your Microsoft account, you can launch the Developer Portal app on the Xbox.\nThis shows you all the apps / games installed plus a ton of other developer details.\nTake note of the Tools IP in case Visual Studio doesn’t automatically detect it.\nThe first time you connect to your Xbox from Visual Studio (selecting the deployment as remote and selecting the Xbox, as shown here) you will be asked for a code to pair the Xbox.\nYou get this code from the Developer Portal on the Xbox in the “Pair with Visual Studio” section.\nVisual Studio and the Xbox must be signed in using the same Microsoft account you activated with. \nDone.  You should now be able to deploy and run games from Visual Studio on your Xbox.\nYou can also see debugging information from your Xbox (providing your local network supports it) while the game is running.\nJust make sure you Run in “Release” or “Master” mode when looking at performance issues as the debugger has an impact.\n\nAnd that’s it. You are up and running.  The security of the setup ensures that you (and only you) can connect to your Xbox in dev mode and deploy apps, so long as you use the same Microsoft account for everything.  You can still sign in other gamers using their gamertags for local multi-player (although you can’t grant gamerscore ). If you also are a member of ID and have access to to the Live SDK and services, you can also test networked multi-player and all the other Live services.\nWhat’s Next? \n Right, so you have your project ready, plans are afoot and you know what you either want to build or have a tech-demo (or even a full project) ready.  To get ready to be published on the Xbox and Windows Store (for games) you need to be registered with the awesome ID@Xbox program. in the past some developers have been a bit disillusioned with the responses to the program but Times have changed . The team has evolved (especially with UWP deploy now coming to light) and it’s now even more streamlined to get access to the program.\nOnce registered and signed up, the ID team are fully behind you, giving you:\nFree software and a Windows Store account Access to all major gaming events Support through the MS Game Developer network Enablement to Xbox Live for access to achievements, networking, leader boards and much more. My recommendation (especially if you have a mobile game already or the beginnings of a desktop app) is to apply just for Windows 10 first, get your project out there in the hands of players and then either publish it as a UWP to Xbox or then also apply for the Xbox tier to build a native game (although check the next section for more detail on that).  Windows 10 has much easier access but has all the same rewards for all ID developers, it also has fewer requirements and certifications to get published (you can’t ship a game that randomly crashes for instance!).\nThe key here is that you are getting your game out as early as possible, getting it in to the hands of players and gaining presence.  I state this in the video but you must be prepared for the amount of footwork you need to put into promoting your game with the general public.  ID will be behind you every step of the way to take your content further (many ID games are now even getting in front of Major Nelson these days, thanks to ID). I will stress, though, expect a lot of work, ID won’t do it for you and you need to be ready to produce high-quality videos, marketing material and make yourself available. At least 80% of the effort in your game will come from the last 20% (as they say).\nIf you want your game to be successful, you need to be out there building presence and touting your game! Only you can promote your game the best way. (But ID will help with guidance and weight) \nKey Differences Between UWP & Native \nTo round this session up and to allay some of the concerns and comments I’ve either heard or been asked about UWP on Xbox, I’ll walk through some of the key differences between publishing UWP on Xbox and going native.\nUWP Projects in short, UWP is simply easier. It’s a friendlier platform and the key benefit is that the single project you build, is also directly shippable on all of Microsoft’s other Windows 10 platforms.\n\nWhile at FutureDecoded , the VISR-VR team showcased an awesome VR project aimed at helping children and adults who suffer from autism called Botanika (it’s also a fun game for anyone btw ).  This game was written in Unity, running as a UWP using the Vive VR setup.  To make it even more amazing, the lead developer spent 10 minutes converting the project over the HoloLens (the night before the event no less) and had it running perfectly. Granted it wasn’t the full scope of the project but all the key elements were there, all now using HoloLens’s gestures to control the game instead of the Vive Controllers.\nGetting Botanika up and running in about 10 minutes on a HoloLens in Unity was an awesome effort Louis! \nWhen publishing UWP games to the Xbox, there are slightly fewer resources to native games (about 70% of resources are available) but there are also fewer certification requirements, meaning less headaches trying to figure out why a controller keeps getting disconnected.  As the demo’s show, there is a LOT you can get done with that 70% (remembering, it’s 70% of a very powerful beast, do not be fooled in to thinking it’s not much)\nNative Development If you get invited into the Xbox Native group, which is a tougher crowd and you need your project to shine, you will be given 2 developer enabled Xbox’s and a couple of years to get your project “finished”.\nA great number of developers are also taking up Microsoft’s offer of getting a “ Preview ” version of their title out even earlier to consumers. Something not offered on other platforms.  Yes, it’s more work but it means you get to build more presence and get feedback direct from your players while building.\nI cannot stress more, just how much extra effort is needed to get a native Xbox game out, apart from the stricter certification requirements (which with some engines, you can run into trouble if it’s the engine causing the issue). Most certification builds take months of testing and validation to get ready.  There are also stricter controls placed on console projects from a ratings perspective (and in some cases, quite costly), IARC hasn’t reached Xbox native yet (like with the Windows Store) but hopefully it will be coming soon.\nThere is also the fact that in a lot of cases, you will need C++ skills (or contract them) to work on the interconnectedness of things, or if you need the utmost performance on the platform.  Although, I’ve known a fair few devs who haven’t had to go down this route but there are always compromises.\nSumming Up \nThe world just got that little bit bigger and if you are already working on a project for Windows 10, the reach of your title has now opened up even more and for very little effort.  If you want to then use the success of your game to then build the “Evolved” edition and build that native later, then you already have a foot in the door and it also becomes easier (although harder from an effort perspective )\nSo, if you want to build one game and ship it on to several platforms at once, then UWP is the answer (yes I know mobile share is small at present but MS is still committed to it ).  You’ll still be able to take it to other platforms later as most engines and frameworks also support more than UWP, so if you architect your project right, the world is your oyster.\nIf you are making games these days, NEVER restrict or limit your dream to one platform. Go BIG, go WILD and get out there!",

      "text": "The Black Friday sale prices for the Microsoft Xbox One game console bundles have been announced. Target, Best Buy, GameStop, Walmart, Costco, Kohl's, Dell and Microsoft have all revealed their best holiday deals, but which ones are the best? ( Xbox ) Advertisement \nThe nation's biggest retailers have revealed their big Black Friday 2016 deals on one of the most popular holiday gift items, Microsoft's Xbox One gaming console. Target, Best Buy, GameStop, Walmart, Costco, Kohl's, Dell and Microsoft itself all have discount prices on various Xbox One bundles, but which retailer has the best sale of all? 2016 Xbox One Bundle Price Drop \nIt has now become a tradition for the most popular gaming consoles, Xbox One S and Sony's PlayStation 4, to be sold in holiday bundles that include at least one game compatible with the purchased console and potentially other add-ons and accessories. Each holiday season, Sony and Microsoft announce the retail price of their popular bundles, which this year comes in at $299, down from last year's standard price of $349. \nThe Black Friday competitive frenzy results in many of the nation's retailers not only discounting the bundle price by $50 but also adding extras and perks of their own to sweeten the pot. Last year, both Target and Walmart outdid their competitors by offering $60 and $30 gift cards on top of the $50 discount that was being offered at other stores, with Target's deal deemed the best of the bunch. Black Friday Xbox One Bundle Deals: Some Better Than Others \nThis year, it looks as if $50 off of the Xbox One S bundles is the standard minimum discount, and that's the best consumers can do at Best Buy , Walmart and GameStop this year. All of those retailers are offering select Minecraft bundles for $249. Costco is offering an additional $10 savings on a Minecraft bundle, bringing the price down to $239 at its stores. \nTarget is once again doing those stores one better by offering either the Minecraft or Battlefield 1 bundles for $249 with a $40 gift card included. While that's not as good as last year's $60 gift card, with the initial bundle price having been lowered by $50 from last year as well, the constructive price of the bundle at Target is now $219 as opposed to $239 in 2015. Best Deal Of The Bunch \nKohl's however, is offering an even lower constructive price of just $175 on the Minecraft bundle by including $75 in Kohl's cash, which can be spent on other items at the store. \nNot to be outdone, Microsoft is offering an online deal of its own for the Minecraft bundle at $249, plus a $25 Microsoft gift card and an additional select game. \nDell has another worthy deal, which includes the Battlefield 1 bundle, extra game Gears Of War 4 plus an additional Xbox One wireless controller at the $249 price. \nSo which is the best of the bunch? If you're looking for the lowest constructive price, go with the Kohl's cash, but if you prefer an additional game and controller, Dell has our vote. Microsoft and Target are certainly worthy runners-up, while Best Buy, Walmart and GameStop come up short this year when compared to their competitor's deals on Microsoft Xbox One S bundles. Happy shopping!  ",

      "text": "Cubic Joins Forces with Microsoft CityNext to Bring Innovation to Cities across the Globe\nCubic Transportation Systems and global public sector initiative enable cities to harness a new era of innovation through a people-first approach\nCubic Transportation Systems (CTS), a business unit of Cubic Corporation (NYSE:CUB) , today announced its participation in Microsoft CityNext, a global initiative empowering cities, businesses and citizens to reimagine their futures and cultivate vibrant communities. Through the Microsoft CityNext initiative, Microsoft and CTS will help cities do “new with less,” by combining the power of technology with innovative solutions to connect governments, businesses and citizens with services that increase efficiencies, reduce costs, foster a more sustainable environment and cultivate thriving communities. Cubic and Microsoft’s partnership for the CityNext initiative will be on display at the Smart Cities Expo held in Barcelona, November 15-17.\nNextCity™ is Cubic’s coordinated framework for building a smarter tomorrow in the world’s urban centers where increasing populations are resulting in greater traffic congestion, frustrated travelers and lessened productivity – contradicting the very economic excitement cities were designed to inspire. NextCity integrates all travel information and payment, customer experience as well as operations and analytics in the region for all modes of transportation – and the Microsoft Azure cloud platform provides the hosting environment that manages the back office data from participating agencies.\n“Cubic and Microsoft have been working at full speed for several months to introduce our alliance to existing and potential customers, and we have secured projects in North America and Australia,” said Matt Cole, president of Cubic Transportation Systems. “The first is part of our contract with the Miami-Dade County’s Department of Transportation and Public Works to modernize the Cubic-supplied EASY Card revenue management system, including migration of their back office to Microsoft’s Azure.”\nCubic also has an agreement with the University of Melbourne in Australia to create the first urban laboratory supporting testing and implementation of connected transport in a real-world and dynamic environment, along with the critical urban analytics that drive change. Cubic’s solution is integrated with Azure, and this will help empower governments and the wider transportation industry to examine different mobility and transport scenarios in preparing for future smart cities.\nLeveraging a broad portfolio of familiar and security-enhanced consumer-to-business software, partner solutions, devices and services and Microsoft’s history of successful education and social programs, Microsoft CityNext is a collective effort that helps cities anticipate and plan for these changes and challenges, enabling them to meet citizens’ needs, thrive economically and embrace modernity.\n“We’re thrilled to partner with Cubic on Microsoft CityNext. Microsoft prioritizes a people- and partner-first approach across all our initiatives, and this initiative is no different,” said Trudy Norris-Grey, managing director, business development, Worldwide Public Sector, Microsoft. “While cities are feeling the strain from economic challenges, Microsoft CityNext ushers in innovative technology solutions to create opportunities for cities and their citizens, enabling them to accomplish what they never thought possible. We’re inspired by our diverse partner ecosystem and know that working together we can help cities realize their full potential.”\nAttendees of Smart Cities Expo can visit Cubic and Microsoft in Stand D400 at the Gran Via Exhibition Centre in Barcelona, Spain.

      "title": "Cubic Joins Forces With Microsoft CityNext To Bring Innovation To Cities Across The Globe",
      "text": "Cubic Transportation Systems (CTS), a business unit of Cubic Corporation (NYSE:CUB) , today announced its participation in Microsoft CityNext, a global initiative empowering cities, businesses and citizens to reimagine their futures and cultivate vibrant communities. Through the Microsoft CityNext initiative, Microsoft and CTS will help cities do \"new with less,\" by combining the power of technology with innovative solutions to connect governments, businesses and citizens with services that increase efficiencies, reduce costs, foster a more sustainable environment and cultivate thriving communities. Cubic and Microsoft's partnership for the CityNext initiative will be on display at the Smart Cities Expo held in Barcelona, November 15-17. \nNextCity™ is Cubic's coordinated framework for building a smarter tomorrow in the world's urban centers where increasing populations are resulting in greater traffic congestion, frustrated travelers and lessened productivity - contradicting the very economic excitement cities were designed to inspire. NextCity integrates all travel information and payment, customer experience as well as operations and analytics in the region for all modes of transportation - and the Microsoft Azure cloud platform provides the hosting environment that manages the back office data from participating agencies. \n\"Cubic and Microsoft have been working at full speed for several months to introduce our alliance to existing and potential customers, and we have secured projects in North America and Australia,\" said Matt Cole, president of Cubic Transportation Systems. \"The first is part of our contract with the Miami-Dade County's Department of Transportation and Public Works to modernize the Cubic-supplied EASY Card revenue management system, including migration of their back office to Microsoft's Azure.\" \nCubic also has an agreement with the University of Melbourne in Australia to create the first urban laboratory supporting testing and implementation of connected transport in a real-world and dynamic environment, along with the critical urban analytics that drive change. Cubic's solution is integrated with Azure, and this will help empower governments and the wider transportation industry to examine different mobility and transport scenarios in preparing for future smart cities.",

Google, in particular, is joining the independent .NET Foundation, becoming an important Microsoft partner for the open platform, despite remaining a key rival in so many markets. “Wednesday’s addition of Google to the .NET Foundation’s Technical Steering Group further reinforces the vibrancy of the .NET developer community as well as Google’s commitment to foster...",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) FILE - In this Oct. 26, 2016 file photo, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addresses a Microsoft media event in New York. Taking a cue from competing online services like Slack, which let workers chat and share information on the job, Microsoft is adding a new program called \"Teams\" to its Office 365 suite of internet productivity software. Analysts say Microsoft is catching up to a trend in which workers increasingly look beyond email and simple document-sharing services to communicate and collaborate. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Microsoft says a newly discovered flaw in its Windows software was used by a hacking group that other researchers have linked to Russia’s government and computer intrusions at the Democratic National Committee. \nThe flaw was detected by researchers at Google, who recently alerted software makers Microsoft and Adobe Systems about vulnerabilities in their programs. Adobe issued a fix for its software last week. Microsoft says it’s testing a patch and will release it next week. \nMicrosoft acknowledged the problem Tuesday, saying only that it affected older versions of Windows and was used by a group called Strontium to target “a specific set of customers.” \nThe security firm Crowdstrike and others have linked Strontium, also known as “Fancy Bear,” to recent attacks on government, media and political targets in several countries. \nFor more business headlines from Jane King at the Nasdaq, watch Daybreak Monday through Friday.

      "text": "Microsoft, the monolithic force in the land of software licensing and exclusivity, has joined the Linux Foundation. Yes, you read that correctly and no, this isn’t a joke.\nAt the company’s Connect conference today in New York, the house that Gates built revealed that it is joining the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. The non-profit organization has three tiers of membership, with platinum being the highest, followed by gold and silver. As a platinum member, Microsoft has committed to donating a minimum of $500,000 annually to the advancement and open source development of many different projects.\nDON’T MISS: Walmart’s pre-Black Friday sale starts right now – here are the best deals so far\nThe announcement is a big deal for both Microsoft and the open source community, but there have been signs that Microsoft was changing its stance on Linux for some time. The company has gradually warmed up to its former nemesis and embraced both Linux software and the community at large in the name of problem solving and collaboration.\nMicrosoft showed its good will by sponsoring events such as Linuxcon, and making things official by becoming a member of the Linux Foundation is definitely a step towards healing old wounds.\nWhat wounds would those be, you ask? Well, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was notoriously anti-Linux throughout his time at the company. In a highly criticized interview with the Chicago Sun-Times in 2001, Ballmer denounced both Linux and the open source movement as a whole.\n“Linux is a cancer that attaches itself, in an intellectual proper sense, to everything it touches,” Ballmer famously claimed. He went on to bash open source licensing, claiming that open source software somehow made all other software worse. So, you can see why it might come as a shock to Linux devotees to see Microsoft writing a half million dollar check to the open source community just 15 years later.\nTrending right now:\nHere’s all the hidden differences between the new MacBook Pros Massive Pokemon Go December update will reportedly bring Pokemon trading and PvP battles Best Buy just released an updated Black Friday ad: Here’s what’s new See the original version of this article on BGR.com",
