      "title": "Amazon Grocery Store Concept to Open in Seattle in Early 2017",
      "text": "Shutterstock photo\nAmazon.com Inc. said Monday it plans to open Amazon Go, its first small-format grocery store, to the public early next year in its hometown of Seattle.\nThe roughly 1,800-square-foot store, which resembles a convenience store-format in a video Amazon released, features artificial intelligence-powered technology that eliminates checkouts and cash registers. Instead, customers scan their phone on a kiosk as they walk in, and Amazon automatically determines what items customers take from the shelves. After leaving the store, Amazon charges their account for the items and sends a receipt.\n\"Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning,\" the company adds.\nGrocery sales may be crucial to Amazon's growth because Americans restock their refrigerators each week, something that could provide opportunities to sell more profitable items alongside cheese and chocolate.\nUntil now, Amazon has centered its grocery strategy around Amazon Fresh, a subscription service that promises quick food delivery for online orders.\nAmazon Go will sell ready-to-eat meals, snack options and grocery staples like bread and milk, according to Amazon. In addition, the store will offer chef-designed \"Amazon Meal Kits,\" which will provide the ingredients to cook a meal for two in a half-hour.\nAmazon says on its website that the new store, located in downtown Seattle near its headquarters, is already open to its employees, and that it will open to the public early next year.\nWrite to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-05-161255ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

      "title": "Amazon just solved the worst part of the grocery store experience (AMZN)",
      "text": "print \nAmazon on Monday unveiled its vision for the future of grocery stores , and retail stores in general: a smart store that knows when you've selected an item, and automatically charges you for your selected items upon leaving the store. There are no cashiers, no registers, and no checkout lines. \nAmazon \nThis concept, called \"Amazon Go,\" is extremely clever — and one of the reasons it sounds so appealing is because it eliminates the worst aspect of the grocery store experience: waiting in line to buy your items. \nThink about any grocery store visit you've had: It can be fun to look at all the food, navigate and browse the aisles, pick various foods and throw them into your cart. It's an adventure! But the food-shopping experience almost always turns sour when you get to the checkout part. Even when there are no lines, the checkout process is slow — you have to look at all the items you selected again as they get scanned — and then you have to pay for everything, sign a receipt, and wait for all of your food to be placed into bags. \nIt takes time, a lot of waiting, and it's generally boring. \nThat's why Amazon Go is a sound concept. There, the whole shopping experience happens on your phone — specifically, you download the Amazon Go app before visiting the store, scan a QR code to get in, and the store recognizes which items you've selected and charges your Amazon account once you've left the store. In this sense, it's kind of like Uber, since initial entry requires using a phone app, and it automatically charges your card once the experience is over — no need to swipe a card and wait for a receipt. \nWe still have many questions about Amazon Go — like how it knows you didn't purchase an item, if you didn't put it back exactly where you found it — but the promise of a checkout-less grocery store experience might be the best idea to come along in awhile. Amazon says the first Go grocery store will open in Seattle in 2017. You can watch the video below to get an idea of what it's like, or check out our walkthrough .

      "text": "\nI am a big fan of Amazon and I’ll tell you why. They like to disrupt shit and they like to do it in ways that benefits me.\nFor starters, you can literally buy anything you want or need (save for transportation, shelter, insurance, or fresh poultry) on Amazon and you can do it without leaving the comfort of your house. I love my house. I love comfort. I love people bringing everything I need directly to my doorstep. Real pleasure.\nBut Amazon knows that despite our best efforts, sometimes we need to leave the house to buy shit. It is a sad, disgusting fact of life. Amazon also knows that hell is other people. That’s why they are creating Amazon Go , the completely human-free, in-store shopping experience. No cashiers, no dipshits asking if they can help you find someone, no nothing. You walk in, you find all your shit, then you walk out. There isn’t even self-checkouts. Amazon is so smart they already know what you took. And if they don’t, that is on them, Bro. That’s their fuck up, not yours.\nAll joking aside (although I wasn’t really joking), this technology can eventually change the retail game as we know it. And if Amazon deploys these Amazon Go stores near Walmart and other competitors, I think those guys are fucked. \n\n",

      "text": "Image courtesy Amazon AWS Snowball Edge \nLast year Amazon announced Snowball, a ruggedized data transfer appliance. Amazon sends you a hardware box that can be loaded with up to 80 TBs of data. It’s encrypted and sent to AWS where the data is uploaded to the cloud. Customers can also use Snowballs to ship data out of the cloud in a reverse process. The next generation of Snowball announced this year is Snowball Edge, which is like the Snowball but adds more storage (up to 100 TB) and some compute functionality to the box. It can filter, clean, analyze and organize data as it gets loaded into Snowball Edge. The idea behind this is to use Snowball in some rugged environment (on a ship or in the middle of a desert, for example) where there may not be internet connectivity, Snowball Edge can store data which can later be uploaded to the cloud. Snowball Edge can also be clustered together in a rack formation. \nPricing and availability Snowball Edge’s are available now for $300 each.",

It is expected to open to the public in early 2017. \nThe e-commerce powerhouse has also been dipping its toe into the physical realm. It has opened three bookstores in California, Oregon and Washington with traditional check outs. Two more are in the works in Illinois and Massachusetts. ",

      "text": "26 Mins Ago SHARES \nAmazon 's latest plan to disrupt the retail industry could finalize the fusion of online and in-store consumer experiences. \nThe tech giant announced its new venture — a corner store called Amazon Go — Monday. The 1,800 square-foot store in Seattle has no registers. Instead, shoppers scan into the store with their free Amazon Go app, shop as normal and leave the store with the items billed to their Amazon.com account. Consumers don't even need to scan items individually. \nThe store, which will open to the public in early 2017, could be an inflection point for the long impending marriage of online and in-person retail. The experiences are becoming increasingly similar, said Lisa Falzone, CEO of Revel Systems , a point-of-sales company that also helps retailers with inventory, purchase orders and analytics. \n\"You see Amazon opening up brick-and-mortar shops. You see brick-and-mortars going online,\" Falzone said. \"It's all becoming one.\" show chapters 1 Hour Ago | 04:07 \nRevel recently released a report that revealed 64 percent of consumers think it's important for physical retailers to have a strong online presence, and 93 percent say they research an item online before buying it in person at a store. \nWhile people still shop in person more often than they do online, consumers have increasingly high expectations for stores' technological capacities. Nearly half of the surveyed shoppers said that all retailers — online or brick-and-mortar — should offer delivery. More than one in four consumers want to use Apple Pay or Samsung Pay at checkout over traditional forms of payment. \nAs Amazon grows its investment in experiences at the nexus of e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retail, the merging of the online and in-store retail industries is likely to continue. The tech giant has previously launched a network of bookstores and pop-up shops , as well as the Amazon Dash Button. \nRevel Systems advises brick-and-mortar retailers to shore up their online presence to remain competitive. Soon enough, it could be online retailers getting the advice to build a physical presence to maintain their edge. \nMore from The Pulse:",

It’s similar to the kind of technology used in self-driving cars. \nTo start shopping, you use a free app to scan yourself in when you enter the store. \nThe app keeps a running tab of what you pull off the shelves. Shortly after you leave, Amazon will charge your account for the items and send you a receipt. Amazon \nAt the moment, Amazon Go seems more like a corner store or convenience store than a full-fledged grocery store. It offers an array of ready-to-eat, grab-and-go meals prepared by Amazon Go’s staff, plus items such as bread, cheese, milk and chocolate. It also sells Amazon Meal Kits, which include ingredients to cook a meal for two at home in under 30 minutes. \nThe store is currently in its beta phase, and only Amazon employees can shop there for the time being. It will open to the public in early 2017. \nAmazon Go seems to be the next step in Amazon’s quest to expand its influence in the grocery business, as well as its brick and mortar presence. In 2007, the company rolled out the grocery delivery service Amazon Fresh , and in 2015, it opened a physical bookstore .

Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow.

The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. \nThe-CNN-Wire",

      "title": "Microsoft Home Hub uses your PC as a centre for the entire family",
      "text": "By James Walker 2 mins ago in Technology The success of Amazon's Echo and rival smart speakers and home automation hubs has created rumours that Microsoft is planning something similar. According to a new report, the company's actually creating something more ambitious, based on your current PC. Microsoft has previously been thought to be developing something called \"Home Hub\" that would integrate with Windows 10. Little has been heard of the feature, except that it's supposed to compete with voice-activated smart home hubs like the Amazon Echo and Google Home . Last week, Windows Central published a report claiming to reveal Home Hub's identity and purpose. According to the site's sources, it isn't a true Echo rival. Instead, it’s a software-based experience that will let you transform your existing computer into something similar to an Echo. Home Hub is a special mode coming to Windows 10 that lets anyone use your PC without a password. The aim is to create a unified interface that an entire family can use. There's no need to sign-in or authenticate yourself. Anyone can walk up to the PC and use its basic functions through voice control. Home Hub will also allow access to shared family documents, apps, bookmarks, calendars and photos. The family account will be \"always logged in\" so you can use the PC immediately. If you're using the Home Hub mode and you want to access your private data, Windows Hello can authenticate you in an instant, using your face or iris, and reveal information from your account. When you're done, you sign out and the Home Hub account is ready for another person to use. This is the kind of context-aware functionality that the Amazon Echo and Google Home currently lack. The latter in particular has been criticised for only working reliably with a single user. Home Hub is for the entire family so multiple users will be able to train Cortana to recognise them. Private data from individual accounts can then be intelligently added to the family view as required. Windows 10 \"Home Hub\" Welcome Screen concept art by Windows Central Windows Central Home Hub will be led by the Welcome Screen. It's a family-centric replacement for the current Windows lock screen that could be likened to a fridge door or pin board. You'll be able to see your family's calendar, reminders, to-do lists and sticky notes on your PC. Microsoft's Cortana digital assistant will be constantly listening in this mode, letting you use your PC much like an Amazon Echo. Searches, reminders, the news and music will be accessible with your voice without logging into or even touching the PC. According to Windows Central , Home Hub is a \"massive project\" for Microsoft that's currently consuming a large amount of engineering resources. It will headline a future Windows 10 update and be an integral part of Microsoft's efforts to get families and consumers using its technology. Microsoft seems to be taking the concept of the Amazon Echo and then thinking of ways to expand on it and improve the accessibility. With Home Hub, the only prerequisite is a Windows PC you already have. Millions of families could start to use Home Hub on the day it's released, with no additional purchase necessary. It will combine the Echo's voice features with a hub interface for the family. Underneath it all, the power of the Windows desktop will remain. Home Hub could become another hero example of the benefits of Microsoft's unified Windows 10 platform. The company already has access to the software services it needs. The company doesn't need to develop new hardware and get consumers to adopt it because a basic PC will be able to act as a Home Hub. Microsoft is simply layering a new interface on top of its existing technology, cutting down the work required to launch a smart home solution. The feature is expected to start showing up in Insider Preview builds of Windows 10 early next year. Its public release is still several months away though. It's unlikely to be launched until the fall of 2017 and could be pushed further back. Aside from representing Microsoft's first big push into the connected home, Home Hub is also expected to debut the company's new Project NEON design language, bringing refinement and fluidity to Windows 10's interface.",

      "text": "Site helps track price of Amazon purchases Filed under Technology at Get Daily Dallas News Headlines Sign Up Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nHow many of you realize that prices fluctuate on Amazon.com -- sometimes wildly and in a very short period of time? \nI think some people are under the impression Amazon is automatically the cheapest place to buy most items. \nThat's not true. \nAmazon can be a good place to shop, both for price and convenience, but it's not always the cheapest. \nThis week I had an email exchange with a reader who was not pleased about an item in my 2016 holiday gift guide. It seems the price of the Brightech Scorpion portable jump starter, which I had listed at $59.99, had jumped by $20 on Amazon. \nI assured the reader the price indeed was $59.99 when I wrote my gift guide and must have increased after we put the section to bed. \nI was wondering if he would believe me, but then I remembered that there's a website that tracks the prices of most items on Amazon called Camelcamelcamel.com. \nI had previously used the site to set up a price drop alert for a few items I had on my wishlist. \nIf you find an item on Amazon and you want to track its price, you copy the item's URL and paste it into Camelcamelcamel.com to set up a price drop alert. \nIf your item drops to your desired price, you get an email notification. \nPart of setting up the alert is a graph showing you the price history of your item. \nIt seems the price of the Brightech Scorpion had been $59.99 since April, but it increased to $69.99 and then $79.99 in mid-November. \nI also noted that of the three colors for the Scorpion, two were $10 cheaper. There's no difference other than the color of the plastic case. \nThe price history graph was the most interesting part of the whole process. \nYou can see when the price goes up or down so you can set a realistic price alert. \nIf you have some time before you need to buy, you can save good money by sitting back and waiting.

But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. From Amazon Previous Next \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. \nThe-CNN-Wire ",

      "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video SEATTLE -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out.\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.\n47.606209 -122.332071 ",

      "text": "Share View photos A box from Amazon.com is pictured on the porch of a house in Golden, Colorado July 23, 2008. REUTERS/Rick Wilking More By Narottam Medhora and Jeffrey Dastin (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Monday it has opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters, kicking off new competition with supermarket chains. Amazon Go, the online shopping giant's new 1,800-square-foot (167-square-meter) store, uses sensors to detect what shoppers have picked off the shelf and bills it to their Amazon account if they do not put it back. The store marks Amazon's latest push into groceries, one of the biggest retail categories it has yet to master. The company currently delivers produce and groceries to homes through its AmazonFresh service. \"It’s a great recognition that their e-commerce model doesn’t work for every product,\" said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research, noting that physical stores would complement AmazonFresh. \"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat\" to supermarket chains, he said. The S&P 1500 food retail index, which includes Kroger Co, Whole Foods Market Inc and other companies, was down nearly 1 percent in mid-day trading. Shares of Amazon were up about 2 percent. Amazon Go is available now for employees of the company and is expected to be open to the public early next year, Amazon said. It was not immediately clear if and when Amazon Go would expand outside Seattle. \"The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino. \"Not only would you save a lot on labor costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.\" Still, the grab-and-go experience would take getting used to, he said. Some people may \"feel like they stole\" an item, Saunders said. \"There is a bit of education needed for consumers.\" Apart from groceries such as bread and milk, the store also offers ready-to-eat breakfasts, lunches and dinners made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries, Amazon said. That would make Amazon Go a potential competitor to fast-casual dining chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as well. Amazon Go is not the first physical store for the e-commerce giant to open. It has a book store in Seattle, as well as pop-ups at malls where it displays Amazon devices such as the Kindle.

      "text": "More Amazon on Monday unveiled a new kind of retail store, with no cashiers. In the concept store in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, Washington, customers can fill their shopping carts and walk out -- with the costs tallied up and billed on their accounts with the US online giant. Amazon Go, which is being tested in a single store with Amazon employees and will open to the public next year, is a \"checkout-free shopping experience made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning,\" its web page says. \"Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we'll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.\" The store in Seattle of some 170 square meters (1,800 square feet) is selling a variety of food products including breads, cheeses and ready-to-eat meals, as well as Amazon Meal Kits, which has the ingredients for home-cooked dishes. It was not immediately clear whether Amazon will expand this model with more physical stores or offer the technology to other retailers. The online giant has been rumored to be looking at creating brick-and-mortar outlets but so far has only announced a handful of bookselling outlets. Reblog",

      "text": "The checkout-less shopping experience envisioned for the Amazon Go store is part of a long-term trend in retail automation. (Bigstock Photo) First there were supermarket shelves. Then barcode scanners, then self-checkout lines, then online shopping. Amazon’s move to take the grocery checkout counter completely out of the loop is the latest disappearing act for the brick-and-mortar retail experience.\nBut it’s not unexpected: Walmart and Whole Foods also have been working on ways to streamline grocery shopping, using automation and robotics. And the competition could heat up quickly.\n“Retailers will be looking to understand what percentage of their current customers are utilizing Amazon, with the thinking that these will be the customers that are most at risk to the Amazon threat,” Matt Sargent, senior vice president for retail at Frank N. Magid Associates, wrote last week in a post that anticipated Amazon’s latest move .\nMagid’s research suggests that Amazon shoppers are weighted in favor of the under-44 population, those with kids in the household, those who go to grocery stores more than once a week, and those who make it a point to buy locally. In short, just the kinds of customers that grocery stores want to hang onto.\nThe Amazon Go concept takes advantage of trends that already have been changing retail – including smartphone apps that grant you access to the store, “smart carts” and smart shelves that keep track of what you buy, and real-time inventory management on the back end of the operation.\nAmazon says it’s adding a few new twists, based on the same sort of artificial intelligence and machine vision that other companies are putting to use in autonomous vehicies.\nWill all this work? Amazon has already been experimenting with physical retail automation, through offerings ranging from its “Dash” reorder buttons to the drive-up grocery store it’s getting ready to open in Ballard.\nThe checkout-less Seattle store, which will be designed to automatically log in customers and then let them walk out with the items they want will serve as a laboratory for the blend of technologies, could serve as Amazon’s most advanced laboratory yet.",

      "text": "Photo by angellodeco / Shutterstock.com \nBe wary of emails you receive that appear to be from Amazon. \nScammers are attempting to steal personal and financial information by impersonating Amazon in emails, AARP warns. \nThe subject line of these emails reads, “Your Amazon.com order cannot be shipped.” The email body states there was a problem processing your order and “you will not be able to access your account or place orders with us until we confirm your information.” \nThe email also directs you to click on a link that will take you to what appears to be an Amazon webpage but is not. There, you are asked to provide your name, address, phone number and credit card info — all the details a scammer would need to use your credit card to make fraudulent purchases. \nIf you enter that info, you are then redirected to Amazon’s actual website, further leading you to believe you provided that info to Amazon rather than a scammer. \nTo view an image of a sample email and the page to which the email directs you, check out AARP’s blog post . \nThis scam is categorized as what’s known as phishing — “when internet fraudsters impersonate a business to trick you into giving out your personal information,” as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission defines it. \nThe FTC advises: \nDon’t reply to email, text, or pop-up messages that ask for your personal or financial information. Don’t click on links within them either — even if the message seems to be from an organization you trust. It isn’t. Legitimate businesses don’t ask you to send sensitive information through insecure channels. \nAmazon advises its customers similarly . \nThe e-commerce giant also notes that suspicious emails that are not from Amazon.com often contain: Forged email addresses to make it look like the email is coming from Amazon.com. If the “from” line of an email contains an Internet Service Provider (ISP) other than @amazon.com, the email is fraudulent. An order confirmation for an item you didn’t purchase or an attachment to an order confirmation. If you receive such an email, you should log in to your Amazon account and go to the “Your Orders” page to see if there is an order that matches the details in the email. If it doesn’t match an order, the email isn’t from Amazon. Requests to update your payment information. If you receive such an email, you should go to the “Your Account” page and click “Manage Payment Options” in the “Payments” section. If you aren’t prompted to update your payment method on that screen, the email isn’t from Amazon. \nHave you received any phishing emails lately? Let us know below or on Facebook .

      "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video NEW YORK -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out.\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.",

      "title": "Earn 3x TrueBlue Points When You Shop on Amazon",
      "text": "  Last year, JetBlue and Amazon teamed up to offer Prime members unlimited streaming entertainment on flights, and now the two brands are expanding their partnership with a “shop and earn” program. Now, TrueBlue members who shop on Amazon — either on the ground or in the air via free Fly-Fi access — using a JetBlue link will earn 3 points per dollar spent. \nHere’s how it works: Starting this month, if you’re on a JetBlue flight, log in to Fly-Fi using your TrueBlue membership info and then shop at Amazon.com to earn points. This benefit will begin rolling out to JetBlue planes this month, and it should be available fleet-wide by January 2017. If you’re shopping on the ground, simply sign in to your TrueBlue account and click on the Amazon link. You can also use this direct link here once you’re signed in. Earn 3x TrueBlue points when you click through JetBlue to shop at Amazon. \nBased on TPG’s latest valuations , 3 TrueBlue points per dollar equals a return of up to 4.2%. This new earning opportunity essentially works like an airline shopping portal , and you can double-dip by earning rewards through your credit card as well. For instance, you can currently earn 5% cash back on Amazon purchases (on up to $1,500 in purchases at Amazon, select department stores and Sam’s Club) with the Discover it Card , in addition to the 3 points per dollar you’d earn by shopping with the e-tailer through JetBlue’s link. \nBottom Line \nIf boosting your TrueBlue account balance is a top award travel priority, this new partnership could come in quite handy — especially now that we’re in the holiday shopping season and many of us will turn to Amazon to purchase last-minute gifts. \nFeatured image courtesy of Joe Raedle via Getty Images.

      "text": "December 05, 2016 at 03:47 AM EST Divine Bounty Launches Magnesium Citrate Capsules on Amazon \n  Orlando, FL -- Magnesium is one of the most important yet taken for granted minerals today. The good news is that there are magnesium supplements available for individuals who seek to increase their intake of the mineral. \nDivine Bounty launches its Magnesium Citrate capsules on Amazon.com. This means that consumers can take advantage of the potential benefits of this mineral in just a matter of clicks. \nAccording to some experts, there are significant roles that magnesium plays inside the body. This is why a deficiency of this mineral may potentially result in many undesirable health consequences. \nStatistics reveal that up to 80% of adults are magnesium deficient. It may be beneficial to take magnesium supplements on a regular basis. \nIndividuals who suffer from magnesium deficiency often experience symptoms which may include poor digestion, muscle aches or spasms, trouble sleeping, and anxiety. These may be due to the fact that this mineral is involved in more than 300 biochemical functions in the body, including heartbeat rhythm regulation and aiding in neurotransmitter functions. \nOther symptoms of magnesium deficiency are kidney and liver damage, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, restless leg syndrome, worsened PMS symptoms, and insomnia. There are even those who suffer from behavioral disorders and mood swings. \nThere are several reasons why magnesium deficiency is quite common, and one is soil depletion. This could reduce the levels of magnesium in crops. It could also be due to digestive disorders, which typically result in the malabsorption of magnesium as well as other minerals in the gut. \nAccording to some experts, extended use of prescription medication and the use of antibiotics may also cause the deficiency. This is believed to result from the damage caused by these medications in the digestive tract, which can hinder proper magnesium absorption. \nNormal functions, which include heartbeat, muscle movement, and hormone production cause loss of magnesium inside the body. Replenishing this loss is imperative to prevent symptoms linked with deficiency. \nThe kidneys take care of controlling magnesium levels in the body as well as in excreting magnesium via urine on a daily basis. This is one reason why there is a reduction in urinary excretion when there are low levels of magnesium and other electrolytes. \nIt may be of benefit to utilize magnesium supplements to potentially increase the amounts of this mineral inside the body. There are many types of magnesium supplements available, and the absorption of magnesium is thought to depend on the combination of ingredients contained in a capsule. \nIt is believed that magnesium citrate supplements are more beneficial because they are more efficiently absorbed inside the body. Magnesium citrate is a combination of magnesium and citric acid. \nThe National Institute of Health reveals that assessing the levels of magnesium may be difficult. This is due to the fact that most magnesium can be found in the bones or cells and not within the blood. This means that blood results may be misleading in terms of determining deficiency in magnesium. \nUsing Divine Bounty’s Magnesium Citrate is thought to be a potential method to fight deficiency. Divine Bounty has long been thought to offer a variety of safe, effective, and potent natural supplements. \nThis product contains 1300 mg per serving, and it provides 208 mg of elemental magnesium. Consumers who are unsure if they are getting the right amounts of magnesium through food may want to consider utilizing this natural alternative. \n( https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Bounty-Magnesium-Citrate-Supplement/dp/B01LYWPNY6 ) About Divine Bounty \nDivine Bounty is a family-owned brand that manufactures high-quality turmeric curcumin supplements.

      "text": "\nThis past October, Amazon announced that it may be opening physical grocery stores as part of its extended AmazonFresh service. Now, the aforesaid rumors have finally quelled with the online shopping stalwart’s announcement of its first Amazon Go convenience store. The futuristic brick-and-mortar features a full-blown \"Just Walk Out Shopping\" experience with fully-equipped computer vision and sprawled out sensors and touts “no lines, no checkouts, no registers.” Shoppers simply check in at the entrance using their Amazon Go account, fill their shopping bags with desired items and immediately head out of the store. The first store is located in Seattle with presumably more openings to follow in major cities.\nGet a dose of the Amazon Go experience by watching the video above and then let us know your thoughts.\nRead more at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) shares are up 2.6% in Monday trading, on track to snap a five-session losing streak, after the e-commerce giant announced the new Amazon Go app, coming in early 2017. Amazon shares have lost 5.1% over the past five days. Unveiled via video available on the Amazon Twitter page (https://twitter.com/amazon/status/805785561768357888), details so far are few, but the video shows customers walking into a store, activating the app, and then shopping freely. The clip promises \"no lines, no checkout,\" saying that technology including AI and machine learning has been \"woven into the fabric\" of the store so shoppers won't have to stop at a register to tally their purchase. Amazon gives a Seattle address at the end of the clip where the store seemingly will be located. Amazon stock is up 12.4% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index is up nearly 8% for the same period.\n-Tonya Garcia; 1317ET\n ",

      "title": "Amazon’s first ‘beta’ grocery store has no cash or checkout lines",
      "text": "Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nYou’re not shoplifting, you’re just shopping in the future. \nAmazon has launched a beta version of its Go convenience store, which it describes as a “new kind of store with no checkout required.” An ambitious project that has apparently been in the works for four years, Amazon Go seeks to do away with the nuisance of waiting in lines. Rather than paying in the store, customers simply … walk out once they’re done getting their groceries. \nMore : Marshawn Lynch is projecting his inner Santa with Amazon’s Treasure Truck \nSo how does it work? According to Amazon, the experience depends upon “the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning.” Whenever you grab an item from a shelf, the company’s Just Walk Out technology detects what’s been taken and its price. If you change your mind about an item, you can put it back, and Amazon will remove it from your virtual shopping cart. When you’re finished, just leave, and your credit card will be charged and you’ll be sent a receipt. \nAs it stands, Amazon Go currently offers ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack options, created daily by on-site chefs, local kitchens, and bakeries. And while Go has grocery store staples like bread, milk, and cheese, it also stocks products for the more adventurous eaters from brands Amazon is eager to introduce to the public. You can even buy an Amazon Meal Kit, which promises to contain “all the ingredients you need to make a meal for two in about 30 minutes.” \nCurrently, only Amazon employees are taking part of the Beta program, though Amazon promises to open up its 21st century grocery store to the public in early 2017. You can sign up to be notified when Go opens here . But until then, keep paying for your groceries in the store. You don’t want to jump the gun on this one.",

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. ",

      "text": "Cowen and Company's bullish on Amazon Go (Seeking Alpha) \nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN )'s latest foray into brick-and-mortar retail could shake up the entire retail industry. Located in the company’s hometown of Seattle, the newest store is called Amazon Go, and it's a grocery story with no lines or checkout counters. How It Works \nAmazon Go utilizes computer vision and sensors to detect what items have been taken out of the store. Consumers will scan an app as they enter the store, and sensors will automatically be able to identify what items are in shoppers' carts. \nThe experience will feel a little like shoplifting, except there will be casino-like surveillance. Not only will the shopping experience be seamless for the customer, Amazon will be able to track movements and items to take advantage of shopping behavior and tastes. \nThis idea is sure to shakeup retail as a whole and could be the ultimate demise of the grocery worker. \nThe store is open to Amazon employees , and the official launch is scheduled for early 2017. \nImage Credit: By Amazon.com Inc.

      "text": "By Laura Stevens\nAmazon.com Inc. said Monday it plans to open Amazon Go, its first small-format grocery store, to the public early next year in its hometown of Seattle.\nThe roughly 1,800-square-foot store, which resembles a convenience store-format in a video Amazon released, features artificial intelligence-powered technology that eliminates checkouts and cash registers. Instead, customers scan their phone on a kiosk as they walk in, and Amazon automatically determines what items customers take from the shelves. After leaving the store, Amazon charges their account for the items and sends a receipt.\n\"Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning,\" the company adds.\nAmazon Go is part of the company's broader effort to move into brick-and-mortar groceries to capture a bigger piece of food sales, one of the few types of shopping that remains predominantly in-store. Amazon has been exploring concepts -- known internally as Project Como -- involving both curbside pickup and small-format stores, hoping to grab a bigger piece of the market and to better compete with rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\nGrocery sales may be crucial to Amazon's growth because Americans restock their refrigerators each week, something that could provide opportunities to sell more profitable items alongside cheese and chocolate.\nUntil now, Amazon has centered its grocery strategy around Amazon Fresh, a subscription service that promises quick food delivery for online orders.\nAmazon Go will sell ready-to-eat meals, snack options and grocery staples like bread and milk, according to Amazon. In addition, the store will offer chef-designed \"Amazon Meal Kits,\" which will provide the ingredients to cook a meal for two in a half-hour.\nAmazon says on its website that the new store, located in downtown Seattle near its headquarters, is already open to its employees, and that it will open to the public early next year.\nWrite to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nDecember 05, 2016 12:46 ET (17:46 ",

      "title": "Amazon Grocery Store Concept to Open in Seattle in Early 2017",
      "text": "By Laura Stevens\nAmazon.com Inc. said Monday it plans to open Amazon Go, its first small-format grocery store, to the public early next year in its hometown of Seattle.\nThe roughly 1,800-square-foot store, which resembles a convenience store-format in a video Amazon released, features artificial intelligence-powered technology that eliminates checkouts and cash registers. Instead, customers scan their phone on a kiosk as they walk in, and Amazon automatically determines what items customers take from the shelves. After leaving the store, Amazon charges their account for the items and sends a receipt.\n\"Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning,\" the company adds.\nAmazon Go is part of the company's broader effort to move into brick-and-mortar groceries to capture a bigger piece of food sales, one of the few types of shopping that remains predominantly in-store. Amazon has been exploring concepts -- known internally as Project Como -- involving both curbside pickup and small-format stores, hoping to grab a bigger piece of the market and to better compete with rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\nGrocery sales may be crucial to Amazon's growth because Americans restock their refrigerators each week, something that could provide opportunities to sell more profitable items alongside cheese and chocolate.\nUntil now, Amazon has centered its grocery strategy around Amazon Fresh, a subscription service that promises quick food delivery for online orders.\nAmazon Go will sell ready-to-eat meals, snack options and grocery staples like bread and milk, according to Amazon. In addition, the store will offer chef-designed \"Amazon Meal Kits,\" which will provide the ingredients to cook a meal for two in a half-hour.\nAmazon says on its website that the new store, located in downtown Seattle near its headquarters, is already open to its employees, and that it will open to the public early next year.\nWrite to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nDecember 05, 2016 12:50 ET (17:50 ",

Pound has plummeted and they aren't manufacturing too many of 1440p 144hz+ screens due to quality control issues. True doubt it will drop again, but currently this has to be the cheapest G-Sync 144hz+ 1440p monitor I've seen, but where are the cheaper Freesync ones @. This would be no good to me with my R9 Fury.

      "text": "\nIt is similar to fibonacci series. Interviewer asked various ways to implement the same – Recursion, 1-D array, with 3 variables and complexity of each. \n2) Design recommendation engine. It’s like auto suggestion. I gave the trie approach. The interviewer seemed fine with this approach and asked me to write full code with time and space complexities. Implementation of Tries: \nRound 4 (Managerial Round – Over video call) Tell me about yourself. \nWhich project you liked working the most. \nAny case where you had conflict with your manager. \nAny idea/technology suggested by you to your team which then got implemented and worked out. \nAny case when you had to work out of your comfort zone. \nThe most critical feedback received from your manager/team members. \nWhat do you do to enhance your technical knowledge apart from your project work. \nAnd many more. \nRound 5(Final Round – Telephonic) Initially I was asked questions about the work I had done, the projects I did and some managerial questions. Then I was given a coding problem to solve. They use Collabedit tool in phone screen interviews where the same screen is shared by both interviewer and interviewee. Ques : Print all the non-repeating words out of two given sentences. Eg. Statement 1: I have a blue pen. Statement 2: I got a red pen. Output : have blue got red Discussion : I suggested the hashing approach. The interviewer asked to implement the same. \nPoints to take care: You must know how to calculate time and space complexities. In each round they ask you about the project you recently did/ the project you liked working most/ most challenging work etc – so you should be prepared well for at least one project with in-depth details. Start with the naive approach for each question asked and then proceed with solutions with better space and time complexities. No need to waste time reading about Operating Systems, Networking, DBMS etc. They only care about the projects you did and your coding skills whether you cover all the edge cases while writing code, know time and space complexities, have better approaches for solving same problem and so on. \nIf you like GeeksforGeeks and would like to contribute, you can also write an article and mail your article to contribute@geeksforgeeks.org. See your article appearing on the GeeksforGeeks main page and help other Geeks. ",

      "text": "By Timi Cantisano News Reporter Neowin LLC @timicantisano · 10 minutes ago with 1 comment \nAlthough technology has pushed lots of boundaries, there are still areas in our lives where it hasn't quite fully penetrated. For quite some time, markets and retailers have utilized checkout counters that require a physical cashier to scan items, total them and accept a patrons payment. In more recent years we have seen checkout kiosks that allow a customer to scan their own goods and pay via an automated system. It appears that Amazon has been working on something to advance the shopping experience over the past fours years and is hoping to take it to another level with its 'Amazon Go' market. \nThe market is like no other as it does not have a checkout line or cashier. When you visit the Amazon Go store, you simply enter the establishment by using your smartphone loaded with the Amazon Go app and just start shopping. The store monitors your activity and knows when you are picking up or putting back an item. When you are ready to purchase, you simply walk out of the store, at which point you'll be charged for the items and sent a receipt. \nThere is currently only one store in the world and it is located in the Seattle, Washington. The store is in a beta phase with it being only open to Amazon employees at the moment and is expected to open to the general public in early 2017.",

But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. From Amazon Previous Next \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. \nThe-CNN-Wire",

      "title": "Amazon Grocery Store Concept to Open in Seattle in Early 2017",
      "text": "By Laura Stevens\nAmazon.com Inc. said Monday it plans to open Amazon Go, its first small-format grocery store, to the public early next year in its hometown of Seattle.\nThe roughly 1,800-square-foot store, which resembles a convenience store-format in a video Amazon released, features artificial intelligence-powered technology that eliminates checkouts and cash registers. Instead, customers scan their phone on a kiosk as they walk in, and Amazon automatically determines what items customers take from the shelves. After leaving the store, Amazon charges their account for the items and sends a receipt.\n\"Our checkout-free shopping experience is made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning,\" the company adds.\nAmazon Go is part of the company's broader effort to move into brick-and-mortar groceries to capture a bigger piece of food sales, one of the few types of shopping that remains predominantly in-store. Amazon has been exploring concepts -- known internally as Project Como -- involving both curbside pickup and small-format stores, hoping to grab a bigger piece of the market and to better compete with rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\nGrocery sales may be crucial to Amazon's growth because Americans restock their refrigerators each week, something that could provide opportunities to sell more profitable items alongside cheese and chocolate.\nUntil now, Amazon has centered its grocery strategy around Amazon Fresh, a subscription service that promises quick food delivery for online orders.\nAmazon Go will sell ready-to-eat meals, snack options and grocery staples like bread and milk, according to Amazon. In addition, the store will offer chef-designed \"Amazon Meal Kits,\" which will provide the ingredients to cook a meal for two in a half-hour.\nAmazon says on its website that the new store, located in downtown Seattle near its headquarters, is already open to its employees, and that it will open to the public early next year.\nWrite to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com\n 12:46 ET (17:46 ",

      "text": "Amazon's New Grocery Store Has No Checkout Lines Henry T. Casey Staff Writer Pin it Share If you ask me, the worst part of shopping is waiting on a slowly-moving, seemingly-never-ending checkout line. Amazon might agree, as today (Dec. 5) it announced Amazon Go, a new grocery store that lets customers skip the payment line, almost as if they were stealing the products in their bags. Introducing Amazon Go Currently in a beta program and only open to the company's employees, Amazon Go uses a mix of sensors, computer vision and what it calls \"deep learning\" to know when you've added something to your bag. The company calls this its Just Walk Out shopping experience, and it will only require you to scan the Amazon Go app when you enter the store, and it will charge you when you leave. While you shop, the store will monitor what you take off the shelf and what you put back, and charge you for what you keep at the end of the experience. The 1,880-square-foot store will open to the public in early 2017, and Amazon says it will be \"conveniently compact,\" which we hope doesn't end up resulting in a too-tight shopping experience. MORE: The Best Holiday Tech Deals Amazon go appears to offer the same products you can find in the average Whole Foods or other high-end market, including ready-to-eat mealse, staples such as bread and milk and those always costly \"artisan cheeses and locally made chocolates.\" Amazon says the store will sell products from well-known brands as well as ones you'll only then discover. View photos Amazon Go will also compete with services such as Blue Apron, as Amazon Meal Kits pack \"all the ingredients you need to make a meal for two in about 30 minutes.\" If you live in or can can travel to Seattle easily, visit this page to get a notification when the store is open to the public. View photos We hope this experience is as seamless as the promo video describes, despite the fact that today's self-checkout machines don't always quite work like they should. If it's successful, this store could bring IBM's vision of RFID-based shopping (which looked an awful lot like shoplifting) to life.",

      "text": "Everyone on Amazon Is Obsessed With This Tea Bag Organizer \n\"This is the tea organizer every tea drinker needs!\" Most Popular By Lauren Smith Dec 1, 2016 Tis the season for brewing your favorite mug of tea, then wrapping yourself in a cozy cocoon on the couch while watching A Miracle on 34th Street . But after a few nights of movie marathons, it's time to switch from mint to something cinnamon-infused, right? Don't let a lack of cabinet space hold you back from expanding your assortment. YouCopia's TeaStand ($25, amazon.com ) is all you need — according to almost 300 rave reviews on Amazon. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The organizer includes 12 clear, removable bins so you can stock up on a robust collection of bags (more than 100, to be exact). Meanwhile, the compact design lets you slide the organizer into your cabinet without sucking up all of the surface area the same number of tea boxes would require. When guests come over, pull the entire organizer out so they can pick their flavor — or, if you know it, just pull out their favorite. YouCopia Most Popular To say tea drinkers find this organizer to be life-changing would be an understatement — and that's why it's one of the best reviewed organizers on Amazon. \"I love tea and this has saved me so much space. It's just the perfect convenient tea stand that shows off my variety, \" Alice Grey says. \"This is the tea organizer every tea drinker needs!\" How-To Book lover says. \"If you have a large volume of tea to organize, want easy access to the tea bags, as well as being able to easily see what teas you have this is the product for you!\" \"Just what I wanted to store my favorite tea selections,\" Rebecca Williams says. \"Easy to handle and fits neatly into my cabinet. Will be ordering another soon.\" Clearly, all 291 reviews (88% of which are five stars and 10% are four stars) have something in common: gleeful satisfaction. Which begs us to wonder if this is the best gift ever for mom, grandma, and even ourselves. We think yes. Read Next: ",

      "text": "Austin Krause | December 5, 2016 in News \nRecently we talked about 10 Amazon Prime benefits you’re probably not aware of . Well, it looks like we left one out! Simply use smile.amazon.com instead of www.amazon.com the next time you go shopping, and the AmazonSmile Foundation will donate 0.5% of your purchase to the charity of your choice. Smile.Amazon.Com Details \nHere’s how Amazon describes its AmazonSmile Foundation : \nAmazonSmile is a website operated by Amazon that lets you enjoy the same wide selection of products, low prices, and convenient shopping features as on Amazon.com. The difference is that when you shop on AmazonSmile(smile.amazon.com), the AmazonSmile Foundation will donate 0.5% of the purchase price to the eligible charitable organization of your choice. \nAmazonSmile lead, Ian McAllister, says that the charity program is something customers are sure to love, and the shopping experience is otherwise identical to the regular Amazon site. \nThere are however a few exceptions for items that do not qualify for charity; these include subscription items (subscribe & save), and digital items. Nearly everything else on the site qualifies, including some of the most expensive items listed in the Fine Art section such as Jacqueline au Bandeau by Pablo Picasso for just $120,000.00 USD . You Control where the Money is Sent \nThe best part as mentioned earlier, although Amazon features specific charities by default, you can use the search tool to select your favorite charity. For example, want to donate to your local schools, fire departments or religious organization? Simple, just use the search box as shown above. \nImagine if your local supermarkets did this rather than asking if you’d like to give cash to some random charity that you probably don’t care about… or trust… But, giving to my local community? Definitely. And again, the best part, it doesn’t cost you anything; AmazonSmile is taking the giving out of its own profits. Spread the Giving between Multiple Charities \nThe charity chosen isn’t permanent either, it can be changed at any time using the Change Your Support link. This means if there are multiple charities you want to help out, just change the setting between each purchase. \nThe smile program is simple enough to use. Just visit smile.amazon.com choose your Charity, and then shop like normal. Donations are not given unless you specifically buy while on the smile.amazon.com subdomain so don’t forget. If you do, Amazon will remind you from time-to-time and let you know how much cash your charity missed out on. The lesson here, don’t forget! My Charity is Missing, Can I add it? \nCharities interested in joining the program can sign up at https://org.amazon.com/ . The Organizations must be public charitable organizations that are registered and in good standing with the IRS as a 501(c)(3) to be eligible to participate. \nOne thing to keep in mind, being that you’re not actually giving the donations out of your pocket, none of your giving is tax deductible through this program. Something to bear in mind around tax time if you want to keep the IRA taxman happy. More Reading:",

      "text": "Dec 5 - Amazon unveils the future of stores, NO CASHIER, NO LINES The 1,800-square-foot store, dubbed “Amazon Go,” is the latest beach in brick-and-mortar retail stormed by the e-commerce giant. It’s clearly a sign Amazon sees a big opportunity in revolutionizing Main Street commerce. Call it Amazon.com’s driverless store. The tech giant has built a convenience store in downtown Seattle that deploys a gaggle of technologies similar to those used in self-driving cars to allow shoppers to come in, grab items and walk out without going through a register. The 1,800-square-foot store, officially dubbed “Amazon Go,” is the latest beach in brick-and-mortar retail stormed by the e-commerce giant, which already has bookstores and is working on secretive drive-through grocery locations. It’s clearly a sign that Amazon sees a big opportunity in revolutionizing the staid traditions of Main Street commerce. In the much longer term, if the experiment works out and is adopted widely, it could radically transform the nature of work in the retail industry, much like driverless car and truck technology threatens to upend transportation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said in a report this year that cashiers were the second-largest occupation, with 3.5 million employed in the U.S. Analysts with Cowen say the move shows how aggressively Amazon is pursuing the grocery business, which represents about 17 percent of total U.S. retail, or nearly $800 billion. It’s an area dominated by Wal-Mart, an Amazon rival that is revving up its e-commerce game. For Amazon, it represents a huge source of potential revenue growth, plus another way to ensconce itself in people’s shopping habits. While more and more people, especially among the younger cohorts, are going online for their groceries, “we acknowledge some people may never be comfortable with the idea,” say the Cowen analysts. Located at the corner of Seventh Avenue and Blanchard Street, the Amazon Go store is open to Amazon employees participating in a testing program. It is expected to be open to the public in early 2017. Amazon says that what makes the store tick is a combination of computer vision, sensors and machine learning that it calls “Just Walk Out technology.” It can tell, say, when a particular shopper picks up a carton of milk from a shelf, and the technology puts it in that shopper’s virtual cart. It can also tell when an item is put back on the shelf — and removes it from the virtual cart accordingly. Shoppers walking into the store would call up the Amazon Go app and hold their smartphone to a scanner as they would at an airport security line. Then they just pick any combination of products and walk out. Amazon would charge them after they leave the store. Unlike the self-serve registers present at many supermarkets, there’s no need to stand in line or go through any register. It’s unclear at this point how Amazon would address shoplifting. The store features ready-to-eat meals and snacks prepared by on-site chefs or local bakeries. There are also essentials such as bread and milk, as well as high-end cheese and chocolate. Amazon says there will be well-known brands as well as “special finds we’re excited to introduce to customers.” That includes an “Amazon Meal Kit,” which contains ingredients needed to make a meal for two in 30 minutes.",

      "text": "Artificial Intelligence After warehouse staff, Amazon to replace store clerks with robots Amazon wants shoppers to just walk out of its stores and let an AI figure out what they owe for what they took. Paris Bureau Chief, IDG News Service   \nAt Amazon Go stores, shoppers will be able to identify themselves with a QR code on a phone app as they walk in, then pay for their purchases simply by walking out the door. The first such store will open to the public in Seattle early in 2017. Credit: Amazon.com 94% off the Complete Machine Learning Course Bundle - Deal Alert \nAmazon.com is still figuring out how to use robots to fill store shelves, but it's about done with clerks. Next year, the company will open a convenience store in Seattle where shoppers can walk in, take what they want -- and leave. \nThe Amazon Go store is on the corner of 7th Avenue and Blanchard Street in Seattle, in the heart of Amazon's new campus development and a few blocks from the company's headquarters. \nAmazon wants people to walk in to the store and then just walk out with what they want. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nIt's not giving the goods away, though. \nTo figure out who to charge, and how much, Amazon will identify shoppers by scanning QR codes on their phones as they walk in, and use sensors and computer vision technology to determine which items they take. \nThat might seem creepy, but it's not much more intrusive than the closed-circuit TV monitoring many stores already have in place to deter shoplifters, or the Bluetooth beacons others use to pitch up-to-the-minute offers to visitors. Whether Amazon's system is sharp-eyed enough to distinguish between a jar of strawberry jelly and a jar of raspberry in the same way that a clerk with a regular barcode reader can distinguish between codes 051500001639 and 051500022030 remains to be seen. \nFor now, only Amazon staff can shop at the 180-square-meter Go store, but early next year it will be ready to sell ready-made snacks and staples such as bread and milk to anyone -- anyone with the Amazon Go app running on a compatible smartphone, that is. \nPayment is automatically deducted from the associated credit card when a shopper leaves the store, and the receipt is sent to the app. \nWith robots already able to mop the floor, and the shelf-stacking problem almost solved by entrants to the Amazon Picking Challenge , the employee-free grocery store may not be far away.

      "text": "\nAs if traditional retailers didn't already live in constant fear of rival Amazon.com Inc., now the e-commerce giant is invading their home turf. Store Pop Amazon's shares rose 3% Monday after it announced plans to open a physical convenience store Source: Bloomberg Intraday times are displayed in ET. \nAmazon on Monday announced plans to open an 1,800-square-foot convenience store early next year, likely sending shudders through Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp., which are already scrambling to keep up with Amazon on e-commerce. \nAmazon's move to the physical realm is no surprise. It has already started building bookstores on college campuses and in shopping malls. Mall operator General Growth Properties's CEO revealed last February that Amazon could open as many as 400 bookstores . And there have been reports for months that Amazon would be rolling out convenience stores . \nWhat is new is the concept Amazon revealed on Monday, called Amazon Go, which will use sensors and AI to eliminate checkout lanes. A promotional video shows customers, with the help of a smartphone app, simply grabbing groceries and walking out the door. \nPhysical retailers have reason to fear this is more than just a gimmick. How Amazon Will Kill Your Local Grocery Store \nThe speedy checkout technology matters because retailers have been trying to crack the checkout process for decades. If Amazon can solve one of brick-and-mortar retail's biggest sources of friction, then that could be a harbinger of how else the company might turn physical retail on its head. \nWalmart once said it could save $12 million for every second it cuts from the checkout process in the U.S. This belief drove a Walmart smartphone app that let customers scan items as they shopped. The app flopped after customers said it took too long to individually scan carts full of items. \nOther retailers have tried self-checkout kiosks, and Apple Pay was created partly to help speed shoppers through checkout, especially since new chip-enabled credit cards have further slowed the process. Easier, quicker payment is one of the biggest reasons customers stick with companies such as Uber and Amazon. \nAmazon's move also highlights a new focus on selling groceries. Unlike electronics and books, online grocery remains anyone's game . Ripe For Growth Amazon controls a small percentage of the highly fragmented grocery market Source: Cowen & Co., company reports, Supermarket News \nIt's an area of the retailing world, and a huge one, that Amazon hasn't managed to dominate -- yet. \nAmazon Go will give Amazon real-life insight into how consumers shop for groceries in the physical world. That can help it tailor the digital experience for grocery shopping, which isn't quite like shopping for headphones or phone cases. Clicked Off 87% of consumers haven't bought groceries online in the past 6 months, according to a recent survey. Here are some of the reasons given: Source: Cowen & Co.'s Consumer Internet Survey of 2,500 people conducted from June to November 2016 \nAll hope is not lost for traditional retailers. There's actually an upside to Amazon entering the physical retail realm: Operating in the daylight of physical stores -- as opposed to behind secretive, online algorithms -- will give traditional retail rivals such as Walmart and Target a front-row seat to Amazon's practices. \nBeing able to walk right into Amazon's stores, to see how they operate and to talk to customers, gives other retailers a chance to quickly match Amazon's best ideas. For smart competitors, this scary moment could be an opportunity.

      "text": "Amazon Go store is checkout free   2:  6:58 PM The Associated Press \nNEW YORK (AP) \" Amazon is testing a grocery store model in Seattle that works without checkout lines. \nCalled Amazon Go, shoppers scan their Amazon app when they enter the store, and then sensors register items that shoppers pick up and automatically charge them to the Amazon app. \nIf a shopper puts the item back they aren't charged. \nThe store offers ready-to-eat meals, staples like bread and milk and meal-making kits. \nThe store is in testing and is open to Amazon employees on a trial run. It is expected to open to the public in early 2017. \nThe e-commerce powerhouse has also been dipping its toe into the physical realm. It has opened three bookstores in California, Oregon and Washington with traditional check outs. Two more are in the works in Illinois and Massachusetts. \nCowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge says the new grocery store is just one way that Amazon has been setting its sights on the food and beverage category, a lucrative $795 billion market. It also offers grocery delivery in some markets and Prime Now for last-minute items delivered in one or two hours. \n\"We are encouraged by Amazon's growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption given younger demos increasingly purchasing food and beverage grocery items via digital channels,\" Blackledge said. \nAmazon.com Inc. shares rose $18.69, or 2.5 percent, to $759.03 in afternoon trading Monday. Its shares are up almost 13 percent since a year ago. \n.",

      "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video NEW YORK -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops.\nNow it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist.\nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals.\nThe key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines.\nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed.\nAmazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies.\nWhen you're done shopping, you just walk out.\nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered.\nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping.\nAmazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet.\nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations.\nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate.\nThe company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms?\nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump.\n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go.\nFor now, Amazon is starting slow.\nThe first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year.\n40.712784 -74.005941 ",

      "text": "\nEvery once in a while, Amazon offers sample boxes for Prime members. The Amazon Grooming Box is geared towards men and was released to Prime member on Black Friday 2016 weekend.\nMy Subscription Addiction paid for this subscription. (Check out the review process post to learn more about how we review boxes.) \n\nThe Box: Amazon Grooming Box \nThe Cost: $9.99 Prime Member Exclusive\nThe Products:\nGillette Mach3 Turbo Razor Cetaphil Men Daily Face Cloth The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash Head & Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo, Classic Clean AXE Antiperspirant Stick for Men, Phoenix Colgate Total Advanced Whitening Gel Toothpaste Plus, received $9.99 in Amazon credit a week after shipping. Credit is available for select products shipped and sold by Amazon.\nShips: Worldwide.\n\n\n\nThese sample boxes are available for Prime Members only! Here are the details on the box:\nFor a limited time, buy this sample box for full price and receive an equivalent credit for select products shipped and sold from Amazon.com. A week after your product ships, you will receive an email with instructions on how to use your credit Limit one box per customer. Sample box is available for Prime members only \n\nGillette Mach3 Turbo Razor – Value $5 on Amazon\nThe only full-size item in the box is this Gillette mach3 Turbo razor.\n\n\nIt’s got 3 blades plus a moisturizer strip.\n\nCetaphil Men Daily Face Cloth – 1 Count Sample\nAs someone with skin on the oily side, these face wipes are always super useful to me. I’m a fan of these face wipes in particular because there isn’t a strong scent and it was big enough to have half the wipe for a second use.\n\nThe Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash – 1 Count Sample Packet\nThis is a 5 ml sample packet of Tea Tree Face Wash. Again, as someone with an oily face, I’m always ready to test out face washes from subscription boxes. This has a fresh minty smell that will definitely wake you up – it will pair nicely with the Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner that I’ve been using from my Bespoke Post Black Box !\n\nHead & Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo, Classic Clean – 1 Travel Size Bottle\nThis little 1.7 oz bottle is for the shampoo only. It’s the classic Head & Shoulders formula, so no real surprises or discoveries here.\n\n\nAXE Antiperspirant Stick for Men, Phoenix – 1 Travel Size Stick \nThis stick is .5 ounces of the Phoenix scent. I’m not a big Axe fan – but this is one of the more neutral, fresh, scents.\n\n\nColgate Total Advanced Whitening Gel Toothpaste – 1 Travel Size Tube \nFinally, the last item is a .75 ounce tube of Colgate toothpaste. It’s your standard mint flavor white some whitening.\nVerdict: I’m always ready to test new grooming products from a subscription box, and while these are mostly standard brands, I’ll still use it all. We just received this, so we’re unsure what the credit will be available for (fingers crossed for the Cetaphil face wipes), but I’ll definitely be redeeming it – bringing my net cost down to $0!\nWhat did you think of the Amazon Grooming Box ? Did you get one?\n",

      "text": "Amazon Go store is checkout free   2:  6:58 PM The Associated Press \nNEW YORK (AP) \" Amazon is testing a grocery store model in Seattle that works without checkout lines. \nCalled Amazon Go, shoppers scan their Amazon app when they enter the store, and then sensors register items that shoppers pick up and automatically charge them to the Amazon app. \nIf a shopper puts the item back they aren't charged. \nThe store offers ready-to-eat meals, staples like bread and milk and meal-making kits. \nThe store is in testing and is open to Amazon employees on a trial run. It is expected to open to the public in early 2017. \nThe e-commerce powerhouse has also been dipping its toe into the physical realm. It has opened three bookstores in California, Oregon and Washington with traditional check outs. Two more are in the works in Illinois and Massachusetts. \nCowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge says the new grocery store is just one way that Amazon has been setting its sights on the food and beverage category, a lucrative $795 billion market. It also offers grocery delivery in some markets and Prime Now for last-minute items delivered in one or two hours. \n\"We are encouraged by Amazon's growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption given younger demos increasingly purchasing food and beverage grocery items via digital channels,\" Blackledge said. \nAmazon.com Inc. shares rose $18.69, or 2.5 percent, to $759.03 in afternoon trading Monday. Its shares are up almost 13 percent since a year ago. \n.",

      "text": "What kid hasn’t peered over a parent’s shoulder to watch messages pop back and forth, wondering at the blue and green bubbles on Mom or Dad’s pocket-size screen? For the post-iPhone generation, reading is more closely associated with messaging-style chat than hardcover books.\nAmazon’s new mobile app, designed for kids ages 7-12, takes advantage of kids&apos; comfort with chat-based interfaces to engage them in reading. Called Rapids, the app contains hundreds of stories, all written as dialogue and embellished with custom illustrations. \n\"The stories are told through the lens of characters chatting with one another, one message at a time,\" says Michael Robinson, director of consumer products at Amazon Education. Each one is original to the app, with categories ranging from adventure and animals to science fiction and sports. Humor pervades throughout; the chat format, as it turns out, is well equipped to deliver the kinds of punch lines that kids enjoy (and repeat and repeat).\n\"We want kids to read for fun,\" Robinson says. \"If a kid is reading on a regular basis and seeks it out, all these other benefits will accrue.\" Decades of research show that voluntary, independent reading correlates with academic growth in areas such as vocabulary and reading comprehension.\nRapids costs $2.99 per month (on iOS, Android, or Fire devices), with no discount for Amazon Prime members. That&apos;s less than reading apps like Learn With Homer and Speakaboos, both of which charge $7.99 per month, but more than video-centric, advertising-based apps that would otherwise be competing for kids&apos; time.\nFor more advanced readers, Rapids offers a no-tap mode in which all of story appears at once, enabling easy scrolling. Early readers can listen to audio of the dialogues (delivered in grating computer-voice) via \"Read to me\" mode, or read aloud together with a parent.\nAmazon declined to disclose how it is compensating the app&apos;s authors and illustrators, nearly all of whom are contractors. Some, like Alien Invasion author Raymond Bean, have previously written books for Two Lions, Amazon&apos;s children&apos;s publishing division. Many are full-time librarians and teachers by day.\nAmazon plans to add dozens of new fiction titles to the Rapids library each month.\nSlideshow Credits: 01 / Photos: courtesy of Amazon;",

      "text": "No cash? No time to wait? No wish to stand in close proximity to another human? No problem, says Amazon, which has announced a new store that makes use of sensing and artificial intelligence to do away with the checkout altogether.\nThere’s just one shop so far, in Amazon’s hometown of Seattle. Called Amazon Go, its modest 1,800 square feet of retail space has a very time-poor kind of customer in mind. There are ready-to-eat meals, basic groceries, and meal kits to cook at home lining its shelves.\nBut the experience of buying goods from this store is certainly not one for the privacy advocates among us. Upon arrival, you have to scan an app to pass through the entrance—like you do with a digital boarding pass. From this point on, it knows you’re there, and can keep track of what you do.\nAmazon says that the store uses on-shelf sensing and computer vision to keep track of every item that you pick up, adding each one to a list to charge you for later. (Though it can also remove items when it sees you put them back). When you leave, it double-checks the list by detecting the items you’re removing from the store.\nThen it charges your Amazon account, leaving you to eat your sandwich without having to stand in line for a single moment. This, it seems, is how people shop in the future.\n\nThe Amazon Go store uses on-shelf sensing and computer vision to keep track of every item that you pick up. It joins a history of attempts to automate the grocery store. Keedoozle tried its luck in 1937 with a system of conveyor belts, glass cabinets, and personalized keys to remove people from the process, though it shut down when its back-end couldn’t support its popularity.\nEarlier this year, a supermarket in Sweden opened that uses an app to grant access to customers, though it demands people scan barcodes via their phone —essentially working on a tech-enabled trust model, with CCTV as backup.\nAmazon looks to be running a much tighter ship. While finding ways to circumvent the system may appeal to hackers, it sounds as if most ordinary folks would find themselves unable to cheat a system bristling with sensors and cameras that monitor shoppers’ every move.\nIf it works as advertised, lifting products off the shelves and simply walking out may become the new way to shop (as opposed to shoplift)—part of Amazon’s bet on the idea that delivering unparalleled convenience will keep customers coming back.\n(Read more: “ Amazon's Next Big Move: Take Over the Mall ,” Amazon Go , “ Amazon Wants to Disrupt the Bodega ”)",

      "text": "More recently, he has threatened to clamp down on companies moving jobs overseas . \nDespite the convincing nature of Trump's anti-offshoring argument, Amazon Go proves the biggest danger isn't jobs going overseas, but rather the march of technological progress. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , 856,850 Americans were employed as grocery store cashiers in May 2015, the most recent data available. Theoretically, Amazon Go's model grocery store puts a chunk of these jobs at risk. Include all cashiers (there doesn't seem to be a reason the Amazon Go model couldn't work for say, clothes or books) and that's roughly 3.5 million people in roles that are at risk of being automated away. \nJoe Raedle / Staff / Getty Images \nTo put that into perspective, t he World Trade Organization estimated that between 2001 and 2013 the US had lost 3.2 million jobs due to outsourcing to China. This isn't an apples to apples comparison, but the numbers are striking. \nThat's not to say that every cashier job is going to disappear overnight. Amazon is only opening a pilot Go store in Seattle next year. And cashier jobs have held remarkably steady of the last decade, even as online shopping became the dominant trend in retail. \nThe change, however, highlights the ever-shifting landscape of the American workforce. \nThis point isn't a new one. Everyone from liberal, Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman to Republican Senator Ben Sasse have noted that technological developments are a bigger threat to American workers than trade. The World Economic Forum estimated 5 million jobs in 15 developed economies are at risk of automation by 2020 and Citi projected that 57% of jobs in OECD nations are at risk of automation. \nIn heavy manufacturing, jobs once done by multiple humans are being replaced by robots. Panera Bread is trying out machines that take and deliver your order, all without a human server. Even in journalism there are programs that are starting to automate simple article writing. \nScreengrab via Bloomberg \nHoward Marks, the founder of investment firm Oaktree Capital, riffed on this topic earlier this year, pointing out that US manufacturing output is near an all-time high, even though US manufacturing employment is down 37% since the peak in 1979. \n\"Perhaps if the government wants to preserve jobs it should just outlaw productivity gains,\" he said . \nThat, of course, isn't feasible. There is likely a long-run benefit to making processes more affordable and quicker. \nRather, the point is that refocusing the labor market on the jobs and skills that will be needed in the future is a productive way to allow innovation and keep American employed. \nThat kind of policy was barely mentioned in Trump's campaign. In fact, the president-elect hardly mentioned the issue of technological advances destroying jobs at all, so it appears to be a huge blind spot in his proposed economic plan. \nTrump is focused on the wrong problem when it comes to the labor market. Instead of getting old manufacturing jobs back from overseas, the government should be focused on retraining workers for the new labor market.

      "title": "Amazon has opened a grocery store in Seattle with no cashiers or queues",
      "text": "retail \nWhether it’s earning extra money as a student or working your way up the ranks, working at a supermarket is a steady form of employment for the most part. It’s a type of job that is going to come under attack by technology in the next few years, though, specifically by Amazon in the corporation’s search for shopping efficiency. According to an announcement earlier today, Amazon has begun trialing a store in Seattle with Amazon Go branding that has no check-outs and no queues. \nSo how does this Amazon Go thing work? Well, you walk into the store as you normally would, picking up a basket and choosing the items you want. Through the magic of technology (computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning), the Amazon Go app can sense which item you have taken off the shelf, and places it in a virtual basket on the app. When you walk through the scanners by the exit, the app is able to tell which items you kept and which you placed back on the shelf, and a bill is totaled up which is paid through your Amazon account. And that is about it. \nThere are no queues to stand in, and no cashiers to make small chat to as they wave your products through the scanners. You don’t even need your wallet, just a smartphone. \nOn the face of it, the idea of going to a store, picking up the items you want and simply walking out while the amount is automatically deducted via the Amazon Go app is very appealing. After all, who hasn’t been annoyed standing in queues as someone stalls the line searching for a coupon or change. But…it’s yet another sign that traditional supermarkets and their employees need to step up their game in order to head off the retail juggernaut known as SkyNet Amazon. It’s also another sign that humans are needed less and less in the world of ours. \nThe first store has 1,800 square feet of floor space, is located in Seattle, and is currently open in beta format to Amazon employees only. Amazon says the store will open to the general public in early 2017. It offers basic groceries such as milk and bread as well as ready-to-eat meals, and cook-at-home meal kits. \nLet us know what you think of Amazon Go in the comments below.

      "text": "Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images \nAmazon debuted its new Go store on Monday, and the design of the store hints at a future of shopping with no human interaction.\nThe grocery store will allow shoppers to check in to the store with their phones, grab what they need, and simply walk out of the store.\nThe shopper's Amazon account will be billed for the cost of the goods. Customers won't have to stand in line, and critically, they won't have to interact with a cashier.\nThat's great news for Amazon customers who  detest human interaction or waiting , but it's bad news for cashiers, a critical part of the US workforce, and it highlights the challenge Donald Trump will face as he bids to boost the US labor market.\nDuring his campaign, Trump  pledged to \" bring back the jobs \" by cutting  taxes and regulation  and   pulling out of trade deals .  Free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement or Trans Pacific Partnership allowed companies to shift jobs overseas to places like Mexico and China  and decimate the middle class, he said. \nThe argument struck a chord, particularly with white working class voters , propelling Trump to the White House.\nMore recently, he has threatened to  clamp down on companies moving jobs overseas . \nDespite the convincing nature of Trump's anti-offshoring argument, Amazon Go proves the biggest danger isn't jobs going overseas, but rather the march of technological progress.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics ,  856,850 Americans were employed as grocery store cashiers in May 2015, the most recent data available. Theoretically, Amazon Go's model grocery store puts a chunk of these jobs at risk.  Include all cashiers (there doesn't seem to be a reason the Amazon Go model couldn't work for say, clothes or books) and that's roughly 3.5 million people in roles that are at risk of being automated away. \nTasos Katopodis/Getty Images To put that into perspective, t he World Trade Organization estimated that between 2001 and 2013 the US had lost 3.2 million jobs due to outsourcing to China.  This isn't an apples to apples comparison, but the numbers are striking.\nThat's not to say that  every cashier job is going to disappear overnight. Amazon is only opening a pilot Go store in Seattle next year. And cashier jobs have held remarkably steady of the last decade, even as online shopping became the dominant trend in retail.  \nThe change, however, highlights the ever-shifting landscape of the American workforce. \nThis point isn't a new one. Everyone from liberal, Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman to Republican Senator Ben Sasse have noted that technological developments are a bigger threat to American workers than trade. The World Economic Forum estimated 5 million jobs in 15 developed economies are at risk of automation by 2020 and Citi projected that 57% of jobs in OECD nations are at risk of automation. \nIn heavy manufacturing, jobs once done by multiple humans are being replaced by robots.  Panera Bread is trying out machines that take and deliver your order, all without a human server. Even in journalism there are programs that are starting to automate simple article writing. \nTasos Katopodis/Getty Images Howard Marks, the founder of investment firm Oaktree Capital, riffed on this topic earlier this year, pointing out that US manufacturing output is near an all-time high, even though US manufacturing employment is down 37% since the peak in 1979.  \n\"Perhaps if the government wants to preserve jobs it should just outlaw productivity gains,\" he said . \nThat, of course, isn't feasible.  There is likely a long-run benefit to making processes more affordable and quicker. \nRather, the point is that refocusing the labor market on the jobs and skills that will be needed in the future is a productive way to allow innovation and keep American employed. \nThat kind of policy was barely mentioned in Trump's campaign. In fact, the president-elect  hardly mentioned the issue of technological advances destroying jobs at all, so it appears to be a huge blind spot in his proposed economic plan. \nTrump is focused on the wrong problem when it comes to the labor market.  Instead of getting old manufacturing jobs back from overseas, the government should be focused on retraining workers for the new labor market.\nNOW WATCH: In the 1970s the CIA created a spy drone the size of a dragonfly \n",

      "text": "Amazon rolls out global programme 'Launchpad' Bengaluru, Dec 06, 2016, DHNS Heightening the competition among ecommerce marketplace players in the country, Amazon on Monday rolled out its global programme ‘Launchpad’ in India to provide startups in the country a platform to market, sell and deliver products across the globe.\n\nAmazon Launchpad programme helps startups get on-boarding experience, access to custom product pages with unique content, marketing support to aid product discovery, and access to Amazon’s global customer base and fulfilment network. The tailormade platform is available for a fee of Rs 5,000 a month. India is the seventh country aster the US, the UK, China, Germany, France and Mexico to get access to this platform.\n\nCommenting on its launch, Amazon Director Global Innovations Jason Feldman said India is a unique place to launch this platform. “the connection to the startup community is rich in India...as a startup comes to us, we will help them launch not just in India but also get access to global markets spanning the US, the UK, France and Germany,” said Feldman.\n\nAmazon Launchpad has tied up with various partners operating in the ecosystem, such \nas Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion’s (DIPP) Start Up India initiative, Nasscom 10,000 startups and Indian Angel Network.\n\nThe new Amazon Launchpad store on Amazon.in features over 400 innovative products ranging from wearable technology, smart homes, food and beverage, health monitoring and educational toys among others. \n\nEven before its launch, over 25 Indian Startups have already joined the programme and are looking forward to leverage Amazon’s marketplace expertise and infrastructure to create awareness and drive sale. \n\nDemonetisation impact \nAmazon said its business in India saw a “short-term impact” in the immediate aftermath of demonetisation but has since then bounced back to “triple digit growth rate”, with ten-fold jump in customers opting for e-payment at their doorsteps. \n\nIndia, for which the company announced a $3 billion investment earlier this year, is the fastest growing geography for Amazon globally.\n\n“From impact perspective, we had to switch off cash on delivery or CoD for 48 hours when old notes were being transitioned out, and we had a short-term impact during that time. Since then, we have seen tremendous adoption by customers for electronic payment method at the doorstep...that has gone up 10 times,” Amit Agarwal, VP and Country Head, Amazon India said.\n\nAmazon India has re-started cash on delivery mode since November 11, he said, claiming normalcy has kicked in “across the board”.\n\nAmazon.in today announced the launch of its much anticipated global program – Amazon Launchpad in India. This program will make it easy for Indian Startups to launch, market, and distribute their products to millions of Amazon customers across India and around the world through a dedicated store.",

      "text": "Amazon wants to put an end to a hallmark of grocery shopping: standing in the checkout line. Amazon Go , the company’s new brick-and-mortar convenience store, will allow you to scan the Amazon Go app when you enter the store. As you wander around, the app will keep track of what you’ve put in your bag and automatically charge you on your smartphone. When you’re done shopping, you can simply walk out of the store.\nIf you decide you don’t want to purchase a product after all, you can put it back on the shelf and the app’s virtual shopping cart will update itself. Amazon is calling the technology “Just Walk Out.”\nThe first Amazon Go store is set to open in Seattle next year. The 1,800-square-foot store will offer prepared foods—including fresh breakfast, lunch and dinner—as well as staples like baked goods, bread and dairy products. The company said customers will be able to purchase items from well-known brands, as well as artisanal sellers. They’ll also find Amazon Meal Kits, which include all the ingredients you would need to make a meal for two in about 30 minutes.\nAmazon Go is currently open for beta testing for Amazon employees, and will open to the public in 2017.\nThis isn’t Amazon’s first push into creating a brick-and-mortar stores. The company will open 20 physical grocery stores in the next two years, and hopes to open as many as 2,000 in the next decade. It also opened an actual bookstore in Seattle in November 2015, with additional locations planned in New York and San Diego.",

      "text": "Amazon has started (December 5) trialing its new grocery store \"Amazon Go\" among employees in Seattle using \"Just Walk Out\" technology, where there are no queues, no cashiers, and no registers. As a customer enters the store -- which exists for employees-only in Seattle for the moment -- the app's virtual shopping cart records items picked up, even recognizing when an item is put back on a shelf. The app does not require the use of a cart or basket, instead using a system of advanced algorithms and sensors to record selected products. Leaving the store prompts automatic payment, and the app sends the user a receipt for their purchases.\nAmazon has not confirmed when or whether Amazon Go might be rolled out elsewhere, although this seems highly likely, but the Seattle store will be open to the public (who have downloaded the app) from early 2017 .\nWatch the Amazon Go video here: https://youtu.be/NrmMk1Myrxc",
