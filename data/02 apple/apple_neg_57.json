      "text": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook Needs a Hug Cook's boast about Apple Watch sales is irrelevant to AAPL stock, but it sure comforts his ego By Dana Blankenhorn , InvestorPlace Contributor | Dec 6, 2016, 9:34 am EST \nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook threw a little shade at Apple bears on Dec. 5 with an e-mail saying the Apple Watch just had its best week ever. Source: Apple \nIn the email , Cook called Watch sales growth “off the charts,” and predicted this will be the best quarter ever for the product, which debuted a year ago and has generally been considered a loser. \nCook was responding to an IDC report that third-quarter shipments for the Watch were down 71% year-over-year. He was trying to reassure potential AAPL stock buyers that the Watch remains a hit and that Apple will keep supporting it. \nWhat analysts and investors want to know today is whether Cook was being straight with them. (He wasn’t.) But what you need to understand is something more basic: namely that it doesn’t matter. \nHere’s why. Apple Watch Numbers Don’t Matter \nThe Apple Watch is a pimple on the company’s total results, and has been since it debuted in September 2015. \nIDC says the company shipped 3.9 million watches during that quarter, but only 1 million during the third quarter of this year — hence the 71% drop. \nThe truth may be quite different. Apple may have made its Christmas shipments this year during the fourth quarter, making the Q3 drop irrelevant. If it shipped 5 million units in October, and sold them all, the Watch might be a monster hit. We won’t know until AAPL reports earnings next month. \nIn fact, we may not know even then, because the Apple Watch is not material to Apple’s results, and aren’t broken out separately in its financial reports. Assuming Apple got the full retail price of its $300 watches last Christmas (which it didn’t) it would represent $1.17 billion in revenue. During the fourth quarter of 2015 Apple revenue exceeded $75 billion. \nNow, Apple didn’t get the full retail price on 3.9 million watches. It may not have gotten the full $300 on the 1 million watches. Regardless, none of this is material on a $75 billion quarter. What should matter there is whether iPhones are still selling briskly and how Apple service revenues do. \nWhat is the real issue?",

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo Research firm IDC released its latest snapshot of the wearable market yesterday. The report suggested sales of the Apple Watch are down 71 percent year-on-year between Q3 2015 and Q3 2016. Apple CEO Tim Cook immediately responded to the report in an effort to seemingly shut down fears that folks aren’t buying or won’t buy the Apple Watch for the holidays.\n“Sales growth is off the charts,” Cook told Reuters . “In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for the Apple Watch.” Cook also put the kibosh on fears the Apple Watch might not be a hot ticket holiday item. “Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year.”\nWhile Apple is clearly bullish on its wearable, this isn’t the first time IDC has published a report with a sales decline. Last month, for example, IDC said sales had fallen 70 percent since last summer . It’s possible Apple may be facing headwinds among folks who either see its wearables as too expensive and, as a result, buy products from competitors such as Fitbit. Consumers who already own the Apple Watch may also not see enough of a reason to upgrade. The new models probably still need some time to gain traction, however.\nWe may never know how well the Apple Watch sold Apple introduced three new variations of the Apple Watch just three months ago, including the Apple Watch Series 1, the Apple Watch Series 2 and a special Nike version of the Nike Watch Series 2. The new iterations sport faster processors, better battery life and are water resistant, allowing you to go swimming without fear of damaging the new wearable. A special feature even uses the watch’s speaker to spit water out after it has been submerged.\nThese features may help Apple set new records during the holiday season, but, unfortunately, we probably won’t ever know the full story. Apple has yet to publish concrete sales figures for its wearable.\n\n\nSource : IDC , Reuters ",

      "text": "WHAT: \"Romeo and Juliet\", new video from Apple, showcasing the iPhone 7&apos;s dual camera system.\nWHO: Apple \nWHY WE CARE : A (very) young and winsome Juliet anxiously awaits her Romeo. Clad in a swishing, silken cape, the similarly youthful Romeo runs through the moonlit streets of Verona and arrives at the Capulet castle. The star-crossed youngsters deliver a perfect rendition of the balcony scene from Act II Scene II of Shakespeare’s classic.\nWho is the producer of this cinematic epic? Some heavyweight Hollywood type? Nah, actually it’s dad. It’s Juliet’s dad with an iPhone 7, demonstrating that the phone’s camera system capabilities are so advanced that video of your kid’s school play can feel like a real movie. Even when you’re so choked with parental pride your eyes are filled with tears. The 30-second spot is the latest in Apple’s \"Practically Magic\" campaign, which kicked off in September with \" Balloons \", a spot launching expressive messaging. Both ads aim to convey the human emotions that can be experienced when using devices rather than the nuts and bolts of the technology.",

      "title": "Apple, Which Doesn't Reveal Watch Sales Data, Says Watch Sales Are Great",
      "text": " 00AM from the great-sales dept. Though several companies are struggling to sell their smartwatches , Apple CEO Tim Cook says sales of Apple Watch set a record during the first week of holiday shopping . Cook added that the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product. The only problem: The company, which loves to numbers do all the talking, won't disclose how many Apple Watch units were shipped or sold. From a report on Mashable: \"During the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch,\" Cook told Reuters in an email. This is not surprising: The company has never revealed any sales data for the Watch, bundling it with the \"other products\" category in its earnings reports. There have been quite a few attempts to extrapolate what this means in numbers, but the truth is that any of those attempts could be a few million units wrong either way.",

      "text": "print Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook waves after meeting with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Abe's official residence in Tokyo, Japan, October 14, 2016. REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nArtificial intelligence researchers at Apple are going to start publishing some of their work and engaging more with the wider academic community. \nRuss Salakhutd, director of AI research at Apple and a professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania, made the announcement at the NIPS conference in on Tuesday, according to a series of tweets from conference attendees. \nThe Californian tech giant has traditionally kept research breakthroughs to itself, seeing any developments as valuable intellectual property (IP), so this is a major change in direction. \nCompanies like Google and Facebook already allow their employees to publish their research across a number of fields, including AI. \nYann LeCun, Facebook's AI director, told Business Insider last month that Apple's closed off approach could hinder its ability to hire the best people in the field of AI. \nDescribing how he gets the most talented software engineers in the world to come and work on Facebook's AI efforts, LeCun said: \"Offering researchers the possibility of doing open research, which is publishing their work. \n\"In fact, at FAIR [Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research], it’s not just a possibility, it’s a requirement,\" he said in London. \"So, [when] you’re a researcher, you assume that you’re going to publish your work. It’s very important for a scientist because the currency of the career as a scientist is the intellectual impact. So you can’t tell people 'come work for us but you can’t tell people what you’re doing' because you basically ruin their career. That’s a big element.\" \nApple will start publishing, according to @rsalakhu at #nips2016 pic.twitter.com/I0ndKKc2vB",

      "title": "Why It’s Time for Tim Cook to Release Apple Watch Sales Numbers",
      "text": "The time has come for Apple and its chief executive Tim Cook to overcome its fears of announcing Apple Watch sales figures.\nOn Monday, research firm IDC released its latest report on the health of the wearables market . While in general, the broader wearables market performed relatively well in the third quarter on 23 million shipments worldwide, that was largely ignored. Instead, the focus was on Apple and its Apple Watch, which IDC said saw sales decline by 71% year over year. Apple Watch shipments hovered at just 1.1 million units in the third quarter, compared to 3.9 million in the same period last year.\nIn an uncharacteristic move, Apple quickly responded to the report. Speaking to Reuters in an emailed statement published on Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said Apple Watch is quite popular and is on pace to be one of the most desired gifts this holiday season.\n“Sales growth is off the charts,” he told Reuters. “In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.”\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nCook’s comments have quickly sparked a debate. Those in support of Apple say IDC’s data is based on estimates and could be grossly miscalculated. They also point to IDC’s acknowledgment that its shipment figures were down in part because of Apple’s release of its Apple Watch Series 2 towards the end of the quarter, not allowing the company to enjoy the full benefit of the new smartwatch’s availability during the third quarter. IDC added, however, that the major reasons for the Apple Watch’s trouble “were an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface.”\nApple detractors have pointed to IDC’s second point for proof that the Apple Watch is falling short of expectations. Some have also used the data to support their arguments that Apple Watch is a “ failure .”\nIn reality, it’s hard to know the truth . IDC doesn’t have a line on actual Apple Watch sales from Apple’s own retail stores and gets its information from “great sources in the supply chain as well as analysts around the world who gather local information,” according to analyst Jitesh Ubrani, who spoke to Fortune . So there is some guesswork that goes into its data. It’s also true that Tim Cook would be in the best position to know how well Apple Watch is selling.\nThe trouble, though, is Cook’s comments offer no context. He didn’t share actual sales figures and has only said that Apple Watch has enjoyed a stellar start to the holiday shopping season.\nIf Apple wants the world to believe Apple Watch is successful--something it apparently does given Cook’s swift response to IDC--it must release Apple Watch sales numbers.\nFor more about Apple’Watch, watch: \nSince its release in 2015, Apple Watch has been a conundrum for investors, market watchers, and analysts. Apple Watch is lumped into the company’s “Other Products” category with Apple TV, Beats products, and others. Apple has declined to provide sales figures each quarter under the dubious pretense that sharing such information could help its competitors.\nEach quarter, Cook touts the Apple Watch’s success in general terms, leaving everyone else wondering just how much the device is contributing to Apple’s revenue and profits.\nWhile Apple has been able to justify its move in the past, increasing scrutiny on softness in the smartwatch market and on Apple Watch sales, in general, might call into question Cook’s strategy. IDC is firmly standing by its findings and Ubrani was quick to note to Fortune that Cook didn’t reject IDC’s report. There is reason to believe, then, that Apple Watch’s third quarter was as bad as IDC says.\nOf course, Apple might disagree and follow up with some information about the third quarter. But absent actual sales figures, it’s impossible to know for sure what happened. And we’ll all be left to speculate on the smartwatch’s performance based solely on third-party information.\nIf Apple truly wants this Apple Watch mess to go away--and Cook’s comments to Reuters suggests it does--it needs to release Apple Watch sales figures. It’s the only way to put the debate to rest.",

      "text": "Home / News / Fitness News / Tim Cook: Apple Watch sales growth 'off the charts' Tim Cook: Apple Watch sales growth 'off the charts' \nby Joe Roberts Read Comments \nTim Cook claims the Apple Watch is 'doing great' following a report from research company IDC which claimed sales of the smartwatch last quarter were down 71% year on year. \nIn an email to Reuters , the Apple CEO said: \"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year.\" \nHis comments come after the IDC report claimed the Apple Watch was struggling to gain traction due to “an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface.” \nThe Apple Watch Series 2 launched in September, bringing with it a host of new features including a more intuitive watchOS 3 and waterproofing. \nRelated: CES 2017 \nAccording to Cook, the latest update has paid off, as the device's sell-through, which measures how many units have been sold to consumers, rather than those sitting on shelves, reached a new high. \nIn his email, Cook added: \"Sales growth is off the charts. In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.\" \nDespite his positive comments, Cook decided to withold any specific sales numbers, so at this point there's no hard data to back up his claims. \nApple is, in fact, yet to provide any data on sales of its smartwatch, which is classed as \"other product\", along with iPods and Apple TV, in its latest earnings report. \nThe company's annual revenue declined year on year for the first time since 2001 this year, falling from $233.7 billion in 2015 to $217 billion in 2016. \nCommenting on the \"other products\" classification, analyst Bob O'Donnell told Reuters: \"While I’m not surprised that there is a good week, there are still, I think, significant concerns about the category.\" \nWATCH: iPhone 7 Review \nWill you be buying an Apple Watch for Christmas?

      "text": "The Roman Empire fell, so will Apple, Facebook or Google. 2001: A Space Odyssey For centuries, Homo Sapiens have dealt with Empires. Since the late agricultural revolution — along with the invention of the first forms of writings — , we believe in some myths. Those myths were the Holy Catholic Church, the Victorian Empire, or the United States of America. Some of them are still believed, some aren’t. Today, the new Empires are Apple, Facebook, or Google. They exist because you think they do, because you believe in them; you might hate or love them, you won’t deny they ARE. But by essence, they are myth in which we believe, the sum of many little things visible, or barely visible, and that’s exactly why they can’t last forever; neither “democracy” nor “Google” will. You want to be the next Apple ? Go ahead, they will fall, it might be in a year or in a century, but they will. Emperor Hadrien, Famous inter alia for building a wall in Scotland separating the Civilised world from Northern barbarians. (Which inspired famous TV show Game of Thrones) “SPQR”, For the Senate and the People of Rome. In this they believed for roughly a thousand years. — I’m being very sketchy on purpose here because there are hundreds of possible length of Rome depending on what you take into account , what do you take for the beginning of Rome and what do you take for its fall , anyway, we all agree it did work for a very very long time — Purple for the Senate, Red for the Empire. All of us would have believed in it as well at that time, it’s complicated to realise, how powerful, and how culturally influent was the Roman Empire at that time. It’s not the only great Empire, we could look deeper at the Napoleonic Empire for example, but it was succinct. Even thought it have marked the world in a timeless way, and some of its fruits are still visible today worldwide, it didn’t last for long and its existence was strongly correlated with Napoléon Bonaparte. So that’s why I’m taking the example of Rome here: Because it was stable, flexible and therefore amazingly sustainable. It was an organisation that did work independently of individual or of any of its components. Senators succeeded, all kind of princeps succeeded as well, the bests but also the worses. To give famous examples, Neron did set the city on fire, and Caligula appointed its Horse as a Consul, most of the components of the Empire have been through their bests and their worses times, Rome was keep going on. They could be defeated, multiple battles in a row, in the end they were winning the war. Did Rome fall after the city was on fire or because its consul was a horse ? It didn’t, it was more than that. Just like Apple didn’t collapse after the death of Steve Jobs, and it won’t neither if all of the iPhones battery suddenly exploded. Roman Empire under Trajan reign. If Rome issued bonds or stocks, well you would have probably bought them, even at a very low/negative coupon rate or at an unfair P/E ratio, and they would have been BY FAR the least risky securities of their kinds in the world. They would have been the benchmark. But it did fall. If you would have bought a perpetual bond not so long before it collapsed, you’d have been fucked. And trust me, you would have buy this security. What do we use to value a company ? A perpetual growth rate. Wait what ? Yes, we assume the firm will be forever. Would you buy a Apple stock at a fair (industry average) P/B value ? You would be stupid not to if you can afford it. Because well Apple have beautiful days coming right ? It can’t collapse anytime soon, and it will be here for at least a century. Well maybe, maybe not. You can’t easily see it coming, Rome didn’t collapse because of a superpower crushing it, neither did it because of the multiples attacks of eastern barbarians. Come on, Western Roman Empire had over 300 000 soldiers when it fell, trained to fight as an Army, perfectly organised, equipped and efficiently managed, how comes those splited small groups of barbarians could possibly beat Rome ? Well just as most of great disasters (it works for great things as well), it was the sum of multiple small things with little significance that wouldn’t even have shake Rome by themselves independently. Those little things were corruptions, greed, and lack of communication. Rome was constantly attacked by small barbarians groups, that’s a fact, but that’s only one of those little things among others, there were also economic troubles that led to severe taxations widening the gap between the rich and the poor, therefore, poor people were not believing as much as before in Rome (And that’s where you start to fall), local rebellions started to appear everywhere, and rich people were doing corruption and tax evasions. The eastern empire was rising, and they failed to collaborate, hence weakening each others, the senate was corrupted, and the emperor were having shortening life expectancy, at a point it became nearly a death sentence to be the “Princeps”. The rise of Christianity was giving people something else to believe in, something above Rome, somewhat incompatible with the values of the Empire and leading to cognitive dissonance. The sum of all those little things led to the collapse of one of the most powerful and stable organisation of all times. David vs Goliath If it happened to Rome, it can happen to anything. You want to compete with Facebook with your 10 000USD start-up ? Go ahead. I wouldn’t say it’s super likely that you will replace Facebook, but it is possible, and it will happen, one day or another. No matter you have ridiculous means, with other little things happening (Maybe that’s just what we call “luck”), it could work. We’re already seeing some signs of weaknesses, Google is releasing a Smartphone and a VR headset ? This isn’t a weakness by itself, but it show little things have happened within the organisation, and the one that once was investing in innovation and in the future, now copy to get immediate cash flows, sound like a company ruled by Wall Street, not by Larry Page. Despite being amazingly managed, Facebook is seeing decreasing interest from its users in its newsfeed. Apple is stagnating, increasing sales could be only inertia of earlier times. Twitter is crawling for profitability. Those associated with other little things, could cause the collapse of those firms, they could also not, because powerful and stable organisation can endure much more, and can handle a lot of defeat before dying for real. It could also be. I’m writing this not as a hater that wish any successful corporation to fall, but because I believe it is important to see this world as it is really : A succession of temporary myths. Except for what is purely biological, nothing is eternal and in some extent, nothing is real. Rémy Astié ps: English is not my native language, so please excuse any spelling mistakes or awkward sentences, don’t hesitate to tell me so that I will correct :) pps: There are few counterexamples, some companies are very very old, and very very stable, and it seems like anything can happens in this world, they won’t fall, but they are usually small companies, having under 100 employees, I will write soon about those companies, and particularly why so much of them are Japanese.",

(Photo: Apple) \nHow's the Apple Watch doing in its second holiday season? If you ask Apple CEO Tim Cook, the answer is \"great.\" \nCook told Reuters via email that sales for the company's smartwatch have been \"off the charts.\" Sell-through of the Watch, an important metric counting the shipments going to consumers as opposed to retailer shelves, \"was greater than any week in the product’s history\" during the first week of the holiday shopping season. \n\"And as we expected,\" Cook continued, \"we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.\" \nCook's response comes amid growing concerns for the wearable category, particularly Apple. On Monday research firm IDC released its third quarter wearable data and found that Apple sold only 1.1 million Watches during the third quarter of 2016, down from 3.9 million last year, a 71% drop. Rival Fitbit, by comparison, sold 5.3 million wearables in the third quarter, up from 4.8 million last year. \nApple does not break out sales numbers for the Apple Watch, choosing to include it in an \"other products\" category alongside devices such as the Apple TV and iPod. \nApple updated the Watch in September, coming out with a faster version of last year's Watch, now called the Series 1, for $269, and a waterproof model, called Series 2, which starts at $369. It also partnered with Nike to release a running-focused version in late October. You'll love Apple Watch Nike+ if you need a boost \nCook expects the new models to be a hit, telling the news agency that \"our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year.\" \n\"This is exactly what I would expect,\" says Avi Greengart, research director for consumer platforms and devices at Current Analysis. \"Apple Watch is a holiday gift, so it is not surprising that it's selling well around the holidays.\" Greengart also says the recent update Apple made to the Watch in September allowed it to be \"faster lower price points, and more focused on fitness at higher price points.\" \nThere are, however, still concerns for the category, with Google delaying its long-awaited update to its Android Wear software until next year and early smartwatch maker Pebble rumored to be selling itself to Fitbit. \n\"In general the smartwatch category is troubled,\" says Greengart, \"it's clear that we're at a point in the smartwatch evolution where people are realizing that unless you give consumers a concrete reason to buy, they won't.\" \nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal .

(Photo: JUNG YEON-JE, AFP/Getty Images) \nWASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that Samsung's violation of Apple's smartphone design patents can involve only a component, rather than the entire product -- a decision that means Samsung may not have to pay penalties reaching into the hundreds of millions of dollars. \nThe unanimous decision from Justice Sonia Sotomayor was a much-needed victory for Samsung, beset with problems ranging from smartphones that burst into flames to washers with exploding tops. It initially faced nearly $1 billion in penalties, later reduced to $548 million, for imitating elements of the iPhone's design. \nThe justices reasoned that the patent infringement could affect just a component of the phones, such as their appearance, rather than all their capabilities. During oral argument in October, Chief Justice John Roberts had noted Samsung did not infringe on \"all the chips and wires.\" \n\"The term 'article of manufacture' is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product whether sold separately or not,\" Sotomayor wrote. \nThe legal battle between the two technology giants represented the first design patent case to reach the high court in more than a century. A jury in 2012 had ruled that because Samsung infringed on three of Apple's iPhone design patents, it must fork over the entire profits from the phones in question. \nSamsung's attorney, Kathleen Sullivan, had told the justices the award was improper. \"A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work,\" she said. \nSamsung's attorney, Kathleen Sullivan, answers questions outside the Supreme Court following oral argument Oct. 11. (Photo: Kevin Wolf, AP Images for Samsung) \nNow the case will return to a lower court to determine what portion of its profits Samsung must pay -- a process several justices predicted will be difficult. While some product designs may be relatively insignificant, others -- such as a Volkswagen Beetle, some justices noted -- are iconic. \nThe five-year-old battle between the world's two most successful smartphone makers had threatened to upend the tech industry. It was watched closely by companies with a stake in the outcome -- from Facebook, Google, Dell and Lenovo on Samsung's side, to more than 100 designers from companies such as Nike and Calvin Klein in Apple's corner.

      "text": "Getty Images The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled for Samsung in a dispute over damages related to Apple 's iPhone design. \nThe ruling allows a reconsideration of some damages Samsung owes Apple. \nThis case began in 2011, when Apple sued Samsung for copying design features of its devices, including, among other things, its colorful grid of app icons. Two lower courts ruled in Apple's favor on design-patent infringement. \nAt dispute is $399 million dollars, representing profits from Samsung smartphones, which Samsung was ordered to pay Apple.\n\nThat penalty is based on a federal law that says that a party copying and applying a patented design to \"any article of manufacture\" is liable \"to the extent of his total profit.\"\nSamsung countered that the penalty is disproportionate. Specifically, the South Korean giant says Apple is not entitled to total profits from the entire phone, but only the profit from the components that infringe.\n— CNBC's Josh Lipton contributed to this report.",

The court said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nThe case now returns to a lower court for further proceeding in the case.",

      "text": "This multi-port accessory adds back everything Apple removed from the latest MacBook Pro This multi-port accessory adds back everything Apple removed from the latest MacBook Pro By Joel Hruska   8:38 am Comment \nApple’s new MacBook Pro is a dongle-happy mess for anyone who uses peripherals manufactured prior to 2017, since the system only supports Thunderbolt 3 by default. Apple’s solution to the problem has been to push users towards a variety of dongles for replacing various aspects of Mac functionality. There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with dongles, but using 2-4 of them on a machine supposedly engineered for svelte lines and simple user experiences doesn’t sit well with many users. Enter the HyperDrive — an all-in-one Kickstarter project that hopes to replicate all of the ports that are missing on the current MacBook Pro in a single product. \nThe HyperDrive includes support for HDMI output (1080p and 4K@30Hz), Thunderbolt 3 pass-through, USB-C, SD and microSD cards, and 2x USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports with support for 5Gbps of speed. HyperDrive claims that the system is capable of up to 45Gb/s of bandwidth, which seems to imply that while the system plugs into two Thunderbolt 3 slots on either the right or left-hand side of the machine, it can’t fully tap the bandwidth of both ports (otherwise maximum theoretical bandwidth would be in the 80GB/s range). \nEven so, the claims here are impressive. Hyper promises it can offer simultaneous access to USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, SD cards, and 2x USB 3.1 ports all while charging the laptop itself. \nLeft unanswered is why Apple itself hasn’t built this type of product yet. Even if the company wanted to offer single cables or dongles for those individuals with one specific use, it could still manufacture and sell an all-in-one solution like this to fill the most common use cases that its own hardware no longer allows. No dongle will ever hit every single port capability anyone might want, but the ports and options here are solid and should fit virtually any situation. \nThe HyperDrive will be available in both silver and Space Gray and is machined out of CNC aluminum to match the MBP itself. Availability is expected in March, with a final retail price of $100 (KS backers will receive their hardware for $70). We don’t normally cover Kickstarter campaigns on ET, and this article shouldn’t be mistaken as an endorsement, but Hyper is a ten-year-old company that sells its own peripherals, accessories, and products. This puts it at least a small step up from other projects. Mac customers may not want to wait for months to get a solution to the dongle problem, but if the timing lines up for your personal purchase this may be worth paying attention to.",

It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years.\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)\nWhat do you think?

      "text": "Does the lack of dongles on the new MacBook Pro keep you from nabbing the Apple laptop? If so, then HyperDrive's USB-C hub may be just the thing you need. ( HyperDrive | Kickstarter ) Advertisement \nApple's new MacBook Pro came with a big problem: it only has two Thunderbolt 3 ports, and while the model with the Touch Bar and Touch ID does have four, it doesn't really keep users away from the whole dongle issue. \nThat said, the HyperDrive Compact Thunderbolt 3 USB-C Hub for MacBook Pro — quite a mouthful, really — is here to save the day. What Is HyperDrive? \nAccording to the people behind the product, it uses two Thunderbolt 3 connections to maximize speed and brings a lot of ports to the table, including two USB 3.1 ports, a microSD slot, an SD slot, a USB-C port, a Thunderbolt 3 port and an HDMI port. \nFor those who are wondering, there's no Ethernet port present, but other than that, USB-C hub gives the MacBook Pro 2016 all the ports that the MacBook Pro 2015 offered. Why Is It A Hero Of Sorts? \nWhen the new MacBook Pro rolled out, a lot of users were disappointed at the lack of ports, which made them dependent on dongles and adapters to access a USB drive or SD card and even charge their iPhones . \nThanks to HyperDrive Compact Thunderbolt 3 USB-C Hub for MacBook Pro, those problems will be a thing of the past. Reliability \nThe best part of this new accessory is that it's made by a company with years of experience in manufacturing external batteries for MacBook units and dongles for the 12-inch MacBook. \nThat means HyperDrive isn't just any ordinary startup that's looking to make its first splash in the market, as it already has the know-how in the industry. Pricing And Availability \nThe expected retail price of this nifty USB-C hub is $99 when it hit the shelves, but for those who act quick, it's available for $69 as a Kickstarter Special on the makers' page . \nAt the time of this writing, the campaign has already garnered more than $145,000 with 42 days still left on its clock, exceeding the $100,000 goal by a mile. \nBefore wrapping things up, be sure to check out our comparison between the new MacBook Pro and the MacBook Pro from 2015 to help you decide whether or not the upgrade is worth it. \nWith everything said and done, what do you think of the HyperDrive Compact Thunderbolt 3 USB-C Hub for MacBook Pro?

      "text": "Apple Watch Goes Down As Fitbit Tops Q3 Wearable Market, IDC Says 6 December 2016, 5:32 am EST By Chris Loterina Tech Times Apple has lost to Fitbit in the battle for dominance in the wearable devices market. This is blamed on the increasing interest on basic wearables and fitness bands rather than smartwatches like the Apple Watch. ( Fitbit ) Advertisement \nFitbit has roundly trounced Apple in the wearable device category according to the latest IDC report, which covered the third quarter of 2016. \nFitbit claimed 23 percent of the wearable devices market whereas the Apple Watch range struggled to secure a measly 5 percent share. Wearable Market Expansion And Apple's Performance \nThe figures in the IDC report are interesting for industry observers because they revealed that the wearable devices market as a whole has expanded. On the other hand, the smartmatch segment has declined, following a consistent trend in the market. \nApple's dismal performance is even highlighted by the drastic drop in its market share when compared with the same quarter last year. Cupertino shipped 3.9 million Apple Watches in Q3 2015 to secure 17.5 percent of the wearable device market. The company only managed 1.1 million shipments last quarter. \nThe drop reflected a staggering 71 percent year-over-year decline. \nAccording to IDC, the poor showing of Apple devices can be attributed to an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface. \n\"Though both issues have been addressed with the latest generation watches, Apple's success will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged,\" the report stated . \nAs a result, Apple tumbled one notch down the ranking and was replaced by erstwhile GPS manufacturer Garmin. Chinese upstart Xiaomi has maintained its second spot ranking. Fitbit's Gain \nIt is important to note that Fitbit's gain has been driven by the market's interest in basic wearables. This product segment, which is largely composed of fitness bands , accounted for 85 percent market share. \nFitbit posted an impressive 11 percent year-over-year growth and this is said to be partly due to the sale of new wearables such as the Alta, Blaze, Charge 2 and Flex 2. The company also stands to gain further once it successfully acquires Pebble. Emergent Players \nAside from Xiaomi, Samsung is also increasing its market share and it is on track to toppling Apple from its current perch should the trend continue. In the same period last year, the South Korean company only shipped around 500,000 of its wearables . Last quarter, that number increased to 1 million, which reflects an astounding 90 percent year-over-year growth. Simplicity Is Key \nIDC claims that, with Fitbit's ascendancy and Apple's decline, there is now a notable shift in the market. \n\"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme,\" Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst at IDC, said. \"Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device.\" TAG © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

      "text": "Shares of Apple Inc. climbed 1% in premarket trade Tuesday, after Chief Executive Tim Cook sought to reassure investors that the Apple Watch was selling well. In an email to Reuters, Cook said Apple Watch sales to consumers set a record in the holiday week, and that it was doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts, and that sales growth was off the charts. However, Cook did not provide actual sales data. His email followed a report by IDC that third-quarter Apple Watch shipments plunged 71% versus a year ago. Apple's stock has gained 3.7% in 2016 through Monday, while the SPDR Technology Select Sector ETF has climbed 10.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average , of which Apple is a component, has run up 10.3%.\nCopyright © 2016 MarketWatch, Inc.",

      "title": "One upside of Nigeria’s dollar shortage, Apple, like Facebook, will now accept the naira",
      "text": "To cope with a worsening dollar shortage over the last year, Nigeria’s Central Bank has proposed a number of controversial policies . One of those has been suspending the use of local currency denominated debit cards for international transactions.\nFor local businesses, the effect of the policy has been tough. Unable to pay for raw materials and imports with local currency denominated cards, they’re forced to purchase dollars at a steep price on the parallel market. Jet-setting Nigerians have also had vacation and shopping trips disrupted. But, a silver lining is starting to emerge.\nFaced with losing subscribers in Africa’s largest economy, some of the world’s biggest tech companies are beginning to charge for services in naira, Nigeria’s local currency, rather than US dollars. Over the past month, Apple subscribers have taken to social media to complain about being unable to pay for the company’s services.\nGreat. I can't pay for my Apple Music subscription because my country has blocked all foreign transactions on all Naira cards. \n— SF (@segunfamisa) October 18, 2016 \n@AllyShimmer They've cut me off everything. Apple music, iCloud storage, BBM subscription. \nNigeria is stifling.\n— Agboola .S. (@AgboolaS) November 6, 2016 \nSo my @DiamondBankNG and @StanbicIBTC Nigeria cards can't pay for my @AppleMusic subscription and I lost all my music. Sad stuff\n— Tony Montana (@Dayo36) November 2, 2016 \nAs a result, Apple has announced that it will start charging subscribers for its various services in naira, the local currency. In an email, Apple told subscribers “the currency of the App Store, the iTunes Store, and Apple Music in Nigeria will soon be changing from U.S. dollars to Nigerian naira.” Following the currency change, Apple said, “pre-orders or subscriptions” will be billed in naira.\nLooks like that Apple Music money from Nigeria is too much for Apple to ignore pic.twitter.com/RElCkkUihv \n— Hafiz Ibrahim (@fizo07) December 3, 2016 \nBefore Apple, Facebook had also adopted a similar tact. The social networking site started charging for ad campaigns in naira back in June, as the currency situation got worse. Nigeria, with more users than anywhere else on the continent, represents an important market for Facebook. Google started accepting naira payments for apps and games in its Play Store in Aug. 2015, just as the forex problems started to bite initially. But Google still requires Nigerian business users of its AdSense and AdWords services to pay in dollars.\nFor months, Nigeria has battled a forex crisis triggered mainly the drop in the price of oil, its main export. With government revenues plummeting, the value of Nigeria’s naira has crashed for much of the past year. While initially putting a fixed exchange rate in place to peg the value of the naira against the dollar, a devaluation of the currency in June has resulted in a steep drop in value, making it more expensive and difficult for Nigerians to get hold of scarce dollars.\nSign up for the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief — the most important and interesting news from across the continent, in your inbox.

      "title": "UPDATE 2-U.S. Supreme Court rules for Samsung in smartphone fight with Apple",
      "text": "(Adds more details from decision, background on case, paragraphs 6-17)\nDec 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that said the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.\nThe justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings.\nThe decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple's iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices.\nThe court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing.\nThe ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone's trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years.\nSamsung had been seeking to pare back $399 million of $548 million it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict finding that it infringed Cupertino, California-based Apple's iPhone patents and copied its distinctive appearance.\nAfter a trial in 2012, Apple was awarded nearly $930 million in damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington in May 2015 upheld the patent infringement verdict, but said the iPhone's appearance could not be protected through trademarks. That cut Samsung's damages back by $382 million.\nThe legal dispute centered on whether the term \"article of manufacture\" in U.S. patent law should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product.\nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component.\nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the patent law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote.\nSamsung in December 2015 paid Apple $548 million. But it took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make $399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications.\nApple said its iPhone's success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone's look and many user interface features, Apple said.\nSamsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits on phones that infringed iPhone design patents, saying those elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features.\nWith the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world's top smartphone maker.\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in the case on Oct. 11.\nDesign patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham)",

Press Trust of India | Last Updated: December 06, 2016 21:11 (IST) Press Trust of India EMAIL COMMENTS New Delhi: Apple Inc officials today met Commerce Ministry top brass amid its plans to open stores in India without initially having to source components locally.According to sources, the meeting chaired by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) Secretary Ramesh Abhishek lasted for almost an hour with senior officials from Apple discussing details of the new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) rules in single-brand retail and the company's retailexpansion plans.Apple officials are believed to have sought clarity on the changes in mandatory domestic sourcing norms for single brand retail brought in earlier this year. However, no official word on the meeting was received from either side.In June this year, government had relaxed FDI norms by giving a three-year exemption from local sourcing to foreign players in single-brand retail and a five-year relaxation for 'state-of-the-art' and 'cutting-edge' technology.India is one of the fastest growing markets for the Cupertino-based company. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, Apple's iPhone sales in India were up 51 per cent year-on-year.In May this year, Apple's CEO Tim Cook had visited India and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as key industry leaders like Sunil Bharti Mittal and veteran banker ChandaKocchar.Apple had also announced setting up of a design and development accelerator to support Indian developers creating innovative applications for iOS and opened a new office in Hyderabad to accelerate maps development.Cook during his May visit, had discussed issues including manufacturing and setting up retail stores in the country with Modi.The FDI rules for single brand retail call for mandatory sourcing of at least 30 per cent inputs from domestic companies.

Posted 06 Dec 2016 23:25 Updated 06 Dec 2016 23:50 A Samsung logo and a logo of Apple are seen in this September 23, 2014 illustration photo in Sarajevo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Files A \nREUTERS: The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that said the South Korean company had to pay a US$399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. \nThe justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings. \nThe decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple's iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. \nThe court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. \nThe ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone's trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years. \nSamsung had been seeking to pare back US$399 million of US$548 million it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict finding that it infringed Cupertino, California-based Apple's iPhone patents and copied its distinctive appearance. \nAfter a trial in 2012, Apple was awarded nearly US$930 million in damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington in May 2015 upheld the patent infringement verdict, but said the iPhone's appearance could not be protected through trademarks. That cut Samsung's damages back by US$382 million. \nThe legal dispute centered on whether the term \"article of manufacture\" in U.S. patent law should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product. \nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component. \nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the patent law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote. \nSamsung in December 2015 paid Apple US$548 million. But it took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make US$399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications. \nApple said its iPhone's success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone's look and many user interface features, Apple said. \nSamsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits on phones that infringed iPhone design patents, saying those elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features. \nWith the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world's top smartphone maker. \nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in the case on Oct. 11. \nDesign patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years. \n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham) - Reuters",

      "text": "As part of its App Store policy, Apple can choose to give refunds to customers who are unsatisfied with an app they download. It’s a good, common-sense move, and a valuable tool for anyone who’s ever read a description, downloaded the app, and then wondered if they’re even using the same piece of software.\nBut according to some developers, customers are abusing the refund policy to get free games, and Apple is turning a blind eye to the practice.\nDON’T MISS: Galaxy Note 7 fires were caused by over-ambitious design, engineers find\nA report in the The Korea Times details how a communication failure between Apple and the developers lets people get away with free stuff:\n“Apple holds full control in paying refunds on paid for mobile content such as games. It determines whether to give refunds to consumers.\nBut the content developer cannot take part in the process under Apple’s refund policy. Apple does not even provide information about the users who have requested and received the refund, claiming it is to protect consumer rights. For this reason, the developers have no other choice but to manually track down the users and check if they continue to use the charged content they have already received refunds for.\nOn the backdrop of this, some users have abused the loophole in Apple’s refund policy to purchase charged content multiple times, request refunds and continue to consume the content without actually paying for it. In particular, some of the abusers have organized profitable businesses to operate the refund process on others’ behalf. “\nIf the game studios alleging abuse of Apple’s policies are right, this is a serious problem. Limited cases of abuse are one thing that Apple can be expected to slowly deal with; setting up businesses to get free stuff out of the App Store is a much more major short-term problem.\nFour Korean game studios told The Korea Times that they’ve started cross-checking data to work out users who are repeatedly requesting refunds, and have moved to block them. But with no help from Apple, it’s a long and difficult struggle for the developers. That adds to the costs of trying to make money from the App Store, and while the plight of a couple developers probably doesn’t move you, the long-term damage it could do to Apple’s vital dev community is genuinely serious.\nTrending right now:\nGet ready for a limited NES Classic Edition sale tomorrow morning Samsung may adopt a beloved iPhone 7 feature for the Galaxy S8, and it’s not the camera Watch the new SNL sketch that had Donald Trump fuming on Twitter See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) By SAM HANANEL The Associated Press WASHINGTON — \nA unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. Copyright The Associated Press \nThere are no comments yet. Be the first to post your thoughts.

      "text": "High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple Posted: By SAM HANANELAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen.\nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits.\nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve.\nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look.\nSam Hananel, The Associated Press",

      "text": "Samsung scores an 8-0 Supreme Court ruling in Apple patent case Posted Google updates its search app, makes your personalized feed the main screen \nThis morning’s Supreme Court ruling was nothing if not decisive. The nation’s highest court handed down an 8-0 ruling in favor of the South Korean smartphone maker in its on-going legal battle against its chief competitor. \nThe case, which dates back to 2011, centers around design patents. Apple sued the phone maker over hardware and software design, including, notably, the use of a grid of icons. Apple scored wins with two lower courts, ultimately walking away with $399 million stemming from infrigment found on 11 different smartphone models. \nSamsung fired back against the massive damage award in a case that went all the way to the high court. In today’s one-sided ruling, the court agreed that Samsung’s damages shouldn’t amount to the total sale of the products at issue, given the fact that the dispute only applied to pieces of the product, rather that the whole. \nThe seemingly endless battle isn’t quite over yet, of course. The case will be sent back down to a lower court to reassess the damages. At the very least, it’s a little silver lining for what has otherwise been a pretty rough year for Samsung and should give other handset makers a bit more wiggle room when it comes to design language. 0",

      "text": "WHAT: A new version of \"Romeo and Juliet\" from Apple to showcase the iPhone 7&apos;s dual camera system.\nWHO: Apple\nWHY WE CARE : A (very) young and winsome Juliet anxiously awaits her Romeo. Clad in a swishing, silken cape, the similarly youthful Romeo runs through the moonlit streets of Verona and arrives at the Capulet castle. The star-crossed youngsters deliver a perfect rendition of the balcony scene from Act II Scene II of Shakespeare’s classic.\nWho is the producer of this cinematic epic? Some heavyweight Hollywood type? Nah, actually it’s just dad. It’s Juliet’s dad with an iPhone 7, demonstrating that the phone’s camera system capabilities are so advanced that a video of your kid’s school play can feel like a real movie. Even when you’re so choked with parental pride your eyes are filled with tears.\nThe 30-second spot is the latest in Apple’s \"Practically Magic\" campaign, which kicked off in September with \" Balloons \", a spot launching expressive messaging. Both ads clearly aiming to convey the human emotions that can be experienced when using devices, rather than the nuts and bolts of the technology.",

A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) \nA unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen , the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit .\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look.

      "text": "View photos\nA Samsung logo and a logo of Apple are seen in this September 23, 2014 illustration photo in Sarajevo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Files More By Andrew Chung\n(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that said the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.\nThe justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings.\nThe decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple's iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices.\nThe court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing.\nThe ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone's trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years.\nSamsung had been seeking to pare back $399 million of $548 million it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict finding that it infringed Cupertino, California-based Apple's iPhone patents and copied its distinctive appearance.\nAfter a trial in 2012, Apple was awarded nearly $930 million in damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington in May 2015 upheld the patent infringement verdict, but said the iPhone's appearance could not be protected through trademarks. That cut Samsung's damages back by $382 million.\nThe legal dispute centered on whether the term \"article of manufacture\" in U.S. patent law should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product.\nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component.\nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the patent law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote.\nSamsung in December 2015 paid Apple $548 million. But it took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make $399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications.\nApple said its iPhone's success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone's look and many user interface features, Apple said.\nSamsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits on phones that infringed iPhone design patents, saying those elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features.\nWith the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world's top smartphone maker.\nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in the case on Oct. 11.\nDesign patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years.\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham)",

      "text": "The Supreme Court has overturned Apple's $400 million award in its long-running patent lawsuit against Samsung. Apple won the case in 2012, convincing a federal court that a number of Samsung devices had infringed upon iPhone design patents — including one for a rectangular device with rounded corners and bezels, and another for a home screen comprised of a grid of colorful apps. The Supreme Court’s decision today does not reverse Apple’s win, but does mean that the case will be returned to the Federal Circuit so that the damages can be reassessed. \nThe Supreme Court’s judgement is complicated, but hinges on the method by which damages are calculated for cases involving the infringement of design patents. The $400 million won by Apple was based on a percentage of the entire profit Samsung made from its infringing smartphones. But, the South Korean company argued that this figure shouldn’t be based on the entire profit, but only part of the profit, as only part of the phone’s design was copied from Apple. The Supreme Court agreed that damages could be calculated this way — but it declined to say whether they should be in this particular case.\nIn a nine-page judgement published today, Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that damages could be calculated based on the entire profit of an infringing product or based on only part of the product’s profit. But Apple and Samsung didn’t brief the court on which should apply in this particular dispute, so the Supreme Court is now sending the case back to the the federal circuit to decide which is the correct interpretation. If there’s one thing to be learned from the decisions, it’s that patent wars never end.",

      "text": "High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple Updated 11 min ago \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is siding with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices on Tuesday threw out a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design. The court said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nThe case now returns to a lower court for further proceeding in the case.

      "text": "High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple Posted: Updated: Tuesday,   SAM HANANELAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look.  ",

      "text": "Supreme Court sides with Samsung over Apple patent penalty The court ruled that iPhone design patent violations could only apply to parts of the phone. Share Save \nThe Supreme Court ruled that Samsung's violation of design patents made by Apple can only involve components, not entire products. This could mean a severely reduced penalty that the Korean company will have to pay... and a rare bit of good news for the troubled company . \nSamsung was facing a penalty of $548 million for imitating elements of the iPhone's design — this itself was reduced from an initial charge of nearly $1 billion . However, during the company's most recent appeal, the justices said that the patent infringement could affect just a component of the phones, like its design or appearance, rather than the sum total of the device. The Justices voted unanimously 8-0 in Samsung's favor. Chief Justice John Roberts noted Samsung did not infringe on \"all the chips and wires\" during the case in October. \nThe case ( still ) isn't over. Now it will return to a lower court to determine a recalculated portion of profits that Samsung will have to pay to Apple -- something that part of the Supreme Court noted wouldn't be easy. \"The term 'article of manufacture' is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product whether sold separately or not,\" Justice Sotomayor wrote.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray The U.S. Supreme Court a short while ago ruled that the a lower court should reconsider damages of $399 million that Samsung Electronics owes to Apple ( AAPL ) when found guilty in 2012 of infringing Apple design patents on the iPhone , according to a write-up of the ruling by Dow Jones Newswires ’s Brent Kendall .\nAt issue was whether Samsung must pay Apple all the profit it earned on infringing devices or just some. The Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit’s ruling, and the case is “remanded for further proceedings.”\nThe text of the ruling can be found on the Supreme Court site, under SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., ET AL. v. APPLE INC .\nJustice Sotomayor wrote the opinion of the unanimous court, according to the document.\nThe heart of the opinion is that the lower court erred in deciding that the target of damages was the entire phone as an “ article of manufacture ,” which the court says is too narrow, because individual components could be an article of manufacture.\nAs Sotomayor writes, “article” can mean an end product, or just a component that’s sold to a consumer within the context of the end product:\nThis case involves the infringement of designs for smartphones. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit identified the entire smartphone as the only permissible “article of manufacture” for the purpose of calculating §289 damages because consumers could not separately purchase components of the smartphones. The question before us is whether that reading is consistent with §289. We hold that it is not [...] This case requires us to address a threshold matter: the scope of the term “article of manufacture.” The only ques- tion we resolve today is whether, in the case of a multi- component product, the relevant “article of manufacture” must always be the end product sold to the consumer or whether it can also be a component of that product. Under the former interpretation, a patent holder will always be entitled to the infringer’s total profit from the end product. Under the latter interpretation, a patent holder will some- times be entitled to the infringer’s total profit from a component of the end product. \nApple shares are up 67 cents, or 0.6%, to $109.78.",

      "text": "High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple By SAM HANANELAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach 5362667 \nWell, this is good news. By now, I’m sure you’ve heard all about the Apple Watch, the so-called “smartwatch” that basically allows you to wear a phone on your wrist. Since the Apple Watch was introduced in 2015, its popularity has grown, despite its ridiculously high price tag. The low end of Apple Watch prices will still put you back $350. Not today. \nToday only, you can get an Apple Watch for $270, which is $80 less than what you’d normally pay. If you’ve thought about gifting someone in your family a smartwatch this Christmas, there is literally no better time to do it. The Apple Watch is 23 percent off today (Photo via Amazon) \nApple Watch 38mm Stainless Steel Case w/ Black Sport Band on sale for $269.99 \nConsidering Apple Watches can cost thousands of dollars, $270 is a very good price. And since the Apple Watch gets a 4.5-star rating (with 81 percent of reviewers giving it a perfect 5 out of 5 stars), there’s no doubt that many folks will be lining up for the opportunity to get it at a discount. Luckily, you don’t have to line up. Because you can get the deal on the Internet. \nHave a suggestion for a cool product or great deal that you think Daily Caller readers need to know about?

      "text": "High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple Posted: By SAM HANANELAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo \nWASHINGTON —The Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that said the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. \nThe justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings. \nThe decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple's iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. \nThe court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. \nThe ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone's trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years.",

A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) \nWASHINGTON (AP) — A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone’s patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay “total profit.” Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone’s success was directly tied to its distinctive look.",

      "text": "– A + Breaking Supreme Court sides with Samsung over Apple, says payments shouldn't cover whole device profits By Roger Fingas \nTuesday, December 06, 2016, 07:41 am PT (10:41 am ET) \nIn a unanimous decision, the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled in favor of Samsung in a long-running dispute with Apple, arguing that design patents can only cover components of a smartphone, and not the entire product.\n\n\n\n\nThe case will now head back to a lower court to determine what Samsung should pay, USA Today said. An original 2012 trial verdict levelled almost $1 billion in damages against the Korean company for violating iPhone design concepts, but this amount was later reduced to about $548 million. Samsung then decided to challenge $399 million of that at the Supreme Court.\n\nApple had contended that Samsung should hand over the whole profits from infringing devices. Samsung, though, suggested that this was ridiculous, likening it to forfeiting the whole profits of a car because of an infringing cupholder.\n\n\"A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work,\" an attorney for Samsung once argued.\n\nLegal action against Samsung began under former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who infamously threatened to go to \"thermonuclear war\" over Google's Android platform —used by companies like Samsung —claiming it was a \"stolen product,\" and that he would even be willing to spend all of Apple's cash reserves to \"destroy\" it.\n\nJobs's hatred of Android helped push a plethora of lawsuits around the world, against Samsung and other Android device makers, but legal battles eventually scaled back to a handful of Samsung issues in the U.S. The 2012 case has been Apple's biggest victory so far.\n\nSamsung was accused of going a step further, deliberately modeling the look of its phones after the iPhone in both hardware and software.",

      "text": "Washington (AFP) - The US Supreme Court on Tuesday tossed out a $399 million patent award from Samsung over copying Apple's iPhone design, sending the case back to a lower court.\nThe justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, in a case closely watched by the tech industry.\nThe 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty -- one element of a major patent infringement case -- was inappropriate because it represented \"Samsung's entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones\" for copying the iPhone's \"rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.\"\nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of the degree to which the patent infringement should affect the penalty.\n\"The parties ask us to go further and resolve whether, for each of the design patents at issue here, the relevant article of manufacture is the smartphone, or a particular smartphone component,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion.\n\"Doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture ... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.\"\nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details of the case.",

      "text": "Posted December 6, 2016 10:31 am - Updated December 6, 2016 11:00 am By Associated Press Supreme Court throws out $399 million judgment against Samsung in company’s patent dispute with Apple \nWASHINGTON — A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design similarities as compared to the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone’s patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay “total profit.” Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone’s success was directly tied to its distinctive look. Advertisement",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic By Andrew Chung, Reuters Dec 6, 2016 at 9:41 am | Print View \nWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that said the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. \nThe justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings. \nThe decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple’s iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. \nThe court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. \nThe ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world’s top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone’s trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years. \n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham) Your next Nation & World articles",

      "text": "More The US Supreme Court on Tuesday tossed out a $399 million patent award from Samsung over copying Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) 's iPhone design, sending the case back to a lower court. The justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, in a case closely watched by the tech industry. The 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty -- one element of a major patent infringement case -- was inappropriate because it represented \"Samsung's entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones\" for copying the iPhone's \"rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.\" But the court stopped short of delving into details of the degree to which the patent infringement should affect the penalty. \"The parties ask us to go further and resolve whether, for each of the design patents at issue here, the relevant article of manufacture is the smartphone, or a particular smartphone component,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion. \"Doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture ... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.\" The court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details of the case.

      "text": "Tweet Share 3D-printed Samsung and Apple logos are seen in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on January 26, 2016. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic More By Andrew Chung (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that said the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. The justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings. The decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple's iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. The court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. The ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone's trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years. Samsung had been seeking to pare back $399 million of $548 million it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict finding that it infringed Cupertino, California-based Apple's iPhone patents and copied its distinctive appearance. After a trial in 2012, Apple was awarded nearly $930 million in damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington in May 2015 upheld the patent infringement verdict, but said the iPhone's appearance could not be protected through trademarks. That cut Samsung's damages back by $382 million. The legal dispute centered on whether the term \"article of manufacture\" in U.S. patent law should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product. In court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component. But Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the patent law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote. Samsung in December 2015 paid Apple $548 million. But it took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make $399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications. Apple said its iPhone's success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone's look and many user interface features, Apple said. Samsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits on phones that infringed iPhone design patents, saying those elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features. With the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world's top smartphone maker. The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case on Oct. 11. Design patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years (Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham) Reblog",

      "text": "Apple killing the headphone jack was one of the biggest tech stories of 2016 — and it appears Samsung is looking to hop onto the trend, too.\nSEE ALSO: Samsung's Siri killer to debut on the Galaxy S8\nSamsung-centric blog SamMobile reports it can \"exclusively confirm\" the upcoming Galaxy S8 will also ditch the classic 3.5mm headphone jack in favor of a sleeker, thinner design. The report doesn't name its sources, so it's fair to take the news with a healthy grain of salt.\nFor the musically minded, the blog claims the device will possibly compensate by integrating new stereo speakers made with tech from recently acquired Harman , since removing the only way to enjoy audio on the down low and replacing it with extra-loud speakers is a totally logical trade.\nSamsung is looking to harvest every cubic millimeter it can within a smartphone chassis.\nSeparately, SamMobile says it's confirmed the Galaxy S8 will feature a USB Type-C port. Technically the now-discontinued Galaxy Note7 was the first Samsung phone with USB-C, so it makes sense the S8 would continue the trend.\nWhat doesn't quite add up is why the headphone jack is on the chopping block. At this point, it's a major differentiator between the Galaxy line and the iPhone, and by forcing users to get their audio via the USB port, Samsung won't get the same boost of S8 users ponying up for its own line of headphone adapters like Apple gets with its lighting port.\nLike every phone manufacturer, Samsung is looking to harvest every cubic millimeter it can within a smartphone chassis in order to improve its technology. Perhaps it's simply weighing new and improved features against the headphone jack and decided the latter has to go. Or maybe it has a newfound love of dongles.\nWe'll see if these are just rumors or if the confirmation was real in February 2017 when the Galaxy S8 debuts at the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona. Until then, hold onto your corded headphones tight — and consider investing in some wireless earbuds.\nBONUS: 5 awesome Android phones to replace your Galaxy Note7",

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nApple's iPhone 7. 4 great gifts for mobile professionals \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has invalidated a US$399 million infringement award against Samsung Electronics in a long-running design patent dispute with Apple. \nThe court, in an 8-0 decision , kicked back the patent award to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, saying the lower court calculated the patent award based on the whole iPhone, while the design patents may cover only pieces of the device. \nThe Federal Circuit's failure to consider a smaller damage award based on pieces of the iPhone \"cannot be squared\" with patent law, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the Supreme Court. The lower court, in its ruling, said it could not separate out the infringing pieces of the smartphones because they were not available for sale to the public, she noted. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nBut \"the term 'article of manufacture' [in patent law] is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product, whether sold separately or not,\" Sotomayor wrote. \nThe damage award relates to three design patents covering the face and rounded bezel design of the iPhone and the grid of sixteen icons on the phone's home screen. \nSamsung, with support from Google, Facebook, and other tech companies, had asked the Supreme Court to take a new look at design patents, even though the rules have remained largely unchanged for more than a century. \nRepresentatives of Apple and Samsung were not immediately available for comment. \nThe two companies' patent disputes will continue. Separately, the same appeals court reinstated a $119.6 million award for Apple back in October. The appeals court ruled that two Apple smartphone design patents, one related to a slide-to-unlock feature , are valid and Samsung infringed a third patent related to helping smartphone users find phone numbers.

      "title": "US Supreme Court rules for Samsung in smartphone fight with Apple",
      "text": "  7, 2016 : 12:07 AM   \nWASHINGTON (Dec 6): The US Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that said the South Korean company had to pay a US$399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. \nThe justices in their 8-0 ruling sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings. \nThe decision gives Samsung another chance to try to get back a big chunk of the money it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict that it infringed Apple's iPhone patents and mimicked its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. \nThe court held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. \nThe ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung, asserting that its rival stole its technology and the iPhone's trademarked appearance. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top US court in recent years. \nSamsung had been seeking to pare back US$399 million of US$548 million it paid Apple in December following a 2012 jury verdict finding that it infringed Cupertino, California-based Apple's iPhone patents and copied its distinctive appearance. \nAfter a trial in 2012, Apple was awarded nearly US$930 million in damages. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington in May 2015 upheld the patent infringement verdict, but said the iPhone's appearance could not be protected through trademarks. That cut Samsung's damages back by US$382 million. \nThe legal dispute centered on whether the term \"article of manufacture\" in US patent law should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product. \nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the US government all agreed that the term could mean a component. \nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the patent law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote. \nSamsung in December 2015 paid Apple US$548 million. But it took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make US$399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications. \nApple said its iPhone's success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone's look and many user interface features, Apple said. \nSamsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits on phones that infringed iPhone design patents, saying those elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features. \nWith the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world's top smartphone maker. \nThe Supreme Court heard arguments in the case on Oct 11. \nDesign patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years. Related Articles",

Here's what's happening: Ben Carson , a former GOP primary rival who then supported Trump, is his choice for HUD Trump pokes China again Companies that try to ship jobs overseas will face tariffs , Trump says Though a top Trump aide says \"it's possible\" that millions voted illegally, there's no evidence Trump's call with the Taiwanese president was his latest break with diplomatic norms Dec. 6, 2016, 8:31 a.m. Reporting from Washington David Savage Supreme Court (Pablo Martinez Monsivais / Associated Press) \nThe Supreme Court ruled for Samsung Tuesday in its patent dispute with Apple and set aside a $400 million damages verdict for copying the look of the iPhone . \nThe justices dealt only with the question of how much the South Korean firm should pay for copying several design features of Apple's smartphone. \nA jury found that Samsung had copied several features of Apple's patented design, and a judge said the South Korean firm should pay out its \"entire profit\" from the sale of its smartphones. \nThose damages of $399 million were upheld by a federal appeals court, but they were set aside by the high court in a 8-0 decision on Tuesday. \nIn a brief opinion, the justices said the design features of the smartphones, including its rectangular shape, were a \"component\" of the product, not the entire product. Therefore Samsung should be forced to pay a lesser amount for copying the look of Apple's iPhone, the court found. \nBut the high court did not decide on the proper amount. Instead, the justices sent the case back to an appeals court to decide on how much the design features contributed to the value of the iPhone. Latest updates",
