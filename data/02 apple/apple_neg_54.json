      "text": "Apple’s Palo Alto Store Damaged From Overnight Hit-And-Run Burglary  48 PST \nApple’s Palo Alto store is pretty significant simply because it is the store that is closest to Apple’s HQ. In the past many Apple executives have been spotted at the store due to its proximity, and where from time to time they would show up for product launches. For example Apple’s CEO Tim Cook showed up at the store for the iPhone 7’s launch. Wow. Apple store in Downtown Palo Alto just got robbed/all products on tables gone. Never happened to MSFT store or Sony. pic.twitter.com/tWj5HS3wMF \n— Sunil Rawat (@_sunilrawat) December 4, 2016 \nHowever it seems that recently the store has been damaged due to an overnight hit-and-run burglary. This is according to a report from The Mercury News in which a group of burglars rammed a rented SUV into the glass door, ransacked the place, and made their getaway. However it seems that some weren’t so lucky as the police managed to arrest four suspects out of the eight to ten that were involved. \nAccording to Palo Alto police Sgt. James Reifschneider, “This was a pretty brazen act when somebody breaks their way into a business after hours and uses a vehicle to force their way into a store.” Those who were arrested include Shaquin K. Ferguson, 19, and Erica Jaynisha White, 18, along with two juveniles who weren’t identified because they were underage. \nApple has declined to comment on the matter and at this point in time, it is unclear as to how much the burglars have made off with in terms of value of the products stolen. \nFiled in Apple .

It wants to raise £5m to scale the business up, taking its staff from 50 to 200 by the end of 2018, and expanding into Australia. \nThe company is listing 2,994,011 new shares at 167p each. \nFashion clearance \nHigh street fashion chains Warehouse, Oasis and Coast have been put up for sale by their owner. Known as Aurora Fashion Group, the outlets have been put under strategic review with a price tag of up to £100m. \nThey were once owned by Icelandic retail group Baugur, which collapsed in 2009, and ended up in the hands of the bank’s administrators. \nIt is understood the chains are being eyed up by private-equity firms including the turnaround group Alteri. \nPound pressure \nSports Direct is expected to reveal the impact of the fall in the pound on earnings when it reports half-year results on Thursday. \nThe scandal-hit retailer failed to hedge against the drop in sterling in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. In October, it said full-year results were set to come in at £285m, compared with the £300m it had predicted. \nSports Direct is also expected to beef up its board over criticisms of corporate governance.",

Check on Apple's Website   2 p.m. Now you can find out if the company is willing to give you a new battery for free, before making a trip to the store. \nDoes your iPhone 6s randomly shut off before the battery is fully drained? Apple last week launched a repair program for this issue, and now it's easy to check if you're eligible for a free battery. \nAs MacRumors notes , Cupertino's new tool lets you enter your phone's serial number and find out if the company is willing to give you a new battery for free, before making a trip to the store. You can get your phone's serial number by tapping on Settings > General > About. \nAs Apple notes on the page, the problem affects \"a very small number of iPhone 6s devices.\" While this is a battery issue, rest assured that Apple says it's \"not a safety issue,\" so don't worry about any Galaxy Note 7 -like explosions. Related Articles Apple iPhone 7 vs. iPhone 6s: Should You Upgrade? \nIf you are eligible for a new battery, you can take your phone to an Apple retail store or one of the company's authorized service providers to get it fixed. Wireless carriers aren't participating in the program, so don't waste your time taking your phone there. \nBefore heading in for a fix, Apple recommends backing up your data to iTunes or iCloud, turning off the \"Find my iPhone\" feature, and erasing data and settings in Settings > General > Reset > Erase all Content and Settings. \nNote that if your phone has another issue that interferes with a battery replacement—if the screen is cracked, for example—Apple won't replace the battery unless you agree to have that fault repaired as well, which won't be free.",

      "title": "\"6 Reasons Android Will Always Be More Popular Than Apple's IOS\"",
      "text": "\"6 Reasons Android Will Always Be More Popular Than Apple's IOS\" Published by Nairaland on Mon, 05 Dec 2016 Google's Android OS currently holds about 83% market share of Mobile devices,that's a huge margin compared to what Apple holds.I'll give you 10 reasons why Android Devices will always be more popular than iOS powered phones.1. VarietyThere are different brands of Android phones. This variety gives users a lot to choose from. Some have amazing camera quality, others are beasts with amazing specifications. In iOS you're tied down to only Apple. You can only choose from the devices they have which are obviously limited.2. Target MarketThe Android OS has devices that covers every country .Google has covered virtually every country on earth and can easily detect common habits and behavioral patterns of mobile phone users in any country making it easier for them to know the best devices and features that'll work in a specific region.As for Apple, they simply lack that ability .3. Flexibility and ControlAndroid gives you the freedom to do what ever you want with your phone. You can root Android devices with the touch of a button, Change your phone's UI by installing a launcher, flashing a Custom ROM or using Xposed Modules. In iOS you hardly have any control without jailbreaking the phone. Even after jailbreaking the device, there are still limits to things you can do.4. ConnectivityThere are a variety of ways to transfer files in Android Devices. You can use Bluetooth , Xender , HotKnot, NFC and more to receive apps, music, photos and other media files. iOS on the other hand forces you to download music from iTunes and you cannot even collect music from someone via Bluetooth because some iPhones don't have Bluetooth support. 5.Budget And Cost Of DevicesAndroid has different phones that cut across every sector of any country's economy. There are phones for the High Class, Middle Class and Low Class. By reducing the cost of production for some devices, Android devices are able to meet the budget of almost everyone. Let's take smartphones in Nigeria as an example.INFINIX, Tecno and Itel are owned and operated by the same company but each of these devices take care of the needs of a particular class of people. iTel devices are mostly targeted at the low income earners, while Tecno and Infinix take care of the average and high income earners.This strategy has enabled these phones have a larger market share if devices in Nigeria. This is the same method all Android OEMs are using all over the world to cover every part of any country they're targeting. However , Apple devices are stuck to the price that Apple has set. iPhones are targeted at high income earners.6. Availability Of Repair Centres Nobody wants to use a phone that can't be fixed when it has a fault. Many Android devices can be fixed by third-party repair centers or personnel quite easily as their parts are readily available. The cost of repair is also relatively affordable. Unlike in iOS, The cost of repairing an Apple product is always high and the parts are always scarce.",

      "title": "Apple Watch 2 - Review",
      "text": "Review Price: £369.00 What is the Apple Watch 2? \nThe Apple Watch 2 (or Apple Watch Series 2 to give it its official title) is the second version of the most successful smartwatch around. \nThe Watch was Apple’s first draft at a wearable, and plenty bought into the promise of a phone on your wrist. At TrustedReviews we liked the look of it, but struggled to understand its purpose: It had health and fitness elements, but they were limited, and it didn't offer water-resistance. In addition, the watchOS software was tricky to use, glitchy, and just didn’t do much. Interesting third-party apps were lacking too. \nThere are clear parallels to be drawn between the Apple Watch and the very first iPhone that was released almost a decade ago, which evolved into a superb product. \nWhile the iPhone 7 didn’t meet our high expectations of it, the Apple Watch 2 has. All our concerns about the original have been addressed: watchOS 3 is now intuitive and useful; there are plenty of compatible apps; and the Apple Watch 2 is now properly water-resistant.vOwning an Apple Watch finally makes sense – especially if you’re the outdoorsy, fitness type. \nIn the end, we loved the Apple Watch 2 so much, we awarded it our coveted TrustedReviews Wearable of the Year Award for 2016 . Keep reading to find out just why it deserved such a fantastic accolade. \nRelated: Best Smartwatch Apple Watch 2 – Design \nThe Apple Watch Series 2 looks almost identical to the original, and I don’t mind that at all. This remains my favourite smartwatch when it comes to looks, particularly since it isn't as chunky as rival watches. It helps that I prefer square watches; those who prefer round ones might not be as kind. \nThe Watch 2 is a fraction thicker than the previous Watch, but not enough that you’d notice without seeing the two next to each other. The square screen with rounded glass edges make it simple to swipe up, down, left and right from the edge to provide additional shortcuts, and the rotating Digital Crown still works well as a method of zooming in and out, and general navigation. \nThe button just beneath the Digital Crown has been re-appropriated from a useless shortcut to contacts and on/off switch to a much more engaging way to scroll through the new apps dock (more details to follow). \nYou can opt for either the stainless steel or, slightly cheaper, aluminium chassis, and one of two sizes: 38mm and 42mm. The Series 2 is available in a range of colours: Gold, Rose Gold, Space Grey and Silver. This time there’s no expensive gold-plated model. \nInstead, Apple has created a beautiful white ceramic smartwatch. The ceramic cast is treated at length at high temperature before it's polished smooth. Not only does it look super-attractive, it’s four times tougher than the stainless steel model. \nStanding out from the crowd does come at a price, though. The ceramic Apple Watch Edition costs more than three times as much as the standard versions – the 38mm one setting you back a cool £1,249. \nSuffice to say, it isn't necessary to spend such an amount for an Apple Watch that’s \"tough\". I’ve dropped my aluminium Apple Watch on several occasions and regularly whack it against door frames; it doesn’t have a single scratch on the screen or body. \nThe headline feature for the Apple Watch 2 is water-resistance. Not only will it survive a brief dunk in the bath, it's now fit for the sea. Apple claims it can withstand up to 50m of water – although we wouldn't advise that you go scuba-diving with it just yet. It’s meant to survive the rigours of arms swinging through water, as opposed to being plunged into the depths. \nAn Apple representative explained to TrustedReviews that the Apple Watch 2 is fit for swimming in a pool for as long as you want, but can also deal with seawater. It was tested on hundreds of swimmers before release, and it provides accurate exercise readings as well as surviving the wet stuff without any bother. \nThe screen locks when under water and so won't be usable, but it will continue to track activity. Once out of the water, the Apple Watch Series 2 performs a little party piece to rid the water from its speaker grilles: it plays sound at various volumes and frequencies to expel liquid like a clam. \nThere's a plethora of straps available for the Series 2 – with an even bigger selection on offer than before – and they're the best way of making an Apple Watch \"yours\". As well as the relationship with luxury brand Hermès, Apple has also joined forces with Nike to launch the Apple Watch Nike+. This comes with a special strap, whose compression-moulded perforations make it more breathable – ideal for athletes – along with some exclusive Nike watch faces and apps pre-installed. \nFor those who intend to swim regularly with the Apple Watch 2 I'd recommend a Sports strap, rather than the metal or nylon straps. The Sports strap doesn’t retain any water, so you won't be left with a damp wrist all day after a brief plunge. Best Deals for Apple Watch 2 0 shares",

      "text": "Reddit \nGames developers say they have detected significant abuse of Apple’s refund policy on apps, and are being forced to take their own steps to hit back after Apple refused to help. \nAt least four developers cited in The Korea Times say that the problem is that people are repeatedly purchasing games and in-app content, asking Apple for a refund – which is normally granted without question – and then continuing to use the content. It is not easy for developers to block access to the content because Apple refuses to reveal the identities of those who have been refunded … Apple holds full control in paying refunds on paid for mobile content such as games. It determines whether to give refunds to consumers. But the content developer cannot take part in the process under Apple’s refund policy. Apple does not even provide information about the users who have requested and received the refund, claiming it is to protect consumer rights. For this reason, the developers have no other choice but to manually track down the users and check if they continue to use the charged content they have already received refunds for. \nSome companies are reportedly even turning this into a business – offering a service to gamers where they will obtain refunds from Apple on their behalf. \nThree of the four developers named – Flint, Nexon and Longtu Korea – say that they are now being forced to make their own manual checks in order to block access to those who continue to use games and content after obtaining refunds from Apple. \nThe piece contrasts Apple’s policy with Google, which allows a single refund on an app if requested within two hours of purchase. However, while developers may prefer Google’s approach, it seems unlikely that Apple will change a policy designed to keep its own customers happy – allowing app purchases to be made confident in the knowledge that they can easily obtain a refund if it fails to live up to expectations.",

      "text": "10 absurd gifts for the Apple fan you're not sure you like Caitlin McGarry @Caitlin_McGarry Dec 5, 2016 3:52 AM 1 of 11 Credit: VioNet Absurd gifts for Apple fans \nBuying a straightforward tech gift for your friends or family members is easy. There are a slew of affordable fitness trackers , laptop bags , and all the other gadgets and accessories your iPhone-addicted loved ones could ask for. \nBut there’s an untapped category of tech gifts: over-the-top, extravagant, or otherwise ridiculous options for the Apple fan you love to hate (or just…sort of dislike but have to buy a gift for). \nIf you’re in that boat, we’ve got you covered. Read on. Credit: Thrive Global A bed for your phone \nHuffington Post founder Arianna Huffington’s new venture, Thrive Global, is all about well-being at work. Getting enough sleep is a huge part of being a productive employee, Thrive says. Sounds accurate. To help you get more rest, the company’s shop is selling a $100 accessory to make “putting our smartphones to bed a regular part of our nightly ritual.” \nThis $100 Phone Bed charging station looks like an actual bed and comes with a satin-clad mattress, dual-sided microfiber and satin cleaning cloth/blanket, and velvet-lined compartments. It’s a bed. For your devices. \nThis is the perfect passive-aggressive gift for the iPhone addict in your life. It’s the ultimate way to say, “Give your selfies a rest already.” Credit: Selfie Mic Next-level selfie stick \nKnow someone who’s a little too into themselves? Give them the gift of a selfie stick on steroids: the Selfie Mic . \nThis gadget attaches to an iPhone or iPod like a standard selfie stick does, but instead of a handle to hold the camera in place, it puts a microphone in your hand. A corresponding app has a library of tunes so you can sing your heart out and record yourself while doing so. \nThis device is designed for kids, but would make the perfect gift for an aspiring singer (whether or not they’re any good). Credit: Goldgenie All gold everything \nGoldgenie’s motto is “luxury gifts for the ungiftable,” and nothing screams luxury as much as a 24-karat gold iPhone 7 does. \nForget Apple’s gold alumnium finish. For the low, low price of $3,068.16, you can get an iPhone made of real gold. (Why is Donald Trump still on Android when this is an option? We’ll never know.) You can up the ante with the $19,200 iPhone 7 Diamond Megastar edition, which comes embedded with 800 diamonds and comes with a VIP concierge service membership to book hotels, restaurant reservations, or any other lifestyle decision you need help with. \nBonus: You only need to put down a 50 percent deposit to snag this gem—although if you can’t pay up-front, maybe a gold iPhone isn’t the smartest gift you can buy.",

      "title": "Why I cancelled my new 15-inch MacBook Pro order",
      "text": "ZDNet Japan Why I cancelled my new 15-inch MacBook Pro order When Apple's new MacBook Pros were announced in October, David Gewirtz's long wait was rewarded with a slightly queasy feeling, because the most obviously powerful model was a 15-inch machine with dual GPU. | Topic: Apple \nSay goodbye to my little friend. \nI wanted to tell you how gorgeous the 15-inch display was. I wanted to tell you how astonishingly fast the PCIe-based SSD storage was. I wanted to tell you how I'd grudgingly come to accept the shallower keyboard, the Touch Bar, and the four USB-C connectors. \nFor months now, I've been looking forward to getting a new fully-equipped, top-of-the-line 15-inch MacBook Pro. For weeks, ever since I placed my order, I've been looking forward to telling you about it once it arrived. CNET Read More \nNow, that won't happen. \nI just cancelled my order. First, I'll explain the technical reasons for my decision. Then I'll discuss some factors you may wish to consider for any professional purchases you might want to make. The tech \nThere is a fundamental architectural difference between the new 13-inch MacBook Pro and the new 15-inch MacBook Pro. The 15-inch model comes with a dual GPU (graphics processing unit) configuration. The 13-inch model only comes with one graphics processor, built into the CPU. \nCNET: New MacBook Pro: Should you upgrade? \nIt's pretty interesting how the dual GPU architecture is supposed to work. Part of the time, the lower power, but also lower-performing, on-chip Intel HD 530 graphics processor is used. When crunch time comes, the Radeon Pro 460 with 4 GB of video RAM kicks in and pounds pixels onto the screen. \nI've used this dual GPU architecture before. About four years ago, I bought the most powerful Windows laptop I could find, a beast of a Sager. It had a dGPU configuration. \nWhen it worked, it was breathtakingly fast. When it worked. \nOver the 18 months or so that machine was my main machine, I had constant driver problems. The GeForce GTX 670M didn't always run properly. The on-chip Intel video driver wouldn't properly change settings. System hangs and freezes attributable to driver conflicts were a regular occurrence. It was maddening. \nWhen I moved off that laptop as my daily work system, I swore I would never buy another dual GPU machine. \nApple's Mac future resides in the cloud | MacBook Pro Touch Bar review in one word: Meh | Five reasons why Apple's new MacBook Pro makes me want to switch back to Windows | The MacBook Pro is not the root of all evil | Is that a PC on your desk? Windows hybrids, Macs and iPads struggle for share \nThe MacBook Pro is actually not a replacement for that Sager. I replaced that with the super-powered iMac I use as my daily work machine. This new MacBook Pro is destined for work in the studio for webcasts and interviews. \nI'm getting a Mac because that job requires some Mac only software. Yes, there are wonderful Windows machines out there. But in my case, for the studio, I need a MacOS machine. \nI had been holding off on purchasing a new Mac for about half a year, biding my time, knowing that the beefiest possible mobile Mac would soon be within my grasp. When the new MacBook Pros were announced in October, my waiting was rewarded with a slightly queasy feeling, because the most obviously powerful one was a 15-inch machine with dual GPU. \nThat nauseous feeling I had when placing that order wasn't just because of the $3,000(!) price tag. The dGPU architecture gave me pause because of my previous experience. But, hey, this is Apple, right? They have to have figured this out. After all, this is far from their first dual GPU MacBook Pro. \nI went against the promise I had made to myself, and placed my order. The problem Read More \nApparently, some new 15-inch MacBook Pros are experiencing failure conditions. I first became aware of the problem in a MacRumors article a few days ago. Users are reporting glitches and crashes, along with weird screen artifacts. This behavior is apparently most prevalent on the higher-end machines, with the Radeon Pro 460 GPU, which is the model I ordered. \nI spent a few hours reading through forum posts , which made it clear to me that this wasn't an isolated incident. Quite a few people were reporting serious problems - problems that necessitated returns back to Apple for system repair or replacement. \nSo what exactly is the problem? That's not clear. It seems to be centered around the dual GPU, but whether it's a software glitch fixable in an OS update, or a hardware issue that requires mobo replacement, isn't yet clear. \nSince many of the reports described the problem occurring while doing high-intensity activities, it could be a heat related problem. That's not known yet, and there's been no official statement from Apple. I cancelled my order \nThis is not a decision I would advise everyone to make. In fact, it goes to a theme we discuss often: you need to make your tech decisions based on your own usage needs. \nLet me tell you about my usage needs. The 15-inch MacBook Pro I ordered was slated to replace the Mac mini in my studio. It was to allow me to do live recording and broadcast in the studio , and then pick it up, dock it at my desk in my study, and work on post production there. \nAll that seems fine, except for one detail. This machine absolutely cannot be allowed to fail. I do real-time webcasts, with hundreds to thousands of live participants, often across multiple continents. Large teams from huge organizations spend months putting these special events together. \nThe success of these events is very much due to a team effort. However, if my computer fails in the middle of a webcast, failure could be directly and solely attributable to me. I must not allow that to happen. \nI also do video interviews. Sometimes, I'm the guest on a major network during a live feed. Sometimes, I'm interviewing someone who is a major \"get\" and this is our one chance to talk. Once again, failure is not an option. \nI need something rock-solid reliable. My aging Mac mini has not failed me. Not once. Not a single crash. Not a single live broadcast failure even remotely attributable to it. It can be counted on. The only reason I'm moving off my very trusty old Mac mini is that it's old, and it just doesn't have the performance I need to run modern versions of the production software. \nBased on the reports of 15-inch MacBook Pro failures, I can't take the chance. It might, in fact, be a wonderful machine. It might be fine. Then again, it might not. How can I ever trust that it won't break at the worst possible time? \nI'm not saying you should not buy this machine. For me, though, it's a non-starter. Your mileage may vary. If you have a work environment that has built in tolerance for downtime and crashes, and you don't mind dealing with growing pains, or gambling with the possibility of having your machine spend time in the shop for repairs, this may turn out to be a great purchase for you. \nBy the way, I have to give Apple credit for making it easy to get out of the deal. Cancelling was a simple, one-button press affair. Compare that to the four-day grief fest our cable company put us through when we decided to drop cable TV service after the election. Points to Apple for making the cancellation process hassle-free. What will I do instead? \nWell, my original plan was to take back my sweet little 2015 i5-based MacBook Pro from my wife, and replace it with a spare Mac mini. It would be a bit underpowered, but I figured I could make do. \nHowever, she quickly disabused me from that approach. Verbally, she said, \"I guess that's okay, although I actually finally have it working now,\" but her eyes said \"Take it and I'll kill you where you stand.\" \nInstead, I'm ordering another new MacBook Pro, but I'm going for a 13-inch model that doesn't have the second GPU. Yes, I'll definitely be sacrificing graphics performance, but it's a good trade-off given the mission-critical nature of the work this machine will be doing. \nI don't mind the smaller form factor, because there's very limited surface space in the studio. The drop in screen size shouldn't be too great a loss. While the 13-inch's i7 processor only has two cores, it does have hyper threading, which can be helpful. It's not quite the beast I'd like, but at least it won't turn into a monster at the worst possible time. I'll max out the very fast storage. It should make a fine little workhorse. \nSadly, these machines aren't available now, so it will be sometime in January before I'll get to set my thumb on the new Touch ID sensor. \nYou can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

      "text": "Developers Unhappy Over Apple’s App Store Refund Policy  21 PST \nEver download an app and find out that it’s not what you thought it was, or that it is working the way you thought it would? Thankfully that’s what refund policies in app stores are for, in which users are protected from having to pay for apps that don’t work as advertised. However over in Korea, developers aren’t thrilled by it. \nIn a report from The Korea Times (via 9to5Mac ), it seems that developers are unhappy with the way Apple handles the refunds because gamers seem to be taking advantage of the system. What has been happening is that gamers have downloaded and paid for apps and in-app purchases, and request for a refund later in which the requests are typically granted without question. \nThis is normal, except that Apple refuses to reveal the identity of the users who have been making the refund requests, meaning that these users are still be able to use the app, play the games and access in-app purchases pretty much for free. Developers are then forced to manually track down these users which is rather inefficient and not a very good use of their time. \nWill Apple be making changes to their policy? It seems unlikely for now, but if you’re a developer than we guess this is something you’ll want to take into consideration. \nFiled in Apple >   Apps and iOS . Related Articles",

      "text": "Apple Publicly Acknowledges Self-Driving Car Plans for the First Time \nHere are some of the stories we’re reading this morning. by GTM Editors \nHere are some of the stories we’re reading this morning. by GTM Editors 0 \nFinancial Times : Apple Reveals Plans for Self-Driving Car \nApple has for the first time publicly acknowledged its plans to develop self-driving cars, with a letter that urges the US highways regulator to promote “fair competition” between newcomers to the automotive industry and traditional manufacturers. \nIn an unusually direct statement accompanying the letter, an Apple spokesman confirmed its work on autonomous systems that could be used to transform “the future of transportation”. \nApple’s letter touts the “significant societal benefits of automated vehicles”, which it described as a life-saving technology, potentially preventing millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year. \nNew York Times : Army Blocks Drilling of Dakota Access Oil Pipeline \nThe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe won a major victory on Sunday in its battle to block an oil pipeline being built near its reservation when the Department of the Army announced that it would not allow the pipeline to be drilled under a dammed section of the Missouri River. \nThe Army said it would look for alternative routes for the $3.7 billion Dakota Access pipeline. Construction of the route a half-mile from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation has become a global flash point for environmental and indigenous activism, drawing thousands of people out here to a sprawling prairie camp of tents, tepees and yurts. \n“The best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing,” Jo-Ellen Darcy, the Army’s assistant secretary for civil works, said in a statement. The move could presage a lengthy environmental review that has the potential to block the pipeline’s construction for months or years. \nMcClatchy : Texan Who Could Lead Trump’s EPA Wants to End Renewable Energy Subsidies \nA Texan under consideration to lead the Environmental Protection Agency wants to end subsidies for renewable energy and said it’s not clear how much human activity contributes to global warming. \nKathleen Hartnett White, the head of a conservative Texas think tank, confirmed to McClatchy that she is being considered to lead the EPA after meeting with President-elect Donald Trump on Monday. \nThe EPA is one of Trump’s biggest targets, and White, whose record shows an interest in cutting regulations, said she is under official consideration for the agency’s top job. \nYale Environment 360 : For European Wind Industry, Offshore Projects Are Booming \nUntil 2011, between 5 and 10 percent of newly installed wind energy capacity in Europe was offshore. Last year, almost every third new wind turbine went up offshore. That growth has helped boost the share of wind energy in the European Union’s electricity supply from 2 percent in the year 2000 to 12 percent today, according to Wind Europe, a business advocacy group. \nNew investments for offshore projects totaled $15.5 billion in the first half of 2016 alone, according to Wind Europe, and newly installed offshore wind energy capacity will double to 3.7 gigawatts this year compared to 2015. More than 3,300 grid-connected turbines now exist in the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Irish Sea, and 114 new wind turbines were linked to the grid in European waters in the first half of this year alone. This is in stark contrast to the U.S. and Asia, where offshore wind use is only just getting started. \nNewsFactor : LinkedIn Opens Building Company Says Is 'Net Zero Energy' \nLinkedIn unveiled what the company says is its first \"net zero energy\" building at its Sunnyvale campus. The social networking company held a grand opening to showcase the building at 880 W. Maude Ave. Sunnyvale Mayor Glenn Hendricks his fellow council members and city staffers were on hand for the tour. \nThe 40,000-square-foot building generates renewable energy onsite to power all of its energy needs including light, heat, cooling and appliances. The building has 778 solar panels, 20 skylights, LEDs with sensors and 16 electric vehicle charging stations with cords long enough to reach adjacent parking spaces.",

      "text": "Apple Inc.'s AAPL, +0.37% stock price target was cut at Pacific Crest, which cited \"stable, but uninspiring\" demand for the technology giant's new iPhones. Analyst Andy Hargreaves kept his rating at overweight, saying the stock is still \"too cheap,\" but trimmed his price target to $127, or 16% above Friday's closing price of $109.90, frmo $129. \"While we believe Apple has slightly reduced its forecast to suppliers, the change is not drastic and is mostly a return to forecasts in place prior to an increase in October,\" Hargreaves wrote in a note to clients. Still he cut, his estimate for fiscal first-quarter iPhone sales to 76.8 million units from 78.3 million, and his fiscal 2017 estimate to 225.0 million from 231.9 million. Hargreaves slashed his fiscal 2017 earnings-per-share outlook to $8.58 from $8.94, compared with the FactSet consensus of $9.00. He said he believes the iPhone estimate changes, recent currency moves, concerns over trade policy and the potential for costs in the next iPhone cycle to increase all pose threats to gross margins. \"This is likely to act as an overhang that reduces optimism around near-term upside potential,\" Hargreaves said. The stock, which edged up 0.3% in premarket trade, has lost 1% since the election through Friday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% has rallied 4.6%.",

      "text": "Italy says no to constitutional reform, Apple ( AAPL ) say yes to automated cars, Burberry ( BURBY ) rejects a takeover and more. These are the five things you need to know before the market opens. Following a decisive No vote in the referendum in Italy over the weekend, stock futures point higher and European stocks are on the rise, as markets respond relatively positively to the vote. It is being reported this morning that Luxury goods retailer Burberry has rejected multiple takeover bids from Coach. According to people briefed on the matter, the talks are no longer active. If the deal had gone ahead, it would've created a company with a market value of $20 billion. Apple have confirmed that it is interested in autonomous-vehicle technology. While it is unlikely that Apple will design or build a car, it is understood they are focused on the software that would control the self-driving vehicle. For more things you must know before the market opens and up-to-the-minute news, head over to our website or find us on Facebook and Twitter to ensure you know what's going on ahead of the opening bell and throughout the day.

      "text": "Korean game developers have slammed Apple for the loopholes in its app refund policy. They assert that app buyers are abusing the refund policy; which keeps them in the dark about the process.\nThe Cupertino-based company has the full control of the App Store payment refund process for paid-for apps. Besides, it decides whether to offer refunds to consumers or not.\n\nKorean Game Developers Request Apple to Reveal the Name of Users Who Ask for Refunds Since Apple doesn’t provide information regarding who has been given refund, developers have to track users themselves to find out if they are still using the content for which they have already received refunds.\n“By analyzing all payment data and logs, we have tracked down about 300 users who are suspected of abusing App Store’s refund policy. Dragon Blaze,” Nov. 28. We pledge to root out the abusers by requesting the judicial authorities for an investigation.” Flint, a Korean mobile game development studio, CEO Kim Young-mo said. The Korea Times .\nNext Floor, distributor of Korean game Destiny Child, also revealed the difficulties handling the abusers without any support from Apple. He added that since the tech giant doesn’t offer refund information to the game companies, they are facing difficulty in resolving the problem.\n“We are regulating those who abuse the payment process and damage other users under our management policy. Unlike other application stores, Apple does not provide refund information to the game companies and we are having difficulties in promptly counteracting the problem.” \nMobile game studio Nexon and Longtu Korea further added that he had asked Apple for the lists of users who had demanded refunds several times. However, Apple did not respond.\nApple states that it doesn’t provide information about users who request for refund in order to protect their privacy.\nWhat do you think of this altercation? Should Apple reveal the name of the users who ask for refunds?\nShare your views with us in the comment, on Facebook , Twitter , and Google Plus . Also download our app on your iDevice.\n",

      "text": "Apple iMac 2017: Will it be powered by Kaby Lake, Skylake, or Xeon processor? By Rida Dec 05, 2016 09:31 AM EST Apple iMac 2017 to boast Intel Kaby Lake or Xeon chip and 27-inch 5K Display with VR support. (Photo: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images ) Advertisement iMac 2017 is the most anticipated device from Apple other than iPad line-up. iMac PC had been the expected device from Apple in the October event. Enthusiasts did not find any single word on this device. However, current reports are indicating the arrival of iMac 2017 in the next Apple event. According to International Business Times , iMac 2017 is rumored to arrive in the next Apple event. However, the main focus is on the processor that will be embedded inside the iMac PC. Earlier, reports highlighted the delay in the launch of Intel's Kaby Lake processor is the reason for the delay of new iMac. It is reported that Intel could be unveiling its latest high-advanced Kaby Lake processors at the Consumer Electronics Show 2017 in Las Vegas. As the upcoming AIO is expected to come with interesting features, a Kaby Lake chipset can only make them better. The Kaby Lake chipset is required to run all high-end features successfully. There are also new reports on iMac 2017, in which the device is expected to feature the same Skylake SoC or the Intel's Xeon processor. If the Intel Kaby Lake chipset supply delays, it may force the Cupertino-based tech giant to go with Skylake or Xeon processor. The MacBook Pro 2016 was also released with the same Skylake SoC in the last event. Apple's official statement on iMac 2017 will give the complete details on the confusion of processor which will power the new PC. A major challenge to Apple Inc. is the Microsoft Surface Studio with the 28-inch screen having fold down ability in-order to make it easier for artists to draw on it. Plus, the Surface makes use of touch input, a stylus and the Dial. Apple needs to make a device far better than the current best device. According to The Bit Bag , the top most features likely be found in iMac 2017 are a 4-core processor, 5K Display and native support for 4K video with virtual reality (VR) support. A newly introduced organic light-emitting diode (OLED) Touch Bar seen in the MacBook Pro 2016 is also expected. Other specs likely to be available are USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, Touch ID and Touch Bar.",

The implementation is nearly identical to the one in the macOS Photos app, but doesn't execute as fluidly as the app's does.\n\nOther changes to the online version of the app include a vertical photo album listing, as well as a new toolbar with upload and download buttons. \n\nApple's Touch Bar , as seen on the new 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro lines, is essentially a USB 2180x80 display, mounted for optimal viewing at a 45 degree angle. Apple reserves 128 pixels on the left as the \"system button,\" and 608 pixels on the right for the \"control strip,\" including Touch ID prompts —but not the sensor itself, which sits to the right of the Touch Bar.",

      "text": "Apple lobbies for shared data, more public road access to test autonomous driving systems By Dan Pye ● 13 minutes ago \nIn a letter to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Apple has expressed interest in cooperating with other companies to accelerate development of its autonomous driving technology, VentureBeat reports. Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, sent the letter to advocate for a data-sharing program that would let companies swap “de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses” while still maintaining the privacy that the company so closely guards. In the letter Kenner admits, “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” \nKenner also makes it clear that Apple wants the same access that “established manufacturers” have to test their devices on public roads “without pursuing exemptions.” Current Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards—including the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act—don’t allow for a company like Apple to take part in that type of testing. In his letter, Kenner argues that allowing Apple more access with less red tape will help “the significant societal benefits of automated vehicles” be realized more safely and much faster.",

      "text": "The new MacBook Pro is objectively Apple’s best laptop ever, but it’s also getting plenty of criticism for its lack of notable improvements. Additionally, the new laptop has a graphics issue that Apple is currently investigating, and if that wasn’t enough, there also appears to be a potential battery problem affecting some units. DON’T MISS: Microsoft kicks off 12 Days of Deals sale: Good Windows 10, Xbox One, and VR deals \nAccording to some MacRumors readers, the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is experiencing shorter battery life than expected. Some users say they’re getting between three to six hours of battery life on a charge instead of the 10 hours advertised.\n“Currently I’m powering a 1080p external monitor and casually browsing with Chrome. At full charge, I’m getting an estimate of 3 hours battery life. With gaming it’s even less,” one reader wrote.\n“I bought a maxed out 13-inch Touch Bar model, and I’ve been using it for about a week,” a second user said. “With light use, I’ve been consistently getting around 5-6.5 hours when mainly browsing. Apple claims 10 hours wireless web but my battery has never lasted this long.”\nA third user said that a 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar got around three hours and 45 minutes of battery life on a single charge during “normal usage” that included web browsing, YouTube video watching, and software development.\nA different user said battery life dropped by 5% in just 12 minutes.\nSimilar stories were also posted on Reddit, which suggests that there are quite a few users who’re seeing battery estimates well below what Apple is advertising. At the same time, this isn’t necessarily a widespread issue, as other users note that their machines are working properly.\n“I’ve been working non-stop for the past 1.5 hours, back and forth between emails, Safari, Calendar, Messages, organizing files, editing some PDFs in Adobe Acrobat DC, and building a financial model in Excel,” a different user said on Reddit. “I started at 100% and am now at 92% battery, with an estimated 10 hours 35 minutes remaining. If you’re not getting this kind of battery life on your MBP, you should definitely get it checked out.”\nApple is yet to address the manner in an official capacity, as it did recently with the iPhone 6s . But if you’re experiencing lower-than-expected battery life on your brand new MacBook Pro, you should definitely have it inspected by an Apple Store genius as soon as possible.\nTrending right now: \nThe Surface Pro 5 might be the Windows 10 MacBook Pro alternative you were looking for Microsoft kicks off 12 Days of Deals sale: Good Windows 10, Xbox One, and VR deals This palm-sized HD camera drone packs some serious flying power and is now just $99 See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "title": "iPhone battery replacement: Apple explains why your smartphone shuts down unexpectedly",
      "text": "Apple has unveiled the exact reasons causing the issue with the iPhone 6s smartphones and the batteries, on its China website. (Reuters) Apple iPhone 6s device users have been facing continuous issues with the battery as their smartphones shut down unexpectedly even when there is some charge left. Apple has unveiled the exact reasons causing the issue with the iPhone 6s smartphones and the batteries, on its China website. The company’s support page for China clarifies hat the battery parts of the iPhone was “exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs.” As a result, the batteries have started to degrade quicker than the normal phones which eventually lead to ‘unexpected shutdowns’. Apple has announced free battery replacement tools and programs for iPhone 6s users who are facing this problem.\nHowever, Apple in the note says that there is no safety issue regarding this. This comes as a relief for the consumers as well as Apple itself, as Samsung had to stop the production of Galaxy Note 7 after the recent exploding batteries issue. Apple has apologised for the ‘inconvenience this has caused customers’, and on the website said that users can get their batteries replaced. The battery issue affects iPhones which were manufactured between September 2015 to October 2015 and was first reported in China itself. Apple will replace the batteries globally and the offer is valid till 3 years since the sale of the first product.\nAlso read | Apple introduces new tool to check if your iPhone battery is eligible for replacement\nYou can check out a page set up by Apple, “apple.com/in/support/iphone6s-unexpectedshutdown/”, where you can find the details of the new program under which there is the new tool which can be explored if the iPhone you have qualifies for the replacement. The new tool by Apple enables the user to enter the serial number of the smartphone and check it their iPhone is eligible. In a previous post by 9to5Mac, it put out information about the serial numbers on the list.\nIf you have an iPhone 6S and wish to find the serial number, you need to go to Settings>General>About. Go down to the serial number option. Enter that serial number on the Apple Support page and you will know if your iPhone is eligible for replacement or repair. Make sure you delete all your data before giving the phone for repairing and shut down the ‘Find my iPhone’ option also.",

      "text": "The latest sales estimates for wearables are out, and the Apple Watch continues to lose ground against inexpensive fitness trackers like Fitbits, according to a new estimate from IDC. \nApple shipped 1.1 million Apple Watches in the third quarter, IDC estimated, down 71% from the 3.9 million it sold a year ago in the same quarter. The other top 5 wearable companies, Fitbit, Xiaomi, Garmin, and Samsung, all saw annual gains.\nAll four companies aside from Apple sell low-cost step trackers, which have found success because they are simple and solve a single problem, as compared to the Apple Watch, which offers fitness, notification, and app store platform features. \n\"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme. Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device,\" IDC research analyst Jitesh Ubrani said in a statement. \nApple watch sales have been falling on an annual basis for the last two quarters. About Apple's relative struggles, IDC noted:\nApple's decision to launch its second-generation watches in mid-September, towards the end of the quarter, did contribute to its year-over-year decline in 3Q16. However, the primary reasons for the downturn were an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface. Though both issues have been addressed with the latest generation watches, Apple's success will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged.\nThe fourth quarter will be critical to Apple's smartwatch as retailers discount and promote the product that CEO Tim Cook expects to be a seasonal product, \"similar to the historical seasonality of iPod.\"\nApple needs a strong holiday season to buoy Apple Watch sales, which it has never publicly revealed. \nHere's the chart:\nREUTERS/Danny Moloshok \nNOW WATCH: 7 places you can’t find on Google Maps \n",

      "text": "By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc is wading in to the debate over regulation of self-driving cars, declaring it is excited about the potential for automated transportation and calling on U.S. regulators not to restrict testing of such vehicles.\nA five-page letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is the company's most comprehensive statement yet about its interest in self-driving vehicle technology. The Nov. 22 letter followed more than a year of industry speculation about the computer and iPhone maker's plans for expanding into transportation.\n\"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" Kenner wrote.\n\"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience — to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\"\nApple urged regulators not to impose too many restrictions on testing of self-driving cars, saying \"established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally.\"\nSince software would decide what actions to take in potentially dangerous situations, Apple said certain areas need special attention. These include the implications of algorithmic decisions for the safety, mobility and legality of automated vehicles and their occupants, ensuring privacy and security in design, and the impact of the cars on employment and public spaces.\nSome analysts forecast millions of jobs will be lost once self-driving cars largely replace truck, taxi and Uber drivers, and eliminate the need for most vehicle repairs, insurance adjusters and other functions.\nApple's letter was prompted by its heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems, company spokesman Tom Neumayr said in an emailed statement.\n\"There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,\" he said.\nIn September, the Obama administration proposed guidelines for the development of self-driving cars in a 15-point \"safety assessment,\" calling on automakers to voluntarily submit details of their systems to regulators.\nApple executives have been coy about their interest in cars. Chief Executive Tim Cook has suggested that Apple wants to move beyond integration of Apple smartphones into vehicle infotainment systems.\nBut Apple has never confirmed reports last year that it was hiring automotive industry engineers and designers to develop a driverless electric car, or that those efforts have been sharply scaled back this year.\nOther companies pursuing self-driving cars include Alphabet Inc's Google unit, Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG, Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.\nApple has reportedly held talks about investing in British automaker McLaren Technology Group, but McLaren downplayed speculation that Apple had proposed an investment.\nApple joins a range of automakers and tech companies that have raised concerns about the proposed National Highway Traffic Safety Administration policy on self-driving cars, and plans by California state regulators to make complying with the safety assessment mandatory.\nAn auto trade group in November urged the incoming Trump administration to conduct a \"comprehensive regulatory review\" of all regulations and actions since Sept. 1, including the Obama administration's guidance on self-driving vehicles.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Richard Chang)",

      "text": "Developers pushing back against abusers of Apple’s App Store refund policy By Dan Pye ● 20 minutes ago \nApple’s full control of its App Store refund policy has drawn the ire of developers who say the company is allowing users to abuse loopholes to cheat them, The Korea Times reports. Apple independently determines whether customers get refunds, with developers unable to even obtain information about users that receive the refunds. That forces developers to track down users manually to ensure they’re not still using the content for which they’ve received refunds. The disconnect has allowed unscrupulous users to buy paid content multiple times, request refunds, and then continue using the content without paying for it. \nDevelopers claim that abusers have even created their own businesses around bilking the refund process on the behalf of others. Developers have been forced to take matters into their own hands, independently tracking down and blocking the accounts of abusers. Game studio Flint, creator of the role-playing game “Dragon Blaze,” claims to have used payment data and logs to track down about 300 users suspected of manipulating Apple’s refund policy and is planning to request an investigation from authorities in South Korea.

Delivering popular Apple-related news, advice and entertainment since 1999. Apple doesn't just want to control your car it wants to drive your life Computerworld | Dec 5, 2016 7:09 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nGee, just what will Apple do with all these fields of data? Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! \nThe problem with so many reports on Apple’s widely publicized letter to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is that they have been so distracted by the letter’s focus on cars, they miss the bigger picture. \nYou see, while the letter confirms the company is “excited about the potential” of automated transportation, it also suggests the company’s wider intent of putting intelligence everywhere . Apple wants to drive your life \nIn the second paragraph of the five-page letter , Apple’s director of product integrity, Steve Kenner writes: \n“Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal. The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the p otential of automated systems in many areas , including transportation.” (Italics mine). \nAn Apple spokesman has since explained the firm to “investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems”. \n“There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation, so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry,” they said. \nThese statements confirm Apple to be exploring multiple sectors in which it can apply connected intelligence. After all, why waste the potential of a billion iOS devices already in use worldwide? How can Apple build on this strong foundation? How can it further develop the AI opportunity ? Now the iPhone has connected the planet, what’s the next step for the firm? What now? \nApple has been uncharacteristically frank in its discussions on these opportunities, so you don’t need to reach too deeply to figure out some of the places it is using or will use these kinds of machine learning technologies: Wearables : Apple Watch should be seen as the beginning, it will not be the summit of its ambition in wearables. Health : We know Apple is working to develop digital health and crowdsourced health data — what do you think ResearchKit is about? The company is also working with IBM to develop health and support services for the elderly and in numerous other implementations. Photography : Faces. Maps : Everything from traffic data and more. Siri: Siri learns as it gets used and Apple is developing contextual intelligence in this sector. Apple Store : Apple uses deep learning to detect fraud at its store. Smart homes : HomeKit . Apple Music : Recommendations and more. \nIn other words, Apple is looking at deep learning, personalization, prediction, voice, health research, maintenance and provision, connected car and V2V communication systems, and that's just the implementations we can guess at. Data disruption \nEvery connected mobile device created data. If properly analyzed this data can provide actionable insights that can make a big difference in numerous ways. \nSmart cities, smart cars, smart infrastructure, smart health — you can take any process you like and shove the word smart in front of it to see the potential. \nEven the world’s oldest industries could benefit: what might a smart tractor do and how could it benefit agricultural production? What about smart cattle trackers? Or smart crop production systems? \nSmart agriculture may not be a target industry for Apple, but it isn’t hard to see how the connected devices it already offers can play a part within this, or any other, sector. \nThat Apple is developing technologies for an Apple Car is just the tip of a much bigger iceberg. \nGeneral purpose machine intelligence, smart workspaces, connected homes, human augmentation and software defined anything are the emerging technologies of our age, with VR and AR solutions set to become mainstream, probably in months — look forward to the AR iMac, people. One step beyond \nApple's big investments in ride sharing tech show it to be working very hard (and laying big money down) to ensure it has a part to play in the smart future. \nWhen it comes to other implementations, Apple constantly repeats the rubric that it seeks ways in which its technologies can make a positive difference to the world. \nApple's recent R&D spending confirms it continues to make huge investments in building these. Its ownership of arguably the world’s best mobile processor, the A-series chips, means it has the potential to get inside almost anything. \nThe opportunity exists for Apple to stake space in industries tech firms have never previously had a footprint in. Would you buy health insurance from Apple if it meant you got a new Apple Watch each year and got lower premiums for staying healthy with good self-care rewarded by iTunes vouchers? Would you purchase vehicle insurance if you gained rewards for driving responsibly? Those things are already happening in the insurance industry. \nNow, I’m not saying Apple has a plan to enter that market, but given the growing importance of personal analytics and health data within that industry, the company has the opportunity to do so. Augmenting human experience \nThe barriers between tech and daily life are breaking down. “Technology will continue to become more human-centric to the point where it will introduce transparency between people, businesses, and things,” predicted Gartner earlier this year. \n“This relationship will become much more entwined as the evolution of technology becomes more adaptive, contextual and fluid within the workplace, at home, and interacting with businesses and other people.” \nWhen I read the letter to the NHTSA I’m not only interested because it confirms Apple’s interest in vehicles, but because it also confirms the company is exploring multiple ways in which automated systems can disrupt everything . And these explorations will have big implications on tomorrow's world. \nGoogle+?

      "text": "Comment Google showcases an image of a 3D view of the Cliff House that is located in San Francisco. Google/AP \nApple has not had the best track record when it comes to mapping apps as well as navigation for the consumer. However, they do have deep pockets as well as a slew of creative brains in the company. This allows them to draw on different kinds of ideas in order to gain a competitive edge over the rest of its rivals, and where mapping is concerned, it looks like drones could be called upon in the near future by Cupertino in order to let them have an edge over Google and the Google Maps app. \nJust how will drones be able to change the way in which navigation apps work from Apple’s perspective? Well, the use of a drone will be able to let Apple keep track of any kind of changes made to road conditions as well as keeping tabs on construction areas. This will then be able to offer on-the-fly travel updates for users of the corresponding app. \nThis entire fleet of drones will work in tandem with Apple’s collection of minivans that have cameras installed on them. Such synergy will allow Apple to make amends and improve on their Maps service. There is a whole lot of room for improvement on Apple’s side, where Apple would certainly love to see a revamp in its location services serve up a greater degree of interaction and integration with other retail apps, and even ride-hailing/sharing apps. \nThis fleet of survey drones would certainly need to have a rather sizeable team to monitor them, as drones do not have the best returns in terms of battery life, and what of the more sensitive areas where laws prohibit drones from flying? It would certainly be interesting to see how Apple will develop this idea, and just how far they would go in terms of implementing it. \nEddy Cue, Apple’s SVP of Internet software and services, shared , “We had long discussions at the ET [executive team] level about the importance of Maps, where we thought it was going in the future, and could we treat it as a third-party app? We don’t do every app. We’re not trying to create a Facebook app. They do a great job. We decided that Maps is integral to our whole platform. There were so many features that we wanted to build that are dependent on that technology, and we couldn’t see ourselves being in a position where that was something that we didn’t own. Let’s say I’m at home doing email before work. I’d like Maps to tell me, ‘Don’t leave now. Your commute will be cut by 15 minutes if you stay home for a while.’ That would be very helpful.” Relevance in a user’s life is always the perfect trump card for any company to succeed with its products among the masses. \nThe other thing that would certainly get one thinking is this. If it works, and works well, what is stopping the likes of Google from jumping aboard the same bandwagon and perhaps even improve on it? That would mean Apple would have lost its competitive edge in this particular area. Well, that is the beauty of capitalism, and it is nice to see ideas being thrown about by the big boys to make our everyday lives easier. At the end of the day, if the service is free and it works well, it would be a win-win situation for all of us consumers. \nOh yeah, if Apple comes out tops in this idea, you can bet your bottom dollar that their stock is going to soar once more to a new plateau, simply because you would need an iOS-powered device for it to play nice with the corresponding app.",

      "text": "Apple kicked off the era of capacitive touchscreen smartphones, but its display technology has fallen a little behind in recent years. The AMOLED panels used by smartphone makers like Samsung can best Apple’s LCDs in every category, but Apple might be planning to play catch up with the iPhone 8. This device is increasingly rumored to be sporting a curved OLED display.\nThe Apple rumor mill has gotten plenty of things wrong over the years (remember that Apple TV set that never came out?). But iPhone rumors have been fairly solid. Apple makes relatively few models of iPhone, so it needs a lot of the same few components. That means plenty of movement in the supply chain that analysts can track. As Apple preps for the iPhone 8, component suppliers are amassing stockpiles of OLED parts. Specifically, recent reports point to Interflex, BH, and Samsung Electro-Mechanics as suppliers of the components, which will be used by Samsung Display to manufacture the panels used in the iPhone 8.\nSamsung’s display manufacturing has provided most of the high-quality AMOLED panels in recent years. The alternative designs from firms like LG are still far behind. Compared with an LCD, Samsung’s latest AMOLED panels have much higher maximum brightness, and richer, more accurate colors. AMOLED screens have much faster refresh rates as well. AMOLED produces light from the pixels themselves, meaning no LED backlight assembly is needed. That reduces the thickness of the device, so maybe Apple can use the added space to put the headphone jack back? Okay, probably not. A legitimate upshot of this property is that black pixels are completely off and do not use power.\nThe Edge display on a Galaxy S7 Edge.\nAs for the curved aspect of the display, that’s just a way to combat Samsung. OLED panels are naturally flexible, so why not go for it? The curved screen has been working for Samsung. The Galaxy Note 7 (before its untimely death ) was only available with a curved display. Samsung has been seeing significantly higher sales of the curved versions of its Galaxy S phones. In fact, it may not even make a flat version of the Galaxy S8. There’s really no functional reason to have a curved screen, but it looks nice.\nThe rumor mill points to Apple using the curved design to push the iPhone 8’s bezels to the absolute minimum. This has sometimes caused problems with palm rejection (i.e. phantom touches). Apple’s going to have to tackle that better than Samsung has. The iPhone 8 may also have a fingerprint reader and home button embedded in the display itself.\nThere may be a few designs for next year’s iPhone, one with the curved display and another more conventional. The leaks should pick up over the summer as early test devices are churned out.",

      "text": "Ahead of the official launch of Single Sign-on on tvOS 10.1 and iOS 10.2 later this month, Apple has added a new App Store section with apps that support the feature for beta testers. The apps are categorized by supported TV providers, including DirecTV, Dish, Sling TV, Hotwire, and GVTC.\nIf you are a Dish Network satellite TV subscriber, for example, you can sign in once with your Dish username and password to start using any of the following apps, among others: Watch Cooking Channel, Watch DIY, Watch Travel Channel, Hallmark Channel Everywhere, and Watch Food Network.\n\nWhen you open an app that supports Single Sign-on on iOS 10.2 beta, a pop-up alert asks if you \"want to allow XYZ to use your sign in credentials,\" according to beta testers. If you decline, the app lets you sign in and authenticate with a provider-specific username and password as usual.\n\nOn a fourth-generation Apple TV running tvOS 10.1 beta, Single Sign-on can be accessed by opening the Settings app and navigating to Accounts > TV Provider. On an iPhone or iPad running iOS 10.2 beta, Single Sign-on can be accessed by opening the Settings app and tapping on the TV Provider section.\n\nSingle Sign-on will be available on tvOS 10.1 and iOS 10.2 in December upon completion of beta testing, enabling U.S. customers to sign in once with their cable TV credentials to access all live cable content available through their cable TV subscription, even when it is spread across multiple apps.\nTags: App Store, iOS 10.2, tvOS 10.1, Single Sign-on\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

Apple's New TV App, Single Sign-On Feature Are Launching Soon Further proof the new goodies are coming in just a few days by Bryan M. Wolfe December 5, 2016 \nApple promised that the company’s new TV app for iOS and tvOS would launch before the end of the year alongside the new single sign-on feature. Today, Dec. 5, we’ve seen the clearest sign yet that Apple plans on sticking to that time frame. \nWorks with DirecTV \nBeta users who activate a TV provider in iOS 10.2 beta 5 now see a link that shows which apps support the selected cable or satellite company. This will make it a lot easier for users to find great content on both iOS devices and Apple TV. \nFirst introduced in September, the single sign-On features allows you to enter cable or satellite credentials in one place and access all of the available apps in your subscription package. \nTo date, the following providers support single sign-on: CenturyLink Prism, DirecTV, Dish, GTA, Hawaiian Telecom, Hotwire, and Sling TV . More content providers are expected to sign up for the new service prior to the public launch. \nCurrent supported providers \nTying all of this together is the upcoming TV app for iOS and tvOS . The new app helps to unify the TV watching experience, allowing users to see all the shows and movies you’re watching, find upcoming episodes, and get personalized recommendations on what to watch next. \nYou can learn more about the new TV app here . \nLast week, the long-anticipated DirecTV Now service went online . Available for as little as $35 per month, the satellite-free video streaming service is available on Apple TV and other platforms including iOS and Roku. While DirecTV Now doesn’t currently support Apple’s single sign-on feature, we expect that it will very soon. As noted, DirecTV proper already does support the feature. \nFor more on the new features, see:",

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo A new letter sent to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) confirms that Apple is investing heavily in autonomous vehicles. It comes as little surprise. The letter asks for Apple to be treated as equal to firms that are already operating in the space. It’s a high demand and one that might stir up a little controversy, especially given Apple’s lack of history in the industry. Indeed, there seems to be more evidence that Apple isn’t even building a car.\nIn fact, if you had asked me a year ago if I thought Apple was building its own car, I would have said yes. After all, last February, Tim Cook said that the wait for the fruits of Apple’s investments in autonomous driving would be worth it, comparing the anticipation to a child waiting for Santa on Christmas Eve . Now, it seems like Apple has started to cut down on its original “Project Titan” plans , instead focusing on technology that might be used to power autonomous vehicles built by other companies.\nThe letter to the NHTSA was written by Apple’s head of product integrity, Steve Kenner, according to BBC. Apple told BBC that the letter was drafted because Apple felt that it needed to voice its opinion to create “best practices in the industry.” Kenner also confirmed Apple has been making “heavy investment in machine learning and autonomous systems.” Kenner seems to be trying to get Apple ahead of the ball, too, well aware that the company is going to face increased competition from automakers and other companies that are already well-known in the space.\nSpecifically, the letter asks the NHTSA to create a level playing field for all firms, no matter how long they’ve been working on autonomous products.\n“Established manufacturers and new entrants should be treated equally,” Kenner said, according to BBC . This is probably Apple’s way of asking the NHTSA to give Apple a say in creating some of the fledgling autonomous car industry’s new standards, even though firms like Google, Tesla, Volvo, Uber, Ford and others are building autonomous systems and testing, often in the public eye, with status updates from companies like Google on how well tests are performing.\nI’m not sure I agree with Apple’s request, though I’m well aware I don’t get to call the shots.\nApple needs to come public with its car plans first I would understand if there’s hesitation from the NHTSA to allow for Apple to help set ground rules if it can’t show what it’s working on. Take Google and Tesla, for example. Both firms are much more transparent in the sorts of tests they’re running, what the cars are capable of and, especially, what sort of mistakes are made. In June, Google said it will now report every time one of its autonomous vehicles gets in a car crash during testing . That allows us to see what works and what doesn’t, and to at least begin to understand how autonomous vehicles work. Tesla’s Autopilot features are already live on the roads, so its accidents are already very public and, in fact, a bit scary.\nApple’s used to calling the shots, even in industries where it doesn’t have a history of participation. Take the iPhone launch back in 2007, for example. Apple got AT&T to agree to exclusively sell its new phones without any control of the product whatsoever. Verizon famously turned that offer down, preferring to be in control of the products it sells. AT&T ultimately made the right decision and earned new customers as a result of the iPhone’s success.\nThis isn’t a phone. It’s a death box that will approach 80mph. An Apple Car, or even just software and hardware developed by Apple for autonomous cars, isn’t the same as a phone. Lives are at risk and so it should not just be developed in secret and sold to the public. It needs to be developed in the open where everyone can seem, and I think only then does Apple have the right to set ground rules on the same playing field as companies who do test opens.\nIf we’re going to put our trust into car systems that are capable of making potentially life or death decisions in a split second, shouldn’t we know how well the internal tests are going? After all, we’re the ones who will be at risk when we decide to get behind the wheel.\n\n\nSource : BBC ",

      "text": "Nissan’s ProPilot is a self-driving chair \nApple has finally shed some light on their self-driving car plans. Not a particularly bright light, mind you, but that wouldn’t have been very Apple-y, would it? \nIn a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), director of product integrity Steve Kenner said that the company is “excited” about self-driving cars. That’s something that was already pretty clear to anyone who’s been following Apple Car/Project Titan developments. Still, it’s nice to finally see an official statement. \nApple’s letter fell well short of confirming anything other than possibilities, really. Kenner’s full comment was that “Apple is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” \nSo, yes, Apple is still open to doing something driverless car-related. Are they building their own driverless car? Probably not, despite the lengthy string of rumors pointing to the contrary. \nTheir comments to the NHTSA centered around data sharing related to accidents, saying that “companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses” so that a “comprehensive dataset” can be assembled to benefit the entire industry. Not just the companies actually building driverless cars, but also the companies that are supplying things like sensors and software. \nIt’s looking increasingly that the second group is where Apple sees themselves. They’re not a car company, after all, but they’ve got plenty of experience with technology related to driverless cars like artificial intelligence, mapping, and virtual assistants.Apple is in a strong position to provide critical software to automakers, and they’ve already got their foot in the door thanks to numerous integration deals that have landed CarPlay and Siri in infotainment systems.

      "text": "Subscribe to the MacRumors Newsletter Apple Watch Takes Just 5% Share of Wearables Market as Basic Fitness Trackers 'Reign Supreme' Monday December 5, 2016 8:21 am PST by Joe Rossignol While the Apple Watch remains the world's best selling smartwatch, the latest data from market research firm IDC reveals basic wearables \"reign supreme\" as consumers gravitate towards simple, dedicated fitness devicesâwhich also typically cost less than the Apple Watch and other smartwatches. Shipments in millions (Source: IDC) Basic wearables accounted for 85% of the market and experienced double-digit growth in the third quarter, according to IDC. Fitbit remained the leader with 23% market share, up from 21.4% a year ago, on the strength of its new Charge 2 fitness tracker. Fitbit shipped an estimated 5.3 million wearables in the quarter. Xiaomi trailed in second as its $14.99 Mi Band is priced well below any competing wearables, allowing the Chinese company to capture 16.5% market share based on an estimated 3.8 million shipments in the quarter. Xiaomi's market share remained virtually unchanged from 16.4% a year ago. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch captured just a 4.9% share of the broader wearables market in the quarter based on an estimated 1.1 million shipments , according to IDC. Comparatively, in the year-ago quarter, Apple had an estimated 3.9 million Apple Watch shipments for a much higher 17.5% market share. \"It's still early days, but we're already seeing a notable shift in the market,\" said Jitesh Ubrani senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. \"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme. Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device. Meanwhile, from a design perspective, many devices are focusing on fashion first while allowing the technology to blend in with the background.\" IDC attributed Apple's decline in the third quarter to an \"aging lineup\" and an \"unintuitive user interface.\" Apple addressed those concerns with Apple Watch Series 2 , but the second-generation models launched in mid-September and therefore did not have a full impact on the third quarter. Apple does not officially disclose Apple Watch sales, instead grouping the device under its \"Other Products\" category in earnings results.",

      "title": "MacBook Pro Diary: I’m one week in, and it turns out my first impressions were wrong",
      "text": "Reddit \nThe main reason I’ve adopted this Diary format for reviewing Apple kit is that first impressions can be misleading. The iPad, for example, launched to very mixed reviews. I won’t embarrass my fellow tech writers by naming names, but the Guardian did a round-up at the time. \nThen there’s my own Apple Watch experience . Going from clear smartwatch skeptic – wondering why anyone would want one – to a complete convert . With the new MacBook Pro , my impressions from the keynote were that I would like it but not love it . It looks like a very nice machine. I’m fully expecting to enjoy the smaller form factor and the new features – even if I will really miss the larger screen – but I’m not expecting to love it. It doesn’t excite me the way I feel that a new generation ought to after four years of more-or-less stagnation. \nIt turns out I was wrong … \nNot in a dramatic way. It hasn’t been an ‘oh my god, why didn’t I see this before?’ experience. But, slowly, quietly, I have come to absolutely love this machine. \nGiven that my verdict on the machine is very much a ‘sum of the parts’ one, rather than a single standout feature, I’ll start by talking through the specifics before summing-up with why the combination of those has turned me into a big fan. \nI also won’t repeat comments I made last time, so I’d suggest reading my previous diary piece first if you haven’t yet done so. Form-factor I’m coming from a 17-inch ‘classic’ MacBook Pro, so the difference in form-factor for me is dramatic. My 17-inch machine literally travelled around the world with me, but I didn’t generally carry it with me in London – I used an 11-inch MacBook Air as my main mobile writing machine. But even the 15-inch version of the new model is so compact and light, I decided to try taking this with me instead, and it worked absolutely fine. It is heavier, at 4lb rather than 2.4lb, but that difference is one I can live with. Size-wise, it fits comfortably into my bicycle bag. I probably won’t actually sell the Air – it’s always good to have a backup machine when you depend on a Mac to earn a living – but I am, for all practical purposes, now a one-Mac person. \nTouch ID \nAs with iOS devices, this is a small feature that makes a big difference. I’ve been doing some side-by-side comparisons with my 17-inch ‘classic’ MacBook Pro, and every time I have to enter my password to unlock it, it feels like a chore. \nI mentioned last time that it isn’t that well supported yet, but once it is, this is going to be a significant feature. It’s notable that Touch ID was actually the most-loved feature in our poll . \nTouch Bar A UBS analyst recently suggested that Apple launched the Watch without a clear idea of the job it was meant to perform. The company initially pushed notifications and communicating with friends, then retrospectively re-invented it as a health & fitness device when that seemed to get more traction. I did initially wonder whether Apple had done the same thing with the Touch Bar: invented a cool piece of tech and then tried to figure out what it’s for. That impression wasn’t helped by me considering that many of its uses were either gimmicks – like auto-correct (pointless as you’re looking at the screen, not the keyboard, while typing) – or downright silly, like microscopic Safari or photo thumbnails. However, glitches aside, I haven’t yet found any downside. And there are a few things I like about it. None of them are big deals. In fact, individually, they are all really trivial, but they do add up to a feature which is beginning to make sense to me. I mentioned the volume slider before. This is a tiny feature, but it is, all the same, a delight to use. It allows you to set the speaker sound both easily and precisely. The dedicated Siri button is another tiny feature, but as someone who uses Siri a lot, I appreciate the convenience. And some apps also use the Touch Bar in sensible ways. Calculator, for example. The Touch Bar puts the operations keys directly above the numbers, making it far more convenient than the usual hard keys scattered around the keyboard, plus the need to use the shift key. It’s still not as convenient as a numeric keypad, of course, but it’s a big step in that direction without the need for any additional hardware keys. There are other cases where I couldn’t initially see any point to the Touch Bar replicating on-screen content, but it has actually turned out to be slightly more convenient. Ending a FaceTime call, for example. When you’re chatting with someone, the chances are you’re not actively using the Mac at the same time, so just to be able to reach forward to tap a very visible End button afterwards is just a bit quicker and more convenient than using the trackpad. Sure, this is utterly trivial, but when enough of these tiny conveniences add up, it turns into something worthwhile. It was bugging me that I didn’t have permanent access to music controls, but some experimentation revealed a useful setting. I never use actual function keys as in F1, F2, etc, so I set the fn key to ‘Expand Control Strip’ – now the music controls are always just a keypress away. (System Preferences > Keyboard.) So now, holding down the fn key reveals the music controls. However, I have noticed that they don’t always work when focus is not on the Music app – hopefully a glitch that will be quickly resolved. Some have expressed concern about the loss of a hardware Escape key. I’m not a coder (my own programming skills didn’t get any further than Basic and Pascal), so I can’t comment from a developer perspective, but from an everyday usage point of view, I haven’t ever found it an issue. The Touch Bar does time-out when you’re not actively using the Mac, such as when watching a movie, but even when it’s not lit it is still functional, so pressing the left-hand edge of the bar will still exit full-screen viewing instantly. You don’t have to touch the bar once to light it and again to press a key, and the Escape key location is a sufficiently large touch target that I’ve been able to reliably hit it. So, in summary, my view is that – while the Touch Bar is being used in some gimmicky and downright stupid ways – it is a useful feature in some ways, and I think it will become more useful as more apps support it. I don’t love it, but I do like it, and expect to like it more. Keyboard I said last time that the second-generation butterfly keyboard immediately felt good, though my accuracy was slightly poorer. I think the reason for this is two-fold. First, the gaps between the keys are slightly smaller than before. Second, the butterfly mechanism means that a keypress is registered even if you only hit the very edge of the key. This is a positive in some ways, but a negative in others – the older keyboard typically didn’t register a glancing strike. But my overall verdict is that this is an utterly fantastic keyboard! Back in the day, I used to love mechanical keyboards. This one couldn’t be more different to those: where they had huge key travel, this one has almost none. And yet, what it does have in common with those, is a really positive, clicky feel. You are in no doubt when a key has been pressed. It seems to me that this provides the best of both worlds: the slim nature of a chicklet keyboard with the positive feel of a deep one. Of all the keyboards I’ve used of late – the ‘classic’ MacBook Pro, the previous MacBook Air and the Magic Keyboard – the 2016 MacBook Pro keyboard is by far my favourite. I really love it. Ports I said last time that, once I had everything set up, the switch to all-USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports wasn’t likely to prove a big deal to me, and that has indeed proven the case. In the office, I have the power brick and Apple Thunderbolt Display connected (via an adapter), and everything else is plugged into the monitor exactly as before. In the living-room, I have another power brick and USB speakers (via an adapter). On the move, I carry this tiny $45 Satechi pass-thru hub . You can put me firmly into the ‘much ado about nothing’ camp. Battery-life This, so far, is my one significant complaint about the machine. In a test with only the apps I was actively using open, and working three notches down from maximum brightness, I got 6h 3m from 100% to 3%. That’s obviously very disappointing in a brand-new machine when compared to Apple’s claimed 10 hours – not just in terms of the machine not being able to make it through a full day’s work on battery, but also because Apple didn’t used to mislead people like that. My rule of thumb for manufacturer battery-life claims has always been to divide them by two. Manufacturers tend to use highly unrealistic settings – low screen brightness, continuous use, super-strong WiFi signal, one app open and so on. But Apple used to stand out as a company which didn’t play those sorts of games. With the iPad, it still doesn’t – I have always genuinely got 10 hours plus from my iPads. Six hours isn’t terrible: it’s more than enough for me most of the time. What’s terrible is delivering six hours when you’ve promised ten. Sure, battery-life will vary depending on usage patterns, but looking around, 5-7 hours seems to be entirely typical – though a few reviewers are, somehow, getting closer to ten, and a few are reporting as little as three. As an aside on battery-life, you could argue I’m wrong about the Touch Bar having no downsides – it does obviously consume some power – but OLED is more power-efficient than LCD, and it switches off when you’re not actively using the machine, so really it’s going to be the equivalent of the screen size being a tiny bit larger. The hit on battery life is probably of the order of 1-2%. Performance You have have noticed that I haven’t commented on the machine’s performance, and that’s simply because I haven’t yet used it for many demanding tasks. Video editing in Final Cut Pro will be my real test, so I’ll report back on that in a week or two. Conclusions There is no single stand-out feature for me in the 2016 MacBook Pro. What there is instead is a whole bunch of features, some smaller, some bigger, that add up to a machine that I have quickly grown to love. It’s beautiful. It’s extremely compact for the screen size. It’s slim. It’s light. It has Touch ID. The Touch Bar is starting to make its benefits felt. The screen quality is jaw-dropping. The speakers are loud. The vast trackpad is great. The keyboard is utterly fantastic. I’m adapting to the (for me) smaller screen faster than I thought I would. What makes me love the machine is the way that the complete package adds up. Each individual benefit a nice-to-have, but put them all together and you get a machine which is just a joy to use. My initial assessment, then, is that I was half-right: the machine still doesn’t wow me – there isn’t any one individual feature that is sufficiently impressive to do that – but I do, in fact, love it. As always, let us know in the comments how you’re getting on with yours. Guides",

      "text": "THE DRONES REPORT: Market forecasts, regulatory barriers, top vendors, and leading commercial applications \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nApple's rumored plans to use drones to bolster its Maps service could face obstacles from the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), according to Recode . \nThe news reflects the idea that the biggest barrier to enterprise drone adoption, which is on the rise, continues to be regulation from local and national governments. \nAs it currently stands, the FAA prohibits drones from flying over airports and densely populated areas. It's possible for companies to request waivers to bypass these rules — Alphabet has done so, for example — but operators are then still only allowed to fly the drones on private property. That could pose a major problem for companies like Apple, which would need to seek numerous exemptions from the agency in order to map out urban centers across the US. \nThis is a high-profile example of some of the issues companies face trying to employ drones in the current regulatory environment. The FAA maintains authority over commercial and enterprise drones in the US. But as an increasingly large number of major companies like Apple hope to use drones to enhance their operations, products, and services, the agency might need to consider updating its policies. It's possible that shift could begin in 2018, when the expected release of commercial drone delivery policies could begin to change the regulatory environment around enterprise drone usage. \nDrones turned the corner in 2015 to become a popular consumer device, while a framework for regulation that legitimizes drones in the US began to take shape. Technological and regulatory barriers still exist to further drone adoption. \nDrone manufacturers and software providers are quickly developing technologies like geo-fencing and collision avoidance that will make flying drones safer. The accelerating pace of drone adoption is also pushing governments to create new regulations that balance safety and innovation. \nSafer technology and better regulation will open up new applications for drones in the commercial sector, including drone delivery programs like Amazon’s Prime Air and Google’s Project Wing initiatives. \nBI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed drones report that forecasts sales revenues for consumer, enterprise, and military drones. It also projects the growth of drone shipments for consumers and enterprises. \nThe report details several of world’s major drone suppliers and examines trends in drone adoption among several leading industries. Finally, it examines the regulatory landscape in several markets and explains how technologies like obstacle avoidance and drone-to-drone communications will impact drone adoption. \nHere are some of the key takeaways from the report: We project revenues from drones sales to top $12 billion in 2021, up from just over $8 billion last year. Shipments of consumer drones will more than quadruple over the next five years, fueled by increasing price competition and new technologies that make flying drones easier for beginners. Growth in the enterprise sector will outpace the consumer sector in both shipments and revenues as regulations open up new use cases in the US and EU, the two biggest potential markets for enterprise drones. Technologies like geo-fencing and collision avoidance will make flying drones safer and make regulators feel more comfortable with larger numbers of drones taking to the skies. Right now FAA regulations have limited commercial drones to a select few industries and applications like aerial surveying in the agriculture, mining, and oil and gas sectors. The military sector will continue to lead all other sectors in drone spending during our forecast period thanks to the high cost of military drones and the growing number of countries seeking to acquire them. \nIn full, the report: Compares drone adoption across the consumer, enterprise, and government sectors. Breaks down drone regulations across several key markets and explains how they’ve impacted adoption. Discusses popular use cases for drones in the enterprise sector, as well as nascent use case that are on the rise. Analyzes how different drone manufacturers are trying to differentiate their offerings with better hardware and software components. Explains how drone manufacturers are quickly enabling autonomous flight in their products that will be a major boon for drone adoption. \nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT \nThe choice is yours.

      "text": "Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) stock price target was cut at Pacific Crest, which cited \"stable, but uninspiring\" demand for the technology giant's new iPhones. Analyst Andy Hargreaves kept his rating at overweight, saying the stock is still \"too cheap,\" but trimmed his price target to $127, or 16% above Friday's closing price of $109.90, frmo $129. \"While we believe Apple has slightly reduced its forecast to suppliers, the change is not drastic and is mostly a return to forecasts in place prior to an increase in October,\" Hargreaves wrote in a note to clients. Still he cut, his estimate for fiscal first-quarter iPhone sales to 76.8 million units from 78.3 million, and his fiscal 2017 estimate to 225.0 million from 231.9 million. Hargreaves slashed his fiscal 2017 earnings-per-share outlook to $8.58 from $8.94, compared with the FactSet consensus of $9.00. He said he believes the iPhone estimate changes, recent currency moves, concerns over trade policy and the potential for costs in the next iPhone cycle to increase all pose threats to gross margins. \"This is likely to act as an overhang that reduces optimism around near-term upside potential,\" Hargreaves said. The stock, which edged up 0.3% in premarket trade, has lost 1% since the election through Friday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has rallied 4.6%.\n-Tomi Kilgore;\n 0854ET\n ",

      "title": "Apple to open seventh Shanghai store on Dec. 10",
      "text": "Apple to open seventh Shanghai store on Dec. 10   07:47 am PT (10:47 am ET) Apple is preparing to launch its next Chinese store in Shanghai on Saturday, Dec. 10, throwing open the doors at 10 a.m. local time. The outlet will be based out of Vanke Mall in Qibao , located in the suburbs of the city. Hours will run from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week, unlike many of Apple's stores in Europe or North America, which normally have reduced hours on one or more days and can sometimes shut down entirely on Sundays. The Qibao shop will be Apple's seventh in Shanghai, cementing the city's status as one of the most densely-covered in terms of Apple stores. The company is up to 489 locations worldwide, and is likely to hit 500 early into 2017. Although China hasn't proven the growth market Apple anticipated —largely due to intense competition from local smartphone makers like Huawei and Oppo —the country is still a major source of revenue, second only to the Americas and likely to take the lead in the next few years.

Roughly 23 million wearables were shipped last quarter, with basic wearables, mostly comprised of fitness bands, accounting for 85% of the market and growing at a double-digit pace. Fitbit Inc. (FIT) maintained its place as the market leader, capturing a 23% share, with shipments growing 11% year-over-year. Xiaomi, Garmin (GRMN), Apple (AAPL) and Samsung rounded out the top five, however Apple's shipments tumbled 71% year-over-year, reducing its share to 1.1% versus 3.9% last year. Samsung's shipments, meanwhile, soared 90%, boosting its share to 1% from 0.5% a year ago. Shares of Apple fell 0.3% to $109.57 in late-morning trade Monday, while those of Fitbit rose 1.8% to $8.29.

The result, they told Korea Times in an interview published on Sunday and earlier discovered by Apple-tracking site 9to5Mac, is users have their paid content but didn’t need to pay. One game developer, named Flint, said it’s found approximately 300 people that might have used the refund loophole.\nThe alleged problem appears to relate to the way Apple AAPL handles its App Store refunds. An unidentified source told Korea Times that Apple makes the sole decision on whether a customer should receive a full refund on an app purchase. If Apple decides to provide a refund, it doesn’t alert the app developer to the refund or say who was issued the credit, according to the Korea Times source. That then requires the developer to try to determine who might have sought a refund and see if users are still employing the previously purchased content--an exceedingly difficult task.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nAccording to the Korea Times source, Apple doesn’t provide data on user refunds due to privacy concerns.\nApple’s Terms of Service agreement says any transaction made through its iTunes Store or App Store are “final.” However, the company says it reserves the right to issue a refund “if technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of content.” The company adds that Apple will refuse refund requests if it has “evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipulative behavior that entitles Apple to a corresponding counterclaim.”\nWhile that policy would suggest that Apple wouldn’t offer refunds, the company still lets users request refunds on both mobile and online. And in 2014, Apple released a no-questions-asked 14-day return policy to customers in the European Union. Since the company has largely remained quiet on its policies, it’s possible that Apple also offers a no-questions-asked return policy elsewhere in the world.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nIt’s unclear how the customers are requesting their refunds from Apple and under what pretense, but the developers speaking to Korea Times say it’s a problem. Not only are they losing money on purchases, but taking the time to track customers can be onerous. The developers add that they’ve requested information on users who request refunds from Apple, but at least so far, the company hasn’t responded.\nApple did not immediately respond to a Fortune request for comment.",

      "text": " 16 AM EST Apple’s Watch Sales Plunged 71% In The Third Quarter \nTech titan Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) may still have the best-selling smartwatch in the world, but its share of the wearables pie continues to plummet. \nThe company shipped just 1.1 million Apple Watches in the third quarter, according to estimates from research firm IDC, which is a 71% drop from the 3.9 million shipped in the year-ago period. \nIn contrast, the other top 5 wearable companies, which include Fitbit, Xiaomi, Garmin, and Samsung, all saw annual gains for their devices in the third quarter. \nApple’s competitors in the space sell much lower-cost wearable technology, such a simple step counters. Those cheap and easy devices have proven successful in no small part because of their simplicity. While Apple Watch has a bit of a learning curve to figure out how to use it, and includes a host of other features like a heart rate monitor, iPhone integration, apps, and much more, consumers seem to be favoring a cheap, simple alternative that achieves a single purpose. \nOther factors for the Apple Watch’s decline include timing issues and a difficult interface, according to IDC: \nApple’s decision to launch its second-generation watches in mid-September, towards the end of the quarter, did contribute to its year-over-year decline in 3Q16. However, the primary reasons for the downturn were an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface. Though both issues have been addressed with the latest generation watches, Apple’s success will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged. \nThe current holiday quarter will be a pivotal tell for the device’s future prospects. If sales keep declining so precipitously, one can even imagine Apple nixing the device entirely from its lineup — or perhaps offering a much simpler, cheaper version to compete with the devices that have begun to rule the space. \nApple shares fell $0.63 (-0.58%) to $109.27   AAPL has gained 4.1%, versus an 8.41% rise   index during  ",

      "text": "Reddit \nThe Apple Watch Series 2 has another app making use of its standalone GPS, with Runkeeper launching a new version of its fitness tracker. The updated app can now not only log performance metrics like heart rate and distance traveled, but store the exact route you took as you jogged, ran, or struggled around the park. Meanwhile, Runkeeper has also tweaked its software to improve usability while you’re predominantly focusing on getting fit. \nSo, there’s now larger fonts on the main activity screen, which the company says should be easier to understand at a glance. The activity screen itself can now be customized, too. You can tap on an individual statistic and then flip between primary and secondary metrics, choosing which stays on-screen during your session. \nElsewhere, there’s now a heart rate graph that has been added, with a snapshot of the most recent five minutes. That can help with figuring out whether you’re at or above your maximum heart rate for an extended period, which Runkeeper sets based on age. If you’d prefer to adjust it, you can in the settings. \nA target pace graph does a similar thing but with the prior five minutes of whatever activity you’re up to. Again, it maps actual performance against target pace. Runkeeper for Apple Watch gives a haptic update every mile you go. \nRunkeeper did already have a standalone mode for those Apple Watch owners wanting to leave their iPhone at home. Released last year , it could track heart rate, distance, pace, and time. However, since the first-generation Apple Watch lacked GPS, you’d still need your smartphone if you wanted a log of where you’d actually been exercising. \nApple’s decision to bake GPS into the second-generation Apple Watch was broadly welcomed by fitness enthusiasts, though there were concerns about how battery life might be affected in the process. Indeed, Apple bills total battery longevity at just five hours when GPS tracking is active. That’s versus roughly eighteen hours when used for a 30 minute workout along with the typical notifications, glances at the time, and other regular watch activity. \nThe latest version of Runkeeper with Apple Watch GPS support is available in the App Store now. You’ll need to be running watchOS 3 and have an Apple Watch Series 2, of course, in order to take advantage of it; those with a first-gen watch (including the updated version with the newer processor but still lacking GPS) will get all of the standalone metric tracking but not location logs.",

Though Apple’s 'Project Titan' may be dead in the water , the Californian company still has dreams of testing its self-driving software on public roads. In an open letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the company says that it is \"excited\" about autonomous tech in a number of fields, specifically \"transportation.\" The five-page letter, written by director of product integrity Steve Kenner, outlines Apple's vision for development and testing of autonomous technology on public roads. It also aims to address both ethical and regulatory issues surrounding the proposed tests. \"Apple uses machine learning to make its products and services smarter, more intuitive, and more personal” reads the letter. \"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\" Read also: Apple cancels car project, still creating autonomous tech Apple also warns that current automakers have an unfair advantage, hoping that newcomers to the industry will have the \"same opportunity\" as established brands in the field of automation without having to chase regulatory exemptions. \"Executed properly under NHTSA's guidance, automated vehicles have the potential to greatly enhance the human experience -- to prevent millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year and to give mobility to those without.\" In September, Apple reportedly repositioned its focus from car building to technology development, laying off a few dozen workers in the process. The company is said to now be working on autonomous technology that would put it directly in competition with companies like Google, Delphi, and others.

      "text": "Apple's Share of the Wearable Market Drops 71% Year Over Year [Chart] LIKE MORE Posted 9 minutes ago by iClarified · 254 views · Translate Apple's share of the worldwide wearable market has dropped 71% year over year, according to the latest IDC report.The overall wearables market grew 3.1% year over year in the third quarter of 2016 (3Q16). Total wearables shipments reached 23 million in the quarter. \"It's still early days, but we're already seeing a notable shift in the market,\" said Jitesh Ubrani senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. \"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme. Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device. Meanwhile, from a design perspective, many devices are focusing on fashion first while allowing the technology to blend in with the background.\" Vendor Highlights ● Fitbit was once again the market leader in 3Q16 as the vendor released a long awaited refresh for the Charge HR with the Charge 2. Despite recent negativity surrounding the company's long-term strategy and stock price, IDC expects Fitbit to continue leading the pack in the near term. The acquisition of Coin and the potential to expand into the smartwatch category present an opportunity for the company to be more than just a fitness brand.● Xiaomi's new Mi Band includes heart rate tracking and is priced well below any competition, making it more suitable for impulse buying than any other fitness band. Despite its worldwide growth in 3Q16, the company managed to lose market share as almost every other vendor outpaced its growth. Xiaomi, across all business lines, continues to struggle to gain any significant traction outside its home country of China.● Garmin captured the third position as the company with one of the widest portfolios among all the vendors in this market. Yet its strategy and branding remain focused on fitness die-hards. The company has managed to expand its channel presence over the past year, focusing on numerous sports equipment chains and independent retailers. Moreover, with the launch of recent products like the fenix Chronos, Garmin has also managed to improve its image as a company with a great fashion sense.● Apple's decision to launch its second-generation watches in mid-September, towards the end of the quarter, did contribute to its year-over-year decline in 3Q16. However, the primary reasons for the downturn were an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface. Though both issues have been addressed with the latest generation watches, Apple's success will likely be muted as the smartwatch category continues to be challenged.● Samsung released two new models, Gear Fit 2 and the Icon X, in 3Q16. Around the globe, the company was able to move large volumes of its latest wearables thanks to bundles offered with the Note 7 and other Samsung smartphones. Though the Note 7 was recalled, many consumers were allowed to retain their Fit 2 or Icon X, thereby artificially inflating Samsung's growth. Bundles aside, Samsung was able to sustain shipments of its Gear S2, particularly the cellular-enabled versions, through various wireless service providers.

      "text": "Stay on target Tesla’s More Advanced Autopilot Arrives Next Month Nissan’s ProPilot is a self-driving chair Apple has finally shed some light on their self-driving car plans. Not a particularly bright light, mind you, but that wouldn’t have been very Apple-y, would it?\nIn a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), director of product integrity Steve Kenner said that the company is “excited” about self-driving cars. That’s something that was already pretty clear to anyone who’s been following Apple Car/Project Titan developments. Still, it’s nice to finally see an official statement.\nApple’s letter fell well short of confirming anything other than possibilities, really. Kenner’s full comment was that “Apple is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.”\nSo, yes, Apple is still open to doing something driverless car-related. Are they building their own driverless car? Probably not, despite the lengthy string of rumors pointing to the contrary.\nTheir comments to the NHTSA centered around data sharing related to accidents, saying that “companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses” so that a “comprehensive dataset” can be assembled to benefit the entire industry. Not just the companies actually building driverless cars, but also the companies that are supplying things like sensors and software.\nIt’s looking increasingly that the second group is where Apple sees themselves. They’re not a car company, after all, but they’ve got plenty of experience with technology related to driverless cars like artificial intelligence, mapping, and virtual assistants.Apple is in a strong position to provide critical software to automakers, and they’ve already got their foot in the door thanks to numerous integration deals that have landed CarPlay and Siri in infotainment systems.",

      "text": "\nMaybe there's no smartwatch market, just an Apple Watch market?\n\nRene Ritchie has been covering Apple and the personal technology industry for almost a decade. Editorial director for Mobile Nations, analyst for iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him on Snapchat, Instagram, or Twitter @reneritchie.\n\nThe last few months haven't been good for the smartwatch product category. Google delayed Android Wear 2.0 until next year, Motorola seems to be putting smartwatches on hold , and Pebble is selling to Fitbit . It's even led my colleague, Andrew Martonik, to declare the entire category a \"zombie\". But here's the thing — while smartwatches might be stalling, Apple Watch seems to be picking up speed.\nHere's Andrew's take away, written for Android Central :\nSo where the heck are smartwatches going? Right now it doesn't seem like they're going much of anywhere. The big companies like Samsung (hey, and Apple) can afford to keep making them purely from an ecosystem point of view, but we have enough data at this point to show that nobody can really make any money selling smartwatches right now.\nFor me, the growth seems to be coming from the lower end of the \"smart wearable\" spectrum: think fitness bands and activity trackers. Devices like the Samsung Gear Fit 2 and Fitbit Blaze are great because they're small, comfortable and inexpensive when compared to \"full\" smartwatches, yet they have lots of the same functionality. That makes sense for a lot of people who don't want to commit to a full smartwatch.\nApple doesn't break out Watch sales in their quarterly reports, the way they do iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales. So, all we have to go on is external metrics and guesstimates. There's a lot of dark matter, though, that helps us get a sense of the gravity.\nWatching the watch makers Apple didn't delay watchOS 3 the way Google delayed Android Wear 2.0. They shipped it right on schedule last September. And it was damn good, cutting out a lot of the early confusing and tightening focus around performance and fitness.\nApple also didn't hit the brakes on hardware, they hit the gas. Not only did they introduce a faster, dual-core model with the Series 1, they introduced a swim-proof, GPS equipped, longer lasting, brighter model with the Series 2. The Series 2 might have raised the bar, but the Series 1 lowered the cost of entry to $269.\nAnecdotally, starting around Black Friday and going into the holidays, iMore typically sees an increased interest in our iPhone coverage as people try to decide what they want to buy. This year was no exception, except for one thing — interest in Apple Watch rose even higher than iPhone for the Black Friday weekend.\nThat's no doubt a reflection of both the lower price point and the deals being offered by some retailers, but it's also a reflection of both of those things succeeding in driving interest.\nTime factors It took a generation or two for both iPhone and iPad to move from niche to mainstream. It will take Apple Watch even longer, given that it can't (yet) be a primary computing device. But it's moving in the right direction.\nCuriously, one of the speed bumps Apple Watch continues to face is perception more than reality: How American media chooses to report on it.\nExpectations drive narratives. Apple Watch outselling Amazon Echo by 3x yet Apple Watch is deemed a disappointment vs Echo a raging success.\n— Neil Cybart (@neilcybart) November 29, 2016 Echo is also barely available outside the U.S., and is a voice interface that only recognizes English. If Apple Watch was similarly hobbled, it would no doubt be considered an even bigger disappointment.\nIt's time to recognize that, for the last few years, the reality distortion field has been pointed decidedly away from Apple.\nThe (Apple) Watch market Circling back to Android Wear devices and Pebble, my guess is that wearables may shake out a lot like tablets. There's no real tablet market, just an iPad market. And there may not be a smartwatch market, just an Apple Watch market, at least for now.\n(iPad sales don't enjoy the acceleration they used to, but it's still a business so large every other company in the world would sacrifice their first born products for it.)\nAndrew's points are apt, though. The bottom-end Fitbits and their ilk are filling the iPod shuffle to iPod nano space in the wearable market, and that's certainly a popular space to fill, especially with Apple staying completely focused on the high end.\nPremium position is something Apple knows well, though. It lets them make the type of products they want to make and be extremely successful with or without majority market share.\nWhat makes Apple Watch uniquely interesting right now, though, is that it's premium positioning has become increasingly affordable as well. It's not as expensive as a phone and doesn't require a service plan, making it much easier to gift, and yet it's also capable enough to add significant value in a few key areas, including fitness tracking, notifications, and communications.\nSeries 1 and holiday deals on the original mean people who've been waiting can now get in at a lower price than ever before. The new Nike+ line, priced the same as Series 2, could increase appeal for fitness enthusiasts, and the new Hermès options and the all-new Ceramic Edition ensure the premium premium is still there for those who want it.\nSmartwatches may be zombies, but put it all together, and I wouldn't be surprised if Apple Watch turns into one of the sleeper hits of the holidays.\nApple Watch \nwatchOS 3 review Apple Watch Series 2 review Apple Watch buyers guide Apple Watch users guide Apple Watch news Apple Watch discussion Buy at Apple ",

      "text": "Now you can use Runkeeper without your iPhone thanks to Apple Watch Series 2 upgrade Runkeeper's updated Apple Watch app uses the built-in GPS in the Series 2 to map your routes. Staff Writer, Macworld | Dec 5, 2016 8:51 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this Apple flirts with, but doesn't commit to touchscreen \nThe best reason to buy an Apple Watch Series 2 is so you can track workouts without carrying on iPhone. The watch’s native Workout app logs runs, swims, and bike rides with help from built-in GPS, but if you’ve been tracking exercise with a third-party app for years, switching is a pain. Runkeeper just updated its watch app with support for the Series 2 so you can log your runs, no iPhone required. \nRunkeeper’s Apple Watch app was already one of our favorite fitness apps . I’ve been using a beta version of Runkeeper’s Series 2 app for the past few days, and it’s better than ever. The app lets you choose to use it without a phone (in which case it taps into the watch’s GPS) or with in its settings. If you’re running sans iPhone, the app shows you how strong the GPS signal is so you’ll know how accurate the route calculation will be. I run outside on Brooklyn sidewalks and through Brooklyn parks and found Runkeeper’s data to be spot-on. If you go for a run without your phone, the app syncs the route to the iOS app after you’re done. \nThe upgraded app also displays your data in a new way, with a heart rate graph plotting your pulse over a 5-minute span to show you how intense your workout is. There’s also a target pace graph so you can see your actual pace plotted against where your pace should be. The watch app vibrates with haptic feedback when you hit each mile. \nRunkeeper’s app is HealthKit-compatible, and workouts completed with the watch app count toward your activity goals. If you’re already a Runkeeper user, upgrading is a no-brainer. If you’ve never used Runkeeper before, this version could persuade you to abandon the watch’s native Workout app. To comment on this article and other Macworld content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

The watch’s native Workout app logs runs, swims, and bike rides with help from built-in GPS, but if you’ve been tracking exercise with a third-party app for years, switching is a pain. Runkeeper just updated its watch app with support for the Series 2 so you can log your runs, no iPhone required.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "title": "Apple says iPhone 6s battery problems caused by 'air'",
      "text": "By James Walker 19 mins ago in Technology Apple has blamed too much air exposure for causing the battery issues and random shutdowns experienced by some iPhone 6s owners. The company has already initiated a replacement program for affected handsets, admitting there's a manufacturing flaw. Last month, Apple said it had identified a \"very small number\" of iPhone 6s handsets built between September and October 2015 that could abruptly power off during use. Devices in the affected serial number range can be taken to an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider for a free battery replacement. Apple has now elaborated on what caused the issues. In doing so, it has also explained why so few handsets were affected. The company said that components used while building the battery packs had been exposed to ambient air in the factory for longer than usual. This caused the batteries created in the substandard conditions to degrade faster than usual, most likely due to a chemical imbalance in the cells. \"We found that a small number of iPhone 6s devices made in September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs,\" said Apple in a statement. \"As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur. It's important to note, this is not a safety issue.\" The increased rate of cell degradation causes the phones to detect faults with the battery and automatically power off. Apple advised customers that it designs the iPhone to shut itself down when outside of its usual operating conditions. The company said that a sudden shutdown could be caused by variations in voltage or even temperature. It may not always be down to a defective battery. Apple has insisted that the widely reported problems with the iPhone 6s' batteries are \"not a safety issue.\" It appears to be concerned the replacement program could be likened to Samsung's recall and subsequent discontinuation of its Galaxy Note 7 earlier this year. According to Apple, the impact of the manufacturing issue is limited to a reduced capacity and occasional unexpected shutdowns. There are no wider consequences. \"We looked for any other factors that could cause an iPhone to shut down unexpectedly,\" said Apple . \"After intensive investigations, no new factors have been identified. We will continue to monitor and analyze customer reports.\" iPhone 6s owners can check if their phone is affected by visiting Apple's serial number validation tool. Handsets should then be taken to an Apple Store or approved third-party repairer for a free replacement battery pack. Apple is also offering to reimburse customers who have previously paid for a battery replacement. The program is valid worldwide for three years pass the original sale date of the phones.",

Fitbit remained the leader with 23% market share, up from 21.4% a year ago, on the strength of its new Charge 2 fitness tracker. Fitbit shipped an estimated 5.3 million wearables in the quarter.\n\nXiaomi trailed in second as its $14.99 Mi Band is priced well below any competing wearables, allowing the Chinese company to capture 16.5% market share based on an estimated 3.8 million shipments in the quarter. Xiaomi's market share remained virtually unchanged from 16.4% a year ago.\n\nMeanwhile, the Apple Watch captured just a 4.9% share of the broader wearables market in the quarter based on an estimated 1.1 million shipments, according to IDC. Comparatively, in the year-ago quarter, Apple had an estimated 3.9 million Apple Watch shipments for a much higher 17.5% market share.\n\n\"It's still early days, but we're already seeing a notable shift in the market,\" said Jitesh Ubrani senior research analyst for IDC Mobile Device Trackers. \"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme. Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device. Meanwhile, from a design perspective, many devices are focusing on fashion first while allowing the technology to blend in with the background.\"\n\nIDC attributed Apple's decline in the third quarter to an \"aging lineup\" and an \"unintuitive user interface.\" Apple addressed those concerns with Apple Watch Series 2, but the second-generation models launched in mid-September and therefore did not have a full impact on the third quarter.\n\nApple does not officially disclose Apple Watch sales, instead grouping the device under its \"Other Products\" category in earnings results.Related Roundups: Apple Watch Series 2, watchOS 3\nTags: wearables, IDC, Fitbit\nBuyer's Guide: Apple Watch (Neutral)\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "text": "on Monday December 05, 2016 @01:00PM from the further-expansion dept. For the first time, Apple has said that it is indeed working on technology to develop self-driving cars. The company confirmed late last week its previously secret initiative in a statement to the U.S. highway regulator . From a report on The Guardian: \"The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation, and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation,\" said the letter from Steve Kenner, Apple's director of product integrity, to the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The letter offered no details of the project, instead highlighting the \"significant societal benefits of automated vehicles,\" which it described as a life-saving technology, potentially preventing millions of car crashes and thousands of fatalities each year. In a statement to Financial Times (might be paywalled), a spokesperson for Apple said, \"We've provided comments to NHTSA because Apple is investing heavily in machine learning and autonomous systems. There are many potential applications for these technologies, including the future of transportation , so we want to work with NHTSA to help define the best practices for the industry.\" ",

      "text": "Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) were slightly lower in mid-morning trading Monday, after the company publicly acknowledged its self-driving car efforts for the first time last week in a letter to the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. People are pleased with this venture because it means the company is diversifying, TheStreet's Jim Cramer, co-manager of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio , said on CNBC's \"Mad Dash\" segment.\n\"Apple's car issue is something that people want to see because it has so little to do with the phone,\" Cramer said. The tech giant has been criticized for relying too heavily on iPhone sales and not being as innovative as it was under its former CEO, the late Steve Jobs.\nJust today UBS analyst Steve Milunovich put out a note out stating that while Apple's share was \"good all over the globe,\" it's losing some share in China, Cramer noted. That's one of the reasons Apple needs to move away from \"just mobile.\"\nApple stock and the tech sector in general have been a \"battle ground\" lately, but those stocks are making a rebound today and Apple could be a part of that, he noted.\nThis stock could also be affected by changing relations with China under President-elect Donald Trump's administration, Cramer said.\n\"I still find that this is an area that you could easily relate a tweet about China from Trump to this stock and say, you know what, I'm going to pay a lower multiple for it.\"",

Apple launched its second generation model with the Apple Watch Series 2 in September, adding a built-in GPS, brighter display, and swim proof water resistance. Check out 9to5Mac’s full review for more details. \nApple also recently released its runner-focused Apple Watch Nike+ line which includes the same features as Apple Watch Series 2 plus unique Nike Sport bands and special Nike+ Run Club watch faces. \nwatchOS 3.1.1 will likely be released this month when iOS 10.2 is expected to come out of beta.

      "text": "– A + Apple adds Minneapolis-Saint Paul transit directions to Apple Maps By Mike Wuerthele \nMonday, December 05, 2016, 09:54 am PT (12:54 pm ET) \nApple on Monday continued the expansion of public transit directions for Maps, adding systems for the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area in Minnesota.\n\n\n\n\nUsers of the iOS and macOS Maps apps can now navigate via the region's bus and rail lines. Different lines are marked with their official icons, and where possible, the apps will present several route options to choose from.\n\nMost of the cities Apple supports in Maps are located in the U.S. and China. In the States, locations with public transit added prior to today include Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dallas, Denver, Ft. Worth, Honolulu, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Portland (Ore)., Sacramento, San Antonio, San Jose, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington D.C. \n\nTo date, Google Maps continues to offer wider transit coverage. Apple does, however, offer a top-down view of train and subway stations in some cities, a feature that Google lacks.\n\nApple notes that it currently gets data from over 250 transit agencies, and its station data maps over 16,000 entrances across supported cities. Implementation of new locations is much more complicated than it appears at first glance —each location added spans ground exceeding just the city it's centered in, and has to be customized.",

      "text": "iphonelife In Brief In a letter to US transport regulators, Apple said it was \"excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.\" The tech firm has even registered several car-related internet domains, including apple.car and apple.auto, adding to the suspicion that the company is investing in self-driving car tech. Rumors confirmed? \nApple enthusiasts and fans have been speculating for some time that the company Steve Jobs left behind is developing a smart car — aka Project Titan. Well, we’ve finally got some sort of confirmation to the long-standing rumor. Apple is indeed getting into the autonomous car business , but it’s currently unclear whether it will actually build a car or just an autonomous driving system. \nIn a five-page letter to US transport regulators, written by Product Integrity Director Steve Kenner, Apple expressed that it “is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” Apple commends the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for its Federal Automated Vehicles Policy, which prompted the writing of the letter. \nApple also acknowledged that it “is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation,” which perhaps is a clear indication that the company is already studying the possibilities of developing one, or an autonomous driving system at the very least. Apple has also already registered several car-related internet domains , such as apple.car and apple.auto. Credits: carwow Riding along \nOne of the things Kenner proposes to the NHTSA in his letter is the sharing of data by companies in the autonomous vehicle industry. “Apple agrees that companies should share de-identified scenario and dynamics data from crashes and near-misses,” Kenner says . “Data should be sufficient to reconstruct the event, including time-series of vehicle kinematics and characteristics of the roadway and objects.” \nApple certainly isn’t the first in this field . Tesla , of course, comes into mind. There is also Uber with its self-driving taxis and trucks . Volvo also has its own plans , and even Nvidia is into the technology. Ford is also supposedly making its own models , on the premise that Apple is developing one. \nWhile Apple may not be ahead of the game in this case, the company seems to be riding along at the right moment, especially with policies for autonomous cars being crafted and refined. Soon, we might not just be asking Siri for directions to our favorite restaurant; she could drive us there.",

It’s arriving just three days after the fifth public beta .\nThis update appears to be very similar to public beta 5. The SOS feature is still functional only in India. And the TV app still can’t be restored after being deleted.\nBut other changes could be hidden in this build, so if you’re into that sort of thing, then you’ll want to check it out. For one thing, you can get access to new emojis, like an avocado, a croissant, and a facepalm, according to MacRumors , before others can use them.\nIf you’re a member of Apple’s Beta Software Program, you can download iOS 10.2 public beta 6 as an over-the-air (OTA) update — just go to Settings > General > Software Update. If you’re not part of the program, you can sign up now, by going here .\nOr you can just wait for iOS 10.2 to become available to everyone. And that should happen very soon.\n",

As of earlier this year, he owned a little more than 440,000 shares, according to filings. \nDuring an interview with The New York Times, Trump said he told Apple CEO Tim Cook that it would be \"a real achievement\" for him to get Apple to \"build a big plant in the United States.\" His proposal to lower the business tax rate to 15 percent and allow the one-time repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a tax rate of 10 percent could make Apple the biggest beneficiary in tech, according to Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. \n—CNBC's Anita Balakrishnan contributed to this report.",

The first developer beta for watchOS 3.1.1 was seeded in late October. \nApple has seeded the fifth developer beta for watchOS 3.1.1, which is a marginal update meant to fix bugs and otherwise improve performance in the wearable. To install it, developers must use the dedicated Watch app on their iPhone, then head into General –> Software Update. For the install process to begin, the Apple Watch must be connected to the charger, have 50% battery, and be within range of the iPhone. \nWhile this update is more than likely focused on behind-the-sceses improvements, if any new forward-facing new additions are discovered, we’ll update this post accordingly.

      "text": "Runkeeper uses Apple Watch GPS to keep track of your route If you have the latest model of the wearable, of course. Share Save \nApple Watch Series 2 arrived with two notable updates: waterproofing and built-in GPS . Even though the popular jogging app has been letting users run without their iPhone since last fall, Runkeeper now tasks the wearable's own GPS for better tracking of your routes. An update to the company's Apple Watch software takes advantage of the built-in feature for \"richer stats\" and a detailed map you can view on your phone. \nRunkeeper's Apple Watch app also gains a customizable activity screen so you can choose what's on the wearable's display during your workout. One of those stats is a new heart-rate graph that shows your BPM over the last five minutes. There's also a target pace graph that plots out a five-minute snapshot of your run compared to a speed goal you input before you get started. \nFor updates during your run, the app will alert you with a vibration each time to you log a mile. To give the latest version of Runkeeper a go, download it from the App Store and lace up your sneakers. Keep in mind that in order to take advantage of the added GPS abilities, you'll need to have an Apple Watch Series 2.",

That's how you can describe Apple 's new MacBook Pro .\nThe company's decision to include only two USB-C ports (four on the more expensive Touch Bar model ) have forced users to rely on expensive and clunky dongles to connect an external hard drive, access an SD card or even charge their iPhone .\nA new accessory is looking to fix this. The HyperDrive adds a variety useful ports to the MacBook Pro, including both an SD and microSD card slot, HDMI output and two USB 3.1 ports. Aside from an Ethernet port, the HyperDrive restores virtually all of the ports found on the previous MacBook Pro from 2015 .\nPhoto by Hyper The HyperDrive is available through a Kickstarter campaign . The hub is priced at $100, but is being offered to Kickstarter backers for $70. It works with both the 13-inch and 15-inch 2016 MacBook models, and is offered in either space gray or silver. The campaign ends on January 16, 2017.

      "text": "Why I cancelled my new 15-inch MacBook Pro order \nAs has been the case for much of 2016, fitness bands, which are part of IDC's \"basic wearables\" category, were the top-selling wearable devices in Q3 and accounted for 85 percent of the market. IDC says much of the increase stems from the launch of newer models and an expanding user base. \nOn the contrary, smart wearables -- including devices like the Apple Watch which are capable of running third party apps -- declined throughout the quarter and will continue to struggle in the near term, IDC says. \nWith the Apple Watch in particular, IDC contends that the 71 percent year-over-year decline of Apple's flagship wearable is due to an aging lineup and an unintuitive user interface. While Apple has attempted to address both issues with the Apple Watch 2, the overall success of the device will be muted as the smartwatch category remains challenged. \n\"It's still early days, but we're already seeing a notable shift in the market,\" said IDC senior research analyst Jitesh Ubrani. \"Where smartwatches were once expected to take the lead, basic wearables now reign supreme. Simplicity is a driving factor and this is well reflected in the top vendor list as four out of five offer a simple, dedicated fitness device. Meanwhile, from a design perspective, many devices are focusing on fashion first while allowing the technology to blend in with the background.\" \nIn terms of the vendor leaderboard, Fitbit's top spot is followed by Xiaomi, Garmin, Apple and Samsung, respectively. The big news here is that Apple lost its No. 3 position to Garmin thanks to its marketing strategy targeting fitness diehards. \nSEE ALSO:",

      "text": "Frankfurt: Volkswagen AG plans to expand its new mobility-services division into a multi-billion-euro business as the German carmaker seeks salvation in ride-hailing, autonomous driving and electric cars in the wake of the diesel-emissions scandal.\nMoia, Volkswagen’s 13th brand, will initially focus on ride-hailing and car-sharing and will roll out its services in two European cities next year before possibly expanding to other regions. Moia aims to be one of the world’s three biggest mobility providers and to generate revenue of “a couple of billion” of euros in a few years, Ole Harms, the Volkswagen unit’s head, told reporters.\n“We’re a start-up with VW group’s resources and we have a global aspiration,” Harms said ahead of the unit’s official unveiling Monday at the Tech Crunch Disrupt Conference. Volkswagen is open to selling a minority stake in Moia, in which it has invested an amount in the “significant three-digit million-euro range,” he said.\nVolkswagen, still recovering from the year-old emissions-cheating scandal while transitioning into an era of robotaxis, has been cutting costs to free up funds for developing electric cars, self-driving technologies and mobility apps. The German automaker has been late to innovate, taking its first step in May to expand beyond its traditional business of manufacturing and selling vehicles by investing $300 million (Dh1.11 billion) in ride-hailing provider Gett Inc. By contrast, Daimler AG founded car-sharing service Car2Go in 2008 and has since added public-transit and cab hailing apps.\nMere hardware \nMaking Moia a separate brand in a line-up that includes Audi and Porsche underscores VW’s strategic revamp to move beyond the scandal and prepare for a tectonic industry shift toward electric cars with new digital features that allow piloted driving or finding free parking spaces via apps.\nAutomakers across the globe have been stepping up efforts to expand digital offerings as Silicon Valley giants like Apple Inc. and Google Inc. plot inroads in the industry and manufacturers fight back to avoid being degraded to mere hardware suppliers. Ride-hailing services such as Uber Technologies Inc. are calling into question whether drivers need to buy vehicles.\n“Even though not everyone will still own a car in future, Moia can help make everyone a customer of our company in some way or another,” Matthias Mueller, CEO of the Volkswagen group, said in a statement.\nMoia’s first car, which could be battery-powered and feature autonomous driving options, may be ready before 2021, Harms said. The brand’s services may eventually expand to the US, China or Latin America.\nWhile Moia’s stand-alone position allows it to pursue its own mobility strategy, the division’s first auto may be co-branded with other VW group marques, he said. Volkswagen’s other units are also expanding their digital and electric offerings.\n‘Substantial’ revenue:\nThe VW namesake brand has outlined plans to establish a platform dubbed “We,” comprising a range of services that could be used by 80 million customers by 2025. Audi offers car sharing in San Francisco and Hong Kong and next year plans to show its first series car that’s capable of driving itself at speeds of up to 60 kilometres (40 miles) per hour.\nMoia, based in Berlin, will have about 200 employees by the end of next year compared with 50 now, Harms said. Volkswagen plans to generate a “substantial part” of its revenue with mobility services by 2025, according to the statement.\n“We want to be a relevant player,” said Harms. “Our clear objective is to become a unicorn.”",
