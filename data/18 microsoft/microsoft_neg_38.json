As usual, some did it in quite creative ways. \nIn order to share the festive mood with you, and to wish you Happy Thanksgiving, in our own usual news-reporting way, we gathered all the celebrative posts from the gaming industry that we could find, so that you can enjoy them in a single, happy place. \nHappy Thanksgiving from DualShockers, and let’s all join in giving thanks for the games we love, for the hard work by thousands of developers around the world, and for the fact that Final Fantasy XV and The Last Guardian are really about to hit the shelves. It doesn’t even feel real just yet. \n— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) November 24, 2016 Every achievement is a tiny parade.",

      "text": "By Cage Appleby Neowin LLC · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIf you have an aptitude for customizing your Android home screen and enjoy using Microsoft Arrow, you will be pleased to know Microsoft has sent out a new update today. \nIt has been just over two months since Microsoft last updated their Android Launcher . The update, while small in size, brings the version number up from 2.2 to 2.7. \nAlong with this jump are a few performance enhancements and a new swipe down to search gesture. Microsoft is also claiming Arrow is 10% more efficient than previous versions. Whether this is a noticeable change remains to be seen. \nYou can read the full changelog below: Performance. Arrow is 10% more memory efficient than the previous version. Swipe down to search. We’ve made search easier to find. Customize the grid layout of apps page. 4×5, 4×6, and more options at your fingertips. “Recent” page: customize the types of content you want to display. Bug fixes: wallpaper, widgets, and more. \nYou can download Arrow Launcher from the Google Play Store .",

      "text": "0 0 \nIt seems that Microsoft is trying to make more and more people to ditch third-party antivirus applications and start using the Windows Defender . The company has just released the Windows Defender Hub application for the Windows PC users. The application can already be downloaded and installed from the Windows Store. \nThis application will only open the Windows Defender interface and it will display some news regarding new viruses, links to blog posts from Windows Defender and other tips that will help you to keep your computer clean. With this application you will be able to scan your computer and check the protection status. \nWe’re not sure why Microsoft has not added access to the Windows Firewall Settings from the Windows Defender Hub. The company could also add some additional configuration options which would allow you to tweak some security settings in order to improve the Windows 10 security. \nIf you want to have quick access to Windows Defender and read about new viruses and malwares, we suggest you to install this application on your Windows 10 PC. So, in order to install this application on your computer, just open the Windows Store, search for Windows Defender Hub and click on the “FREE” button. We hope that Microsoft will add some more features to the Windows Defender Hub because, currently, this application looks quite simple. \nHowever, we remind you that according to specialists, the Windows Defender is not as good as other third party antivirus applications. In other words, if you want to make sure that your computer stays more secure, you should purchase a third party antivirus application that will offer much more protection than the free Windows Defender. \nAre you using Windows Defender on your Windows 10 PC? Do you think that this application is good enough to keep your computer clean? \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft has quite a few projects in the works in its effort to maintain its reputation as a successful brand that’s always cooking something new up. Some of its upcoming products include new Surface tablet hybrid devices, a possible new smartphone line, new Xbox variants and updates, and of course, consistent updates for Windows 10. \nWith all that going on, you would almost expect the latest Microsoft product you hear of to also be the last one for a while. If that’s the case, then it was a wise decision because it seems like there are even more Microsoft goodies in the works for fans of the tech giant. \nIt’s been discovered that Microsoft is creating a product called the Home Hub has been. The service would act as a common platform where all family members could view shared information such as calendars, planners, and so on. While all the specific features of the Home Hub are still unknown, it’s clear that Microsoft has envisioned it as a way to connect all family members. Family interaction is definitely something the company can market and while the idea of a product being intended “for the whole family” isn’t new, Microsoft’s implementation of the concept at this level is at the very least intriguing. There have also been sightings of another device which would supposedly serve as a voice controlled unit which people would be able to access from a distance. \nApparently, these ideas aren’t quite new within Microsoft’s circles, as a post from 2014 featured on LinkedIn shows a Microsoft engineering manager revealing two new Microsoft projects which were developed in collaboration with teams formed by experts in various related domains formerly employed at Nokia’s Beijing division. Before the projects were scrapped, they underwent the first test trials and they were deemed apt for performance. \nWhat all this means is that we might possibly witness the materialization of two older Microsoft projects which have been delayed quite a bit. Until more details are uncovered, fans are left to speculate the true purposes of these two new additions to the Microsoft family. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "Microsoft Launches Office 365 in 10 New Countries (MSFT) By Richard Saintvilus   1:49 PM EST \nMicrosoft Corporation's ( MSFT ) Office 365 will now be available in 10 additional countries. This means Office 365 is now available in 150 markets and 44 languages, the company said. \n\"Today, we are announcing the availability of Office 365 in 10 new markets: Bhutan, Cambodia, Greenland, Guadeloupe, Laos, Maldives, Martinique, Mozambique, Myanmar and Vatican City,\" explains a blog post on Microsoft's website. Whether it is for school, work or in their personal lives, the company claims that more than 1.2 billion people around the world use Office. (See also: Microsoft Stock Upgraded at Goldman Sachs .) \nMicrosoft continues to rely on Office, which combined with Windows still generates the lion's share of the company's revenue and profits . Notably, that's still the case after 25 years, and even more so today after the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant has converted Office into a subscription revenue stream. \nIn the most recent quarter, Microsoft Office 365 revenue grew at an impressive 51% year over year, driven by the addition of almost 1 million subscribers, pushing its total to 24 million. \"As our service expands, we are mindful of the incredible and increasing diversity of Office users,\" Microsoft said. \"This latest market expansion required innovative engineering work to create new languages, cultures and currencies.\" (See also: Microsoft's Competitive Advantage: An Inside Look .) \nMicrosoft says it plans to launch Office 365 to 97 new countries over the next year. The company recently integrated the suite of Office 365 applications into Teams – its new workplace collaboration platform – which is scheduled for general release next year.

      "text": "EU Set to Approve Microsoft, LinkedIn Deal (MSFT, LNKD) By Richard Saintvilus   9:24 AM EST \nMicrosoft Corporation's ( MSFT ) $26.2 billion blockbuster deal for LinkedIn Corporation ( LNKD ) could be green-lighted soon, according to Reuters. And this suggests that the company's concessions offered to the European Commission last week might have been enough. \nOn Wednesday, sources told Reuters that tweaks to the concessions Microsoft made aimed at addressing the Commission's competition concerns proved effective. The Redmond, Wash.-based company promised regulators that it will play fair and not favor LinkedIn at the expense of competitors. (See also: Microsoft Makes LinkedIn Concessions .) \nMicrosoft said it would allow competitors access to its software such as Outlook and give hardware makers the option of installing competing professional social networks on computers after the acquisition , noted Reuters. The Commission, which has fined Microsoft more than €2.2 billion ($2.3 billion) over the past decade, was concerned that Microsoft joining forces with LinkedIn would threaten competition. The European Commission, which sought feedback from Microsoft's rivals and customers, was apparently satisfied with the information that has been provided. Reuters noted that cloud rival Salesforce.com, Inc. ( CRM ), which also sought to acquire LinkedIn, was one of the competitors the Commission requested feedback from. Salesforce urged regulators to examine the anti-trust and data privacy issues thoroughly before approving the deal. \nThe Commission is scheduled to rule on the deal by Dec. 6. Regulatory officials from the U.S., Canada, Brazil and South Africa already approved the deal without asking either company for concessions. (See also: LinkedIn Nails Earnings Ahead of Acquisition .) \nMicrosoft stock closed Wednesday at $60.40, down 1.18%. The shares have risen 8.85% year to date, compared with a 7.87% rise in the S&P 500 ( SPX ) index.

Microsoft has released Solitaire for iOS and Android, giving millions of people something to do when sitting around the dinner table with family.\nBe honest: You spent hours playing Solitaire as a kid when you were really supposed to be writing an essay for class. I know I did. The Solitaire Collection includes Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Pyramid, and Tripeaks game types. There’s even Xbox Live integration so you can compete with friends.\nKLONDIKE Timeless & Classic Solitaire. Clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw. Also try out Traditional or Vegas scoring!\nSPIDER Eight columns of cards await you. Clear them all with fewest moves possible. Play single suit or challenge yourself with four suits!\nFREECELL Be strategic and use the four extra cells to move cards around and try to clear all cards from the table. FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\nTRIPEAKS Select cards in a sequence, earn combo points, and clear as many boards as you can before you run out of deals!\nPYRAMID Combine two cards that add up to 13 to remove them from the board. Challenge yourself to reach the top of the Pyramid and clear as many boards as you can!\nThe best time-waster of them all You can download Microsoft’s Solitaire for iOS and Android now, but hurry, because the premium version will only be free until Dec. 31.\n\n\nSource : AppStore , GooglePlay ",

That's the kind of service contract that I buy. Overnight, to the location. I've worked as an A+ Certified tech, so I know how it works. And using it is worst case. I haven't had to use most of them. And if I buy it for 4 years, then I've sold it before it even runs out in every case. And the release mechanism for the connector also deals with the hinge. Look at the location. Personally, I wouldn't buy a Book right now- it's first iteration. That's the reason I hadn't even looked at the Surface before now. But I have it, and it's been rock solid.I get it. You don't like it. There's no real need to continue- opinions are personal, and it seems that you have your mind made up, which is cool, and I'm not trying to convince you. I could point you to the fact that in all of the cases I have contact with people, they've had no problems around the hinge (power, OS stability, sure... patched and better in both cases). But it is a great feat in engineering, and I look forward to the future iterations.

      "text": "You are at: Home » Business » Microsoft and FireEye collaborate to up the cyber security ante on Windows 10 devices Microsoft and FireEye collaborate to up the cyber security ante on Windows 10 devices Business , Security news FireEye to gain access to telemetry data from every Windows 10 device \nFireEye has recently struck a deal with Microsoft, which gives FireEye access to all Windows 10 telemetry data, according to a report by Australian news magazine ARN . This means FireEye in return will place the security vendor’s iSIGHT Intelligence software into Windows Defender, an inbuilt Windows security offering. \n“FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence is a proactive, forward-006Cooking means of qualifying threats poised to disrupt business based on the intents, tools and tactics of the attacker.” \nThe Windows Defender service can be used by the users in a free trial before purchasing a subscription to Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP). \nThe partnership with a well-known cyber security vendor such as FireEye benefits Microsoft, and specifically the reputation and credibility of the commercial version of Windows Defender. \nAdditionally, it also pits the software giant against the incumbent players in the already highly competitive endpoint security market. \nWDATP customers have access to intelligence technical indicators that are provided by the software. These include the main motivation of the attacker, related tools, information about target sectors and geographies, and a description of the actor and operation. \nAccording to the report on ARN, security teams may also be able to access the telemetry via a subscription billing model. \n“FireEye has invested in nation-state grade intelligence and we are strategically partnering with industry leaders to operationalise this high-quality intel,” said FireEye senior vice president of corporate development, Ken Gonzalez. \nFireEye is now able to offer “differentiated intelligence” within WDATP by working with Microsoft, Gonzalez said and together help make organisations more secure. \n“With the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, we added this new layer of defence with WDATP – a new built-in OS sensor combined with powerful cloud-powered behavioural detection analytics – in order to help enterprises, detect, investigate and respond to targeted attacks and data breaches on their endpoints quicker and easier,” added, Windows Cyber Defence, general manager, Moti Gindi. \n“As two security leaders working together, the combined Microsoft and FireEye adversary-based security intelligence ensures WDATP detections can provide the right context needed to prepare for and simplify response to attacks.” \nJames Turner, IBRS security analyst, told ARN that the deal brings extensive benefits to both vendors. \n“There are benefits here for both Microsoft and FireEye,” he said. \n“Microsoft are seen to be playing with a big brand name in the security space and FireEye potentially get access to a much broader distribution of endpoints than it would otherwise have.” \nAccess to telemetry alone will not essentially give the vendor an edge over its rivals, warned Turner as the partnership may only be seen as a boon for FireEye, covering the vendors threat detection network to contest with major endpoint players such as Kaspersky Lab and Symantec. \n“It’s a classic case of FOMO [fear of missing out],” he explained. “Everyone thinks that everyone else has got better intelligence than they do so everyone has a fear of missing out. \n“So everyone talks about intelligence sharing but the most valuable threat intelligence is that which is made directly applicable to you and can take action on. \n“When you start looking at this particular offering, it has to be fairly generic because there is no customisation – as far as I can tell – around this. It is literally going to be a case of seeing something out there and identifying it as bad. \n“It is going to be very hard for this to be customised to any specific client.” \nAdding further, Turner said that there could be exemptions to this rule including searching for pre-defined keywords. However, it is going to be determined by the actual mechanism around it. \n“If it is a way of helping to commoditise more advanced, threat centric security for the endpoint, then that is a plus,” he said “But ultimately, I think anybody who is expecting a silver bullet will be disappointed. \n“Obviously we need to see the proof of the pudding in the eating, but there is a definite potential here to help do a capable shift in the way things are going.”",

Full Bio The author is a Forbes contributor. The opinions expressed are those of the writer. Loading ... This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe Snapchat's Spectacles Are Now on Sale In New York City \n2017 will see Microsoft release what CEO Satya Nadella describes as “the ultimate mobile device.” Speaking to the Australian Financial Review , he talks about how Microsoft missed getting on the first mobile train, but is determined to deliver something unique, and will continue to be in the phone market. \n“We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device. Therefore we stopped doing things that were me-too and started doing things, even if they are today very sub-scale, to be very focused on a specific set of customers who need a specific set of capabilities that are differentiated and that we can do a good job of.” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella (picture: Microsoft.com) \nGiven Microsoft’s current cuckoo-like approach of ensuring that users have access to Microsoft’s software and cloud services no matter what device they are using, trying to discern what Nadella is referring to when he says that the company was working on ‘the ultimate mobile device’ is not as simple as jumping to the obvious conclusion. \nFor many people the ultimate mobile device is the one they currently have in their pocket – Microsoft’s current focus on the cloud could mean making that mobile device ‘ultimate’ by getting that user signed up and using Microsoft apps such as Outlook or OneNote. \nIt could mean working with manufacturers to ensure that Microsoft’s software is already on the handset when the consumer opens the box. That’s certainly the case with devices from manufacturers such as Asus and Samsung who have deals to install apps like Microsoft Office at the factory on some Android-powered devices. \nThese are all good strategies, and are being put into good effect by the teams in Redmond. But the obvious conclusion here is that Microsoft will be debuting a smartphone in the near future that demands an ‘ultimate’ moniker. \nEveryone not living under a digital rock knows what that device would be. The Surface Phone. Microsoft last Windows 10 smartphones, the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL (image: Ewan Spence) \nMicrosoft has had a rocky road with the Surface brand, but it now has three ‘best in class’ devices that exhibit some of the highest specifications, the classiest design touches, and a surfeit of critical acclaim. The Surface Pro 4 mixes the best features of a tablet with an ultraportable PC. The Surface Book is a highly-specced business focused laptop with a detachable tablet-like screen. And the recently launched Surface Studio pushes the desktop computer to the ultimate conclusion (at least for those who work with graphics). \nNaturally all of them run Windows 10. \nNow take all those design touches and put them in a smartphone chassis. Outfit it with one or two different screen sizes to offer a smaller device or larger phablet. Pack it full of processor power, memory, and storage. Use Windows 10 and its competent management of a mobile environment for the end-user. Don’t worry about meeting a low price to reach a significant number of consumers, just worry about making it the best smartphone possible and if that means it won’t sell tens of millions of units so be it. The exercise is not to make a million seller, the exercise is to create the ultimate device to show off Microsoft’s potential for the next five to ten years. \nThat really would be an ultimate mobile device. And I expect Microsoft to deliver on its vision in the first half of 2017. ",

      "text": "Today, let’s be thankful we can remember a time when Microsoft’s Solitaire wasn’t rubbish Thursday, 24 November 2016 23:21 GMT By Brenna Hillier Share on: \nMicrosoft’s Solitaire is now available on an Apple platform, in case you had any doubts that these are the End Times. \nMicrosoft has announced the arrival of its famous version of Solitaire on Android and iOS. Since the world of video game news has fallen into its annual torpor, and I, the Australian on staff, am still required to come to work, this is what we’re talking about today. \nCats: Solitaire on Windows 10 is bullshit, and this really upsets me. It’s not something I think about every day, because I need those neural resources to worry about politics and cancer, but whenever I remember it I gnash my teeth alarmingly. Let’s run down its many faults. \nFault #1: it’s an app now Microsoft Solitaire doesn’t come pre-installed on Windows 10 as system software, breaking a cherished Windows tradition. It’s an app you have to download from the Windows 10 Store, which means you have to look at the Windows 10 Store, itself a crime. Remember all those years of sneakily getting into Solitaire even when the school or work admins were pretty sure they’d managed to hide all non-productive software? So many hours of sanity reclaimed, now denied to future generations. \nFault #2: it has ads in it Solitaire has ads in it now. Between games you’ll have to sit through some nonsense from Microsoft’s extended family of rubbish free-to-play titles. You have to pay to get rid of them. Piss off. \nFault 3: it has microtransactions and they’re intrusive Almost every time you lose a game, Microsoft’s like “oh HEY want to give us some MONEY so you don’t LOSE you big LOSER”. You’re supposed to lose Solitaire regularly! It’s statistics! Bugger off with your pop-ups, Solitaire. \nFault 4: it’s psychologically manipulative Every day, Microsoft sends you a handful of challenges. Some of them are insultingly easy, and others are almost impossible. Completing one earns you points, and completing every challenge on a particular day nets you an amount of points that makes the initial prize look feeble. Log in every day, and you can earn enough points to get a monthly rating. This is straight out of Make Gamers Addicted To Your Bullshit Microtransaction Ridden Corpse of a Product 101, and I have no doubt it is exquisitely balanced and tuned to extract the maximum amount of milk from you with the minimum of moo. \nFault 5: you have to log into it with your Microsoft ID Even though I use it for Skype and Xbox Live, I cannot remember my stupid Microsoft ID, let alone the password for it, and I resented having to dig it out in order to play Solitaire. To be fair, this is a fault across a lot of Windows 10 products: Windows 10 installed itself against my will and then changed my desktop log-in to my Microsoft ID, barring me from my own hardware in my own house with two-factor authentication. \nFault 6: it takes forever to log in to Xbox Live I have a surprisingly robust ADSL connection for rural Australia, and I can log into Steam and the PSN in half a breath. Why does it take painful seconds of boredom to get Solitaire started while Microsoft ensures it can tell my three Xbox Live buddies that I’m not actually doing any work today? \nFault 7: it’s not lightweight This is actually my main complaint. Cynically, I’m resigned to everything above as a product of our horrible times. But the fact that I cannot expect to run Solitaire even when the rest of my system is stressed beyond endurance is unforgivable. Solitaire is what you do when your system is half-melting and you need to sit and let it chug away with its tasks for a bit. It’s what you do while you wait for a crashing app to respond to task manager’s force close command. Not any more! If you alt-tab to Solitaire from a demanding game everything throws a fit. Unacceptable. \nAnyway, if you can live with all this, hooray, Microsoft Solitaire Collection is now mobile, too. Go for your life. Share on: Latest",

      "text": "Microsoft's Solitaire heading towards iOS, Android By Mizgan Masani Nov 24, 2016 12:23 PM EST Microsoft's Solitaire collection heading towards iOS and Android free of charge Advertisement \nMicrosoft is bringing its popular version of Solitaire to iOS and Android. While the game has existed on Windows for more than 25 years, the modern Solitaire collection will now be available outside Windows for the first time. \nThe company is offering its Solitaire collection to iOS and Android free of charge, as it hopes to gain more players to add to 119 million who have played the game on Windows 8 and 10. Advertisement \nThe mobile version will include FreeCell, Klondike, Spider, Tripeaks and Pyramid game modes. It will sport Xbox Live integration as well, so you won't have to play it alone, alongside daily challenges for the players. \nXbox live integration is there so that users can sign into Solitaire and play with friends or earn achievements. \nFreeCell uses four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead. \nTriPeaks displays cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. \nPyramid is played with two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board and users must try to reach the top of the pyramid. \nMicrosoft is also offering Premium edition for $1.99 per month without ads, which includes double coin rewards for daily challenges and boosts. \nWhile there are already countless versions of Solitaire available for iOS and Android, it makes sense for Microsoft to bring its popular version of the game over. \nSolitaire is a card that has existed since the late 1700s, its the oldest Windows game and dates back to 3.0 version released in 1990. \nMicrosoft intended Solitaire 'to soothe people intimidated by the operating system'. \nThe firm said Windows developers wanted users to develop speed and precision when using the mouse and making left and right clicks a natural habit. \nYou can download the app from Android Google Play Store and also from Apple app store too. \n",

      "text": "InfoCenters Advertisement Home > SQL Server > SQL Server 2016 > Microsoft Announces Enterprise Edition Features Across all Editions of SQL Server 2016 Microsoft Announces Enterprise Edition Features Across all Editions of SQL Server 2016 https://www.baboo.com.br/eventos-treinamentos/microsoft-connect-2016-ao-vivo/ Advertisement \nIt’s not often that a service pack release for Microsoft SQL Server deserves as much attention – let alone a keynote announcement – as the first service pack for SQL Server 2016 does. Most service packs don’t unlock key enterprise edition features into standard edition however. \nIn his keynote address Scott Guthrie, Executive Vice President for Cloud and Enterprise at Microsoft Corporation, announced just that this week at Connect 2016 . \nGuthrie started by stating that Microsoft is about any developer, any application, and any platform. Throughout the entire keynote, across all speakers, it was stressed over and over again that Microsoft is for the Developer. The enhancements in platforms and tools: from Visual Studio to SQL Server are squarely aimed and outreach to open source developers and independent software vendors. Microsoft has reached the stage where they’ve committed enough resources and retrenched in the last few years to significantly address stability and strength to their core products in the Data Platform, Development, and Cloud space. It’s now very apparent that they plan to spend the capital they’ve committed to those aspects of their business to squarely commit to demonstrating that the current Microsoft – the new Microsoft – is focused on being the best in class for providing tools and platforms to the generation of developers who came into their own with the impression that Microsoft was the antithesis and perhaps the nemesis and not the ally to their success. \nAt 90 minutes into the Connect 2016 keynote is when data professionals were brought into the discussion. Guthrie started by reminding attendees that Microsoft SQL Server continues to be the visionary leader in Operational Database Management Systems – per its positioning in the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant for that class of products. Additionally Microsoft SQL Server: \nIs the most secure database for the past 6 years according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology \nHas the highest performing data warehouse platform holding the top three TPC-H benchmarks \nOffers end-to-end mobile intelligence, including the lowest cost-per-user for self-service BI ($120) when compared to Tableau ($480) and Oracle ($2,230) \nProvides in-database Advanced Analytics using R language now included inside of Microsoft SQL Server allowing for up to 1 million predictions/sec \nAfter laying the groundwork for why Microsoft SQL Server 2016 is a great platform across the board. Guthrie then made his case for developer adoption and announced the enhancements coming in the latest service pack. Until now most of the advanced analytics and security features were only available in Enterprise Edition releases of Microsoft SQL Server: In-memory OLTP and DW, Operational Analytics, Polybase, advanced compression and partitioning functionality, Always Encrypted; these were not available in Standard or Express editions of the product. This is seen as a barrier to development because developers and independent software vendors alike needed to have the most expensive edition of SQL Server to develop against and market to in order to take advantage of these features. \nService Pack 1 for Microsoft SQL Server 2016, per Guthrie, now provides for those advanced features listed above to be in Enterprise, Standard, and Express editions of SQL Server. \nAdditionally Guthrie announced the availability of Microsoft SQL Server on both Windows and Linux; combining the industry leading in-memory performance and security of SQL Server with a widely adopted open source platform. Adding connectors for .Net, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and more; in addition to functionality for developing locally on macOS with Docker. Microsoft SQL Server on Linux will be available for Red Hat and Ubuntu, and within Docker. \nLara Rubbelke, Principal Software Development Engineer Lead at Microsoft was then introduced to provide a demonstration of installing SQL Server on Linux via a Docker container on a Macbook. There are 29 words in that last sentence. Until a year ago only the first 20 would have been appropriate. The last nine were not expected to ever be considered truth until recently. A single command line for accepting the End-User Licensing Agreement (EULA), setting the “sa” password and identifying the listening ports and thanks to being able to pull the image from Docker Hub SQL Server was ready to be used for development: docker run –e “ACCEPT EULA=Y” –e “SA_PASSWORD=<some_value>” –p 1443:1443 –d <path to install binaries> \nWithin seconds Rubbelke was connected to a Linux install of SQL Server inside a Docker container and never touching Microsoft Windows once. \nGuthrie then returned to the stage to announce that the private preview for SQL Server on Linux had ended and that the Linux/Microsoft SQL Server public preview was now open for all. \nMicrosoft continues to stress outreach towards application developers and their Intelligent Applications initiative by making it easier for developers to code against the Microsoft Data Platform be it SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or DocumentDB. This single surface initiative allows application developers and independent software vendors (ISVs) to code against a single code base of Microsoft SQL Server and eliminates the need to code around impediments to taking advantage of what were, up until now, enterprise edition-only features. Furthermore developers and ISVs alike are no longer constrained to a single operating system with the move towards Linux as an option for operating system hosting. \nService Pack 1 for Microsoft SQL Server 2016 is available for download here . \nThe public preview for Microsoft SQL Server on Linux is available here .",

      "text": "Pinterest \nMicrosoft’s Surface Studio is gearing up to be the company’s most ambitious and impressive product yet. However, it looks like Redmond is not taking any chances with its first generation of Surface AIOs and has set up a dedicated support system for Surface Studio owners. \nIt’s not secret that the first generation of any product will have some bugs to work out; which is likely why Microsoft is getting ahead of the problem. That is not to say that there may be some serious flaws with the Surface Studio. This, instead, looks more like a precautionary measure more than anything else. \nOn a similar note, Microsoft has surprised everyone by shipping pre-orders of the Surface Studio out early. Those who placed their pre-orders on the first day can look forward to the device arriving in the near future; despite Microsoft saying that the Surface Studio will not be available until 2017. \nNaturally, that doesn’t matter to Malaysians. The Surface Studio is currently only available in the US, and there is no indication that Microsoft is interested in expanding the limited production facilities to cater to the global market.",

      "text": "Microsoft Offers Concessions to Get EU Nod for LinkedIn Bid by Zacks Equity Research Published on November 24, 2016 Trades from $ 3 Shares of Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT - Free Report ) have been steadily treading higher over the last one year. The stock generated a return of 8.87% compared with the S&P 500 index’s gain of 7.87%. The upward momentum in the stock has been primarily driven by strong cloud growth. The continuing enterprise strength, benefits from the Office 365 subscription model, strong growth prospects of Azure and promising new products are expected to generate top-line growth in 2016. Meanwhile, per a Reuters report, it is rumored that Microsoft is trying its best to get the European Commission’s approval for its $26.2 billion takeover of LinkedIn Corporation ( LNKD - Free Report ) that is scheduled for Dec 6. To that end, Microsoft will not only allow LinkedIn competitors to access to its own software, but will also give hardware manufacturers the freedom of opting to install services offered by its rivals. For example, professional social networks that already have access to the company’s application program interface (API) will continue to enjoy that functionality even after the deal materializes. Additionally, hardware manufacturers such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company ( HPE - Free Report ) , Dell and Lenovo will have the freedom to install any other professional social network on their devices. \nMICROSOFT CORP Price \nMICROSOFT CORP Price | MICROSOFT CORP Quote Why this Move? Microsoft reportedly submitted the concessions related to its LinkedIn deal to the European Commission last week as the EU anticipates the deal to have adverse effects on competition. Moreover, as per the Reuters report, Microsoft is trying its bit to convince the EU that it is playing fair and is offering a level playing ground for competitors to prove their mettle. We note that LinkedIn has posted encouraging results in the third quarter and witnessed a strong year-over-year improvement in both the top and the bottom line. Moreover, it recorded an impressive 18% surge in cumulative member count. LinkedIn’s traction in the mobile segment is particularly impressive, primarily attributable to the launch of its applications for Apple’s ( AAPL - Free Report ) iPhones and Android-based smartphones. Synergies from its acquisitions are expected to contribute to earnings through targeted marketing strategies over the long term. \nIf the EU gives the green signal for the deal, Microsoft will be able to tap into the strong user base of 433 million LinkedIn users to promote its own products as well as generate a healthy cash flow through ad revenues. \nLINKEDIN CORP-A Price \nLINKEDIN CORP-A Price | LINKEDIN CORP-A Quote Zacks Rank & Key Picks At present, Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": "Reddit \nAdding to the rumors that Tesla might be working on adding augmented reality features to its vehicles, Tesla this month hired one of the top industrial designers of the HoloLens, Microsoft’s augmented reality headset. \nIt’s Tesla’s second hire from Microsoft’s HoloLens program after having hired one of the computer vision scientists from the program last year. \nAndrew Kim, Senior Designer for HoloLens & New Devices at Microsoft, changed his LinkedIn profile this week to list his new job as ‘Lead Designer’ at Tesla’s Design Studio in Hawthorne, California – first spotted by Slashgear : \n“Most recently, his time there involved work on Microsoft’s HoloLens headset, the augmented reality wearable with which the company is pushing Windows Holographic. However, Kim was also heavily involved with the design of the Xbox One S before that. In a since-removed post about the console, he described the brief for the slimmer hardware as being “a more friendly and universal product that doesn’t evoke traditional ‘gaming’ cues” in its aesthetic.” \nHis work on the Xbox also explains his cool parting gift – via his Instagram : A photo posted by Andrew Kim (@mnmllymnml) on Nov 23, 2016 at 12:42pm PST \nAlso, looking at his Instagram history it appears that Kim is a fan of Porsche’s design and he is a Porsche owner himself. Among his new colleagues at Tesla’s Design Studio in Hawthorne, Félix Godard is a former Porsche interior designer credited with the design of the Mission E . \nAs we reported last month in our write up of ‘Tesla Vision’ , Kim will not be the only employee at Tesla from Microsoft’s HoloLens program. Last year, Tesla hired Yekeun Jeong, a computer vision expert working on the HoloLens, to work on Tesla Vision. \nOf course, due to his background in industrial design, augmented reality devices are far from Kim’s only potential contribution to Tesla’s design team led by Franz von Holzhausen. \nBut nonetheless, Tesla has been rumored to be working on an augmented reality system in the form of a heads-up display for the Model 3. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been referring to the interior controls of the vehicle as “spaceship-like” and the prototypes unveiled earlier this year didn’t feature any instrument cluster. \nSeparately, Tesla has also been exploring using VR or AR in its retail strategy. Not unlike Volvo’s own partnership with Microsoft on the HoloLens: Guides Tesla \nTesla is a transportation and energy company. It sells vehicles under its 'Tesla Motors' division and stationary battery pack for home, commercial and utility-scale projects under its 'Tesla Energy' division. View THe Guide Tesla Model 3 \nThe Tesla Model 3 is the first vehicle built on Tesla's third-generation platform. It aims to reduce the entry price for electric vehicles while not making any compromise on range and performance. The Model 3 will start at $35,000 in the US and deliveries should begin in late 2017.",

      "text": "0 A woman checks a Surface tablet as she visits a Microsoft store in Paramus, New Jersey July 8, 2015. Reuters//Eduardo Munoz \nLatest reports doing rounds on the Internet claim that Microsoft could be releasing the Surface Pro 5 and Surface Phone together in 2017. The company is surely one of the biggies in the industry today and if these reports turn out to be true, Microsoft could be having a much bigger 2017. \nFans have been waiting eagerly for the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 and the Microsoft Surface Phone to be released. Tech enthusiasts have come up with innumerable theories, release dates and anticipated specs and features of the devices. Fans were hoping that at least one of the devices would be released before 2016 ends. \nAccording to The Bitbag , the Microsoft Surface Phone and Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may be announced as early as February 2017. This could be a double bonanza for Microsoft fans and the best New Year surprise they could think of. However, Microsoft has not made any official announcement on the same and this somewhat disappointing. \nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 5 could come powered by Intel’s Kaby Lake processor. This would surely be an upgrade from the existing Skylake chipset. The device may also come equipped with a Surface Pen. A new dock in the main device will charge the Pen. USB Type-C ports may also be included, writes iTech Post . \nTech enthusiasts believe Microsoft will go for a major display upgrade too and surprise fans with a 4K/UHD display feature with a screen resolution of 3860 x 2560 pixels. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will come with a hefty price tag. The basic model of Surface Pro 4 sold for US$899 (AU$1,210). This price went up to US$2,000 (AU$2,700), depending on the configuration. \nThe Surface Phone could be Microsoft’s last chance to take a shot at Apple’s iPhone. This product may allow full versions of Windows software to run on an ARM processor.",

      "text": "Apple's Black Friday Deals Go Live With Gift Cards; Microsoft Store offering Discount deals on Products Xbox One S available at $249 as part of sale Apple's gift card deals do not include iPhone 7 and 7 Plus Apple's deals include 13-inch MacBook Pro 2016 model without Touch Bar \nThe Black Friday deals have already started pouring out and all the major companies seem to have pulled their socks up in order to provide tough competition to local retailers. In order to celebrate the occasion, Apple is offering gift cards for specified product purchases while Microsoft has now started offering discounted deals on its products on the Microsoft Store. \nEarlier this week, a dedicated webpage on the Apple's website teased a one-day shopping event on November 25 on account of Black Friday. Even though the company doesn't have a reputation of offering big discounted deals, the teaser raised hopes that it might offer something special this year. However, as it turns out, Apple is still offering gift cards for specified product purchases as part of its Black Friday celebration. It should be noted that company's recent products are not a part of this deal. Apple's Black Friday deals are reportedly live in just New Zealand and Australia for, but the listings confirm the approximate discount that can be expected in other regions in including US. The gift cards range from AUD 35 (roughly Rs. 1,800) to AUD 200 (roughly Rs. 10,200). The deals notably exclude iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , Apple Watch Series 2, and the Touch Bar models of MacBook Pro 2016. However, the deals do cover the 13-inch model of MacBook Pro 2016 without the Touch Bar.\nOn the other hand, Microsoft is now offering some of its premium products at discounted prices as part of its Black Friday sale on the Microsoft Store. The Redmond-based company is now offering its Surface Pro 4 variant with Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM with 256GB SSD for $999 (roughly Rs. 68,400), which is $430 (roughly Rs. 29,400) less than its usual price. \nFurther, the company is offering the Surface Book model with Core i5 processor and 8GB RAM with 256GB SSD at $1,499 (roughly Rs. 1. 02 lakhs) compared with its usual price tag of $1,899 (roughly Rs. 1.3 lakhs). The Microsoft Store also lists the Dell Inspiron 15 i5559 Signature Edition at $399 (roughly Rs. 27,300), which is $350 (roughly Rs. 23,950) less than its standard price. \nThe Microsoft Store has also slashed the price of Alienware 15 Touch Signature Edition gaming laptop to $1,497 (roughly Rs. 1.02 lakhs) from its retail price of $2,499 (roughly Rs. 1.7 lakhs) as part of its sale. Microsoft is also offering its gaming console Xbox One S at a discount of $50 (roughly Rs. 3,400) for $249 (roughly Rs. 17,000) as part of its Black Friday sale. The company is also giving away a gift code worth $25 (roughly Rs. 1,700) and a select game as part of this deal.",

Subscribe Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella talks at a Microsoft news conference. (Photo credit: DON EMMERT/AFP/Getty Images) \nPollsters and major media groups that had forecast a narrow victory for veteran politician Hillary Clinton unhappily found themselves on the wrong side of the U.S. presidential election outcome. Despite a well-organized field campaign, seemingly impenetrable firewalls of brain power, heavy ad spending, and mountains of data, post-election analysis suggests the Clinton campaign’s own models were built on an array of flawed assumptions. Conversely, Donald Trump’s campaign wriggled through most of the pollster’s algorithms by using tactics with none of the markers of a “standard run” for the White House. Trump’s heavily emotional appeal to a broad spectrum of the electorate surfaced core threads the Democrats missed, tapping deep economic and cultural anxieties. \nIt appears the Democrats’ own blind spots cost Hillary Clinton the White House. And though it’s likely Trump himself did not expect to win , the failures of the Democratic machine offer key insights for every business leader believing they have their strategies “all wrapped up” and working just fine. Lessons from the positive approach used by two CEOs – Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Kati Levoranta of Rovio (pioneer of Angry Birds ) – remind us of the power in advocating “for” questions, and actually cultivating questioners. Rooting out blind spots can save you and your company the leadership perch you worked years – perhaps even decades – to achieve. \nHere are two ways to generate conversations and behaviors in your teams to reduce blind spots that stall innovation, and stifle an ability to pivot away from the competition. \nWatch on Forbes: \nProactively question your favorite narrative of the future . During a recent trip to Finland I spoke at an innovation conference held at Microsoft. Seven years ago I’d visited the identical building, which in 2009 belonged to Nokia – the famed Finnish company that rose to dominate the mobile phone industry in the early 2000’s. In fact, the building had once been known as Nokia House – a grand testament to the once-thriving telecom giant. \nBut on this occasion, still whispered in the hallways were the failures of Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, who despite flagging sales remained convinced that the company’s mobile software was still world class. Signing a $7.2 billion partnership deal with Microsoft in 2013 , Nokia’s dominance narrative was upheld by Steve Ballmer and his Microsoft leadership team, all convinced that together they could rebuild Nokia’s declining market share to form a “third ecosystem” to compete with Apple and Android on the global stage. That investment officially went sour in May 2016, after Microsoft ultimately acquired Nokia, wrote off billions and laid off over 18,000 employees starting last year. \nInternal attempts to shift Ballmer away from his “Microsoft will be a dominant mobile phone player” narrative – or at least have him constructively question it – failed. The same fate met Elop’s troops inside Nokia. In fact, questions about the strategic posture of Nokia were given no quarter, even during a much-touted 2013 trip by Elop to visit mapping maverick Navteq (now Here) at its Chicago headquarters. Recognized as the author of some of the world’s best mapping technology , Navteq – a company Nokia had purchased years earlier – was not handed over as part of the Microsoft deal . Yet when Elop spoke to several key Chicago R&D team members working on next generation mapping technology, Elop not only failed to consider Navteq’s ground-breaking work as a template for Nokia’s mobile phone future, he dismissed any in-depth conversations or question sessions with this elite team. Elop’s blind spots won the day, Nokia lost its independence, and Steve Ballmer’s command and control style led to a very visible failure for Microsoft’s mobile phone bid. \nEnter Satya Nadella. As noted in my July 2014 Forbes post , Microsoft’s Nadella has consistently displayed a more collaborative, inclusive style than his bombastic predecessor. Not only has Nadella shifted away from a “here are the answers, now go execute them” approach, he’s emphasizing the value of a growth mindset within the employee base. This means leveraging the power of learning and cultivating the power of discovery versus raw “knowing.” Named a business leader of the year by Fortune just weeks ego for returning the company to a growth path, Nadella in fact emphasizes “ listening to learn ” through questions. Consciously seeking out questions and questioners as part of his strategy to optimize Microsoft’s cloud computing thrust, Nadella is also eliminating blind spots that plagued the early years of its Surface computer. By remapping his schedule to consciously speak to diverse Microsoft constituents every week, Nadella is rebuilding employee and investor confidence, intentionally encouraging provocative, constructive questions about Microsoft’s future narrative.

      "text": "Nigeria: How Telecoms Sector Topped Advertisers' 10-Year List By Collins Mwai The Ministry of Education has entered a partnership with Microsoft Corporation that will see incorporation of information and communication technology into various aspects of the country's education sector. Microsoft, a multinational technology company that develops and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services, among others, brings onboard access to the latest technology, skills and a wealth of experience. The partnership is aimed enabling speedy digital transformation of the education sector. Among the aspects of the sector to benefit from the partnership is the 'Smart Classrooms Initiative,' which will complement the One Laptop per Child (OLPC) programme, according to officials. So far, Smart Classroom implementation is underway in 1,500 'smart' classrooms that are being set up while 150 Microsoft Academies are being set up to help train students, teachers and local community. The public private partnership will also see over three million students and 61,000 teachers access Wi-Fi internet during learning. The two partners have since conducted a pilot phase of a connectivity programme that will use a new technology, TV White Spaces technology. The technology utilises the unused space in terrestrial TV spectrum to provide cheap internet connectivity to remote areas. Unlike Wi-Fi that propagates to a 100-metre radius, TV White Spaces can propagate the signal to a radius of about 10 kilometres and is more affordable. The pilot tests involved Lycee de Kigali and University of Rwanda's College of Business and Economics. Currently, only about 9 per cent of 531 schools in the country have access to the internet. Of these, only 6 per cent of primary and 18 per cent of secondary schools, are connected to the internet. The pilot phase, underway at the University of Rwanda, will benefit 28,000 students and 1,500 teachers at the institution, and will also see Microsoft offer IT Certification, Cloud Computing solutions and devices equipped with Microsoft products. Speaking at a meeting with Microsoft officials in Kigali, yesterday, the Minister for Education, Dr Papias Musafiri, said the new technology and model of Smart Classrooms will not render the current OLPC programme redundant but will rather complement the gains already made under OLPC. With over 250,000 computers already distributed to schools across the country, there were concerns on the fate the OLPC programme. The minister said the Government was encouraging parents to acquire laptops for their children and had set up schemes to make laptops affordable and payable in instalments. He said, from OLPC programme, the Government had learned valuable lessons that would come in handy for the next phases ICT in education. The minister noted that the Government was well aware of issues that were likely to affect the process such as limited electricity connectivity. \"To address such issues we are working out off-grid solutions that tap into solar energy and ensure that technologies introduced are compatible with solar energy solutions,\" he said. Mark East, the general manager of Microsoft Global Sales and Operations, said that the partnership will also present business opportunities for a section of local private sector. Among the ways they will seek to work with members of the local private sector is rollout of internet connectivity and solar energy provision. \"There will be no waste of investment, including previous ventures such as One Laptop per Child, they will all fit in the ecosystem. We want to empower local partners to be able to contribute toward the vision. We are already working with telecom companies and will be working with players in solar energy provision,\" East said. The partnership will also enable Rwanda to access Microsoft software at highly subsidised costs, which is expected to benefit learners acquiring devices from local computer assembly plant, POSITIVO BGH.

      "text": "Surface Phone Rumors: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Confirms Pursuit Of The 'Ultimate Mobile Device' 25 November 2016, 12:00 am EST By Carl Velasco Tech Times Latest News And Scoops On Smartphone Now Playing Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, has hinted at its next smartphone being the \"ultimate mobile device.\" The possibly Surface-branded phone is a way for the company to reenter the smartphone business after abysmal results with past Windows Mobile phones. ( Andrew Burton | Getty Images ) Advertisement There has long been eclectic whispers of what the Surface Phone could be , and Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, isn't one to simply ward those rumors off from the mill. In fact, the CEO has even somewhat thrilled those who are stuck in speculation about Microsoft's next lineup of smartphones. The 'Ultimate Mobile Device' In an interview with the Australian Financial Review posted Monday, the same one where Nadella threw a bit of subtle shade at Apple , he confirmed that Microsoft was currently conducting \"innovative\" research that would bolster the company's presence in the smartphone market. However, Microsoft wants to approach the smartphone race differently, disregarding the game of catch-up other phone makers have been increasingly guilty of and instead pursuing to create the \"ultimate mobile device,\" in Nadella's own words. \"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device,\" he told the Australian Financial Review. According to Nadella, Microsoft has no plans of launching a phone that doesn't bring something innovative to the table, since it's more attuned to the behavior of people and organizations in relation to mobile devices, instead of the device itself. \"[T]he question is, what can we bring? That's where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,\" he said. Surface Phone Rumors Surface Phone rumors have been ambling for quite some time now, with the resounding notion that it could complement other products in Microsoft's Surface line, such as the Surface Pro and the acclaimed Surface Studio . Some predict a mobile phone running on Windows 10 Mobile OS, while others lean more toward a device that sports a physical keyboard. Others have also noted that the HP Elite x3 , advertised as a PC-capable smartphone, could also hint at which direction Microsoft intends to tread along in the smartphone business. Microsoft's vision of an ultimate mobile device is far too thin to stretch as of this time, and it remains to be seen whether it could truly clinch an official comeback. However the Surface Phone turns out, it'll unarguably serve as a second chance for Microsoft to reenter the smartphone race after failing to win consumers even with the Nokia acquisition two years ago. Its smartphone business has visibly struggled over the years, and if this ultimate mobile device proves revolutionary as the company intends it to be, then Microsoft could assume its place once again in the painstakingly competitive smartphone industry. Do you think Microsoft could possibly be a front-runner in the smartphone race with its ultimate mobile device? Feel free to sound off in the comments section below.

      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) Microsoft Surface brand is expected to come out with a mobile phone product soon. \nMicrosoft is currently soaring high with its Surface line of tech products particularly the PC and the tablet-laptop hybrid segments. Fans, however, are quite expectant to hear more about its purported smartphone, the Microsoft Surface phone. \nThere have been a bountiful number of rumors that came out with regard to the alleged gadget with some saying that it could be unveiled before this year ends. Other reports cited concept photos and renderings of the unit. But all those speculations can now finally be laid to rest with the latest update from the Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, himself. \nAccording to Forbes , Nadella has recently spoken with the Australian Financial Review to dish out details about the highly anticipated Microsoft phone. \nIn his statement, the tech firm executive reiterated the fact that the company is continuing their research for a much more innovative smartphone technology despite the fact that they came in late to the hype train. Advertisement \nHowever, instead of following closely the footsteps of today's industry leaders in this particular consumer electronics, Nadella set his sights on paving a new path to create what he called the \"ultimate mobile device.\" \n\"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device. Therefore we stopped doing things that were me-too and started doing things, even if they are today very sub-scale, to be very focused on a specific set of customers who need a specific set of capabilities that are differentiated and that we can do a good job of,\" he said. \nThe tech behemoth is reportedly slated to unveil this telecommunication handset by 2017. It is also said to run with the new Windows 10 Redstone 2 OS which is due to go live by next year. \nWatch out for more updates.  ",

      "title": "Surface Phone release rumors: Device to be unveiled at next year's Mobile World Congress",
      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) The Surface Phone is said to replace the Microsoft Lumia 950 (shown). According to rumors, the alleged device will be launched at next year's Mobile World Congress. \nAfter it was speculated that Microsoft would finally unveil its alleged Surface Phone at its own event last month, the latest in the rumor mill claims that the highly anticipated device will finally be launched in February next year. \nAlthough Microsoft has never confirmed the existence of the Surface Phone, there is no denying that it is one of the most-anticipated devices. In fact, although it was already strongly suspected that Microsoft's event last Oct. 26 would cast the spotlight on the brand's first-ever all-in-one PC, there were still some who believed that the Surface Phone would be launched there. \nNonetheless, despite being a no-show at last month's Microsoft event, rumors about the Surface Phone continue to grow louder. In fact, according to the latest rumors, Microsoft will finally unveil the alleged device at next year's Mobile World Congress (MWC) happening in Barcelona, Spain from Feb. 27– March 2, 2017, along with the equally anticipated Surface Pro 5. \nApart from its release rumors, there are also various rumors and speculations as to what the Surface Phone will have to offer. Reportedly , the device will run on Windows 10 Redstone 2, the latest operating system from Microsoft that is, likewise, to be unveiled. Advertisement \nHowever, despite running on a Windows OS, it is also alleged that the Surface Phone will still be able to run some Android and iOs apps. In the event that this turns out to be true, pundits expect that Microsoft's share in the mobile phone market will improve as the main reason why the Lumia line it acquired from Nokia got a poor response from the consumers is the lack of apps that its Windows OS can run. \nOn the other hand, there are also reports claiming that the Surface Phone may not be a phone after all as, allegedly, Microsoft no longer has the intent to jump into the mobile world market. Instead, according to rumors, the brand will release an innovative product that can function as a phone as well. \nWhile the rumors attached to the Surface Phone are nothing short of exciting, unfortunately, they are nothing more than unconfirmed pieces of information at this point in time. In the event that the device is really unveiled at the upcoming MWC 2017, only by then can it be confirmed if the aforementioned speculations are true or not. Copyright © 2016 Ecumenical News",

But given the latest rumors, the details that the report includes pretty much make sense. Specifically, NPU writes that Microsoft has developed several prototypes for the Surface Phone and all of them are powered by a Snapdragon 835 CPU and come with support for Quick Charge 4.0. This would give the device super-fast charging speeds with a USB Type-C connector. Wireless charging is very likely to be supported as we...",

Security company Forcepoint has discovered a new wave of attacks involving Microsoft’s OneDrive for Business , with cybercriminals hosting malware on Redmond’s service and then attaching links into emails sent to victims. Since it’s a Microsoft domain, attackers expect victims to trust the links and download the attached files, which would eventually infect their systems. According security researchers, most attachments hosted on OneDrive for Business are infected with malware families such as Dridex and Ursnif.

      "text": "Cybercriminals Spreading Malware Using Microsoft’s OneDrive GO New way found to make malware links look legitimate Nov 25, 2016 06:53   Cybercriminals are always seeking new ways to convince their victims to load websites or download malicious files, and this time they have turned to Microsoft services to make links look legitimate. Security company Forcepoint has discovered a new wave of attacks involving Microsoft’s OneDrive for Business, with cybercriminals hosting malware on Redmond’s service and then attaching links into emails sent to victims. Since it’s a Microsoft domain, attackers expect victims to trust the links and download the attached files, which would eventually infect their systems. According security researchers, most attachments hosted on OneDrive for Business are infected with malware families such as Dridex and Ursnif. Attachments are usually delivered as executable files or archives that include a JavaScript downloader. The attacks are mostly aimed at users in Australia and the United Kingdom for the time being. Compromised OneDrive accounts Forcepoint explains that it’s unclear for the moment how attackers managed to compromise the OneDrive for Business accounts, but in addition to malware spreading, this new series of hacks shows that not only users targeted by malicious emails are exposed, but also these businesses themselves. Depending on the information and data they store in their OneDrive accounts, cybercriminals could get access to sensitive details, so it’s essential for businesses to take actions and secure their accounts. “While it is unknown how OneDrive for Business accounts are being compromised, it entails additional risk not only for the compromised user but also for the affected business as it means that the attackers may also have access to other business assets and contacts,” the company explains. It goes without saying that users who receive emails coming from untrusted sources should be extra cautious, especially if they are encouraged to download files or attachments that appear to be compromised. An antivirus solution can also help since these are known forms of malware, but staying away from such files is usually the most effective way to prevent an infection.",

      "text": "Microsoft set to win EU approval for LinkedIn buy: Report Reuters Email Author \nMicrosoft is set to gain EU approval for its $26 billion buy of professional social network LinkedIn with tweaks to concessions aimed at addressing competition concerns, three people close to the matter said on Wednesday. \nMicrosoft last week told the European Commission that it would still allow LinkedIn's rivals access to its software such as its Outlook program and give hardware makers the option of installing competing professional social networks on computers after the acquisition. \nThe second plank of the concession is important because of the company's battle with the EU competition authority over the last decade and the policy of tying its products to block rivals, resulting in fines of more than 2.2 billion euros. \nThe slight modifications came following feedback from rivals and customers, the people said, declining to provide details because of the sensitivity of the issue. \nThe deal, Microsoft's largest ever acquisition, will allow the company to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. \nHowever, it came amidst regulatory concerns and citizens' worries about big data and that some companies may use the huge amount of information they gather to squeeze out competitors and encroach on users' privacy. Also read: Beyond Microsoft and LinkedIn: Biggest tech acquisitions \nThe deal has been criticized by U.S. rival Salesforce, which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn and which urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before approving it. \nThe Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Dec. 6, as well as Microsoft, declined to comment. \nAuthorities in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa have already nodded through the acquisition without demanding concessions. \nThe bulk of LinkedIn's $3 billion annual revenue comes from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.

      "text": "News Surface Phone is real and coming in 2017, hints Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella mentioned in his a statement about an \"ultimate mobile device\", hinting after a long time that they would continue to stay in the smartphone market. A + A - \nNot long after Microsoft released its last Lumia in the market, rumours for another lineup of pocket devices have been doing the rounds. At one part the company declared Windows phones are will be fully supported and the talked about its continued commitment to Windows 10 phones, alleged leaks with full-fledged renders were hitting websites and blogs. \nBut now, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella mentioned in his a statement about an \"ultimate mobile device\", putting an official sense to all the air about a future Windows smartphone. Though it could also mean something else, the fact that Microsoft will have to bring in new hardware to fully carry Windows Phone OS on its shoulder could only explain how it would \"continue to be in the phone market\". \n\"We don't want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That's where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,\" he said. \"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.\" Also Read: Microsoft's Surface Phone delayed till 2017, may come in 3 variants \nWhat we know from all the leaks and renders of devices appearing before this is that the phones will have new hardware, the one being readied as 'surface hardware' to match the already available surface devices. Then the software is also getting an upgrade - the Windows Phone 10 RedStone 1 update already launched in July end and the RedStone 2 scheduled for launch with the Surface hardware in 2017. \nMicrosoft had a tough time putting off its previous smartphone lineup, including laying off hundreds of employees. But its new surface devices have garned a lot of praise. And that could be a big motivation behind resuscitating a device lineup close to its heart (and new revenue proposals).

Posted 25 Nov 2016 17:16 Updated 25 Nov 2016 17:20 File photo of an HDB lift undergoing maintenance. (Photo: Xabryna Kek) A \nSINGAPORE: Urban planning consultancy firm Surbana Jurong and Microsoft inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Friday (Nov 25) to develop cloud-based technology for governments and city planners to better monitor common estate facilities like lifts, and in turn better manage their cities. \nThe agreement is the first such collaboration for Microsoft in the region, and also comes after Surbana Jurong launched its Smart Cities in a Box initiative in July, which allows city officials and to track city assets like lights, water tanks, buildings and lifts through a series of applications. \nSurbana will now have access to Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure, which both sides say will help save costs, and allow clients to access the Smart Cities in a Box technology from anywhere without software and hardware upgrades. Cloud computing involves storing or managing data on Internet servers instead of a local server or personal computer. \nFollowing the MoU, Surbana said it will also be able to tap on Microsoft's predictive technology to improve its smart city solutions, and in particular lift management. For example, this could mean having sensors in lifts to predict breakdowns before they occur, or using video technology to detect if a person faints, and trigger alerts accordingly. \nThe firm currently monitors 24,000 lifts in Singapore's public housing estates, and have been conducting trials of the technology with town councils since July. \n\"As our predictive analytics capabilities are refined and enhanced over time, we could see a reduction in the number of lift incidents in the future,\" said Surbana Jurong Group CEO Wong Heang Fine at the MOU signing. - CNA/xk",

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIt’s Black Friday, so there are tons of deals available out there and this one of the better ones, in case you’re looking for a virtual reality headset. You can currently purchase the HTC Vive directly from Microsoft, and get a discount worth $240. \nThe HTC Vive is one of the best virtual reality head-mounted displays out there, and the device has been selling for $799.99. But if you want to pick up the headset for less, you can do so today on Amazon for just $699.99 . \nStill, Microsoft has an even better deal for you, with the headset coming in at the same $699.99 price, but also bringing a few more bonus items on top. For one thing, if you purchase the headset from Microsoft you’ll also get a $100 gift code for the Microsoft Store . You’ll also get two free games for the Vive, worth together $40. On top of that you’ll also get free shipping. \nUnfortunately, the deal is only currently available in the United States, so those of us in other countries will have to wait for other opportunities to pick up the Vive.

      "text": "microsoft turning quantum research into real products computer ibm More Many companies and researchers are investigating quantum computing as one of the next major steps in the evolution of computers. The “spooky” effects of quantum physics, it is hoped, will enable the creation of computers that operate on certain tasks at unprecedented levels of performance.\nMicrosoft is one of those companies, and it has been looking at quantum computing for some time now. Today, however, the company is taking the next step of actively investing in the creation of a real, scaleable quantum computer that can be used to tackle real-world problems, as the company outlines on the official Microsoft blog .\nMore: MIT’s newest quantum computer puts us one step closer to defeating modern encryption\nAs Microsoft executive Todd Holmdahl puts it, ““I think we’re at an inflection point in which we are ready to go from research to engineering.” The executive has some experience within Microsoft of bringing pie-in-the-sky projects to the market, having been involved in the development of the Xbox, Kinect, and the HoloLens — all projects that started out as mere research projects and made it all the way to consumer products.\nMicrosoft will be drawing on the skills and knowledge of two prominent quantum computing researchers in moving the initiative outside of the lab and into a real product. Charles Marcus is Villum Kann Rasmussen Professor at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen and also serves as director of the Danish National Research Foundation-sponsored Center for Quantum Devices. Joining him at the center of Microsoft’s efforts is Leo Kouwenhoven, distinguished professor at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands and founding director of QuTech, the Advanced Research Center on Quantum Technologies.\nBoth researchers have been working with Microsoft on their quantum computing tech for some time, and now the company is funding more work on basic research in the lab. Both scientists will retain their titles and affiliations after joining Microsoft and will continue working with their respective teams. At the heart of their efforts will be the ultimate goal of bringing a quantum computer into the real world.\nAccording to Marcus, “I knew that to get over the hump and get to the point where you started to be able to create machines that have never existed before, it was necessary to change the way we did business. We need scientists, engineers of all sorts, technicians, programmers, all working on the same team.”\nMore: Researchers in Australia develop more stable qubits for quantum computers\nMicrosoft hasn’t announced any firm plans to deploy a product, but its focus will be on the type of qubit, which stands for a unit of quantum information, call the “topological cubit.” Qubits are used as the key building blocks in a quantum computer, and could allow them to determine multiple solutions to a problem at once, in contrast to today’s sequential computers.\nThe company will have a number of obstacles to overcome in building a quantum computer. For example, the devices will require incredibly cold and static environments to avoid external influence on the system’s quantum state, as that will disturb the state and disrupt processing. According to Microsoft, qubits are less susceptible to heat and electrical noise, meaning they can be used to maintain quantum states for longer periods of time.\nClearly, the challenge will be a significant one. At the end, however, will be the creation of a quantum computer that can dramatically reduce the time to develop new drugs and study biological processes, to take two examples. A quantum-powered intelligent cloud would exceed existing computers in power in the same way that the smartphone exceeds the first cell phones. Holmdahl expanded on the opportunity, saying, “There is a real opportunity to apply these computers to things that I’ll call material sciences of physical systems. A lot of these problems are intractable on a classical computer, but on a quantum computer we believe that they are tractable in a reasonable period of time.”\nOne day, a quantum computer might help delve into the secrets of quantum physics itself. It’s conceivable that questions about dark matter and other mysteries of the universe might one day be solved on a Microsoft quantum computer running the company’s own specialized software.\nWe spoke with the science consultant behind Doctor Strange’s mind-bending multiverse Researchers in Australia develop more stable qubits for quantum computers Analog DNA computers can perform math inside a test tube",

      "text": "Microsoft’s LinkedIn Takeover “Likely” to Receive EU’s Approval GO Report claims EU is expected to clear the deal soon Nov 25, 2016 05:36 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft announced earlier this year that it agreed to purchase professional social network LinkedIn for no less than $26.2 billion, but the company hit some roadblocks in Europe, where rivals complained that this acquisition could violate competition laws. After working closely with EU’s antitrust watchdog, Microsoft is very likely to get the go-ahead in Europe as well, after the United States, Canada, Brazil, and South Africa already approved the deal. A report by Reuters and citing people with knowledge of the matter reveal that Microsoft has agreed to concessions which would address worries that Microsoft could block access to LinkedIn data for its rivals. One of the concessions states that Microsoft will continue to “give hardware makers the option of installing competing procession social networks on computers after the acquisition,” the report states. A decision on Microsoft’s LinkedIn takeover is expected to be announced by the EU by December 6, and there are big chances that Redmond receives the go-ahead in this deal. The Salesforce complaint One of the companies that complained about Microsoft’s LinkedIn takeover was Salesforce , which is also a party that was involved in the negotiations, but lost the bidding war to the software giant. Burke Norton, Salesforce’s chief legal officer, warned that “Microsoft’s proposed acquisition of LinkedIn threatens the future of innovation and competition,” calling for the European Union to closely investigate the takeover because it might violate competition laws. On the other hand, Microsoft guarantees that competition won’t be affected in any way, and not only that it offered concessions, but it also explained that little is going to change for LinkedIn when it comes to its collaboration with company rivals. “We’re committed to continuing to work to bring price competition to a CRM market in which Salesforce is the dominant participant charging customers higher prices today,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s chief legal officer, said. Microsoft is yet to comment on these rumors, and this is clearly no surprise, as the company is awaiting an official statement from the European Union.",

      "text": "Mail Print Subscribe \nWhile IoT keeps climbing the popularity charts, the other thing which is growing at almost twice the pace along with it is the security concern associated with it. \nNowadays, personal computers are no more the only devices connected to the internet. A variety of devices embedded with Internet connectivity and functions have also joined the party. This very class of devices, famously known as the Internet of Things or IoT, and has ended up giving birth to a new level of security and privacy risks. \nIn order to curb these, the Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group or the BITAG- an alliance formed by world technology giants Microsoft, Google, Verizon, Intel and a number of other players in the tech industry- has laid out a set of guidelines so as to improve the security on Internet of Things devices. Advertisement \nFormed in the year 2010 to produce best practices for broadband security, the BITAG published its recommendations for IoT manufacturers in a report titled Internet of Things (IoT) Security and Privacy Recommendations . The Report explores in detail the technical aspects of the security and privacy of networked consumer devices. \nIn the 8-pages long document, the BITAG mentions that “the nature of consumer IoT is unique because it can involve non-technical or uninterested consumers; challenging device discovery and inventory on consumer home networks.” It further added that IoT devices can be hijacked to create “Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, perform surveillance and monitoring, gain unauthorized access or control, induce device or system failures, and disturb or harass authorized users or device owners.” \nThis is exactly what happened in the case of Mirai , the malware that is responsible for causing one of the worst denial of service cyberattacks that the world had experienced in the last few years. Recently the malware had spread and infected internet-connected devices in over 177 countries all around the world. \nIn October, Mirai caused massive outrage when it targeted Dyn, a major name in the domain name service (DNS) provider sector. The case saw Internet of Things being put to use to break the internet. \nIn order to avoid such cases in the future, the Broadband Internet Technical Advisory Group made a number of recommendations for the manufacturers: \n1) IoT Devices should make use of the best current software practices. This should include a strong mechanism for secure, automated software updates. \n2) IoT Devices should use strong authentication by default and not use common or easily guessable user names and passwords (e.g., “admin”, “password”). \n3) IoT Devices manufacturers should follow best security and Cryptography practices by securing communications using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Lightweight Cryptography (LWC). If devices rely on a public key infrastructure (PKI), then an authorized entity must be able to revoke certificates when they become compromised, and manufacturers should take care to avoid encryption methods, protocols, and key sizes with known weaknesses. \n4) IoT Devices should be restrictive rather than permissive in communication. \n5) IoT Devices should continue to function even if the internet connectivity is disrupted. \n6) IoT Devices should continue to function even if the cloud back-end fails \n7) IoT Devices should ship with a privacy policy that is easy to find and understand. \nBITAG is a non-profit, multi-stakeholder organization that is focused on bringing together engineers and technologists in a Technical Working Group (TWG) to develop consensus on broadband network management practices and other related technical issues that can affect users’ Internet experience, including the impact to and from applications, content and devices that utilize the Internet. \nThe report has also recommended that IoT devices manufacture should make sure that the devices are not reachable via inbound connections by default. Since BITAG is just an advisory group, it can’t legally enforce any of its recommendations on IoT device manufacturers, but can only give them crucial points to think on and act. \nThe lead editors of the report were Jason Livingood, Vice President – Technology Policy & Standards at Comcast and Nick Feamster, Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University. Douglas Sicker, Executive Director of BITAG, Chair of BITAG’s Technical Working Group, Department Head of Engineering and Public Policy and a professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, chaired the review itself. \n[Top Image: logicworks.net]",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft’s Windows 10 Continuum venture has been a huge success on their part and the introduction of this feature was one of the best aspects of the new Windows version capable of delivering an archetypal desktop-like experience with Universal Windows Apps in conjunction with a Continuum compatible phone to an external display, keyboard and mouse. \nStill, there is a limitation to the functionality: its inability to run full-fledged x86 apps. But since January 2016, there has been a rumor that Microsoft has been working on adding x86 emulation to ARM processors along with eliminating this exception in Continuum . This addition was needed as not all apps are developed for the UWP platform and some apps need to be run in the x86 mode. \nThanks to codename ‘Cobalt’, various sources have suggested that Microsoft is planning to enable x86 on ARM64 emulation in Windows 10 by Fall 2017 with its ‘Redstone 3’ release. One of them, a Twitter user called Walking Cat, insinuated that Microsoft’s upcoming technology involves “Windows hybrid x86-on- ARM64 tech” which is apparently codenamed CHPE. \nIt looks like Windows’s hybrid x86-on-ARM64 tech has a new name “CHPE”, whatever it means ???? maybe something like Compound Hybrid PE, tweeted WalkingCat. \nBreaking down the abbreviation, HP refers to Hewlett-Packard while the C might stand out for Cobalt, which is as we previously mentioned a code name for x86 emulation based on ARM. \nHP stated a while back that a majority of enterprise consumers of its Elite x3, a Continuum focused device, used some kind of remote-desktop capability to run x86 apps via Continuum. For the most part, the main program being run is Citrix to fulfill their needs of using Win32/line-of-business apps. HP has seemingly also reworked its HP Workspace virtualisation service to target smaller business users so they can access their x86 apps without having to gain remote-desktop access. \nWhy is it needed? Think of it this way: Wouldn’t Windows 10 mobile be a more reliable and dependable interface with added support for x86 apps with the help of ARM64 , just like the WOW (Windows on Windows) emulator allowed 32-bit apps to run on 64-bit Windows? If you ask us, it is definitely an interesting take on Continuum by Microsoft. \nMoreover, Cobalt might also prove to be a revolutionary aspect for Microsoft’s very own Surface Phone . The company’s Terry Myerson recently stated the ARM processors in Windows Mobile are one of the unique things about the platform and that the ARM processors “have a role in the technical landscape of the future”.",

      "text": "print \nMicrosoft HoloLens allows people to see things that aren't really there. Microsoft \nA number of recent hires suggest that Tesla has an eye on the newly emerging field of augmented reality. \nThe Californian car giant has now hired two people straight out of Microsoft's augmented reality program, according to a report from Electrek on Thursday. \nThe most recent hire was reportedly Andrew Kim, senior designer for HoloLens & new devices at Microsoft. \nHe changed his LinkedIn profile this week to Lead Designer at Tesla's Designer Studio in Hawthorne. \nTesla has also hired Yekeun Jeong, a computer vision expert who previously worked on Microsoft HoloLens. He joined Tesla last year and works in the Tesla Vision department. \nIt's possible that Tesla is working on an augmented reality heads-up display for the Tesla Model 3 car, Electrek reports. It's also possible that Tesla wants AR to help with its retail strategy as it would allow people to see and engage with its fleet of cars in a new way. \nThe technology would be an obvious fit for Tesla, which is aiming to make its cars some of the most technologically advanced consumer vehicles in the world. The cars can already navigate themselves from A to B and they're considerably more efficient than the average vehicle on the road thanks in part to their electric batteries. \nWhat's more, Elon Musk, the company's CEO, is something of a futurist. The billionaire, who has a space transportation company called SpaceX, wants to make life \"multiplanetary\" and reduce the risk of human extinction. He also wants to mitigate global warming through another one of his companies, Solar City.",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Phone To Be ‘Ultimate Mobile Device’, According To Satya Nadella 12:08 pm By Roland Hutchinson \nWe have been hearing rumors about the new Microsoft Surface Phone for some time, the device is expected to be made official next year. \nMicrosoft’s CEO Satya Nadella recently spoke about Microsoft’s mobile plans and whilst he did not mention the Surface Phone by name, it is clear he was talking about the device. \n“We don’t want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That’s where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,” he said. “We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.” \nIf Microsoft use the same design strategy for the Microsoft Surface Phone as they did for their new Surface PC, they could end up with a popular smartphone.",

      "text": "Back in the day, well before you could waste hours online browsing around the web, Microsoft’s built-in Solitaire app on Windows was a game that was often in heavy rotation. If you remember those pre-Internet days fondly, or with absolute horror, you can relive it all with a new iOS and Android app from Microsoft that brings Solitaire and a number of other nostalgic-fueled games to your mobile device.\nDON’T MISS: Verizon has an incredible Black Friday Google Pixel deal\nAppropriately called the Microsoft Solitaire Collection, the new app is free to download and comes with five games that may come in handy as we approach the Thanksgiving holiday.\nMajor Nelson adds:\nMicrosoft Solitaire Collection offers five of the best Solitaire card games – Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Pyramid and Tripeaks – all in one app. The game also includes Daily Challenges, where you can play guaranteed solvable challenges every day in all five game modes with multiple levels of difficulty, while earning cool awards.\nPlus, with Xbox Live integration, you can sign in with your Xbox Live gamertag or Microsoft account to earn Xbox Live achievements and Gamerscore, compete with friends, and continue playing on any Windows 10, iPhone, iPad, or Android device while on the go since your progress and game data are saved in the cloud.\nThe included list of games reads as follows:\nKLONDIKE Timeless & Classic Solitaire. Clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw. Also try out Traditional or Vegas scoring!\nSPIDER Eight columns of cards await you. Clear them all with fewest moves possible. Play single suit or challenge yourself with four suits!\nFREECELL Be strategic and use the four extra cells to move cards around and try to clear all cards from the table. FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\nTRIPEAKS Select cards in a sequence, earn combo points, and clear as many boards as you can before you run out of deals!\nPYRAMID Combine two cards that add up to 13 to remove them from the board. Challenge yourself to reach the top of the Pyramid and clear as many boards as you can!\nYou can relive the 90s by downloading the app here for iOS and over here if you’re on Android .\nTrending right now:\nCyber Monday plans for Kohl’s, Sears, and Kmart revealed Watch the Almond 3 smart home router system murder your Wi-Fi dead spots A single miscalculation sent ESA’s Mars lander crashing into the Red Planet See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "title": "Microsoft cuts Lumia 950 XL price to £289 in the UK, including a free Display Dock",
      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 13 minutes ago with 3 comments \nJust over a year ago, Microsoft unveiled its Windows 10 Mobile flagships , listing the Lumia 950 at £499 in the UK, while the larger Lumia 950 XL was priced at £549. But it reduced the cost of both handsets before pre-orders had even opened , and it's been gradually cutting their prices ever since. \nIn September, it gave the Lumia 950 XL its third permanent price cut this year, reducing it to £339 SIM-free. Now, as part of its Black Friday promotions in the UK, its price has fallen again. \nMicrosoft has slashed an additional £50 off the Lumia 950 XL, bringing it down to just £289 . On top of that discount, it's also giving away a free Display Dock with the device, worth a further £79.99. The Display Dock supports Windows 10 Mobile's Continuum mode , allowing owners to use a mouse and keyboard with the phone when connected to a larger display. \nThe Lumia 950 XL's key specs include: 5.7-inch AMOLED with Quad HD (2560x1440px) resolution Octa-core 2.0GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor 3GB RAM 32GB onboard storage (plus microSD card slot) 20MP PureView rear camera with auto focus, 6-lens optics, triple-LED flash, optical image stabilization and 4K video recording at 30fps 5MP front-facing camera with wide-angle lens and 1080p video recording Bluetooth 4.1 Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac with Wi-Fi Direct support Qi wireless charging USB 3.1 port with Type-C connector 151.9 x 78.4 x 8.3mm; 165g \nThis latest deal on the Lumia 950 XL will remain available until November 28 - but over in the US, the Microsoft Store is making buyers an even better offer. Those who purchase the Lumia 950 XL for $499 will now get the smaller Lumia 950 (worth $399) free , including a free Display Dock worth $99.99.",

      "title": "Changing Font Case in Microsoft Word",
      "text": "Changing Font Case in Microsoft Word Bettinna Bech / EyeEm on Getty Images By Martin Hendrikx Updated June 16, 2015 . \nWhen you are working with text in Microsoft Office Word, you can easily toggle the case of your text using several methods. Today I will teach you a few different methods for toggling text case in Microsoft Office Word for Windows and Mac OSX. Font Case Variations \nThe first thing you need to do is select the text you want to toggle. The case toggling will have three different effects: ALL THE SELECTED TEXT WILL BE CAPITALIZED all the selected text will be capitalized All The First Letters Of The Selected Text Will Be Capitalized Toggle Case (will change the case of each letter to its counterpart) Toggling Font Case Formatting In Word 2007 or Earlier \nTo change the font case in Word 2007, follow these steps: Highlight the text you want to change Click on the \"Change Case\" button on the \"Home\" tab of the ribbon. (It is the button with a capital A and a lower case A: \"Aa\" in the font subsection) Toggling Font Case Formatting Using A Shortcut \nIf you prefer to use a shortcut to toggle the text case in your document, simply highlight the text you want to change and use the following shortcut: Shift + F3 . \ncontinue reading below our video Word Tutorial: Useful Keyboard Shortcuts \nThis shortcut will toggle through all the different case options as described earlier. Toggling Font Case Formatting on Word for Mac \nUnlike Microsoft Office Word for Windows, the shortcuts for formatting text in Word for Mac are a tad more complicated. The first step you will need to take is to select the text that you want to toggle. \nIf you are using Microsoft Office Word 2011 or earlier for Mac, you will need to use the \" Shift + F3 \" keyboard shortcut. If you try to use this keyboard shortcut for any newer version of Word for Mac, you will notice that the shortcut actually toggles \"Screen View\" instead of case font. \nIn the case of Word for Mac 2013, there are two commands you can use to replace the \"Shift + F3\" shortcut. Use \" Command + Option + C \" to switch between ALL LETTERS CAPITALIZED, all lower case, or First Letter Capitalized. Use \" Command + Shift + A \" to switch between ALL UPPER CASE and all lower case.",

      "text": "Microsoft Set To Win EU Approval for LinkedIn Buy Published by Slashdot on Fri, 25 Nov 2016 Microsoft is set to gain EU approval for its $26 billion buy of professional social network LinkedIn with tweaks to concessions aimed at addressing competition concerns, three people close to the matter said on Wednesday. From a report on Reuters: Microsoft last week told the European Commission that it would still allow LinkedIn's rivals access to its software such as its Outlook program and give hardware makers the option of installing competing professional social networks on computers after the acquisition. The second plank of the concession is important because of the company's battle with the EU competition authority over the last decade and the policy of tying its products to block rivals, resulting in fines of more than 2.2 billion euros.

      "text": "on Nov 25, 2016, 7:30 AM TechSpot \nMicrosoft boss Satya Nadella has given the strongest hint to date that the long-rumored Surface phone is in development. Speaking during an interview with the Australian Financial Review , the CEO talked about his company redefining the field with the “ultimate mobile device.” \nIt looked as if Microsoft was finally abandoning the smartphone market back in May when it sold the feature phone business it acquired from Nokia to Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile. A week later, the company announced plans to “streamline” its smartphone hardware business, which involved eliminating 1850 jobs and restructuring costs totaling $950 million. \nBut it appears this didn’t spell the end of Microsoft’s smartphone ambitions. Nadella said the company wasn’t interested in launching any technology that doesn’t introduce something new, and it would apply that mindset to smartphones. \n\"We don't want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is, what can we bring? That's where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,\" he said. \"We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today's market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.\" \nWith Microsoft’s other Surface products – the Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, and the recent Surface Studio – proving popular, it’s not a great surprise to find the brand making its way to smartphones. \nAlmost a year ago, Microsoft executive vice president and chief marketing officer Chris Capossela said the company was working on a “breakthrough” smartphone that would make Apple fans \"pause before they buy their 17th iPhone.” \nWith Windows Phones making up just 0.4 percent of the smartphone market in Q2 2016 , the company knows this is one area where it really struggles. While a Surface Phone may not threaten Samsung and Apple’s domination, you would expect an “ultimate mobile device” to do well. Related Reads",

      "title": "Xbox Project Scorpio Price: Phil Spencer Confirms It Will Cost More Than The One S",
      "text": "If you’ve been following the news about the next console from Microsoft , one thing has become glaringly obvious. The Xbox Project Scorpio price is going to be high. It won’t just be the most powerful console; it will also be the most expensive. And in a recent interview, Microsoft Xbox boss Phil Spencer confirmed that it will cost more than the One S, but he failed to elaborate further.\nImage Source: roadtovr.com Phil Spencer on the Xbox Project Scorpio price You probably already guessed that a console which offers 8 CPU cores, 6 Terraflops of power, True 4K gaming, VR, and 320 GB/s memory bandwidth, there would be a drawback. However, while the price may be high, those who feel the need to own a premium console have probably already decided to buy it in 12 months’ time.\nIn a recent interview with Levelup, Spencer reiterated that the Scorpio will be a “premium device.” He said:\n“Scorpio will be a premium console; It will cost more than [the Xbox One] S obviously. That’s how we’re building it. We haven’t announced price points for Scorpio yet, but I want to make sure that the investments we’re putting into the product of Scorpio meets the demands of the higher end customer, and that will be a higher price.”\nSo you can expect the Xbox Project Scorpio price to be more than that of the Xbox One S at $399 for the 2TB launch edition. However, this means that it will also be more expensive than the 1TB PlayStation 4 Pro at $399.99, which is a more powerful console than the One S. So what does this mean for the Xbox Project Scorpio price?\nHigh-end gaming at a premium price A spokesperson for Microsoft recently said the Scorpio would offer true 4K, high-end PC gaming in a console, and like a high-end gaming PC, its contents will be worth thousands of dollars.\nIn another conversation, Microsoft’s Aaron Greenberg described Scorpio as the “most powerful console anyone has ever seen.” So again, what does this mean for the Xbox Project Scorpio price? We think it’s likely to be the most expensive game console ever, and while this will take it to a price point beyond that of the One S and the PS4 Pro , it’s likely that this will be no more than $100 more, making the Xbox Project Scorpio price around $499.\nIs it worth the extra? Sony’s PS4 Pro will have had a head start, as Project Scorpio isn’t expected to come to market around this Christmas 2017. However, when it comes to 4K gaming, Scorpio will have the ability to render games like no other console.\nSaid to offer “true 4K gaming,” Greenberg talked about this at the Fanfest in Mexico City:\n“This will really bring the most powerful console you’ve ever seen. It will bring these really true 4K, really incredible visual games that we’ve never seen before on the console. People who have spent thousands of dollars on a high-end PC are getting that experience. How do we bring that to scale in a console in your living room? That’s a big part of what Project Scorpio is about.”\nWhile there has been no official talk of the Xbox Project Scorpio price, we believe that $499 is realistic, if not a little low, particularly for a home console which promises so much. We can’t see how Microsoft could manage to develop and retail a device without the extra cost. However, it wouldn’t be the first company to take a hit in the profit department to get a device out of the door. We’ll just have to wait and see what more is revealed during 2017.\nXbox family One final point that Phil Spencer touched on was that Scorpio will not replace the Xbox One S . Instead, it will join its less powerful sibling, creating an Xbox family of devices. Even so, it’s thought that the next Xbox will be backwards compatible, giving the owner of devices such as the One and 360 a means of keeping their existing game libraries.\nWith the Xbox Project Scorpio price now officially confirmed to be higher than that of the One S, the floodgates are open for speculation about how it could compete with the PS4 Pro ‘s price point. But as we’ve already said, we think it will cost around $100 more. And that is why Microsoft regularly touts it as a premium console; after all, devices labeled “premium” generally cost more.\nThe post Xbox Project Scorpio Price: Phil Spencer Confirms It Will Cost More Than The One S appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "Austin Krause | November 25, 2016 in How-To \nIt’s no secret that Microsoft is hungry for your data, and Windows 10 is its best tool for collecting it. While Windows 10 does give you a few privacy options during installation, there are reports of Cortana and the built-in Windows search acting as keyloggers which send all of your information to Microsoft. Today I’m going to show you a tool called Spybot Anti-Beacon designed to keep Microsoft from looking over your shoulder while you use your computer. It will automatically take care of or otherwise block the majority of the ways Microsoft keeps tabs on you while using Windows 10. If you’re using Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, this tool is also capable of blocking Telemetry tracking there as well. \nYou can get Spybot Anti-Beacon for free from their website. \nThe first thing I noticed is that during setup of Spybot Anti-Beacon there is an option to “refresh immunization” every time   reboots. This is an important feature because Microsoft has been known to undo some of the privacy protections users have put in place whenever a major update is pushed through to Windows 10. I haven’t had Spybot Anti-Beacon installed long enough to confirm this works, but assuming it does it is a nice touch for a free software tool. \nOnce Spybot Anti-Beacon is installed you are taken to the main tab of the program window. It shows all of the primary protection tweaks that you can make to Windows 10. These include blocks for the Telemetry Host file, Telemetry Services, group policies that disable Telemetry, disabling of the Customer Improvement Program group policy, disables AIT in group policy, disables Step Recorder in group policy, WiFi sense, App advertising ID , and external network P2P windows updates. \nAll of these Windows policies can be tweaked to protect your privacy in one easy click. Just click Immunize and it will block them all. While I don’t think “Immunize” is quite the correct term to describe what Spybot Anti-Beacon does, it hopefully gets the point across that it’s removing the equivalent to built-in Microsoft spyware. And of course, if you only want to block certain services and group policies there is a “Show Options” button that gives more details on what every section entails and allows you to deselect areas that you don’t want to block. \nBe sure to also check out the Optional tab. While arguably not as important, I personally blocked the majority of the items listed there, leaving out only Bing’s IP because I do use it for Bsearch rewards . However, if you don’t use Bing, block that too! One thing that surprised me was that Spybot Anti-Beacon provides some group policy and task edits for Microsoft Office 2013 and 2016. Just in case you weren’t aware, Microsoft Office also sends data on you back to Microsoft. \nThat’s it. No extra gimmicks or frills and the remaining tabs are for logs, questions, and developer credits. Spybot Anti-Beacon is a simple program designed to automatically do several Windows 10 privacy fixes that could otherwise be done manually. The best feature of the program is that it will reproduce these changes automatically, but you’ll have to keep the program up to date as Microsoft is always changing where they hide the Telemetry options in Windows 10.",

      "text": "Ukraine Is Using Microsoft's Hololens to 'See' Through Its Tanks \nThe headsets will allow drivers to see as if their tanks were made of glass. Most Popular By Kyle Mizokami Nov 3, 2016 In the latest example of consumer technology adapted for military applications, Microsoft's Hololens is being put to work to allow tank crews to \"see\" through the walls of their vehicles. The result will be greater situational awareness for tank crews, allowing them to fight more effectively. Tanks and armored vehicles traditionally have poor situational awareness, for obvious reasons. Crews are trapped inside a moving fortress of steel, aluminum, and ceramic composite often several inches thick, with a limited view of the outside world. Vision slits and periscopes allow some view of the outside, but to really get a good look around, crews need to a hatch and expose themselves to enemy tank fire, snipers, and artillery. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Now a Ukrainian Company Limpid Armor is using the Hololens to give armor vehicle crews a better idea of their surroundings in combat. Taking a cue from the Joint Strike Fighter's Distributed Aperture System (DAS), the technology will give crews a 360-degree view of their environment without compromising their safety. DAS uses a system of infra-red cameras installed on the fighter's fuselage looking in all directions—even straight down. The cameras are linked to the pilot's helmet, allowing the wearer to \"see\" in all directions without turning his or her head. Most Popular The Ukrainian version uses a series of cameras installed on the outside of an armored vehicle that are then fed into the Hololens. The Hololens can also project information over the video feed, noting mission objectives, enemy vehicles, and other critical information. Via Limpid Armor's Facebook page. Another technology originally invented for fighter planes but included in Limpid's headset is helmet mounted cueing , which allows the user to \"look, lock, and launch\" against enemy targets. Presumably this will involve a vehicle mounted gun slaved to the helmet, or anti-tank or anti-aircraft guided missiles. The Ukrainian system isn't the first \"mixed reality\" system for armored vehicles. Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems recently introduced its \" Iron Vision \" system. Iron Vision, however, does not appear rooted in consumer technology. From an armored vehicle crew perspective this is a revolutionary technology. For a hundred years tankers have stared at the armored walls of their vehicles from the inside, wondering what they could see if they could just see through them. Now vehicle crews can, using tanks and infantry fighting vehicles as though the walls weren't even there. Here's Elbit's promotion video touting the Iron Vision system: Read Next: ",

      "title": "Office apps get Box integration, improved accessibility and more on Android",
      "text": "\nEarlier this month, Microsoft released a pretty major update for the Office apps on Android to Office Insiders. Today, the company has started rolling out the update to all Android users. The update introduces a couple of new features to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Firstly, the update brings improved accessibility features to all of the Office apps — Microsoft says the company has improved “support for TalkBack, your keyboard, and other assistive technology when you’re creating, editing or presenting your docs.” Here’s a breakdown of the other new features from our previous article when the update was available to Insiders:\nMicrosoft is adding integration for Box which will allow Box users to be able to edit Office files such as a PowerPoint presentation right from their Box account on PowerPoint. In addition to Box, Microsoft is also bringing integration for Egnyte and Weiyun.\nThere’s also a neat new feature for Excel which now allows users to transform geographical data on their Excel spreadsheets into rich maps. Additionally, the update also brings notifications for shared file which means you will now get notified whenever someone shares an Office document with you. And lastly, the update introduces improved hyperlinks on Excel which now lets users set a text for hyperlink rather than showing the full link.\nKeep in mind that these features are only available to Office Insiders, but these features will likely roll out to the public once they are polished and ready to be used by everyone. If you are interested, you can get the latest update for Word here, Excel here, and PowerPoint here. ",

      "title": "Tech Today: Large-Cap Tech Rising, Black Friday Deal Making, Microsoft in Mobile",
      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Here are some things going on today in your world of tech :\nWelcome back from your holiday feast, for those in the United States. Shares of large-cap tech are mostly trading higher, with Amazon ( AMZN ) up $5.62, or 0.7%, at $785.74, in early trading; Alphabet ( GOOGL ) up $2.50, or 0.3%, at $781.50; Intel ( INTC ) up 9 cents at $35.29; and Facebook ( FB ) up 25 cents at $121.09. Notable laggards in early trading are down 6 cents at $111.17; and IBM ( IBM ) is down 19 cents at $161.79.\nBlack Friday selling mania is in full effect, and MarketWatch ’s Barbara Kollmeyer reports that an early start to deals drove a 13.6% increase, year over year, in online electronics sales, as “U.S. shoppers hit their mobile devices and laptops to shop on Thanksgiving Day, racking up sales of over $1.15 billion.”\nSpeaking of deals, Apple has unveiled its Black Friday discounts, which aren’t really discounts but rather offers of gift cards to buy more stuff from Apple when you buy select products. Reflecting on this, Brian White with Drexel Hamilton reiterates a Buy rating on the stock, and a $185 price target, writing that the company “remains one of the best positioned tech companies to benefit from spending trends this holiday season with a well-received iPhone 7/7 Plus, a new Apple Watch and a new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.”\nIn just 72 hours, of course, it’ll be time for Cyber Monday , for which Amazon has not yet unveiled its own deals, but rather teases you to come back and check out the page at the start of next week .\nAmong research items today, an interesting tidbit on the mobile market comes from Richard Windsor , who used to be a big brokerage-house analyst then parted to do his own thing. This morning he offers up his daily analysis of tech, in this cases assessing Microsoft ’s next act in mobile phones . \nSadly, it seems the next act may be as bad as the recent ones. Windsor expects Microsoft to a “Surface Phone,” to complement devices like its Surface Studio computer. But while Studio and other tools are “best in class,” to lure Apple and Google Android users, “Microsoft will have to make its Digital Life offering utterly compelling to convince even these users to move their Digital Lives to Microsoft, and in that regard I see nothing but neglect and malaise.”",

      "title": "Users hate the new Windows 10 Photos App, want to restore the old version",
      "text": "0 0 \nLast week, Microsoft completely revamped its Windows 10 Photos App . Users can now draw directly on pictures with various tools, customize their photos to their liking, or save doodles and apply them directly to another photo later on. \nThe Redmond giant also changed the app’s user interface. More specifically, the Photos App UI has a new coat of paint, but also a new image and a fresh aspect that screams “clean”. \nDespite Microsoft’s best intentions and efforts, users hate the new Windows 10 Photos App . And this is no exaggeration. Many consider that the new app is actually a downgraded version, and don’t agree with Microsoft’s decision to remove a series of useful features. Windows 10 users don’t get along with the new Photos App \nUsers complain that the new Windows 10 Photos App is much more limited. A series of features, such as brightness, contrast, highlights, shadows, color boost, selective focus and others have disappeared. Users are puzzled and can’t understand the logic behind Microsoft’s decision. Since when is massively reducing functionality an upgrade? \nThe old Photos app was very easy to use, very intuitive, and most importantly, users had got used to it. Microsoft should have never done such a major change all of a sudden. If the company had chosen to gradually deploy these changes, maybe the users’ feedback wouldn’t have been so fierce. \nPut it back and stop fixing stuff that doesn’t need fixed!!! This is ridiculous. At least let us CHOOSE whether to update or not, but don’t just change stuff. It sucks. It’s terrible. I hate it. \nPhotos App users also say that they had more control over their editing in the previous version. Many are tired of Microsoft’s experiments and already decided to use other photo editing tools , such as Photoshop . How to restore the old Windows 10 Photos App \nYou can undo unwanted system changes by reverting your computer to a previous restore point . In other words, you can roll back the update for the Photos App, provided that you had enabled a restore point on your machine. \nMicrosoft has yet to issue any comments on this situation. However, we’re sure that somebody must be reading the comments from this forum thread . Keep on putting pressure on Microsoft and we may have the old Photos App back! \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",
