      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nIn the middle of their busiest time of the year — Cyber Monday is just hours away — Amazon has been busy on internal fronts, too. After dumping incentivized reviews , the retail giant is going to start capping the number of product reviews any customer can submit in a given week. According to The Digital Reader , an email went out to Amazon’s more enthusiastic reviewers telling them of this change. \nBasically, you can review any product at any time if you bought it from Amazon. However, if it’s a non-Amazon Verified Purchase, there’s a limit. In GeekWire , an Amazon rep confirmed the changes. \nMore: Mobile shopping continues to make an impact on Thanksgiving and Black Friday \n“Customers can now only submit a limited number of non-Amazon Verified Purchase reviews a week. The limit is five and the count is calculated from Sunday at 12:00 a.m. UTC through Saturday 11:59 p.m. UTC. Customers’ ability to submit Amazon Verified Purchase reviews will not be impacted. This policy also does not apply to Vine reviews or reviews on digital and physical books, music, and video.” \nYou can read the Community Guidelines here . The Digital Reader notes that the Amazon review structure has been under fire as the company reportedly squashed negative reviews and ratings for Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new book , “politically motivated commentary submitted by people who hadn’t been verified to have purchased the book.” This new system would not have had an effect on those reviews, given that it doesn’t apply to books. \nThese are critical moves for Amazon to make. Given their stature in the online marketplace and the global economy in general, it’s essential for Amazon to have a solid bond of trust with their user base, and it goes the other way, too. End users need to be able to trust the Amazon is giving them the straight scoop, and Amazon needs to be sure that they’re getting the straight scoop from reviewers. Anything less does a disservice to everyone involved. ",

      "text": " 00 a.m. \nAmazon flooded with negative reviews of Megyn Kelly’s memoir \nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump’s have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports hundreds of negative reviews of Kelly’s “Settle For More” have appeared on the online retail giant’s site since its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book’s publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the “hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book” and brought them to the attention of Amazon. \nAmazon didn’t immediately respond to a request to comment. \nH.G. Wells ghost story published for 1st time \nNEW YORK \nHere’s an odd story, from long ago: A man by the name of Meredith has converted a room in his house to a cluttered, dirty study. Meredith has a taste for Scotch whisky and one day asks a visiting friend, the story’s narrator, if he doesn’t notice something odd about the ceiling. \n“Don’t you see it?” he said. \n“See what?” \n“I shook my head and looked at him.” \n“All right then,” he said abruptly. “Don’t see it!” \nThis brief hybrid of ghost tale and detective story is called “The Haunted Ceiling” and its author is H.G. Wells, later known for such science-fiction classics as “The Invisible Man” and “The Time Machine.” He apparently wrote “The Haunted Ceiling” in the mid-1890s, when he was around 30, and left it unseen by others. It debuted last week, more than a century later. \n“The Haunted Ceiling” is so obscure that two Wells scholars, Patrick Parrinder and Michael Sherborne, said they had never seen it before. Judging from the style and content, they guessed it dated to around 1895, when ghost stories were popular and Wells was both prolific and in need of money. \nAssociated Press",

      "text": "  Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos. (AFP/File) \nGlobal online retailer Amazon.com is reportedly in talks to purchase Dubai-based e-commerce platform Souq.com in a deal valued at $1bn, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. \nAmazon is mulling a bid to acquire the entire site, but no final agreement has been reached so far, unnamed sources told Bloomberg . \nIt was previously reported that Souq was seeking a buyer for a 30 per cent stake to support its regional expansion plans. \nSpeaking earlier this month to reporters, Souq co-founder and CEO Ronaldo Mouchawar confirmed that the company had hired investment bank Goldman Sachs to assist in its growth but disclosed few other details. \n“It’s just looking at what other options we have as a company as we grow.” \nThe company had grown 30 to 40 per cent year-on-year across its footprint covering the Gulf countries and Egypt and 50 per cent in Saudi Arabia, he said. \nHowever, Mouchawar suggested a listing was some way off. \n“We’re not there yet, we have work to do.” Mouchawar added. \nIn February, Souq.com announced it had raised more than Dhs1bn ($275m) in funding from existing investors Tiger Global Management and Naspers, new entrants Standard Chartered Private Equity, World Bank member IFC, Baillie Gifford and several regional and tech-focused financial institutions. \nThe round is believed to have made the company the Middle East’s first unicorn – a start-up company valued at more than $1bn.",

Coats and jackets are up to 75 percent off regular prices, making the inevitable coming of winter easier to swallow. \nFrom double-breasted coats for men to plush parkas for women , there's tins to choose from and the majority of it is Prime-eligible. There's a pretty solid collection for kids too, and it even includes skiwear, so you may as well stock up while the prices are low (before the temperatures get lower).",

      "text": "This is your holiday season reminder that Amazon doesn’t always have the lowest prices A few extra minutes can save you a few bucks. AFP / Getty Amazon’s prices are often great. But they are not always the best. That’s a worthwhile reminder this time of year considering tens of millions of you are Amazon Prime members , which makes you less likely to compare prices before buying on Amazon. But you should. Case in point: leading up to the holiday season, Google’s price comparison site showed better prices than Amazon on nearly 60 percent of Amazon best sellers, according to the pricing firm 360pi . \n  In the lead-up to the holiday rush, some other online retailers showed signs they were going to be much more aggressive this year in matching or beating Amazon on prices. Walmart, as an example, was beating Amazon on 20 percent of top-selling toys that both retailers were selling. Walmart also matched Amazon’s price on another 35 percent of these goods. Over at Jet.com , now owned by Walmart, you could find better prices on 46 percent of top-selling toys that both sites carried. Amazon is often still the best option, either because its price is the lowest or customers value its unbeatable selection and steady reliability this time of year over anything else. But spending a few minutes checking prices elsewhere can sometimes save you money. recode_divider More From Recode",

      "text": "November 27, 2016 \nIf there are two things we love here at Hackaday, it’s games and automating mundane tasks by adding a lot of electronics and voice control. A game room is, therefore, the perfect sandbox for projects that get us excited in all of the right ways. Liberty Games, a UK-based games room company, already had a really impressive game room (as you might expect). They’ve just posted an awesome build log showcasing how they went about automating mundane game room tasks by adding a lot of electronics and voice control. \nThere were four tasks that Liberty Games wanted to be able to complete with voice control: releasing billiards balls on their pool table, adding credits to an arcade machine, releasing pinballs on a pinball machine, and control of a CD jukebox. For all of these tasks, they used an Amazon Echo, which already has built-in support for adding new “skills” (Amazon’s term for user-created Alexa commands). These skills allow the Echo to communicate with other devices using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). \nIn this case, those “other devices” were Raspberry Pis for everything except the jukebox, which was controlled with a Logitech Harmony Hub. The physical connection between each Raspberry Pi and its corresponding game was accomplished in the way you’d expect – simply triggering the coin-op mechanism on each machine. The jukebox is controlled normally by IR remote, so using a Harmony Hub to take over as the remote was a simple matter (and would make it easy to control additional devices, like a TV). \nThe result is an already awesome game room, made more awesome by the addition of voice control. No longer is it necessary to strain your back by bending over to drop a coin in, or to spend hours searching for the jukebox remote (your dog probably ate it). The chiropractor bills alone should pay for all of the electronics! Of course, there really is no limit to what you can control with an Echo once you’ve acquainted yourself with Alexa Skills Kit (ASK) . Maybe a voice controlled blender? That sounds useful to us! ",

      "text": "Seattle Times staff The Seattle Times \nTUESDAY: Amazon Web Services’ mammoth annual conference, re: Invent, begins in Las Vegas. At the three-day event, AWS CEO Andy Jassy and others will lay out plans for growing the $12 billion unit that generates much of Amazon’s profit. Several of the key presentations will be streamed. \nS&P/Case-Shiller will release its monthly index comparing home-price increases in cities across the country for September. Seattle has been closing in on Portland for the city with the fastest-rising prices. \nWEDNESDAY: Microsoft holds its annual shareholders meeting at the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue. The company is likely to tout the success of its move toward selling web-based business software services, which recently has pushed its shares to record highs. Scheduled votes include a shareholder proposal to broaden the ability of shareholders to nominate and vote for directors, and a largely symbolic vote on executive compensation. \nThe Federal Reserve releases its monthly ‘Beige Book’ survey of economic conditions across the nation. Its October report found economic growth had picked up a bit as fall began, supported by modest hiring, an uptick in consumer spending and steady homebuilding. Further evidence of improvement could encourage the Fed to lift interest rates in December. Most Read Stories",

      "text": "Excursion to the Amazon - Talent, OR \nTalent, OR \n\nAfter brekkie a tour bus took us 3 hours downriver to a boat town where we boated to a large island with cacao plantations. The farmer gave us a long presentation on how chocolate pods grow. He cut one open for us to suck on the inner bean covering, sweet white sticky substance. Then we boated across the Amazon to a sandy beach where we swam. Then back in the boat to the bus which took us to a village where the farmer's wife Maria runs a restaurant in their home. The meal was huge and delicious: a traditional Peruvian meal of small slice corn cob, yucca, sweet potato, roasted hominy, pintos, sauce, rice, chicken and egg cooked in a leaf. Place mats were banana leaves. Cacao drink. Then she making chocolate candy. She roasted cacao beans over a wood fire, then rolled them on a surface to remove the skins, then hand ground them and added honey, ginger, monkey brains nuts, coffee for delicious candies. We bought several candies and pure cacao bars.\n",

NEW YORK — Black Friday sales are still going on, but Amazon has unveiled some of its deals for Cyber Monday. \nThe online retailer will roll out more than 75,000 sales starting Monday and throughout the week on a variety of products, including toys, electronics, video games and books. \nWhile electronics tend to be big sellers on Cyber Monday, Amazon said that so far this holiday season, the “most-watched deal” has been the Mermaid Tail Blanket. \nRelated: America shops: Black Friday 2016 is here \nAmazon’s own products will also be on sale on Monday: The voice-controlled Echo speaker will be priced at $139.99 and the Tap Bluetooth speaker will be $89.99.

      "text": "Amazon might be treating themselves to their own Black Weekend treat, by purchasing the Middle East's local e-commerce giant Souq.com for a cool $1 Billion. This is only a rumour at this point, but it's long been suspected the company have been looking to move into the Middle Eastern market for a while now. And with The Grand Tour's release this year, we're surprised Amazon boss Jeff Bezos actually has that much money left to play with. [Jeff Bezos] The reports come from Bloomberg, which is suggesting that the company might spend up to $1 billion on the site. Neither party is talking about the deal, but it would fit with Amazon's suspected plans to gain a foothold across Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. So we'd say an acquisition of the company is rather likely. Amazon is going from strength to strength, using its Prime OTT service to attract millions of viewers to shows such as The Grand Tour, as well as providing sales services and banging Black Friday deals on devices such as the Kindle Fire. Even Netflix is struggling to keep up with the vastly expanding company, with rumours of a merger with Disney coming to the fore over recent months. It's been a crazy 2016, but we're pretty sure all bets are off for OTT services next year, but go on Bezos. You know you want to. ",
