      "text": "Wed, 07 Dec 2016 17:04 UTC Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube have joined forces to fight the spread of terrorist propaganda online. Together they say they will create a \"digital fingerprints\" database of terror-linked content that also respects privacy and freedom of speech . \"Our companies will begin sharing hashes of the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services - content most likely to violate all of our respective companies' content policies,\" the tech giants' statement reads. The database the four giants are going to launch is similar to a technology that Google has been using to scan for pictures involving child abuse . Its automatic image search compares \"hashes\" of images ‒ a unique code created by running an image through a simple algorithm ‒ that is then compared to a database of hashes produced by known images of child abuse. Similar technologies are also used to identify copyright-protected files. Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are essentially going to be doing the same. \"Starting today, we commit to the creation of a shared industry database of 'hashes' - unique digital 'fingerprints' - for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images that we have removed from our services,\" the companies said. Once a company detects prohibited content, it will independently determine what image and video it wants add to the database. Anticipating outcries of privacy concerns, Facebook assured that \"no personally identifiable information\" will be shared between the companies and that posts matching the \"fingerprints\" won't be immediately removed. Comment: Which is hilarious, given that these companies already have close to zero respect for privacy... \"Each company will continue to apply its own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content when a match to a shared hash is found,\" the companies said, stressing that they are \"committed\" to protecting privacy and freedom of speech. It will also be an individual decision in each company's case, whether or not they apply practices of transparency and how to deal with any government requests. Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are just starting to set up their database, but they hope that as they uncover new terrorist images, more companies will join. Comment: Positive: if terrorists don't have a venue to share their propaganda, their propaganda has little effect on the people it is designed for. Negative: the propaganda has little effect on the people it is designed to target, which will make certain folks in the intel communities a bit peeved, because they rely on it as much as the \"terrorists\" do.",

      "text": "How to select the best DBMS software: A buyer's guide A collection of articles that takes you from defining technology needs to purchasing options Microsoft SQL Server 2016 relational DBMS overview by Craig S. Mullins Mullins Consulting Microsoft SQL Server 2016 for Windows comes in four editions, with updates that include a new stretch database feature, Polybase, dynamic data masking and more. FROM THE BUYER'S GUIDE: Buyer's Guide Section you're in: The top DBMS products More articles from this section: Share this item with your network: Sponsored News Technical White Paper: Microsoft SQL Server 2016 In-Memory OLTP –Microsoft \nMicrosoft SQL Server 2016 is a relational database management system (DBMS) for Windows platforms that can be used for building, deploying and managing applications located on premises or in the cloud. \nThe latest version, SQL Server 2016 , was released in June 2016. It provides a bevy of new and improved capabilities, including: A new stretch database feature, which can be used to store some data on premises and send infrequently used data to Microsoft's Azure cloud . Applications can access all data, regardless of where it's stored. The Always Encrypted feature makes it possible to encrypt data at rest and in memory at the column level. Polybase, which integrates SQL Server with Hadoop's Distributed File System and enables Hadoop data to be queried with SQL and joined with native relational data. In-database advanced analytics provides the capability to incorporate the R programming language into SQL Server applications by wrapping it in stored procedures. Dynamic data masking can be used to obfuscate data, protecting actual data values from unauthorized personnel for regulatory and compliance purposes. Support for temporal data enables automatic tracking of historical changes to data over time. \nOther features include built-in JavaScript Object Notation support, as well as improvements to Microsoft's Hekaton in-memory capabilities. This latest version also provides a new storage format, row-level security and Transact-SQL improvements for memory-optimized tables. SQL Server 2016 offerings \nThere are four main editions of SQL Server 2016 relational DBMS: Enterprise is for mission-critical applications, advanced analytics and data warehousing/business intelligence workloads. This edition is configured to provide high performance and availability for your most important applications. It supports an unlimited number of cores, and memory usage is constrained by only the operating system. Standard is for core database capabilities, reporting and analytics. Compute capacity can't exceed 24 cores; maximum memory usage is 128 GB per instance. Developer is designed for application development purposes (as opposed to production database usage). Its core and memory support is the same as for the Enterprise edition. Express is a free edition geared primarily for learning and basic introductory usage. Express edition uses the same database engine and offers compatibility with the main SQL Server editions, but it limits database size to a maximum of 10 GB running on no more than four cores and 1 GB of memory. \nMicrosoft SQL Server 2016 relational DBMS runs on Windows only and supports numerous versions . Microsoft has committed to porting SQL Server to Linux in the near future. Microsoft SQL Server 2016 licensing \nSQL Server 2016 software licenses are sold through: Online retailers, which offer full-packaged product licenses of SQL Server software; OEMs, which offer preinstalled licenses with their hardware systems; and Licensing solutions partners and enterprise software advisors, which offer SQL Server software through Microsoft Volume Licensing programs for end-customer organizations. \nThere are two main licensing options for SQL Server 2016: Server + CAL , which enables customers to license users and devices at a lower cost, adding to their SQL Server deployment as needed; or Per Core , which offers a more precise and consistent measure of computing power, regardless of whether SQL Server is deployed virtually, on physical servers, on premises or in the cloud. \nContact Microsoft for specific pricing. \nA free, full-featured trial version of SQL Server 2016 is available for 180 days. Microsoft offers Premier Mission Critical Support for SQL Server 2016 that's based on an organization's specific usage and requirements. Data types supported \nIn addition to the standard numeric, character and date/time data types supported by all relational DBMSes, Microsoft SQL Server 2016 supports money, XML and variable binary data types, as well as user-defined types. Support for system-versioned temporal data was added in the latest version. Benchmarks \nSQL Server 2016 holds the world record for TPC-H on Lenovo hardware, as well as an impressive 100 TB analytics study running on four Intel Xeon E7 processors. Microsoft regularly updates benchmarking details for SQL Server 2016. Next Steps",

      "title": "‘It’s fun!’ Microsoft vet Bob Muglia speaks out on competing with Amazon, his first CEO post, and his stint in Redmond",
      "text": "Bob Muglia at re:Invent 2016, Las Vegas. (GeekWire Photo / Dan Richman) It takes a certain amount of courage to compete with public-cloud giant Amazon Web Services — especially when your own product runs exclusively on AWS. But that isn’t fazing Bob Muglia, a 23-year Microsoft vet who in June 2014 stepped into his first C-suite job as CEO of data warehouse-maker Snowflake .\n“We compete and we’re good partners at the same time,” Muglia said. “Don’t forget, AWS sells compute and storage time whether someone’s running Redshift (its own data warehouse) or Snowflake, so our success is their success, to some extent.”\nMuglia, now 53, shared his candid views on that relationship, on Azure’s shortcomings and on what drove him to leave Microsoft during a one-on-one interview with GeekWire at AWS’s re:Invent user conference in Las Vegas.\nCoopetition with Amazon Web Services Snowflake, a San Mateo, Calif., startup founded in August 2012, makes a data warehouse that competes directly with AWS’s Redshift. Data warehouses keep copies of structured data (in rows and tables, such as relational databases) or, in some cases, semi-structured data (JSON files, logs, mobile-device output and Internet-of-Things sensor output) and analyze it to reveal unsuspected connections and patterns. They’re old technology, at least as offered by companies including Oracle, Neteeza, Teradata and Vertica, in Muglia’s view.\n“Our approach is different from those and from Redshift, which is built using the architecture all the others also use, called ‘ shared nothing ,'” Muglia said. “They all involve a set of compute nodes closely coupled to data, working together as a cluster. But for any cluster, you will eventually run out of capacity, and adding new clusters requires creating new ones, copying and data and managing it. It’s very difficult for companies to do that.”\nSnowflake, in contrast, scales easily, he said. It uses AWS’s S3 as its sole storage mechanism and has a three-layer architecture: storage on the bottom, compute in the middle and service (management) on top.\n“When a Snowflake cluster runs out of capacity, we can instantiate another cluster right next to it, accessing the same data at the same time, and basically continue to scale,” Muglia said. Conventional data warehouses “can’t be turned into what we’ve created, which we call multi-cluster shared-data architecture.” Snowflake also allows running relational queries and updates on stored data, a feature missing from many open-source competitors, he said. And its ability to process semi-structured data is a feature most data warehouses omit.\nSnowflake runs only an AWS, Muglia said, because “S3 is such a sophisticated service. Azure’s blob storage is not as sophisticated, so it would be a technical challenge to run on Azure. This is one of the areas where Amazon is just ahead.”\nMuglia didn’t hesitate to bash Azure, in the process taking a swipe at himself.\n“We obviously compete with the cloud vendors, for example with companies that were using (Microsoft’s) SQL Server (relational database) and are looking at Redshift, Azure, Snowflake,” he said. “When we have those (as competitors), we tend to do very well, because Azure’s products are very deficient, particularly Azure Data Warehouse. Redshift is a much better product, which I can tell you because (Azure Data Warehouse) is technology based on technology that was built by my team.”\nAWS “has done a great job of supporting us,” Muglia said. “We’re very happy with them. They helped sponsor our recent tour of 10 cities. Their sales reps come out on our sales calls under a program Amazon has put in place. But we compete for customers. We talk about our benefits and they talk about theirs.”\nThe data warehouse market is worth fighting for. For conventional products alone, IDC values it at $14-$15 billion, “but the cloud data warehouse market will be much bigger, because the cloud will be larger and you can do a lot more in the cloud,” Muglia said. “All the legacy-technology (end-user) companies will move to the cloud eventually. ”\nMicrosoft ‘missed the shift in the industry’ For 23 years, through 2011, Muglia labored in the engineering arm of Microsoft, at various times building SQL Server, running developer operations, the server group and Office, then running Windows and the entire server and tools business. In the 2000s, the early days of open-source software, “I got to feeling there was a lot more we should be doing with the open-source ecosystem, but Steve (Ballmer, then CEO) was well-quoted as calling it cancer,” Muglia recalled. “Microsoft had a policy that was very protective of its intellectual property, and I always felt that was very detrimental, because we weren’t participating in the ecosystem.\n“And Steve was, like, ‘No, we need to hang onto this, because Linux will be competing with Windows.’ It almost got to the point where we were making threats that people who were using open source needed to license it. And I was just, like, ‘This is broken.'”\nBallmer and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates “were in sync on this,” Muglia said. “But the world changed and they hadn’t. They were operating in the business model of the 1980s, not the model of the 2000s. It’s true that by retaining that intellectual property, Microsoft has a $3-billion patent-royalty business right now. Whoop-de-doo. That’s not going to move the mark, yet they missed the shift in the industry because of it.”\nUnder current CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft “is positioned to do much better, because one of the first things he did is reverse policies,” Muglia continued.\nBut by the time Nadella was appointed CEO, in February 2014, Muglia had left for Juniper Networks, where he ran the software group. Flat growth, budget cuts and quarter after quarter of layoffs proved discouraging, so he began searching for something new.\nAvoiding the daily ‘BS’ “My time at Juniper helped me see that the transition to the cloud was going to be a major tidal-wave disruption and that the companies I call old technology — HP, Dell, Symantec, SAP, Cisco, Oracle — were going to struggle as a result,” he said. “I realized that most of the innovation was happening in smaller companies. And for the remainder of my career, I wanted to build something that matters. I was looking for a big market, a major disruption, something cloud focused. And I love databases. I heard about Snowflake through Sutter Hill, an early investor and builder of the company. When I heard what they’re doing technically, I recognized it could really work. So essentially, I was hired by the founders of Snowflake.”\nWhat’s it like being a CEO for the first time?\n“It’s fun!” Muglia said. “People say it’s a huge amount of work to lead a startup, and it’s true. But it’s rewarding because it makes a difference. At Microsoft or Juniper, a large percentage of what I did every day was BS — just stuff you had to do to make the business go forward, just overhead. There’s no overhead at Snowflake. Everything you do is focused on helping the team to grow, or improving the product, the sales process, the marketing.”\nHis biggest challenge, he said, is “scaling, scaling, scaling. In particular, hiring engineers is one of my top challenges.”\nTo that end, Snowflake is looking to open a Seattle office with 10-15 people initially, because “it’s a very strong market for systems talent, with the history of Microsoft and Amazon.” The search for real estate in Seattle is set to begin immediately, he said. “I hope to grow it to be a a material office over time.”\nFor now, Muglia is commuting between Seattle, where he and his wife own a Mercer Island house, and San Mateo, where they own a condo. “My driver’s license is issued by California and my wife’s is from Washington,” he said.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft in 2014 added the capability for users to search with Bing merely by entering in emojis into the search box, now the firm appears to be expanding that capability somewhat.\nSome users of Bing have now been able to type in an emoji description into the search engine and then receive not only a description of an emoji, but related emoji and be offered the option to copy that emoji for personal use in heated twitter debates or what have you.\nGallery To be clear, this feature seems to be limited to certain accounts (and regions we’d wager). I haven’t been able to trigger it on my own account despite changing the region to Microsoft’s favoured USA but another member of the MSPU staff in the same region has had it work for him, we have reached out to Microsoft to comment on this and will update this if necessary.\nBing’s status as “not Google” has been detrimental to it in the past. Despite Microsoft’s best efforts, the search engine has settled at a 20% share in the market and still remains the butt of many jibes and japes online. Along with a series of quizzes and more, Microsoft seems to be trying to push Bing as the more interactive search engine in comparison to Google – even tying it to Cortana to force Windows 10 users who use the personal assistant to use Bing by extension. With Microsoft adding more and more features to Bing, they may still be able to carve out a small but loyal piece of the market.\nWhat do you think of this new feature? Let us know in the comments below.\n",

      "text": "Google and Slack deepen partnership in the face of Microsoft Teams The move will bring deeper integration between Google Drive and Slack U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Dec 7, 2016 9:00 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Martyn Williams Review: Skype for Business pros & cons (video) \nSlack and Google have vastly deepened their partnership roughly a month after Microsoft announced its competitor to the popular enterprise chat service. \nWednesday saw the announcement of several new features aimed at making G Suite, Google’s set of productivity software and services, more useful to people who use Slack. The functionality resulting from the partnership will make it easier to share and work on files stored in Google Drive using Slack. \nSlack and Google were early partners during the lifecycle of the chat service which gives business users a set of rooms where they can discuss work, share files and more. Microsoft recently announced Teams , a similar service integrated into Office 365 that’s currently in beta. MORE ON NETWORK WORLD: 3D printing will transform these five industries \nA representative for Slack said via email that Microsoft’s introduction of a competitive product that is expected to become generally available next year didn’t have an impact on the company’s decision to deepen its integration with Google. \nBut one way or another, the partnership has clear benefits for both companies. Slack becomes more useful for G Suite users, and Google gets to make its productivity suite a more attractive offering to those organizations that want to use Slack. \nIn a thoroughly modern turn, Google is building a Drive Bot, which will inform users about changes to a file, and let them approve, reject and settle comments in Slack, rather than opening Google Docs. It goes along with Slack’s continuing embrace of bots as a key part of the chat service’s vision of productivity. \nWhen users share a file from Drive in Slack, the chat service will check the sharing permissions on the file and make sure that it’s set up so that everyone in a channel can access what’s being shared. If the settings don’t match, users will be asked to modify them. \nTo go along with that, users will be able to associate Team Drive folders with particular Slack channels. That means the Marketing folder for members of the marketing team inside a company can also be linked to the team’s Slack channel. \nWhen users upload files to a Slack channel with a linked Team Drive, the files will be backed up inside Google’s cloud storage service. When Team Drive files get changed, users will be notified using Slack. \nIn addition, Google and Slack are working together to give users access to previews of Google Docs that they share in Slack, so it’s possible for people to see inside a file at a glance without having to open it. \nIt’s not yet clear when all of this functionality will be making its way into Slack, however. The chat service startup will let users sign up for notifications about the forthcoming updates here.

This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe (Photo: VESA MOILANEN/AFP/Getty Images) \nWhy is Microsoft showing so much interest in Linux? originally appeared on Quora : the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights . \nAnswer by Mathew Lodge , Board member of CNCF, a Linux Foundation project, on Quora : Microsoft has decided that the operating system is no longer an important battleground, and that it’s more important to gain market share in cloud (Azure and Office 365) than it is to put energy into battling Linux for application market share. If you want to see what a company really values, you look at their sales compensation approach. Microsoft focuses all of its accelerators and sales training on Azure and Office 365. Its sales people lead with these. Customers renewing their Windows/Office software licenses get free credits for Azure when they ask for a discount. Microsoft will (of course) absolutely take a Windows renewal deal, but it is going to come with a chunk of free Azure because it wants you to use that instead of Windows on your own servers. It also has a program for its VARs (value-added resellers — people who help you get value out of Microsoft stuff) to provide professional services to help customers use those free Azure credits. It also has VARs who will help customers transition off Exchange and onto hosted Exchange instead, which is far easier to manage than hosting it yourself. So why this shift away from caring about Windows? An operating system only matters because it is a platform for applications. Apps make money for businesses and productivity for individuals — i.e. they deliver the real value of computing. Microsoft very effectively monetized apps with Windows and the .NET application platform. While the various proprietary UNIX vendors (Sun, HP et al) were duking it out with each other in the server market, they built a very well-integrated and easy to use app development platform for the desktop. When Linux and Intel x86 based servers came along and started to cannibalize the UNIX market, keeping Sun and others occupied, Microsoft spent its time expanding Windows from the desktop into x86 servers too. In recent years, 75% of the servers going into corporate data centers ship with a Windows license [1] — the rest run Linux, mostly from Red Hat, who had spotted the need for Linux server distribution that enterprises could actually run reliably and spent 10 hard years building a business around that. Linux was largely successful in replacing proprietary UNIX in data centers (mostly Sun), and outside the enterprise in the hosting business (again, mostly Sun) where Intel x86 servers were now “good enough” and no one wanted to pay for the operating system. Microsoft didn’t care too much about this because there is no OS market when no one wants to pay. However, being free, Linux app capabilities grew, as did the base of people who knew how to write apps for it. So Linux has grown in scale and usage, even though it’s hard to make money as a server OS vendor with a Linux distribution (proof points: Canonical, SUSE). Only Red Hat has managed it, but they have broadened their business into management software to find growth. So if you’re Satya Nadella and in charge of Azure and Windows, what is the single best strategy for growth when AWS is a $10B business, >10x the size of Azure [2] and growing 64% per year [3] , while Windows licenses are growing in single digits? AWS, the cloud that is a platform for apps in its own right, regardless of which OS you run? Do you keep pouring money into making Windows the platform for more apps vs. Linux? Or should you just not care which OS the app runs on, throw open the doors, and welcome every single app that runs on Linux onto Azure? Although it is doubtless painful, as Satya you stop caring about the OS and focus on the cloud app platform, embarking on a program to make yourself as attractive as possible for every Linux app. That includes joining the Linux Foundation.

      "text": "Microsoft gains EU approval for $26 billion buy of LinkedIn Tue Dec 6, 2016 11:20am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Foo Yun Chee \nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft MSFT.O won EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its $26 billion bid for professional social network LinkedIn LNKD.N, its largest ever acquisition, after agreeing to a series of modest concessions. \nThe deal, which has already received the green light in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa, would close in the coming days following the EU clearance, said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer. \n\"With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,\" he said in a blog. \nThe U.S. software company is aiming to enhance its core business products with LinkedIn's suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services, allowing it to better compete with rivals in next-generation computing. \nLinkedIn generates the bulk of its $3 billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people. \nThe European Commission, which in recent months has signaled concerns about companies acquiring rivals with valuable data and the potential negative impact on competition, said the concessions addressed its concerns. \n\"These networks are important for professionals to connect and interact and to find new career opportunities. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. \nReuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on Nov. 23.

      "text": "Microsoft’s Holiday Ad Celebrates The People Who Made 2016 A Better Year For Everyone Thank goodness for these folks. 12/07/2016 01:26 pm ET Carol Kuruvilla Associate Religion Editor \nMicrosoft’s 2016 holiday advertisement celebrates the accomplishments of ordinary people who worked hard to make 2016 a better year for everyone. \nThe global tech company worked with the ad agency McCann to bring eight changemakers into the same room to create artwork that reflects their “vision of hope, peace and beauty.” The “Art of Harmony” ad featured people like Zianna Oliphant , a young girl who pleaded for justice at the Charlotte City Council after the police shooting of Keith Scott in North Carolina, Christopher Catrambone , an entrepreneur who founded the Migrant Offshore Aid Station to help rescue migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea, and Jazz Jennings , a transgender activist. \nAfter letting the participants draw together (using Microsoft products , this is an ad after all), their artwork was projected onto Jane’s Carousel, in Dumbo, Brooklyn. \nIn a press release, Microsoft said, “This year has been challenging for many and much of what we hear in the news can be negative. Microsoft wanted to lift people up and remind them that ordinary people can make a difference. The message focuses on the spirit of the holidays, people coming together and celebrating what is good and right with the world—what unites us, instead of what divides us.” \nThe ad will run throughout the holiday season on television and online, in markets throughout the world. \nMona Haydar, a Muslim activist featured in the ad, told The Huffington Post that she hopes the campaign “functions like a healing balm or salve” to soothe hearts and minds this holiday season. Haydar and her husband Sebastian Robins are known for promoting interfaith engagement and understanding. After the San Bernardino attacks, the pair set up a booth outside of a Cambridge, Massachusetts library with doughnuts, coffee, and a sign that read “Ask a Muslim.” They invited passers-by to ask them questions about Islam, in an effort to combat stereotypes about Muslims. \nWatch Microsoft’s short video on Haydar below. \nHaydar said that it was a pleasure to meet and make art with people she deeply respected and honored. As a Syrian-America, she was especially moved by the work that Catrambone is doing to help refugees. \n“ We had such a good time on set together as a group that I actually ended up having everyone over to my apartment for brunch to hang out more!” Haydar told The Huffington Post. \n“There is so much to celebrate and feel joyful about- and not a cheap joy either― a real and abiding joy that comes with hard honorable work that ensures that our world will be a more loving and beautiful place for us all!” Related...",

      "text": "17 for '17: Microsoft researchers’... Show More \nMicrosoft researchers have shared their annual predictions of what they believe will be the big advancements in technology within the next 10 years. The predictions were made by 17 different researchers at the company, covering 10 different areas. \nPredictions are always a dicey thing. Stewart Alsop will never live down his prediction that \"the last mainframe will be unplugged on March 15, 1996.\" Twenty years later, IBM still sells its z Series mainframe. Oops. \nStill, the Microsoft wizards have some interesting predictions. And for this year's list, Microsoft's prognosticators are all women. Microsoft is celebrating Computer Science Education Week around the globe, with special emphasis on women and girls, given the fact women account for only 20 percent of computer science graduates in 34 of the countries which are members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) yet are half the population. \nSome of the predictions from the women: One of the great algorithmic advances of the next decade will be the development of algorithms that are fair, accountable and much more robust to manipulation. The search box will disappear. It will be replaced by search functionality that is more ubiquitous, embedded and contextually sensitive. By 2027, we will have ubiquitous virtual reality systems that will provide such rich multisensorial experiences that will be capable of producing hallucinations that blend or alter perceived reality. By 2027, automation will give rise to a new economy in which most people’s societal contribution comes from the data they generate as they go about their lives rather than the work they do. By 2027, we will have a quantum computer that can break at least low-strength traditional cryptographic systems. By 2027, the majority of software engineers will be facile in programming systems that reason about estimates and produce models with statistical methods. In 2017, systems will increasingly re-architect themselves to support interactions without a graphical user interface. We’ll see fewer users installing apps on their devices and more apps turning into behind-the-scenes services for chatbots and personal digital assistants.

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 8 minutes ago with 1 comment \nWith the holiday shopping season well and truly underway, Microsoft has been offering all sorts of deals in recent weeks. For buyers in the UK, it's now launched a new offer for those intending to purchase one of its Surface devices. \nMicrosoft is giving away a free Xbox One S console worth £249 with select Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 models. Buyers get to choose from one of three bundles: Xbox One S 500GB with Forza Horizon 3 Xbox One S FIFA 17 Bundle (White - 500GB) Xbox One S Minecraft Favourites Bundle (500GB) \nEvery Surface Book from the Intel Core i5 model with 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and discrete GPU - priced at £1,599 - to the range-topping £2,649 variant is included in the promotion. Only those who purchase the entry-level Book, priced at £1,299, will not be eligible for a free Xbox One S. \nThe freebie is also available to Surface Pro 4 buyers who purchase any model above and including the Intel Core i5 version with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD, which costs £1,079. \nThe deal will continue until December 21 - and we'll no doubt see plenty of other festive promotions popping up before Santa does his thing later this month.",

Microsoft's Build 2017 will be May 10 to 12, 2017 in Seattle. More information on topics and registration will be coming at a later date on http://build.microsoft.com . (The last and only time Microsoft held Build in its backyard was in November 2012.) \nMicrosoft also is combining two of its previously separate conferences into a single event. The Microsoft Envision conference -- which was slated to happen in February 2017 in Los Angeles -- is now being combined with the Microsoft Ignite conference in September in Orlando. Envision is the show that evolved from the Microsoft Convergence conference which used to be focused exclusively on the company's Dynamics business, partners and customers. \nThe company's Worldwide Partner Conference is being renamed to \"Microsoft Inspire,\" and will be held from July 9 to 13 in Washington, DC. Registration for the partner show is open already. \nIn the name of \"One Microsoft,\" Microsoft also is combining some of its internally focused events, too. Microsoft's MGX sales conference, TechReady, and the Solution Specialist Sales Summit (S4) will be a single event happening in Las Vegas the week of July 17, 2017, I've heard from my contacts. \nBack to Build 2017. I know some will be wondering if we tea-leaf readers are reading anything into Build happening in May. \nSome of us have been hearing Microsoft is planning a late Spring 2017 hardware launch. Recently, Microsoft has held separate hardware-launch events for its new devices, rather than combining them with other Microsoft events, so I wouldn't necessarily link the two. And as I've been noting for a while, the rumored RTM (release to mainstream) timeframe for Windows 10 Creators Update is March 2017, so I'm doubtful there's any link there, either. \nIt's worth remembering that Build is primarily, but not exclusively, an event that revolves around Windows.

      "text": "on Dec 7, 2016, 8:30 AM TechSpot \nMicrosoft announced in June that it would be purchasing professional social network LinkedIn in a cash deal worth $26.2 billion. The purchase will further cement Microsoft into the world of social media after previous deals with Facebook and the acquisition of Yammer in 2012. \nA deal this large requires approval from regulators around the world and today Microsoft received its final approval. Other agencies in the United States, Canada, Brazil, and South Africa have already reviewed and cleared the deal. By passing the European Commission, Microsoft is set finalize the acquisition. \nThe long delay in approval stems from the European Court's requirement that Microsoft preserve competition among other social networks. Microsoft will be incorporating LinkedIn into their Office Add-in program and other products. This will integrate the social network into Office and Windows. Regulators voiced concern about the deal being used to unfairly target other social networks. Microsoft agreed to play nice and will not require or enter into agreements with PC manufacturers to pre-install LinkedIn on their products. They will let users and administrators customize their Office experience by disabling LinkedIn if the feature is unwanted. Microsoft also agreed to allow promotional opportunities in the Office store for other social networking services. \nIn a blog post highlighting the final details, Microsoft described an effort to help those in the workforce succeed, bringing better digital tools to schools and better data to those pursuing jobs, and for governments to create opportunities. \nMicrosoft promised the deal would close before the end of 2016 and they can finally relax as things wrap up in the next few days. Look to see LinkedIn more heavily integrated into the Microsoft ecosystem in the future as well as programs targeting societal issues facing the workforce. Related Reads",

      "text": "Google and Slack deepen partnership in the face of Microsoft Teams The move will bring deeper integration between Google Drive and Slack U.S. Correspondent, IDG News Service | Dec 7, 2016 9:00 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Martyn Williams Top 3 biggest Facebook changes from F8 \nSlack and Google have vastly deepened their partnership roughly a month after Microsoft announced its competitor to the popular enterprise chat service. \nWednesday saw the announcement of several new features aimed at making G Suite, Google’s set of productivity software and services, more useful to people who use Slack. The functionality resulting from the partnership will make it easier to share and work on files stored in Google Drive using Slack. \nSlack and Google were early partners during the lifecycle of the chat service which gives business users a set of rooms where they can discuss work, share files and more. Microsoft recently announced Teams , a similar service integrated into Office 365 that’s currently in beta. \n[ Download the State of the CIO 2016 report ] \nA representative for Slack said via email that Microsoft’s introduction of a competitive product that is expected to become generally available next year didn’t have an impact on the company’s decision to deepen its integration with Google. \nBut one way or another, the partnership has clear benefits for both companies. Slack becomes more useful for G Suite users, and Google gets to make its productivity suite a more attractive offering to those organizations that want to use Slack. \nIn a thoroughly modern turn, Google is building a Drive Bot, which will inform users about changes to a file, and let them approve, reject and settle comments in Slack, rather than opening Google Docs. It goes along with Slack’s continuing embrace of bots as a key part of the chat service’s vision of productivity. \nWhen users share a file from Drive in Slack, the chat service will check the sharing permissions on the file and make sure that it’s set up so that everyone in a channel can access what’s being shared. If the settings don’t match, users will be asked to modify them. \nTo go along with that, users will be able to associate Team Drive folders with particular Slack channels. That means the Marketing folder for members of the marketing team inside a company can also be linked to the team’s Slack channel. \nWhen users upload files to a Slack channel with a linked Team Drive, the files will be backed up inside Google’s cloud storage service. When Team Drive files get changed, users will be notified using Slack. \nIn addition, Google and Slack are working together to give users access to previews of Google Docs that they share in Slack, so it’s possible for people to see inside a file at a glance without having to open it. \nIt’s not yet clear when all of this functionality will be making its way into Slack, however. The chat service startup will let users sign up for notifications about the forthcoming updates here. To comment on this article and other CIO content, visit us on Facebook , LinkedIn or Twitter .

      "text": "\nMicrosoft has just announced Build 2017 — the company’s annual developer conference. Build 2017 will start on May 10 and end on May 12. This time around, Microsoft will be hosting the conference in Seattle. At the moment, it’s a bit early to speculate what Microsoft will talk about at the event.\nAs Mary Jo Foley notes , you’ll notice that Microsoft has pushed Build back to May rather than the usual March/April timeframe. This is likely because the company will show off the next major upgrade for Windows 10 at the event. According to one of my trusted sources, Microsoft will possibly show off Windows 10 ‘Redstone 3’ at the event. The software giant is expected to release Windows 10 Redstone 2 (aka the Creators Update) in March 2017 — so, it should not be a huge surprise if Microsoft does indeed show off Redstone 3 at Build 2017 in May.\nIn addition to Build 2017 details, Microsoft also announced some other info regarding its other developer events. Firstly, the software giant is renaming its Worldwide Partner Conference event to “Microsoft Inspire” — and this event will be held from July 9 to 13th in Washington. Additionally, the company is also combining its Envision conference with Ignite — which will be happening in Orlando next year.\nBuild 2017 and Microsoft’s other events should, indeed, be very exciting. We’ll be covering them as per usual, so make sure to stay tuned in 2017 as there are lots of exciting things to look forward to.",

Because of this, we're assuming a lot of the focus will be on Redstone 3 changes and features that developers are going to want to take advantage of, perhaps our first official look at Project NEON will happen in May too.\nMicrosoft hasn't given any more specific info outside of May 10th-12-th in Seattle. Regardless, Windows Central will be there covering the event as usual. It's an exciting time to be a Microsoft fan, and we can't wait to see what Microsoft has planned for BUILD 2017.\n",

      "text": "Microsoft will be holding its Build 2017 developer conference in Seattle from May 10-12 8 minutes ago By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 15 minutes ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft outlined its 2017 event line-up today, which includes its Build 2017 developer conference. The event will be held May 10-12 in Seattle, rather than its usual March-April in California. \nThe company also said that it will be renaming its Worldwide Partner Conference to Microsoft Inspire, and that will be held from July 9-13 in Washington D.C. The firm says that, \"This new name reflects how Microsoft and our partner community inspire each other to innovate and deliver powerful new solutions to customers.\" \nFinally, Microsoft Envision will be folded into Ignite, which we already know will be in Orlando, Florida, from September 25-29 . Of course, these are just Microsoft's major events, as there will be product launches scattered throughout the year as well. \nOf course, Build is a conference that many look forward to, including non-developers. After all, it's where Microsoft will talk about what's next for its platforms. \nAs for what the company might announce at the event, you can expect quite a bit. The blog post made a point of saying that Seattle is the \"cloud city\", so in case you weren't already expecting it, there should be some announcements regarding Azure and the Microsoft Cloud. \nThere's also a strong possibility that we might hear about Redstone 3, which is to be the next feature update to Windows 10 after the Creators Update . After all, the Creators Update should arrive in March , so a couple months after that would be a great time to talk about what's next. It would also make a lot of sense that the event was scheduled in May instead of its normal timeframe.",

      "text": "\nAs 2016 comes to an end, Microsoft is already looking forward to 2017 and the company will be making a few changes to its events. Everything from Build to Ignite has been refined and the company is sharing the dates for all of these events.\nBuild, the company’s annual developer conference that it organizes each Spring, is headed to Seattle; the past couple of years it has been located in San Francisco. The event will run from May 10-12 but the company is not ready to announce yet when registration will open.\nDuring the summer, the company will be hosting its Inspire conference in Washington D.C from July 9-13. This conference, known to most as Worldwide Partner Conference, has been rebranded and registration for this event is open today .\nFinally, the company’s Envision conference for business leaders is being combined with Ignite. This event will take place Sept. 25-29 and will be hosted in Orlando.\nThe most notable change here is the location for Build. Each year at the event, the conference sold out quickly and last year Microsoft promised to make the 2017 event open to more attendees. This is not the first time the company has hosted the developer conference on its campus and seeing as they know have more control over the venue, expect there be more room for additional attendees.\n \nThe post Microsoft Details Event Line Up For 2017, Build Heads To Seattle appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "Home > Startups > Microsoft and Wipro to help startups grow business Microsoft and Wipro to help startups grow business \nMicrosoft Accelerator has announced a partnership with Wipro to identify technology solutions that can be integrated across Wipro’s existing business verticals and to offer the startups enrolled in its accelerator programme comprehensive go-to-market (GTM) opportunities. \nThe announcement was made at Microsoft Accelerator’s flagship event Think Next 2016 on Wednesday. \nUnder the partnership, Wipro will refer select startups for Microsoft Accelerator programmes and events. The referred startups will gain access to Wipro Open Innovation initiatives such as global GTM reach, opportunity to integrate their solutions with select Wipro solutions, exposure to Wipro’s global customer base and targeted Wipro marketing support. \n“We are confident that our partnership with Microsoft Accelerator will be an important enabler in developing critical solutions for our customers, harnessing both the innovation taking place within Wipro and the external ecosystem,” KR Sanjiv, chief technology officer of Wipro Limited said. \nIT major Wipro has a $100 million corporate venture fund. \nWipro’s VC arm invests $1-5 million per financing round in early- to mid-stage startups in India, Israel and the US. It invests in areas such as open source, Big Data and analytics, artificial intelligence, digital, Internet of Things and security. \nIts latest investment was in US-based cyber security company Vectra Networks Inc. In March, Wipro Ventures had picked up a minority stake in another US-based security startup, Emailage Corporation. \nThe Indian tech company is already working with three startups from Microsoft Accelerator’s previous batch such as banking analytics vendor CustomerXPS, omni-channel customer management platform CloudCherry, and Altizon System, a big data company focused on the Internet of Things (IoT) industry. While Wipro led a $4 million (around Rs 27.2 crore) Series A funding into Altizon early this year, CustomerXPS raised $4 million from Tokyo-based venture capital fund Jafco Asia in its Series A funding in 2011 while CloudCheery raised Series A funding of $6 million from Vertex Ventures, Cisco Investments and IDG Ventures India. \nThis partnership is part of Microsoft Accelerator #CoInnovate program. \n“Connecting startups to corporates and crafting a win-win relationship is a critical need of the ecosystem today. The partnership with Wipro allows us to leverage our combined strengths and market reach to provide a whole new level of market access for our startups,” said Bala Girisaballa, CEO-In-Residence, Microsoft Accelerator. \nMicrosoft Accelerator is a global program that works with market-ready startups to provide the tools, resources, connections, knowledge and expertise to scale their businesses. \nMicrosoft had recently restructured its startup programmes to separate its venture arm and the accelerator programme. Microsoft Ventures, under which the accelerator programme was run so far, is now a pure venture unit that will focus on Series A and beyond investments in North America and Israel while the accelerator will focus on startup enablement under its nine accelerators across the globe. \nThe accelerator programme in India has produced 95 startups so far, of which 87% received venture capital funding raising around $177 million. The programme also witnessed nine acquisitions so far. \nWith its CoInnovate programme, Microsoft Accelerator also partners with large companies including Temasek, TCS, Citi, and Reliance Industries to power their startup programmes. \nThe event also marked the graduation of 13 startups from its ninth batch. Whodat, Betaout, MovenSync, Transaction Analysts, AllizHealth, Uncanny Vision, Meddiff, FarEye, Epictions, Germin8, Talview, Faircent and Surukam are the startups graduating from the accelerator’s ninth batch. \nLike this report?

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 4 seconds ago \nMicrosoft today announced a new build of Office for Mac for Insiders on the Slow ring. The December update brings the version number to 15.29 (16120401). \nLike the last couple of updates , today's build only brings a few new features. Here's what's new: \nAccessibility built right in: We've improved support for using your keyboard, VoiceOver, and other assistive technology to read and edit documents, worksheets, and presentations. \nHyperlinks in PDF files: In Word, retain your document fidelity, with working hyperlinks, when converting documents to PDF. \nTo check for updates, head over to Help -> Check for updates -> Check for updates. If you're not on the Office Insider Program just yet, you can sign up by using the same menu. Today's update is for the Slow ring, but there's a Fast ring as well. \nIf you're not feeling adventurous and want to stick to stable builds, you'll likely see this update later this month, as they tend to move from the Slow to Production rings within about two weeks.

      "text": "hp envy desktop monitor usb type c charging k display More In October, HP used Microsoft to reveal the HP Envy 27 desktop monitor as part of its fall lineup. It was slated to arrive on December 4 with a starting price of $500 packing a 4K resolution and support for AMD’s FreeSync technology. It’s now listed on HP’s website to purchase directly from the company with an optional six-month payment plan for qualifying customers.\nHere are the specs:\nScreen size: 27 inches Panel technology: IPS Native resolution: 3,840 x 2,160 @ 60Hz Contrast ratio (static): 1,300:1 Contrast ratio (dynamic): 10,000,000:1 Brightness: 350 nits Pixel pitch: 0.1554 millimeters Response time: 14 milliseconds Aspect ratio: 16:9 Color gamut: 99 percent sRGB Ports: 1x HDMI 1.4\n1x HDMI 2.0\n1x DisplayPort 1.2\n1x USB Type-C (up to 60 watts) For starters, the display is based on In-Plane Switching technology (IPS), a newer panel tech that offers brilliant colors and wide viewing angles. By comparison, the older Twisted Nematic (TN) technology has been around for a long while, and is best known for its brightness levels and fast response times. That leads us to the new panel’s 14ms response time, which is surprisingly slow compared to most other models on the market. This is the time it takes a pixel to go from white to black and back to white again.\nView photos\nHP Envy 27 Display More The FreeSync aspect means it’s great for PCs packing an AMD Radeon graphics chip. To better understand what it’s for, consider that the video output of a graphics card generates a number of frames per second (FPS). Likewise, the display flashes a number of frames per second as well (refresh rate). With FreeSync technology, the output of the Radeon graphics card is synchronized with the refresh rate of the display so that when framerates drop or rise, the display’s rate drops and rises too. That provides a smooth viewing experience, eliminating screen tearing and stuttering.\nMore: HPE confirms successful demonstration of memory-driven computer architecture\nAs the specs show, HP’s new panel provides a USB Type-C port for generating up to 60 watts of power to a PC or mobile device. Other notable features include a micro-edge design to provide more screen and less bezel, and support for millions of colors to present crisp, brilliant images in a 4K resolution. The panel doesn’t appear to be served up with any HP-specific features such as what we see crammed into other brands, providing a simple plug-and-play solution. However, it does come with a disc packing drivers.\nHere is what comes in the box:\n1x power cable 1x HDMI cable 1x DisplayPort cable 1x USB Type-C cable VESA mount adapter HP crams a CAD-focused workstation into a gaming console box with the Z2 Mini HP makes the Envy name premium again with new laptops, all-in-one, monitor",

      "text": "\"Crackdown 3\" is one of the big games Microsoft plans to release to its fans in 2017. It's also coming to Project Scorpio in 4K. ( Microsoft ) Advertisement \nCrackdown 3 is one of the many Xbox One games fans have been waiting for ever since it was announced at E3 2014. The game is expected to be the among the first titles to take advantage of the cloud, but not in terms of rendering. \nMicrosoft showed off a demo where we get to see cloud-based destruction physics in action. Apparently, the physics shown is not capable using just the Xbox One hardware alone, and as such, the multiplayer will rely heavily on the cloud. This feature is not expected to be part of the single-player game, however. \nCrackdown 3 was projected to hit retail stores in 2016, but was delayed to 2017 earlier this year. Since them, we haven't heard much about the game, well, not until now. Could Release Before Holiday 2017 \nBecause of the magnitude of Crackdown 3 , one would have expected the title to be released during the holiday season of 2017. However, Executive Producer Peter Connelly, Design Director Clint Burdock and Art Director Dave Johnson stated in a recent TwitchTV stream that the game would come before holiday 2017, but they did not give a hard date. \nWhat's also interesting is that the game will run at native 4K on Project Scorpio , Microsoft's next gaming console set for release during the holidays of 2017. \nNow, considering the different launch dates of both products, it's clear that Crackdown 3 will likely hit store shelves before Project Scorpio. Project Scorpio Launching Earlier Than Expected \nCrackdown 3 is one of Microsoft's most known and popular games. It would make sense for the company to release alongside Project Scorpio to show off what the console can do. No doubt the game could be an impressive launch title, so why not? \nWell, there's always a chance for Microsoft to release its new video game console earlier than planned. We could see Project Scorpio release before holiday 2017 with Crackdown 3 as one of its launch titles. After all, the head of Xbox, Phil Spencer , did say at one point that development of the console is ahead of schedule. \nWith Sony having relative success with the PlayStation 4 Pro , it shouldn't be too surprising if Microsoft decides to bump the date of Project Scorpio's launch rather than give Sony a full year's head start. \nIt should be noted that all Microsoft platform-exclusive games will support 4K going forward, and as such, Project Scorpio will have a good amount of 4K games when it becomes available next year.

      "title": "Cray collaborates with Microsoft to scale the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit on Cray supercomputers",
      "text": "\nAt the 2016 Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) Conference in Barcelona, Cray announced its deep learning collaboration with Microsoft, and the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS). They worked with Microsoft and CSCS to scale the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly CNTK) on a Cray XC50 supercomputer at CSCS nicknamed “Piz Daint”. By accelerating the training process, instead of waiting weeks or months for results, data scientists can obtain results within hours or even minutes.\n“Applying a supercomputing approach to optimize deep learning workloads represents a powerful breakthrough for training and evaluating deep learning algorithms at scale,” said Dr. Xuedong Huang, distinguished engineer, Microsoft AI and Research. “Our collaboration with Cray and CSCS has demonstrated how the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit can be used to push the boundaries of deep learning.”\nA team of experts from Cray, Microsoft, and CSCS have scaled the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit to more than 1,000 NVIDIA® Tesla® P100 GPU accelerators on the Cray XC50 supercomputer at CSCS. The result of this deep learning collaboration opens the door for researchers to run larger, more complex, and multi-layered deep learning workloads at scale, harnessing the performance of a Cray supercomputer.\n“Only Cray can bring the combination of supercomputing technologies, supercomputing best practices, and expertise in performance optimization to scale deep learning problems,” said Dr. Mark S. Staveley, Cray’s director of deep learning and machine learning. “We are working to unlock possibilities around new approaches and model sizes, turning the dreams and theories of scientists into something real that they can explore. Our collaboration with Microsoft and CSCS is a game changer for what can be accomplished using deep learning.”\n",

      "text": "64-bit Windows 10 Microsoft 2017 event line up 2016 has been a year of exciting growth and innovation here at Microsoft and for our customers. Business leaders, IT professionals, developers and our partners are embracing the cloud and new technologies like artificial intelligence, IoT and mixed reality to drive digital transformation. As we look toward 2017, Id like to share an update on Microsofts premier conferences for the year ahead. As always, our goal is to provide high-quality event experiences that deliver impactful guidance and enable our vibrant communities to network, grow and learn from each other. First, we are bringing our annual Microsoft Build conference to Seattle  the cloud city  from May 10-12, 2017. Once again, developers can hear from Microsoft engineering leaders and learn about the latest tools and technologies to boost creativity and productivity. Look for information about Microsoft Build at http://build.microsoft.com . Next, we are renaming the Worldwide Partner Conference to Microsoft Inspire, which will be held July 9-13 in Washington, D.C. This new name reflects how Microsoft and our partner community inspire each other to innovate and deliver powerful new solutions to customers. Registration for Microsoft Inspire is now open  learn more at https://inspire.microsoft.com/ . And finally, we are shifting Microsoft Envision, our event for business leaders previously planned for February, to become part of Microsoft Ignite Sept. 25-29. The partnership between business and IT leaders has never been more important, so Microsoft Ignite will now cater to both audiences and help foster collaboration between the two. Well have more details to share in the coming months. In addition to these signature, world-class conferences, we will continue to offer a wide range of live and virtual events to provide customers and partners with opportunities to learn, grow and network. You can find local Microsoft events at www.microsoft.com/events . Im looking forward to these conferences and a great 2017! Chris",

      "text": "Blog archive Microsoft Clears Final Regulatory Hurdle in LinkedIn Deal \nThe European Union's approval of Microsoft's $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn clears the final regulatory holdup, allowing the deal to close in the coming days. \nIf there was any potential for Microsoft to miss its target of closing its $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, announced in June, the European Union yesterday put that to rest by approving the deal, which is now set to close in the coming days. \nThe approval dashes the last hope by those objecting to the deal -- notably Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff, who filed objections with both the U.S. regulators and subsequently with the EU. Benioff, who was outbid by Microsoft in an attempt to acquire LinkedIn, raised concerns that Microsoft would lock out rival social networking service using its large Office and Windows market share. \nBefore clearing the deal, the EU last month sought some concessions from Microsoft, which had reportedly offered compromises. Microsoft President Brad Smith outlined the key commitments it will maintain for at least five years. Among them Microsoft will: Continue to make its Office add-in program available to third-party professional social networking providers, which will let developers integrate those services into Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel. Maintain programs that allow third-party social networking providers to promote their services in the Office Store. Allow IT pros, admins and users to customize their Office configurations by letting them choose whether to display the LinkedIn profile and activity information in the user interface when Microsoft provides those future integrations as is anticipated. Ensure PC manufacturers aren't required to install new LinkedIn apps or tiles in the European Economic Area (EEA). Likewise, Microsoft is promising not to hinder users from uninstalling the apps and tiles. Microsoft also said it won't use Windows itself to prompt users to install a LinkedIn app, though it'll remain in the Windows Store and customers may be promoted in other ways to use it. \nIn the EEA, Smith also said that Microsoft has agreed not to form agreements with PC makers to pre-install LinkedIn exclusively, thereby blocking competitors. \"We appreciated the opportunity to talk through these and other details in a creative and constructive way with the European Commission,\" Smith noted in yesterday's post. Having cleared approval in Europe, Smith said Microsoft is ready to move forward. \n\"Microsoft and LinkedIn together have a bigger opportunity to help people online to develop and earn credentials for new skills, identify and pursue new jobs and become more creative and productive as they work with their colleagues,\" Smith noted. \"Working together we can do more to serve not only those with college degrees, but the many people pursuing new experiences, skills and credentials related to vocational training and so-called middle skills. Our ambition is to do our part to create more opportunity for people who haven't shared in recent economic growth.\" Posted by Jeffrey Schwartz on 12/07/2016 at 10:45 AM <>",

      "title": "Why Microsoft won't release Minecraft 2",
      "text": "Mansoor Mithaiwala \nSince its release in 2011, Minecraft has become one of the most popular games of all time —inspiring Microsoft to acquire the developer, Mojang, three years later . But now that the studio is under Microsoft's control, they've made it expressly clear that they have no plans to pursue a sequel, saying it doesn't \" make the most sense .\" In other words, in the company's eyes, it isn't a traditional game—and there's a lot more they can do with the property than people realize. Here are a few reasons why Microsoft won't make Minecraft 2 . Microsoft only recently acquired Mojang Getty Images \nMinecraft first exploded onto the scene in 2009, when Swedish developer Markus \"Notch\" Persson released an alpha version on the TIGSource forums. Even though the game was only in its infancy at the time, it had quite an impact—so much that Valve paid for Persson to visit their headquarters and see if he was interested in a job. Persson took them up on their offer but ended up turning down a position . Instead, he helped co-found Mojang. \nBy co-founding an independent video game developer/publisher, Persson was able to continue working on his Minecraft project uninterrupted and without the stress of deadlines. Two years later, in 2011, Persson and Mojang released a completed version of the game on PC, Mac, and Linux. Within three years of release, it had expanded to last-generation consoles and amassed a user base of over 100 million people worldwide . \nIn September 2014, Microsoft acquired Minecraft as well as Mojang for $2.5 billion. Although the company planned to not only continue supporting Minecraft but also expand the game to other platforms, they had no immediate plans for a sequel—it's only been two years since the acquisition, and looking at what other Microsoft studios have done, it fits with their history. For example, Microsoft-owned studio 343 Industries didn't release their first Halo game until five years after forming. Minecraft is expanding to new platforms Getty Images \nBy the time Microsoft acquired Mojang in 2014, Minecraft had expanded from its initial PC, Mac, and Linux release to mobile devices, specifically Android and iOS phones, as well as consoles such as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 . These releases allowed for Minecraft to drastically widen its audience, which fit squarely within Xbox head honcho Phil Spencer's goals. \"For me, I look at it as a great game to add to our portfolio,\" he told IGN . \"I love [the gamer] who plays Minecraft . I love that male, female, young, and old—it's something that lives on so many different screens. I'd love to bring it to more screens out there.\" \nAfter the Microsoft acquisition, the company helped Mojang expand even further, to new consoles and eventually handheld devices. In conjunction with 4J Studios, who developed the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of Minecraft , Mojang was able to release the game on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 2014; later that year, in October, the company made its first handheld release for Minecraft on PlayStation Vita , and in December, they released the game on Windows Phone . \nThanks to Microsoft's acquisition, Windows Phone users aren't being left out in the cold anymore when it comes to popular games. Interestingly, when they acquired Mojang, Microsoft promised to continue supporting and releasing the game on non-Microsoft devices —a promise they upheld when Minecraft made it to the Wii U in 2016. The game is still thriving Getty Images \nEven though it has been five years since its initial release, Minecraft is still thriving. In fact, it's doing better than ever now that Mojang is part of Microsoft. By the time Microsoft acquired Mojang, Minecraft had amassed a user base of over 100 million people, but only 14.3 percent of users eventually convert into paid subscribers. \nBy June 2014, just three months prior to Microsoft's acquisition, Minecraft had totaled an estimated 54 million copies sold across PC, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. That means Minecraft was already a global phenomenon when Microsoft acquired the game. Within two years, though, the company was able to take Minecraft 's popularity and virtually double its sales across new platforms. \nBy expanding to the aforementioned platforms in 2014 and 2015, Microsoft turned Minecraft into one of the highest-selling games of all time. As of June 2016, Minecraft had surpassed 100 million copies sold , totaling almost 107 million, and averaging 53,000 sales a day. With 24 million of those copies being taken up by PC users, Minecraft has become the highest-selling PC game of all time, outpacing World of Warcraft 's second-place total of 14 million copies sold. Minecraft now trails only Tetris as the second highest-selling game of all time , with Wii Sports in third place with 82 million copies sold. New content continues to release \nOther than revolutionizing a game, the main reason for a new installment in a video game series is so users can get new content. So long as Microsoft and Mojang continue to release new content for Minecraft— which is what they plan on doing—users won't hound the company and studio for a new iteration. \nWhen the game first arrived, it only had a Survival Mode , in which players are required to gather resources (wood, stone, etc.) in order to begin crafting. Furthermore, the environment is filled with dangerous monsters, which force the player to build some sort of shelter at night to protect themselves. Not much later, Mojang thought it would be fun to add a Hardcore Mode , which sets the game on the toughest difficulty, and if a player were to die in a hardcore server, they would forever be banned from joining again. \nMojang later added a Creative Mode for players who just wanted to explore and create, allowing the player full access to resources and neutralizing their environmental damage. There is also a Spectator Mode that allows for players to, quite literally, watch without participating in gameplay. And then, finally, they added an Adventure Mode , which allows players to explore environments created by others. In those cases, rules set forth by the creator trump the rules of the game. \nIn addition, there is also the Multiplayer Mode, which now mostly exists within Minecraft Realms , allowing players to play with and against each other. Finally, in June 2016 , Microsoft enabled cross-platform play between Windows 10, iOS, and Android devices, thus unifying the player base. There's plenty of user-generated content \nPC and console gamers have had a long-running rivalry, but thanks to the new generation consoles, that gap has begun to close —albeit marginally. Still, no matter how close they get in terms of quality, there's till one underlying difference between the two platforms: mods. \nThe vast majority of PC games allow users to create their own modifications. Sometimes those mods fix glitches within the game, improve the graphics, or expand upon the content and gameplay. There are potentially thousands of mods within Minecraft , and that number's only increasing. Persson once thought mods would threaten his vision for the game, but he has recently come to cherish the mods for what they are—and, more specifically, what they do to make Minecraft what it is. \nMods and other forms of user-generated content, such as minimaps, texture packs, and custom items, helped popularize Minecraft among the PC community. However, Mojang recently made it clear that they've never officially recognized Minecraft mods—but that's something they are planning to change in a future update, which will not only make modding official but also streamline the process. As long as Microsoft and Mojang continue to support user-generated content, the community will help the game continue to thrive. There are other applications for Minecraft Getty Images \nOver the years, Microsoft has been able to utilize their gaming initiatives and technology for other applications. For instance, their motion-sensing peripheral, the Kinect, started out as a way to complement the Xbox 360 and Xbox One but is now used by students, companies, and even doctors . In fact, in 2011, shortly after the launch of the original Kinect, Canadian doctors used the device during a cancer surgery. Now the company has incorporated their intelligent personal assistant , Cortana (inspired by the Halo character of the same name), into Windows 10, which allows them to compete with Apple's Siri. \nMicrosoft is looking to continue that mission with Minecraft . In early 2016, the company announced plans to release Minecraft: Education Edition (commonly known as MinecraftEDU ) later in the year as a tool for students and teachers. The initiative aims to continue the work of MinecraftEdu, an independent organization formed in 2011 that worked alongside Mojang in using Minecraft in education, except this time there will be an official education version of the game. \nLeigh Wolmarans, head of Lings Primary School in the U.K., believes Minecraft would be useful to students. \"Technology can lead to exceptional learning, but it has to be used in conjunction with other tools,\" Wolmarans told the BBC . \"If all you are doing is sitting them down and leaving them to experience Shakespeare through Minecraft , you would be doing something wrong. Dance, art, drama and music remain the best ways to teach kids. But technology can add to that as an additional tool.\" Microsoft can pursue more spinoff games \nAs previously mentioned, Microsoft is looking into other revenue streams and applications for Minecraft , and one of those streams comes from spinoff titles and other types of games. For the company, it's not so much about the game itself as it is about the intellectual property. Microsoft is approaching Minecraft the same way Disney is using Star Wars : licensing out the property for third-party development, and profiting off the title that way. \nFor instance, in late 2015 and early 2016, Mojang partnered with Telltale Games to release an eight-part, episodic series in the same vein as other Telltale games (e.g. The Wolf Among Us , The Walking Dead , Game of Thrones , etc.), titled Minecraft: Story Mode . All eight episodes, as well as three additional ones that released as downloadable content, were successful with critics and audiences alike . It's unclear, however, if Telltale and Mojang will pursue a second season for the game. It's not always about games \nWith the convergence of the movie and gaming industries, as well as the consumer and commercial technology industries, there are more options for capitalizing on video game titles than there were ten, 20, or 30 years ago. \nMinecraft happens to be one of those titles, which allows it to be profitable for Microsoft on multiple levels—including a movie adaptation. In 2016, Warner Bros. officially announced plans to release a Minecraft movie in May 2019 (which means it will go up against movies like Avengers 4 and Star Wars: Episode IX ), with Wonder Woman scribe Jason Fuchs writing the script and Night at the Museum helmer Shawn Levy directing . \nOther than a movie adaptation, Microsoft has capitalized on Mojang's willingness to release Minecraft -themed merchandise, namely their Lego collection. In 2012, Lego released the official Lego Minecraft set, which Forbes reported as being so popular that it sold out during the holiday season. The quest continues Getty Images \nInstead of pursuing new content or an unnecessary sequel, Xbox boss Phil Spencer says Microsoft would rather like to unify Minecraft 's player base first. Again, to Microsoft, it's more about the intellectual property and what they achieve with it in terms of technology. \n\"I think what we've learned through Xbox Live is something that we can help in unifying a little bit of what happens with Minecraft today,\" Spencer told IGN . \"If I'm on PC, I get access to the mod servers; if I'm on console or the mobile editions, I don't. We're looking at how do we bring that whole system together a little more. Because there are other games out there that let me move from screen to screen fairly seamlessly.\" \nThey've shown their capability for doing just that by expanding the game to new platforms. Additionally, Microsoft has utilized the game's content and technology in various fields, including education, which has significantly bolstered sales. With these extra revenue streams, there's really no rush for Microsoft to make Minecraft 2 . Recommended",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 40 minutes ago with 2 comments \nAfter months of the unlocked model and weeks of the AT&T version of the Lumia 640 XL being out of stock, we reported on Monday that all of them were suddenly once again being sold in the online Microsoft Store. By the next day, the unlocked variant had already sold out , as well as the black AT&T device. \nAs of today, all variants of the Microsoft Lumia 640 XL are once again listed as out of stock in the Microsoft Store. The news shouldn't come as a shock to anyone (having them in stock again was more surprising), as the devices will be two-years-old in March. \nSporting a quad-core Snapdragon 400, 5.7-inch HD display, 13MP rear camera with a 1/3-inch sensor and f/2 aperture, and a 5MP front camera, the handset was still a deal at $99 for the AT&T version or even $149 for the unlocked model. Sadly, if you didn't jump on it over the last couple days, it would appear that your only options now are third-party sites. \nOf course, if Microsoft does decide to replenish its stock of the devices again, we'll let you know right here.

      "text": "SEC Allows Some Adjusted Revenue Metrics Under “Unusual Circumstances” Microsoft sought pre-clearance from regulator to furnish investors with non-GAAP revenue By 0 COMMENTS ENLARGE Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at a Microsoft tech gathering in Dublin, Ireland October 3, 2016. Photo: Reuters \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission will allow some companies to report adjusted revenues under special circumstances, but these must clear it with the regulator first, said Mark Kronforst, chief accountant for the division of corporation finance. \n“If you do have unusual circumstances, please do come and talk to us,” Mr. Kronfrost said, speaking on a panel at the American Institute of CPAs conference in Washington D.C. “We don’t want to suggest that there’s no circumstance under which revenue can be adjusted.” \nThe SEC in May issued new guidelines on the use of financial figures that don’t conform with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, a push to rein in the practice. The guidelines targeted the prominence of non-GAAP figures in earnings releases and specifically prohibited certain adjustments to revenue. \nThe SEC’s focus on revenue adjustments prompted several companies in the video game industry , for example, to drop their non-GAAP revenue figures from financial filings. \nMoreover, the regulator has criticized companies, including Tesla Motors Inc. , for continuing the practice despite the new guidelines. \nBy contrast, Microsoft Corp. has continued to report adjusted revenue due to unusual business circumstances, Mr. Kronforst said. \nMicrosoft is transitioning its Windows business from a license sale model to a software as a service model at the same time as U.S. rules governing revenue accounting are on the cusp of change, said Frank Brod, Microsoft’s chief accounting officer, speaking on the same panel. \nUnder current revenue accounting rules, Microsoft recognizes its license sales revenues upfront, but must recognize its growing pool of subscription revenue over time, Mr. Brod said. But the timing of subscription revenue recognition will change under the new accounting rules, so the company has provided non-GAAP revenue metrics as way of helping investors bridge the two standards, Mr. Brod said. \nMicrosoft sought input from its audit committee members, and held discussions with the SEC’s corporation finance division as well as with the office of the chief accountant to ensure it could keep reporting that non-GAAP measure while also complying with the new non-GAAP guidelines, Mr. Brod said. \n“As Frank has demonstrated, there situations where we think it’s just fine [to adjust revenue],” Mr. Konforst said. \nStill, Mr. Brod said Microsoft will adopt the new revenue recognition rules as early as it possibly can, which is July 1, 2017 for the company. \n“We will no longer have a non-GAAP adjustment to revenue at that time,” Mr. Brod said. \n",

      "text": "Twitter \nIt’s only been a few months since Microsoft started rolling out the Windows 10 Anniversary Update . And it’s almost time for the next major overhaul. The Creators Update A Peek Into the Windows 10 Creators Update A Peek Into the Windows 10 Creators Update Microsoft just announced the next major Windows 10 upgrade. The Creators Update will come to 400 million users in Spring 2017. Here are the highlights of Wednesday's Windows 10 event. Read More (also known as “Redstone 2”) is due to hit Windows 10 computers in Spring 2017. \nIf you’re on the Windows Insider Preview Windows 10 Insiders: You Might Want to Drop Out Now Windows 10 Insiders: You Might Want to Drop Out Now The Windows 10 Insider Program is about to begin another round of fresh updates, but if you've been wanting off, here's how to return to the normal release schedule now. Read More program, you can already play with beta versions of some of the new features already. If you’re not, keep reading to find out what you can look forward to. 1. Improved Action Center \nAfter some intelligent tweaking in the Anniversary Update, the Action Center is due to take another giant leap forwards in usefulness with the Creators Update. \nThe biggest change comes in the form of sliders for volume and brightness, but you can also expect to see improved Cortana integrations, a neater user interface, and an improved offering of customizable Quick Actions. 2. More Personalization \nOne of the biggest criticisms of Windows 10 so far has been its limited personalization options 10 Quick Ways to Customize & Personalize Windows 10 10 Quick Ways to Customize & Personalize Windows 10 Not all of Windows 10's default settings will float your boat. We show you all the possible ways to customize Windows 10 in a simple, step-by-step guide. Read More , when compared to previous versions of the operating system. \nThat’s all set to change. If you love using custom accent colors, you’ll now get the benefit of a color picker and a system-wide preview. It’ll even tell you whether the colors you’ve chosen will be easy-to-read and suggest alternatives if they won’t. \nMicrosoft will also introduce an automatic “Blue Light” option. It’ll change the brightness and screen warmth based on the time of day Can F.lux & Night Shift Really Improve Your Sleep Habits? Can F.lux & Night Shift Really Improve Your Sleep Habits? Excessive use of computers, tablets, and smartphones can lead to deteriorated sleep quality -- but do apps like F.lux and Night Shift really counteract those effects? The science is pretty clear on this. Read More , much like existing third-party solutions. 3. Paint 3D \nThe Microsoft Paint interface has barely changed since the version that was shipped with Windows 95. However, the Creators Update will dump the tried-and-tested visuals in favor of a new 3D offering The New Microsoft Paint App Has Leaked Online The New Microsoft Paint App Has Leaked Online Microsoft Paint is being overhauled in a big, bold way. And the new Microsoft Paint for Windows 10 has now leaked online. Drum roll, please... Read More . \nThe new app will support pen input and allow users to design and create 3D models. You’ll even be able to scan a real-life 3D object on your phone and import it into the app for editing. Microsoft has suggested there will also be a newly-created online community where you can share and discuss your creations. 4. Mixed Reality \nMixed reality blends augmented reality, virtual reality, and holographic computing Augmented vs. Virtual Reality: What's the Difference? Augmented vs. Virtual Reality: What's the Difference? Augmented reality. Virtual reality. Mixed reality. What are all these \"realities\" and how are they going to impact you over the next few years? Here's everything you need to know. Read More . When used in conjunction with Windows 10, the HoloLens mixed reality headset will let you download or create a 3D model, then virtually place it within the real world. \nIf the $3,000 HoloLens hardware is out of your price range, don’t worry. Microsoft is working with Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo to create headsets that should be available for as little as $300. \nFor people who love DIY or are on the cusp of a major home renovation Remodel Your Home: 6 Websites for Learning the Basics Remodel Your Home: 6 Websites for Learning the Basics Would you rather put up with an unsatisfying home? Or spend a bit time and energy making it into a place that makes you smile when you walk through the entrance? Read More , it promises to be a revolutionary new feature. You can redecorate entire rooms without touching a paintbrush. No more expensive mistakes! 5. New Microsoft Office Features \nThe 3D revolution doesn’t stop with Paint. According to reports, Microsoft PowerPoint will receive 3D models and cinematic 3D animations that you can use in presentations. Word and Excel will eventually receive similar features. \nAll the Office apps will also support pen functionality for writing, editing, and formatting. 6. Enhanced Edge Functionality \nEdge hasn’t quite managed to grab the public’s attention so far. It wasn’t helped by some glaring omissions 5 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Switch to Microsoft Edge Yet 5 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Switch to Microsoft Edge Yet Is Microsoft Edge worth using while Chrome, Firefox, and Opera are still around? Is Edge good enough to be your primary browser? Read More when it first launched, though there is no doubt it’s grown into a fast and functioning browser in the last couple of years. \nIt’ll take another step forward in the Creators Update. Most welcome will be the inclusion of a session manager, which will let you restore tabs from before you rebooted or closed the app. The update will also improve the navigation of currently-open tabs by expanding the preview function. Lastly, you’ll now be able to save 3D objects directly from websites. 7. Windows Store Themes \nAlong with improved personalization options, Microsoft will offer system-wide themes available to buy directly from the Windows Store. They’ll be available through a new personalization tab. \nAt this stage, it’s not clear exactly what form these themes will take, but it’s reasonable to assume there will be both users’ and brands’ designs available. If you want to plaster your computer with imagery from a certain movie, video game, or sports team, that will soon be an option. 8. MyPeople \nMicrosoft has repeatedly stated it wants to “place people at the center of Windows”. As part of this vision, it’s set to introduce a new feature called MyPeople. \nYou’ll find it on the right-hand side of the Taskbar and it will give you a way to quickly communicate with the most important people in your life. Your email, Skype, Xbox Live, and SMS messages will integrate into the new app, and you will be able to switch between communication methods with a single click. \nMicrosoft has not announced whether it’ll open the API to third-party developers. 9. Global Actions \nColloquially referred to as “Pick Up Where I Left Off”, Global Actions will utilize Cortana to sync a specific app’s state from one device to another. This is similar to Apple’s continuity feature What Does Continuity Mean for Yosemite & iOS 8? What Does Continuity Mean for Yosemite & iOS 8? OS X 10.10, better know as Yosemite, is a major Mac update that offers numerous features never seen before in an operating system. One of the most important is Continuity. Read More in MacOS and iOS. \nWe speculate that Microsoft wants to extend the feature to work for entire workspaces. Cortana would contextually sync files, tabs, and apps between all your devices, allowing you to seamlessly switch gadgets. 10. Windows Defender Overhaul \nAnother one of the criticisms frequently leveled at Windows 10 is that it includes some legacy graphics and layouts. These legacy items can make for a jarring user experience. The Control Panel is the worst offender, but another of the apps that received some flack — Windows Defender — is set to receive a complete design overhaul. \nThe app’s new interface looks a lot more like a typical Windows 10 app. It proves Microsoft is not planning on leaving the legacy graphics in the operating system forever. If I had to guess, I’d predict we’ll see the Control Panel revamped in the first major release after the Creators Update. 11. Groove Music Maker \nMicrosoft is targeting the Creators Update specifically at “creative” people: those who enjoy producing content. \nTo that end, Microsoft will offer a new app called Groove Music Maker. It will let you create tracks without the need for purchasing any new software. The app is free, so don’t expect it to usurp the leading music editing software, but it should be more than adequate for home enthusiasts. Other Improvements \nIn addition to these bigger changes, a host of smaller tweaks and updates will improve the Windows user experience. Here’s a small taste of what else Microsoft will include: Improved Upgrading — If you uninstall built-in apps, Windows will not reinstall them when you download a system update. Wi-Fi Control — The update will include new settings to give you more control over your Wi-Fi, including disabling it for a specified period of time. Mail App — It will be possible to reply to emails using Quick Actions and automatically CC someone using the @ symbol. OneDrive File Placeholders — Microsoft removed OneDrive placeholders in Windows 10. A sync-on-demand feature looks set to return with the new update. Game Broadcasting — The Game DVR feature will now have a broadcasting button. It’ll allow anyone to tune in and watch you slay some demons or win the World Cup. One Thing Isn’t Clear… \nClearly, the community will appreciate these updates because they will make Windows 10 even more powerful and useful. \nBut one question remains: Will Microsoft do anything about the biggest and most frequently cited problem with the operating system? You know what I’m talking about: the forced updates and restarts outside Active Hours. One can only hope. \nWhich of these new features and/or apps are you most looking forward to using?

      "text": "Microsoft today announced version 9.0 of its R Server , a product designed for data scientists working with large sets of information. The new software was one of several announcements the company made today touching on data analytics, cloud administration and databases.\nR is a specialized programming language “designed by data scientists for data scientists,” said David Smith, principal program manager for Microsoft’s R community, during a presentation this morning. R Server is software for analyzing Big Data in the cloud or on premises, whether inside or outside of the Microsoft SQL Server database.\nThe new version converts R-language models and scripts into web services with a single line of code, directly from an integrated development environment, Microsoft said. It allows training machine-learning models in one environment and deploying them in another, whether on-premises or in the cloud.\nMicrosoft also announced the private preview of a “cloud console” for its Azure cloud-computing service that it said in a blog post combines a graphical user interface, for simplicity, with a command-line interface, for power. The Azure Cloud Console allows working from the command line while simultaneously viewing cloud resources in the GUI.\nThe console automatically authenticates command-line tools from the developer’s web login and comes with all Azure command-line tools and relevant command-line utilities pre-installed. Interested developers can volunteer for the trial here .\nAnd Azure offered new choices of price and performance for its SQL Database elastic pools, which it said lower the starting price for pools and the effective cost per database and reduce price jumps among pool sizes. Azure is offering larger sizes for basic, standard and premium pools. SQL Database elastic pools are intended to provide a simple, cost-effective way to manager the performance of multiple databases with unpredictable use patterns.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft has detailed their December updates for Office Insiders on the Windows 10 Insider Program, and this month’s updates have a few treats for Excel and OneNote users.\nFirst of all, Microsoft is making it easier to use the pen lasso option by linking it to the Surface Pen so you can trigger the lasso tool without needing to open the ribbon on the app. That’s not all that’s new for Surface users, you can now manipulate objects easier with the Surface pen on Excel.\nFor OneNote, Microsoft now supports multiple Microsoft accounts for OneNote users, so if you have several Notebooks on different accounts you can now view them all in the main OneNote app without needing to sign out and reselect an alternate account. There’s a new Undo button added for smaller screen devices so you can go back on your actions.\nLasso select now at your fingertips with Excel Mobile Tap the Surface pen button to use Lasso Select on ink without visiting the ribbon. Select and move objects with greater ease in Excel Mobile Use your Surface pen to resize, rotate, move handles on objects and more. Open more files with Excel Mobile Now you can open files that contain form controls and Scenario Manager on your device. Add multiple Microsoft accounts to OneNote You can now add all of your favourite notebooks to OneNote, even if the notebooks were created by using different Microsoft accounts. Undo easily with OneNote Minds can change anytime! Use the undo button to rewrite and undo your note-taking history. The Office Mobile apps update automatically from the Windows Store – but you can download Office from the Store links below .\nWP-Appbox: Excel Mobile (Free, Windows Store) → \nWP-Appbox: OneNote (Free, Windows Store) → ",

      "text": "Is Rebalancing A Stock Portfolio A Form Of Value Investing? (Seeking Alpha) \nOn CNBC's Fast Money Halftime Report , Jon Najarian spoke about bullish options activity in Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ). He said that traders were aggressively buying the March 21 calls and they pushed the premium up to $1.25. The trade breaks even at $22.25 or approximately 16.5 percent higher. \nNajarian decided to follow the trade, but instead of buying only a call, he bought a call spread in Twitter . \nPete Najarian noticed that options traders were buying the February 60 calls in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) in the morning session on Wednesday. Around 11,000 contracts were traded and they paid $2.40 for it. Pete Najarian owns the stock and he added to his position on Wednesday. © 2016 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "We’re over a week removed from Cyber Monday, but in terms of game deals Microsoft is rebooting some of its offers in the “12 Days of Deals” lead up to Christmas sale. Today marks Day 3 of the sale, which features dozens of Xbox One games on sale up to 50% off. Titles like Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare and Titanfall 2 are at all-time lows. You can see a full breakdown of the game sale here or the top deals listed below.\nIt’s also the best time in December to buy an Xbox One S from the Microsoft Store, as they’re giving you both a bonus Xbox One S Bluetooth controller (2 total) and a free game of your choice. The free game of your choice is from a list of Ubisoft titles which range from the old Watch Dogs to newer 2016 releases like Far Cry Primal and the growing-in-popularity Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege . The game + controller bonus is arguable a $120 bonus value (not bad).\nTop Xbox One Game Deals \nGears of War 4: Ultimate Edition : (Xbox One / Windows 10) $79.99 (list price $100) XCOM 2 : $44.99 (list price $60) Gears of War 4 : (Xbox One & Windows 10) $39.99 (list price $60) Titanfall 2 : $29.99 (list price $60) Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare : $29.99 (list price $60) ReCore : (Xbox One / Windows 10) $19.99 (list price $40) More Xbox One Game Deals \nWatch Dogs 2 : $49.99 (list price $60) XCOM 2 : $44.99 (list price $60) Far Cry 4 Complete Edition : $39.99 (list price $50) FIFA 17 : $39.99 (list price $60) Dying Light: The Following Enhanced : $39.99 (list price $50) NHL 17 : $39.99 (list price $60) Madden NFL 17 : $39.99 (list price $60) NBA 2K16 : $29.99 (list price $60) WWE 2K16 : $29.99 (list price $60) Xbox One S Bundles at Microsoft \nXbox One S 2TB Gears of War 4 Bundle + Extra Controller + Free Game : $449 Xbox One S 1TB Gears of War 4 Bundle + Extra Controller + Free Game : $349 Xbox One S 1TB FIFA 17 Bundle + Extra Controller + Free Game : $349 Xbox One S 1TB Battlefield 1 Bundle + Extra Controller + Free Game : $349 Xbox One S Battlefield 1 Storm Grey Bundle + Extra Controller + Free Game : $299 Xbox One S Battlefield 1 Bundle + Extra Controller + Free Game : $299 Xbox One S Minecraft Bundle + Extra Controller + Free Game : $299.99 Xbox One S FIFA 17 Bundle + Extra Controller + Free Game : $299 Being part of the 12 Day of Deals, the Xbox One Game sale is a today-only offer. Some titles are already sold out, like Battlefield 1 (which was at its historic low too… bummer).\n\nUnlike the games being discounted by over half-off, the Xbox One system sale with free controller is not over and done with until Friday, December 10th. After that point Microsoft will no longer offer a free controller with an Xbox One S console bundle, but will still be offering a free game of your choice from now through December 31.\n",

      "title": "Microsoft Fortifies Windows 10 Creators Update With Security Features",
      "text": "Windows 10's next big update will include new tools that help businesses better control their PCs and keep their data safe. Although aimed at creative professionals and virtual reality (VR) enthusiasts, the upcoming Creators Update for Windows 10 will also contain features for security-conscious IT administrators, Microsoft announced. And not a moment too soon. Windows 10 adoption among enterprise customers is picking up, said Microsoft's Rob Lefferts, director of program Management at Windows Enterprise and Security. Over the past six months, there has been a three-fold increase in deployments of Microsoft's latest desktop operating system (OS) among enterprises, he claimed. Now that the OS is showing up in more businesses, the Redmond, Wash., software giant is focusing on improving its hardiness against malware and other threats. First, Microsoft is building on the Windows Security Center, first introduced in this past summer's Anniversary Update. The portal will soon link to the Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection service, allowing IT personnel to track attacks as they attempt to wend their way across client systems and email inboxes. \"In the Creators Update we're also adding new actions and insights in Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) to investigate and respond to network attacks, including sensors in memory, enriched intelligence and new remediation actions,\" wrote Lefferts in a blog post.Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection will be able to sniff out memory and kernel-level threats. Supplementing Microsoft's own threat intelligence and that of partners like FireEye, Creators Update will enable organizations to contribute their own intelligence to Windows Security Center, allowing businesses to tailor the system's machine learning-based malware detection capabilities to their unique environments, Lefferts said.Creators Update will also include new Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection remediation actions. With a single click, IT personnel will be able to isolate infected Windows systems, collect forensics, and block or quarantine suspect files. Separately, Intel today announced that the chipmaker is doing its part to improve Windows security and combat the problem of weak passwords. The company's Intel Security division unveiled a new Microsoft Edge extension for its True Key password manager that uses the Windows Hello biometric login technology to provide multifactor authentication capabilities when users log into their online accounts. \"The password problem won't disappear overnight, which is why working with Windows Hello is a big step in the shared vision between Intel Security and Microsoft of a password-free future,” said Richard Reiner, CTO of True Key by Intel Security, in a Dec. 7 announcement. \"By providing True Key app users with enhanced multi-factor protection and support for dynamic web form-filling—we continue to build an application that will encourage better password management and online security.\" In terms of Windows management, Creators Update will feature additions to the Windows Analytics dashboard that report on device health and other metrics using an organization's own telemetry data. A new in-place UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) conversion capability will remove many of the manual steps of updating Windows 7 systems using traditional BIOS on UEFI-enabled hardware to Windows 10. Finally, the update will include mobile application management features, allowing organizations to protect business data on personal devices without enrolling them in a mobile device management platform.",

Cortana also picked up better music integration with the update, as the personal assistant can now play music from certain apps via voice commands — for example, you can simply use “Play Drake on iHeartRadio” to play Drake’s songs on iHeartRadio. The update also brings the music recognition feature to users using Chinese (Simplified).\nAnother neat little feature that’s been added with 14986 is the new idle mode for Cortana — this will essentially make Cortana go full-screen (similar to the lockscreen Cortana) when your computer is unlocked and idle.

The build highly focuses no new features for Cortana.\nWith build 14986, Microsoft is adding the ability to turn off your comments and chance volume with voice commands on Cortana. Cortana also picked up better music integration with the update, as the personal assistant can now play music from certain apps via voice commands — for example, you can simply use “Play Drake on iHeartRadio” to play Drake’s songs on iHeartRadio. The update also brings the music recognition feature to users using Chinese (Simplified).\nAnother neat little feature that’s been added with 14986 is the new idle mode for Cortana — this will essentially make Cortana go full-screen (similar to the lockscreen Cortana) when your computer is unlocked and idle.

      "text": "Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates. Ramin Talaie/Getty Images \nBefore Microsoft had Office, before it had Windows, it had an operating system called MS DOS. \nMS DOS was a command-line operating system, meaning you had to memorize a lot of commands and type them into the computer to get it to do things like show you a list of files. \nAnd for the past 36 years, every version of Windows still had a way for people to get to this MS DOS command prompt to find and manipulate files, for those needing to do things with their PCs in that old-school way. Until now, reports Computerworld's Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols. \nLast month, Microsoft quietly retired the MS DOS prompt in its latest version of Windows 10 released to Microsoft's developer community (known as Windows Insiders). It is being replaced by a technology called PowerShell. That's a Microsoft technology for writing scripts that just celebrated its 10-year anniversary, Microsoft announced in a blog post. \nEver sensitive to the fact that Windows users, especially programmers, are very particular, it is possible to tell Windows that you don't want the classic MS DOS prompt to go away in favor of PowerShell. So it's not completely dead, yet. But short of that, it's good-by to the face of MS DOS. The making of Bill Gates \nThe history of MS DOS is part legend, part myth, but either way, it is responsible for Bill Gate's fortune, as well as that of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. \nMS DOS Microsoft \nThe story goes: IBM was building a new device, a personal computer, using a fast new chip and it needed an operating system. \nIt went to the guy who was famous at the time for building operating systems for small computers. Legend has it, he wasn't home because he was a pilot and out flying, so the meeting never happened. Another version says he did meet with IBM but couldn't agree on price. \nMeanwhile, IBM also decided not to write all the software for the new device itself and came to a tiny company called Microsoft to partner on a language called BASIC. Microsoft had become known for this language. \nIn talking to IBM, Bill Gates heard of IBM's predicament for an operating system so he went out and bought one, and hired the guy that created it to turn it into MS DOS. It was one that competed with the pilot's operating system. Legend has it, he paid $75,000, offered it to IBM for $50,000 with the stipulation that Microsoft was allowed to license it to other PC makers, too. \nAnd with that Microsoft's empire was born. The business model of licensing the same operating system to many PC makers took off, and the PC industry flourished. Flash forward a couple of decades and Bill Gates became the richest guy in the world.",

      "title": "Microsoft releases Windows 10 for PCs build 14986 to the Fast ring - here's what's new",
      "text": "Star Wars: The Old Republic \nStarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm \nThe Binding of Isaac \nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt \nTerraria \nTom Clancy’s The Division \nTotal War: WARHAMMER \nWarframe \nWorld of Tanks \nTip: You can control this feature through the Windows Game bar settings. In the settings dialog, look for the “Show Game bar when I play full-screen games” checkbox. See Major Nelson’s post on Game bar for more info on how to adjust settings for best game performance. \nTaking your Windows Ink experience to the next level: We’ve already announced and released some of the improvements that will be coming for our pen and Windows Ink users with the Creators Update, and with this build we’re excited to announce some more! \nResuming previous screen sketches: We’ve heard your feedback that it can be too easy to accidentally lose your Screen Sketch sketch, so we’re excited to announce that with build 14986 you can now resume previous sketches! By default, when you open Screen Sketch, it will always open to a new screenshot, but now you can click on the Resume button and it will take you back to the sketch you were working on when Screen Sketch last closed. \nUpdated Ink Flyout Visuals: The Windows Ink pen, pencil and highlighter flyouts now show a preview of what it would look like to ink with the currently selected color and width. This improvement will be visible in any app that uses Windows Ink with the Windows 10 Creators Update SDK. We’ve also updated the flyouts so that they’ll no longer show what appear to be duplicate color entries when in high contrast, now support using the Esc key to close the flyout, and have returned the flyout to dismissing once you tap a color or change the width (rather than staying open until you manually close it) \nFiner control over ruler rotation: We’ve updated the Windows Ink ruler to now rotate in sub-degree increments when you’re moving it with touch, so as to make it easier to line the ruler up with two points on the screen \nPolishing your inking experience: The cursor will no longer be shown while you’re inking – we believe this makes the experience feel even more like pen on paper. \nNew Extensions in Microsoft Edge: Great news! We have new extensions to share with Windows 10 users. Please take a look at Ebates, Intel TrueKey, and Read & Write. Try them out and send feedback to the Feedback Hub or @MSEdgeDev on Twitter. \nUpdated Rendering Technology: We’ve changed the rendering technology used for many types of UWP app content, so please provide feedback through the Feedback Hub if you notice any new visual glitches in UWP apps. For additional context on this change, we are now widely using the same Windows.UI.Composition API that app developers have access to for XAML UWP app and shell rendering. \nNarrator improvements: Making our products more accessible is a goal of ours and improving the experience when using Narrator is a big part of that. As such, this flight comes with a number of improvements, including: \nNarrator has a new feature to give you additional information about fonts, colors, line spacing, margins and more. Press Caps Lock + F to hear this information. Continue to press Caps Lock + F to cycle through nine categories of information. Use Shift + Caps Lock + F to move through these categories in reverse. \nThe default level for a Narrator feature called Context Awareness is now set to 2. You will hear additional information as you move around areas such as the Start Menu, Office ribbon and more about the areas you are in. Use Alt + Caps Lock + / to cycle through the different options. Zero means off for the feature. \nThe key to get advanced information about the item with focus has been changed to Caps Lock + 0 from Caps Lock + F in Narrator. \nWe fixed an issue from recent flights where Narrator would only say “No item in view” when placing focus on the Start menu tiles. \nIf you haven’t already read our plan for what to expect in 2017 with the Windows 10 Creators Update, and Office 365 – we invite you to go over it now. Lots of exciting things yet to come! \nNew Windows Defender dashboard: We are making it easier for you to view and control Windows 10 device security and health features available on your PC or tablet with the availability of a new dashboard coming in the Windows 10 Creators Update. Windows Insiders will get a preview of the new experience beginning today. After upgrading to this build, Insiders will have to restart their PC. After that, they can find the dashboard by searching for “Windows Defender” and clicking on the search result that says “Windows Defender/Trusted Windows Store app”. Remember, the dashboard is a work-in-progress and not fully functional just yet. \nRegistry Editor improvements: Continuing our theme of enhancing your registry experience, we’ve taken your feedback and added the familiar File Explorer keyboard navigation shortcuts to Registry Editor, so you can now easily go up (Alt+ Up arrow), backwards (Alt + Left arrow) or forwards (Alt + Right arrow) in the registry. We’ve also added a new entry point in the View menu so you can customize the font Registry Editor uses. \nThe USB Audio 2 Class Driver and You: Previous builds flighted to Windows Insiders have contained a Microsoft class driver for devices that support the USB Audio 2.0 standard. However, if you had a third-party driver which was specifically written for your device, Windows would use that instead. In order to get more miles on the class driver, we are temporarily changing things as of 14986 to prefer the class driver over third-party drivers – this is so we can flush out device compatibility issues and other bugs in our driver. \nWhen you have a chance, please go through all your regular listening scenarios and see how they sound (we’ll be adding a Quest about this too!). If everything works fine for you, awesome! If you do run into a problem where our class driver does not work with your device, please let us know by filing a problem report, and then manually switching to your specific third-party driver \nSome things that we are already aware of: \nOur class driver does not support ASIO \nOur class driver does not work in WASAPI exclusive mode in certain applications \nFor the most recent information on USB Audio in Microsoft Windows, see https://aka.ms/usbaudio. \nImproved Update Experience: Windows strives to keep your device running the most secure, reliable and feature rich version of Windows available with minimum impact to you. We’ve heard your feedback, and as such, 14986 comes with two more improvements in this space: \nInvolving you more when specifying a time to update: For some of you though, receiving these updates has resulted in your device not being available for use when you needed it. For those of you that happened to fall into this category, you will be happy to see that we now have moved to involving you more in specifying when to successfully apply a pending update. If Windows Update in unable to find a good time to restart your machine to apply the latest updates, you will now get be prompted to “restart now”, “Schedule” a time that works for you, or simply “Remind me later” which will not apply the update but offer you these options again. \nMaking it easier to free up space for upgrading: Sometimes PC disk drives fill up. When they do, you have to clear up space in order to install the latest update. Previously, this could be a bit of a hassle, but now we’ve simplified the process to help you through it and polished it up a bit along the way, so you can easily see how much space is needed, what your options are for creating it, and then make it happen. This updated Windows 10 setup page will be displayed in white (as shown below) when you encounter this issue while upgrading using Windows Update (there will be a link in Windows Update Settings to fix issues that will bring you here), and in blue when upgrading using an ISO (where there will be a link to fix issues before proceeding with the upgrade). \nAs you can see, there is quite a bit that's new in today's build. The new features seem really exciting, so we'll leave you to it. Tags",

      "title": "Here's what's fixed, improved, and still broken in Windows 10 for PCs build 14986",
      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft today released Windows 10 for PCs build 14986 to the Fast ring . As with all Fast ring builds, it originated in the Development Branch, and it's a preview of the upcoming Creators Update, previously only known as Redstone 2. \nThere are quite a few new features in today's build, including a number of improvements to Cortana, Windows Ink, more Edge extensions, and quite a bit more. But as always, there's a long list of fixes, improvements, and known issues. Here's what got fixed and improved in Windows 10 for PCs build 14986: \nWe have improved the Windows Hello face which may require you to “Improve Recognition” to get recognized again. To do this – go to Settings > Accounts > Sign-in Options and under “Windows Hello” and “Face Recognition”, select “Improve Recognition” to go through the Improve Recognition wizard. \nWe updated the Taskbar’s context menu settings entry to now explicitly be called “Taskbar settings”, as that is where it pointed. \nWe fixed an issue where the Virtual Touchpad’s left and right buttons might not work on some devices. We also fixed an issue where the Virtual Touchpad wouldn’t launch if the primary monitor was non-touch, and added the Virtual Touchpad icon to the Taskbar settings where you can Turn system icons on or off. \nWe fixed the issue where apps such as Store, Photos, and People might launch on their own after your PC had been inactive for a period of time. \nWe fixed the issue where navigating to Settings > System > Battery would crash the Settings app. \nWe’ve changed the default state of the Handwriting Panel to be floating next to the text field, rather than docked at the bottom of the screen. If you prefer docked-mode, you can still select it by tapping the icon in the top right corner of the Handwriting Panel. \nWe fixed an issue where using ~ to switch languages using the Thai keyboard when typing in Office apps, such as Outlook or Word 2016, might sometimes result in a hang. \nWe’ve updated our migration logic, so that going forward from 14986 the default user’s numlock setting will now be preserved across upgrades. \nWe fixed an issue where double-clicking on an Excel document to open it from File Explorer would crash Microsoft Excel. \nWe fixed an issue where Windows Hello might get stuck “Looking for you”. \nWe fixed an issue Insiders with Surface Dial may have experienced recently where rotating the Dial could result in unexpected beeps. \nWe’re moving some things around in Storage Settings – stay tuned for future updates. For this flight, you’ll notice that the settings to change save locations has moved to its own page. We also fixed an issue where Storage Usage for the Other category might show an unexpectedly high number. \nWe fixed an issue where the PowerShell entry in File Explorer’s File menu would sometimes be unexpectedly greyed out. \nWe fixed an issue where the Clock and Calendar flyout in the taskbar wouldn’t launch when the display language was set to Chinese (Traditional) and the system was using the phonetic sorting method. \nWe’ve updated the full screen Settings search results to now use smaller icons – we feel this delivers an overall more polished feel, as well as enables more search results to display on the page at a time. \nWe fixed an issue where some notifications might draw too high or too low, and then be seen moving itself to the correct position. \nWe fixed an issue where the outline incoming notification toasts could still be seen if notification banners as a whole for that particular app had been turned off. \nWe fixed an issue Insiders may have experienced where the Favorites bar on desktop might appear empty, despite having items in the Favorites folder. \nWe fixed an issue that could result in CPU throttling when idling on certain webpages with many gifs or looping videos in Microsoft Edge. \nWe fixed an issue that could result in Alt + D sometimes not being able to set focus to the address bar in Microsoft Edge. \nFor Insiders with PCs that upgraded to builds 14926-14959, some default power settings may have been lost and not recovered on subsequent upgrades. The effect of this causes devices to potentially use more power, change the power button behavior on tablets, etc. Starting with 14986, an attempt to detect this issue and re-apply the power settings will be made during upgrade. This attempt is a temporary process to help address this issue for Insiders, and will be removed once we’re closer to the Creators Update release. \nWe’ve heard your feedback, and updated our Windows Error Reporting logic so that uploading crash data should no longer interfere with online game play, video streaming, Skype calls, or other network-intensive activity. Please keep an eye out for this if you experience any crashes and let us know how it goes. \nWe fixed an issue resulting in Microsoft Studios games like Microsoft Sudoku, Jigsaw, Minesweeper, Taptiles, and Treasure Hunt potentially freezing at the splash screen on launch. \nWe fixed an issue where, if the taskbar location was set to be on top, it was visible on the Welcome screens after upgrading. \nHere are the known issues: \nUsing keyboard monitor hotkeys to adjust brightness won’t work as expected. Desired brightness change could be done via the Action Center or by going to Settings > System > Display. \nYou may see a popup “Catastrophic Error” dialog when opening OneDrive folders. If you do, the workaround is to open an elevated Command Prompt or PowerShell window and enter “attrib -O ”. \nWe’re currently investigating reports that DirectAccess isn’t working for some Windows Insiders. \nWhen using Microsoft Edge with Narrator, you may hear “no item in view or silence when tabbing or using other navigation commands. You can use Alt + Tab when this happens to move focus away from and back to the Edge browser and then Narrator will read as expected. \nHey Cortana, play on doesn’t work immediately after installing the app. Wait 5 minutes for indexer to kick in and try again. \nCurrently, the Windows Defender dashboard is primarily aimed at providing some minimal read-only status for Antivirus/Firewall, with some very limited functionality for interacting with the app. Here are some of the known issues with the dashboard to be aware of (not a comprehensive list): \nDoesn’t accurately roll up status of Pillars \nDoesn’t accurately show status when a 3P AV is on the machine. \nHistory is not yet available in the new app \nAdvanced/Custom scans are not yet available in the new app \nSettings are not configurable through the new app \nFirewall control panel not launchable from new app \nFirewall settings are not configurable through the new app \nMost of the known issues for this build seem relatively minor, and there really is a lot of new stuff to play with, so if you're feeling curious, you might want to install it. \nIf you're on the Fast ring, you can grab build 14986 by going to Settings -> Update & security -> Windows Update -> Check for updates. If you're not, go to the Windows Insider Program tab and click Get started. Once your PC reboots, go back and set it for the Fast ring. Tags",

      "text": "\nToday, Microsoft released Windows 10 Build 14986 with some major new features across Cortana, Windows Ink, and more. Along with Cortana, Microsoft is also introducing some major improvements to the default browser in Windows 10 — and that is, of course, Microsoft Edge.\nThe build introduces partial support for CSS variables to Microsoft Edge, which is undoubtedly one of the most talked about features in web development and design at the moment. The update also brings performance improvements to the DOM, which will possibly make sites load a tiny bit faster. Other additions include core platform support for the Fetch API and support for the Brotli data format as an HTTP content-encoding method.\nHere’s the full list of new features that are being added to Edge’s web platform with build 14986:\nSupport for the Brotli compressed data format (on by default) as an HTTP content-encoding method Support for the individual transform syntax for CSS transforms (behind a flag) Updated the MS-prefixed FIDO 2.0 implementation to match the latest W3C Web Authentication specification Partial support for CSS Custom Properties (aka CSS Variables) Preliminary implementation of the Payment Request DOM API (Behind a flag) Preliminary support for the IntersectionObserver API Core platform support for Fetch abstraction (behind a flag) Async/await is on by default (previously behind a flag) DOM performance improvements Along with the above web developments, Microsoft is also introducing improved debugging experience for ES6 Modules, and some other debugging improvements:\nConsole filter settings will persist for buttons and context menu. Improved ES6 Modules debugging experience Fixed an issue that prevented attaching the F12 Developer Tools to Windows web apps As you can see, Edge has picked up quite a lot of improvements with build 14986. With the upcoming builds, Microsoft will likely add new features to the browser itself, which should be pretty exciting to see.\n",

      "title": "Why Is Apple Letting Microsoft's Surface Kill the Mac?",
      "text": "Windows Insider Why Is Apple Letting Microsoft's Surface Kill the Mac? More than ever, Microsoft is in a position with its hybrid PC to challenge Apple in the space of innovation. By Ed Bott 12/07/2016 \nIf you're a professional whose job takes you out of the office frequently, chances are the short list for your next PC will include a MacBook Pro and a Microsoft Surface. \nAfter stumbling badly out of the gate with the original Surface RT in 2012, Microsoft has recovered to win excellent reviews with its Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. Meanwhile, Apple continues to sell roughly 20 million Macs a year, most of them in the MacBook family. The result is an unlikely head-to-head competition for the only slice of the PC market that is both growing and profitable. \nEven more improbably, Microsoft now finds itself being hailed as the innovator in modern PC design, with Apple hearing loud criticism for its outdated devices and timid technology decisions. \nHave we fallen through the looking glass? Not exactly. But the tale of these two product lines says a lot about what both companies think of the future of computing, with two very different approaches to the convergence of traditional PCs and mobile devices. \nAs far as Apple is concerned, the PC of the future will be a descendant of the iPad Pro, with a screen large enough to handle side-by-side documents. \nThe Mac, on the other hand, is a legacy device, as far as Apple is concerned. The biggest tell? Six years after the debut of the iPad and four years after PCs began shipping with touchscreens, Apple adamantly refuses to add touch capabilities to the MacBook line. \nThat design decision is not just stubbornness. Rather, it's a deliberate decision that Cupertino made after watching Microsoft's Windows 8 woes. Apple's Phil Schiller admitted as much in an interview with British newspaper The Independent in October: \"If you made the Mac a touchscreen you'd have to figure out how to make it a good experience with your finger on a touchscreen. Trust me, we've looked at that -- it's a bad experience. It's not as good or as intuitive as with a mouse and trackpad.\" \nThe new MacBook Pros get a second touch surface (the Touchbar), but when it comes to the main display, you can look but not touch. \nMeanwhile, Microsoft has gone all in with touchscreens. More important, it has built Windows 10 to support what insiders refer to as One Core. The same core Windows code runs on every version of Windows: desktops, notebooks, ARM-based tablets and phones (yes, Windows phones still exist), the Xbox One console, and an unfathomable number of Internet of Things devices. Those devices have a large number of common APIs, as well, which makes Universal Windows Platform apps possible. \nThe reengineering work that went into One Core took years, but the first step is now complete. As a result, Microsoft can ship updates to all of those Windows 10 platforms simultaneously and support some decidedly nontraditional form factors. \nIn short, Microsoft's approach to convergence starts with its classic PC hardware and software, adding new capabilities to the OS to support new devices and services. Apple's approach is to put its version of the classic PC on a glide path to obsolescence and concentrate on beefing up its newest platform, the iPad Pro. \nSo, where should you place your bets? Well, Apple has done a spectacular job of encouraging developers to write apps for iOS. In fact, one of the most prolific developers of them all is Microsoft, which has dozens of professional apps in the Apple store, including the heavyweights in the Office family -- Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint. \nMicrosoft has a compelling developer story on paper. Write one app and then make a few small changes to different devices? That approach sounds great, except for the fact that Windows has only a meager share of the market for mobile devices. \nIncreasingly, I'm convinced that there's room for both iOS and Windows, with devices defined more by screen size and connectivity than by which OS they happen to run. In a world where online services define work, the platform itself is a matter of personal preference. Where that leaves the Mac, however, isn't so clear.

      "text": "Informed news analysis every weekday Microsoft tunes R Server 9.0 for machine learning Microsoft is tooling R Server to be a resource for working with data where it already lives InfoWorld | Dec 7, 2016 Use   Why you need to start using Polymer for your Web development \nEver since Microsoft announced it was acquiring Revolution Analytics , which created the flagship distribution of the R language for math and statistical analysis, speculation circulated as to what Microsoft might do with such a prize. Maybe it would rewrite R from the ground up or shut off R behind closed-source doors. Instead, Microsoft elected to keep the core R product free and open and has built Microsoft R Server atop that foundation. \nToday, Microsoft rolled out R Server 9.0 , outfitted with features that reflect R's usefulness in machine learning and as a server. Even more important, it also hints at how Microsoft wants to make R into a resource that can work with data where it lives. [ Download the InfoWorld quick guide: Learn to crunch big data with R . | Sign up for InfoWorld's Big Data Report to stay atop all the latest news and developments in the field. ] Smarter than your average bear \nMachine learning has long been one of R's staple applications , so it comes as little surprise that it's the focus of the two biggest new features. \nFirst is the new MicrosoftML package of Microsoft-authored machine learning algorithms that can be used alongside the conventional open source CRAN R packages. Some are exotic, high-end projects, such as GPU-accelerated deep neural networks. Others are more conventional, like a fast random forest. \nAlgorithms aren't much good without a data source, so R Server adds support for Spark 2.0, the long-awaited upgrade to the in-memory data framework. R Server already supported Spark 1.6, but 2.0 added new methodologies for handling streaming data and a revamped memory management subsystem for better performance. \nNew R Server data sources also come with this upgrade: Apache Hive for real-time queries, and Apache Parquet for high-speed data serialization, both of which can be used by Microsoft's proprietary ScaleR functions that can run in parallel. Tapping into Spark is important, but Microsoft's real intention is to make R's connectivity as broad and, thus, as future-proof as possible. Serve the data where it lives \nR Server 9.0 is also future-proofed thanks to improvements to the \"server\" part of its name. The new version provides data-oriented services from R Server to applications or endpoints -- and in Microsoft's parlance, to provides the analytics and the connectivity where the data lives. \nFor starters, R Server 9.0 allows R models to be converted to web services without being translated to the language of the application deployed. This can be done by using the Swagger standard to generate APIs for the R service. Then, the target app simply needs to talk to R Server through the API. \nIn the bigger picture, R Server is only one piece Microsoft's long-term plan for R. As a component, it can be added anywhere data services already exist, and R programmers can plug directly into it. Microsofthas detailed such plans for SQL Server 2016; the most recent Community Technology Preview of that app allows T-SQL stored procedures to have R code stored inline and executed against SQL Server R Services. \nFor one possible analogy for Microsoft's R plans, look to Linux. The Linux kernel remains a collaborative open source project, but multiple commercial outfits place it at the center of professional-level products for which they sell support. Likewise, the core open source R project is available on its own, with R Server as a professional-grade distribution bearing Microsoft's proprietary add-ons. The point isn't to get the average R developer to switch, but to awaken enterprise interest for R and give reasons to delve in. Related:",

      "text": "Microsoft fixes Windows 7 'Group B' security-only patching method Great news: TechNet blog eschews fixing Win7/8.1 security-only bugs with monthly rollup patches InfoWorld | Dec 7, 2016 Use   The Windows 8.1 user's guide to navigating Windows 10 \nIn what may be the most important news for ongoing Windows 7 customers since the patchocalypse , Microsoft field engineer Scott Breen has both analyzed the key problem with \"Group B\" security-only patching in Windows 7, and has promised a solution. \nDon't be put off by the title -- Update to Supersedence Behaviour for Security Only and Security Monthly Quality Rollup Updates . The underlying message is crucial for Win7 and 8.1 users who aren't connected to a corporate update manager. [ InfoWorld has you covered through all stages of Windows 10. Download the Windows 10 installation superguide and the ultimate Windows 10 survivor kit , both available as PDFs. | Stay up on key Microsoft technologies with the Windows Report newsletter . ] \nThe crux of the matter lies in the way Win7 (and 8.1) users update their machines, starting last October. I divide the patching universe into two hemispheres: Group A is willing to take all of Microsoft's new telemetry systems, along with potentially useful nonsecurity updates. It installs the Monthly rollup (in Microsoft parlance the \"Security Monthly Quality Rollup\" patch). Group B doesn't want any more snooping than absolutely necessary and doesn't care about improvements like daylight saving time zone changes. But it does want to keep applying security patches. It installs Security-only patches (Microsoft-speak \"Security Only Quality Update\"). \nThe key problem arises when Microsoft introduces a bug in a Security-only patch and then fixes that bug in a Monthly Rollup patch. By forcing Security-only updaters to install a non-security rollup, Microsoft effectively bars customers from only installing security patches. \nBreen illustrates the problem with this graphic. A bug in an October Security-only patch was fixed in a November monthly rollup. (I believe he's referring to the MS16-087 print spooler bug .) \nSays Breen: \nThis resulted in customers using WSUS or Configuration Manager 2007 being unable to deploy security only updates using the built in software update mechanisms without additional workarounds. \nIt also threw the Win7 (and 8.1, Server 2008 R2, Server 2012, and Server 2012 R2) patching community into a black hole. Although few people realized it, the integrity of the security-only patching method was at stake. Many knowledgeable Win7 patchers simply threw in the towel: If Microsoft was going to force them to install the non-security (read: telemetry) patches, they didn't want any of it. They didn't sign up for Windows 7 snooping, so they stopped patching entirely . \nI'm very happy to report that Microsoft has acknowledged the error of its ways. Starting this month, Breen says, bugs in Monthly Rollup patches will be fixed in Monthly Rollup patches, and bugs in Security-only patches will be fixed by changing the metadata in those patches. \nThose of you who deal with WSUS or SCCM can read his article and see how that key change will ripple into the WSUS listing. For those of you who just worry about patching Windows 7 (or 8.1, Server, etc.), you can stick to your guns. If there's a bug in a Security-only patch, it'll get fixed in a Security-only patch -- possibly the same Security-only patch will be re-issued, perhaps a subsequent patch will just roll over the bad one. \nIt's a great day for Windows 7 and 8.1 customers.

Credit: Martyn Williams How IBM's Watson will change cybersecurity \nSlack and Google have vastly deepened their partnership roughly a month after Microsoft announced its competitor to the popular enterprise chat service. \nToday saw the announcement of several new features aimed at making G Suite, Google’s set of productivity software and services, more useful to people who use Slack. The functionality resulting from the partnership will make it easier to share and work on files stored in Google Drive using Slack. [ How to integrate Microsoft Teams with others apps . | 6 secrets to mastering Slack . | Chat happens: Your guide to 8 group chat services . | Cut to the key news in technology trends and IT breakthroughs with the InfoWorld Daily newsletter . ] \nA representative for Slack said that Microsoft’s introduction of a competitive product ( Microsoft Teams ) that is expected to become generally available next year didn’t have an impact on the company’s decision to deepen its integration with Google. \nBut the partnership has clear benefits for both companies. Slack becomes more useful for G Suite users, and Google gets to make its productivity suite a more attractive offering to those organizations that want to use Slack. \nGoogle is building Drive Bot, which will inform users about changes to a file stored on Google Drive, and let them approve, reject and settle comments in Slack, rather than opening Google Docs. It goes along with Slack’s continuing embrace of bots as a key part of the chat service’s vision of productivity. \nWhen users share a file from Drive in Slack, the chat service will check the sharing permissions on the file and make sure that it’s set up so that everyone in a channel can access what’s being shared. If the settings don’t match, users will be asked to modify them. \nTo go along with that, users will be able to associate Team Drive folders with particular Slack channels. That means the Marketing folder for members of the marketing team inside a company can also be linked to the team’s Slack channel. \nWhen users upload files to a Slack channel with a linked Team Drive, the files will be backed up inside Google’s cloud storage service. When Team Drive files get changed, users will be notified using Slack. \nIn addition, Google and Slack are working together to give users access to previews of Google Docs that they share in Slack, so it’s possible for people to see inside a file at a glance without having to open it. \nIt’s not yet clear when all of this functionality will make its way into Slack, however.

      "text": "\nToday, Microsoft released Windows 10 Build 14986 with a bunch of new features and improvements to Insiders. One of the most notable new additions in build 14986 is the new Windows Defender app which the company showed off back at its Windows 10 event in October. The new Windows Defender app is currently in preview, which means it will have a couple of rough edges and that’s completely expected.\n\nThe new Windows Defender app introduces a modern design for Windows Defender just like most of Microsoft’s modern Universal Windows Apps. The app includes a pretty simple Windows 10 UI with a hamburger menu that makes navigating around the pretty easy.\nIn terms of features, the new Windows Defender app includes all the basic features you’ll find on the classic Windows Defender. For example, you can scan for any threats in your PC with the new app, and you can also check for protection updates right from the Windows Defender app. However, Microsoft notes that the new app may lack some features which isn’t anything surprising to see as the app is still under development — here’s the company’s full statement:\nWe’re working hard on adding new features and finishing our new look, so not everything is ready quite yet. Some features you’re loooking for may not be available now, which is why the previous version of Windows Defender is still available on your device.\nWe’re looking forward to hearing your feedback on the improvements we’re making to Windows Defender!\nHere are some more screenshots of the app:\nGallery Once again, the new Windows Defender is only available to Insiders running build 14986 — which you can know more about here. If you aren’t a part of the Windows Insider program, you’ll get to try out the new Windows Defender along with a range of other improvements with the Windows 10 Creators Update which is expected to be available in March 2017.

      "text": "  3 screenshots Block domains that could be used to send data to Microsoft and disable tracking services in Windows 10 with the click of a button The launch of Windows 10 was nothing if not controversial, considering the long list of complaints related to telemetry settings and data collection attempts. Therefore, there have been numerous attempts to find workarounds to Microsoft's initiatives to enhance the user's experience by gathering Windows usage information. Win.Privacy is one of the many applications that aims to reduce the amount of data that is sent home to Microsoft in Windows 10. Press a button to protect your privacy in Windows 10 Win.Privacy is designed with simplicity in mind, enabling the user to fix privacy-related issues with the click of a button. But simple is not always good. The application it does not offer the possibility to check which fixes should be applied and which shouldn't. It does include a readme file to briefly let the user know about the changes that will be made to the system but all the actions are performed in batch, with no option to exclude unneeded fixes. Considering the above, creating a system restore point before using it is recommended, if not mandatory. The user can carry out this operation manually before using Win.Privacy, but it should be noted that the application creates a new restore point prior to applying its privacy-related fixes. Nevertheless, users can undo some of the changes Win.Privacy makes to their PC, or they can restore a previous state of Windows that does not include the fixes. Blocks tracking services and adds new domains to the hosts file Once the 'Fix Privacy Issues' button is pressed, the 'Logs' area starts filling in with all the fixes Win.Privacy applies. To begin with, the 'DiagTrack' and the 'dmwappush' services are disabled and then deleted. Secondly, the hosts file in Windows is modified and a long list of domains that are known to be accessed when Windows 10 sends data to Microsoft are blocked. As such, communication between the Windows 10 computer and Microsoft's servers is hampered, at least partially. Optionally, users can also disable the Windows Update service, location tracking and the Hibernate function. Lacks many Windows 10 privacy tweaks other similar apps have Win.Privacy could be a good option for users who are looking for a quick and easy fix for Windows 10's privacy issues. However, there are many other areas this application does not take into account, unlike its competitors. As such, users shouldn't expect it to fully restrict Microsoft's access to their private data. While Win.Privacy does block telemetry-related domains and services, not providing clear information about what each fix does to the operating system and not offering users the possibility to choose the tweaks they want to apply are important drawbacks.

(GO-Trust) announced the immediate availability of the GO-Trust Authenticator. This is a whole new approach for securely logging into Windows or MAC and then into Cloud Services. The User’s iPhone or Android phone communicates with the work computer and once the User’s identity has been confirmed via the ‘one touch’ fingerprint sensor or the ‘one click’ camera for facial recognition, a secure dialogue logs into Windows or MAC with the equivalent of a long and complex password. There is nothing for the User to remember other than to bring his phone to the office. The GO-Trust Authenticator also works with Microsoft Office 365, G Suite by Google, Salesforce, Box and many others. The authentication mechanism supports both PKI and FIDO UAF. The GO-Trust Authenticator can also be used, with the same simplicity “One Touch” to sign/encrypt e-mails and office documents. This Smart News Release features multimedia.

      "title": "Microsoft releases new Windows 10 preview with more Cortana commands, Ink enhancements",
      "text": "Microsoft today started rolling out a new Windows 10 preview build for PCs for those who participate in the Windows Insider program.\nBuild 14986 comes about a week after Microsoft released build 14977 for Insiders but strangely only made it available for Windows 10 Mobile. Build 14977 followed build 14971 . Sure enough, this update may well be worth the wait, because it contains a lot of changes.\nCortana Windows 10’s Cortana virtual assistant gets smarter in this build especially when it comes to running basic system-level functions. Now Cortana can shut down, restart, and lock your PC or put it to sleep, or adjust the volume, Dona Sarkar, a software engineer in Microsoft’s Windows and Devices Group, wrote in a blog post . \nIf your PC is programmed to use U.S. English, Cortana can also play individual songs and albums and music from certain artists and genres from iHeartRadio and TuneIn. Cortana can also start playing radio stations through those apps. And now you can ask Cortana “what song is playing,” in any app, and she will tell you. \nMicrosoft is also making it possible for people in China (those using Simplified Chinese) to ask Cortana to identify the song that’s playing.\nAnd when your computer is unlocked and idle, if you say “Hey Cortana” and wait for around 10 seconds without touching your PC, Sarkar wrote, Cortana will now respond in full-screen mode.\nAnd now on Windows 10 PCs, Cortana will let people sign in with Azure Active Directory work or school accounts instead of managed service accounts (MSAs). You can sign in by visiting Cortana’s Notebook and selecting About Me.\nInk In addition to Cortana, Windows Ink is also getting several optimizations. The Screen Sketch feature that arrived in the Anniversary Update now lets users keep working on your most recent sketch, by hitting the new Resume button.\nWhen you’re using Windows Ink, the cursor will disappear. And Ink’s ruler can now “rotate in sub-degree increments when you’re moving it with touch, so as to make it easier to line the ruler up with two points on the screen,” Sarkar wrote. Additionally Windows Ink flyouts will show previews of using implements like pen, pencil, and highlighter with the color and width that’s selected at that moment.\nMicrosoft is also changing options for updating Windows 10. \n“If Windows Update in unable to find a good time to restart your machine to apply the latest updates, you will now get be prompted to ‘restart now,’ ‘Schedule’ a time that works for you, or simply ‘Remind me later’ which will not apply the update but offer you these options again,” Sarkar wrote.\nAnd, she wrote, the process of clearing up storage space on your PC when installing a new Windows update has also been revised:\nPreviously, this could be a bit of a hassle, but now we’ve simplified the process to help you through it and polished it up a bit along the way, so you can easily see how much space is needed, what your options are for creating it, and then make it happen. This updated Windows 10 setup page will be displayed in white (as shown below) when you encounter this issue while upgrading using Windows Update (there will be a link in Windows Update Settings to fix issues that will bring you here), and in blue when upgrading using an ISO (where there will be a link to fix issues before proceeding with the upgrade).\nThe Windows Game Bar now works in full-screen mode with 19 more games: Arma 3, Battlefield 1, Civilization V, Dark Souls III, Fallout 4, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Mad Max, Mafia 2, NBA 2K16, Overwatch, Star Wars: The Old Republic, StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, The Binding of Isaac, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Terraria, Tom Clancy’s The Division, Total War: Warhammer, Warframe, and World of Tanks.\nMicrosoft has improved Input Method Editor (IME) for people using Windows 10 in Chinese and Japanese. And for people using the Narrator screen reader, the app can provide more information aloud about user interface characteristics such as fonts, colors, and spacing, by hitting Caps Lock-F.\nThe standard-issue Windows Defender antivirus tool has a new dashboard, although it’s not complete yet.\nAnd there are three new Edge extensions: Ebates, Intel TrueKey, and Read & Write.\nBug fixes and known issues The build contains quite a few significant bug fixes.\nSometimes the Windows Hello biometric authentication system gets stuck and says it’s “looking for you.” No longer, thankfully.\nSometimes going to Settings > System > Battery would cause Settings to crash, and that won’t happen anymore.\nDouble-clicking on an Excel file while in File Explorer won’t crash Excel anymore.\nApps like the Store, Photos, and People won’t randomly launch if your PC is inactive for a while.\nIn Edge, there won’t be anymore CPU throttling when you’re looking at websites with a bunch of GIFs or videos that play in a loop, and the Alt-D keyboard shortcut should now set the focus to the address bar as it should.\nAnd if you’re one of those people who have a Surface Dial — that newly released hockey puck-like hardware product that lets you control apps, even sometimes onscreen in the case of the Surface Studio — you’ll be pleased to learn that rotating the device won’t make it suddenly beep.\nThat said, as you might expect, the new build does have known issues. \nAsking Cortana to do things within certain apps may not work right after you install them. Sarkar recommends trying again in five minutes after Windows’ indexer has gotten a chance to index app content. Additionally when you open a folder in OneDrive, a “Catastophic Error” dialog box might pop up. Sarkar suggests that you open an elevated command prompt window (hit Start, type “cmd,” and right-click on Command Prompt, and select “Run as administrator”) or elevated PowerShell window (hit Start, type in “Powershell,” right click on Windows PowerShell, and select “Run as administrator), and type in attrib -O . (To learn about the other known issues and bug fixes in this build, take a look at Sarkar’s entire blog post .)\nIf you want to try this new build for PC or mobile but you’re not a Windows Insider, you can sign up here .\n",

      "title": "Why 4chan trolls failed to corrupt the Mitsuku bot",
      "text": "GUEST: \nYou may remember back in March this year when Microsoft unleashed Tay, an artificially intelligent chatbot, onto Twitter. Tay learned by interacting with users, and in less than a day the AI had been corrupted by a group of hackers from the /pol/ board on 4chan, who taught the chatbot to be racist and sexist .\n4chan is an open imageboard website where users can post anonymously. The 4chan /pol/ board is the politically incorrect board on the 4chan website, and it has become notoriously racist and offensive. Due to the ability of users to post anonymously, the website has become a free-for-all where people can get away with posting almost anything with no accountability.\nRecently I wrote an article about Mitsuku, an AI chatbot developed by Steve Worswick that won the most humanlike AI category in the Loebner prize this year . On the 20th of April, Steve began to notice that Mitsuku was receiving an unusual amount of traffic. In normal circumstances when this happens, Mitsuku has just been featured in an article somewhere on the internet, but that was not the case this time.\nUnlike Tay, when Mitsuku learns, she learns locally and emails Steve, who decides whether the information she has learned should be incorporated into her global knowledge base. Steve had begun to receive a lot of emails from Mitsuku. She had been taught about Hitler, feminists, and various offensive topics.\nIt was not long before Steve received a Google alert that pointed him in the direction of the /pol/ board on 4chan, and he was able to locate the culprit thread that was attempting to corrupt Mitsuku.\nThroughout the day Steve followed the thread and sat back and watched as people posted screenshots of what they had taught Mitsuku, gloating about how they had corrupted the AI. Steve posted several comments informing people that in fact Mitsuku had not been compromised, and that none of the offensive information had made it to Mitsuku’s global knowledge base, but the board board members ignored this and continued to post screenshots glorifying the fruits of their labor.\nAt one point there were 100 concurrent users interacting with Mitsuku, which was above the norm of roughly 10-20 users. The would-be hackers were sending roughly 18,000 interactions per minute, almost six messages per second in a bid to corrupt Mitsuku in the way they had succeeded with Tay. Due to the amazing technology at Pandorabots where Mitsuku is hosted, the increase in traffic posed no issues to the AI. The bot was able to handle and respond to each and every input.\nAfter about four or five hours, the 4chan hackers realized that their attempts to convert Mitsuku into a foul-mouthed racist were having no effect globally and decided to give up.\nOne of the features of the 4chan boards is that threads get deleted after a certain amount of time, so the original thread was deleted. In July a different group of hackers on the 4chan website who were unaware of the earlier failed attempts decided to try exactly the same thing.\nAgain thanks to Mitsuku’s supervised learning, their efforts were a total waste of time, and Mitsuku was left unharmed and uncorrupted.\nOnce again in November, yet another group attempted to corrupt Mitsuku with the same outcome. The (very offensive) thread from the hack attempt is archived here . The thread is no longer active. No doubt they will try once more (and fail) to corrupt Mitsuku.\n",

Credit: Microsoft \nWindows 10 Build 14986 , which Microsoft released on December 7, allows users to shut down, restart, lock and put their PCs to sleep by asking Cortanta by voice. They also can raise and lower system volume and control music playback (US English only) with iHeartRadio and TuneInRadio by voice with this latest Creators Update test build. \nMicrosoft also is adjusting Cortana's look when PCs are unlocked and idle, making it more usable for \"far field\" viewing. By saying \"Hey Cortana,\" PCs running Build 14986 will be able to see results to questions from across the room. Cortana can also be used to sign in using Azure Active Directory identity using a work or school account instead of a user's Microsoft Account, if they so desire. \nPC testers also will get a preview of the new Windows Defender dashboard in this latest build. Defender provides device security and health status information. And Microsoft is adding some new Registry Editor tweaks in this build, as well. \nThere are new enterprise-cloud-printing capabilities included in today's new test build, as well as some tweaks to the Windows Ink experience around flyout visuals and other areas. \nThere are also a few new Edge browser extensions in Build 14986: Ebates, Intel TrueKey and Read&Write. There are more Narrator improvements meant to make Windows 10 mroe accessible. \nLate last week, Microsoft officials temporarily \"paused\" availability of Windows 10 PC test builds in order to add Unified Update Platform (UUP) support to Windows 10 for PCs. UUP will allow users to avoid having to download full new builds every time there's a feature update; they'll be able to get differential feature updates only, reducing overall update size/time. (Microsoft already added back-end support for UUP to mobile test builds .) \nToday's blog post on Microsoft's latest test build doesn't mention whether this new UUP functionality will affect testers any time soon. However, Build 14986 does allow users more granularity in specifying when their devices receive updates, plus tweaks designed to help users more easily free up space for upgrading. \nThere are other improvements and fixes in today's build, including updates for Windows Hello face, virtual touchpads, app-launching and navigation issues and more.As always with Insider test builds, there are known issues , too, which are itemized in today's blog post.

      "text": "Social Media Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Microsoft vow to cut off terrorist content The platforms are sharing a database to log and quickly quash the spread of hateful content online. Instagram also announced features to quell harassment. By Beki Winchel | Posted: December 7, 2016 Tweet In a time of growing divisions and increasingly negative online commentary, social media and tech companies are making a stand. \nFacebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft have pledged to come together to stop the spread of terrorist content online. \nA recent post on Facebook’s newsroom reads , in part: Starting today, we commit to the creation of a shared industry database of “hashes” — unique digital “fingerprints” — for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images that we have removed from our services. By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms. We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online. Our companies will begin sharing hashes of the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all of our respective companies’ content policies. Participating companies can add hashes of terrorist images or videos that are identified on one of our platforms to the database. Other participating companies can then use those hashes to identify such content on their services, review against their respective policies and definitions, and remove matching content as appropriate. \nThe Verge reported : Social networks have faced criticism this year for doing too little to prevent their platforms for being used to spread terrorist propaganda. Amid pressure from the European Union, the companies agreed this year to remove content within 24 hours if it qualifies as hate speech or propaganda . Meanwhile, Twitter faced a lawsuit in the United States alleging that its slowness in removing posts from ISIS constituted material support to the terrorist group. The lawsuit was dismissed in August. \nCNN Tech reported : The European Commission found that only 40 percent of hate speech published on the firms' platforms was reviewed within 24 hours. \nFor those worrying about user privacy, the companies clarified that the “hashes” database doesn’t contain identifiable user data: As we continue to collaborate and share best practices, each company will independently determine what image and video hashes to contribute to the shared database. No personally identifiable information will be shared, and matching content will not be automatically removed. Each company will continue to apply its own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content when a match to a shared hash is found. And each company will continue to apply its practice of transparency and review for any government requests, as well as retain its own appeal process for removal decisions and grievances. As part of this collaboration, we will all focus on how to involve additional companies in the future. Throughout this collaboration, we are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and their ability to express themselves freely and safely on our platforms. We also seek to engage with the wider community of interested stakeholders in a transparent, thoughtful and responsible way as we further our shared objective to prevent the spread of terrorist content online while respecting human rights. \nCould this unifying force be enough to affect the spread of other damaging content, such as fake news? Some expressed hope that it might be. Given the recent discussions about the spread of fake news on social media, one hopes this new collaboration could potentially pave a path for the companies working together on other initiatives going forward. \nInstagram using new features to crack down on harassment \nThough not a move to address terrorist content per se, Instagram also recently announced additional features to cut down on harassment and abusive comments. \nIn a blog post, the company said : Comments are where the majority of conversation happens on Instagram. While comments are largely positive, they’re not always kind or welcome. Previously, we launched the ability to filter comments based on keywords. This was an important step in giving you more control over your comments experience. However, there are two more features we think will improve this experience. We’ll soon add a way to turn off comments on any post. Sometimes there may be moments when you want to let your post stand on its own. Previously this was only available for a small number of accounts. In a few weeks, it will be available for everyone. Tap “Advanced Settings” before you post and then select “Turn Off Commenting.” You can also tap the … menu any time after posting to turn commenting back on. \nInstagram also enables users to remove abusive followers and report self-injury posts. \nConsumerist reported : Users who have set their accounts to “Private” will now also be able to remove followers they have already accepted, something that wasn’t possible before without blocking that user. Anyone you remove from your list of approved followers won’t be notified. To help those who may be struggling in the community, Instagram is also adding anonymous reporting for self-injury posts. If you report a friend who may be thinking about hurting themselves, Instagram will connect your friend to organizations that offer help. \nNo matter whether it’s terrorist content or bullying remarks, more social platforms are likely to make additional moves to battle virtual hatred. \nPerez wrote: … [B]ecause of their outsized influence on today’s web, these companies are beginning to wake up to the fact that they will be held accountable for the content shared on their platforms, given that content has the ability to influence everything from terrorist acts to how people perceive the world and even politics on a global scale. \nWhat do you think of these efforts, Raganreaders?",
