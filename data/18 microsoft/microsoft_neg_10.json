      "text": "Xbox One Continues to Lead Sales, According to Microsoft Trending up. By Seth G. Macy \nThe Xbox One was October's best-selling console, according to a statement from Microsoft. \n\"Xbox One was once again the best-selling console in October in the U.S., U.K. and Australia,\" according to results given to Microsoft by The NPD Group and GfK Entertainment. \nOctober marks the fourth consecutive month Xbox One bested PS4 in US sales , and the second month for the UK and Australia. In July, Xbox One was the top selling 8th-generation console, but that month saw the Nintendo 3DS at the top of overall console sales. \nMicrosoft said the launches of Gears of War 4 and Battlefield 1 helped drive console sales, with Gears of War 4 coming in as the number one \"platform-exclusive title for October\" in both the US and UK. Microsoft credited both Gears and Battlefield with increasing the number of multiplayer gamers on Xbox Live by 52 percent over the same period last year. \nAt the end of last month, Microsoft revealed its holiday Xbox One bundles , including Gears, Battlefield, Minecraft, and FIFA options. \nThe full NPD numbers for the US won't be released until next Thursday. \nSeth Macy is IGN's weekend web producer and just wants to be your friend.

      "title": "Xbox Project Scorpio news: Specs and features speculations suggest it will be the console to beat",
      "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it \n(Microsoft Project Scorpio) The upcoming Xbox Project Scorpio gaming console is said to be the most powerful one. \nAfter Microsoft announced the coming of the Xbox Project Scorpio earlier this year, players have been waiting for the details of the console to be shared. While nothing much is officially known about it, supposed leaked information suggests it will soon be the console every player would like to have. \nXbox One remains to be one of the most popular consoles to date, and Xbox Project Scorpio is said to feature big improvements from its predecessor. According to reports , the upcoming game console is said to support virtual reality (VR) technology in high fidelity. It is said to boast of 320 GB per second of memory bandwith and is said to support 4K gaming as well. \nWindows Central also describes the console as a one-stop shop for Windows 10 and Xbox One development. The source further explains that Xbox Project Scorpio will \"be able to mimic and Xbox One at a hardware level so developers can test how their games scale between different power levels.\" \nXbox chief Phil Spencer says that Xbox Project Scorpio will sport 6-teraflops of computational power, which is a big improvement from Sony's 4.2-teraflops PlayStation 4 Pro making it the most powerful console ever made. Advertisement \nSeveral games have already been revealed to run on the console with the help of the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) that has standardized the API tools across the Windows 10 device family. This means that any game programmed for UWP on Windows 10 will easily run on the upcoming device. \nSony arguably dominates the market where gaming consoles are concerned. Nintendo recently launched its Switch device, which has also generated interest in the market. It is also an attempt to bring their name back on top of the game. Will Microsoft's Xbox Project Scorpio surpass them all come 2017? That is something players have to find out. Copyright ÂŠ   Like Us",

      "title": "Microsoft’s Mike Ybarra reveals why Xbox One gaming has become more social",
      "text": "  \nYesterday, Microsoft rolled out the Xbox Holiday Update to the Xbox One and its cross-platform Xbox app , bringing several new social features to the Xbox Live network such as Group Messaging, Clubs and Looking For Groups. Following this major release, head of platform engineering at Xbox Mike Ybarra gave a lengthy interview to VentureBeat to explain what the Xbox team is doing to make Xbox Live a better social experience. \nWhile online multiplayer gameplay still requires an Xbox Live Gold premium subscription on Microsoft’s Xbox consoles, Ybarra acknowledged that the Xbox team needs to have a forward-looking approach towards what is becoming an increasingly important part of the gaming experience: \nGames have evolved from largely single-player experiences to team experiences. Working together as part of a group to accomplish a task. As games evolve, Xbox Live has to evolve to make sure that we’re in front of what customers and game developers expect. \nBut the purpose of the Xbox Holiday Update is also to give more incentives for gamers to spend more time on Xbox Live, chat with their friends and explore user-generated content. “We wanted to focus on a lot of the top feedback around bringing people together on Xbox Live, making it easier to find friends, making it more inviting to play with people that have the same likes I have,” he explained. And the company is also really proud of its mobile apps, with Ybarra adding that “the engagement is very high.” As for future updates, the exec announced that “It’s our commitment to make sure that when new features come out, users can engage with those anywhere they are.” Clubs on Xbox Live. \nAs for the new social features on Xbox Live, Ybarra shared that Looking For Groups could well give some competition to dedicated websites that passionate gamers use to find people to play with: \nTo me it’s all about giving gamers the choices they want and making it as easy as possible. We don’t want people to have to bring up websites, find websites for different games. We bring that all together in one place across our phone app, the Windows 10 app, and the console. \nHowever, the new Arena feature which will let Xbox Live users create their own tournaments will remain in preview for now as the Xbox team is still polishing it. “It’s one of the features that’s among the highest growth areas in e-sports, in terms of developer and consumer interest. We’re very excited about what that’s going to bring, explained the exec, adding that « we’re having a lot of discussions with developers about what that means and how we differentiate ourselves in a meaningful way that provides value to them.” If you haven’t done it yet, you can try all the latest Xbox Live social by installing the latest software update on your Xbox One or by downloading the latest versions of the Xbox app on Windows 10, Android or iOS. For Xbox One users, Major Nelson announced earlier this week that the Xbox One Preview Program would soon become the Xbox Insider Program which will no longer be invite only. “I love the preview audience we have. They give us invaluable feedback. They’re some of our most passionate fans. Their feedback impacts the product across the board, whatever it is we do,” he explained.  ",

      "title": "Microsoft Office Android Apps Confirmed To Get Chrome OS Support: Company Works Closely With Google To Make It Happen",
      "text": "Microsoft has confirmed that its Office mobile suite will work with Chrome OS. The move is largely driven by the Chromebook's new capability to run native Android apps. ( Google ) Advertisement \nChrome OS has just become one of the world's fastest-growing operating systems as Chromebooks zoomed past Apple Macs in terms of sales in the United States. This is perhaps the reason Microsoft announced that it is collaborating with Google to bring its Office mobile suite for Android to the Chrome OS. On Chrome OS Support \nThe critical variable here is Android compatibility. It could further solidify Chrome OS's position as the second most popular OS in the United States because of the ability to run Android's native apps. The consensus is that Chrome OS now has increased value, along with the expectation of an uptick in Chromebook demand. \nThe Office productivity apps are available on the Android platform and observers have predicted it is only a matter of time before these also get ported to the Chrome OS. Microsoft's Position \nOn one hand, an insurgent Chrome OS should set alarm bells for Microsoft since Chromebooks are now directly competing with entry-level and even mid-range Windows laptops. Keeping the Office suite out of Chrome OS's reach would have been an effective strategy to check its growth. \nOn the other hand, Microsoft has been pursuing the so-called \"cloud-first, mobile-first\" policy , which aims to make its productivity apps such as those bundled in the Office suite available across different platforms. This is the reason the Office mobile suite is now available in iOS, Android and Windows Phone platforms. The Chrome OS is, therefore, a logical destination for the Office productivity apps. Microsoft-Google Collaboration \nSome users will probably notice that, presently, the Office suite for Android does not work on their Chromebooks. The reason for this is simple: Microsoft is currently optimizing Office to provide users with the best possible experience. \n\"Our strategy has not changed. Office for Android is supported on Chrome OS devices via the Google Play Store,\" Microsoft said . \"While Google Play on Chrome OS is in beta, we are partnering with Google to deliver the best experience for Chromebook users and plan to make the apps available on all compatible devices by general availability.\" \nThe purported refinement efforts could also include the development of monetization schemes. The Office suite that has rolled out for some Chromebooks already reflects this. Users who own devices with displays larger than than 10.1 inches will need an Office 365 subscription. Otherwise, they cannot create, edit and print documents. This rule has exempted the Asus Chromebook Flip so its users have free access to the entire range included in the mobile Office suite for Android. © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

      "text": "After iOS and Android, Windows 10 Mobile Finally Getting Authenticator App Microsoft Authentication for Windows 10 Mobile available Nov 11, 2016 13:18 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft officially introduced the new Authenticator app earlier this year, but while the company rolled out new clients for iOS and Android, the Windows 10 Mobile version was only in beta stage, as engineers still needed to test and improve some of its features. Of course, with iOS and Android clients already up for grabs, it was super frustrating for Windows users to stick with the beta, especially given Microsoft’s increasing focus on non-Windows systems. So today, Microsoft officially introduced the new Authenticator app for Windows 10 Mobile, coming with the same features as on the rival platforms, including a new user interface, as well as with support for wearables and certificate-based authentication for enterprise customers. This new app replaces the Azure Authenticator, Microsoft account, and Multi-Factor Authentication apps. In case you’re wondering what wearables the app supports, the official description of Authenticator names Apple Watch or Samsung Gear, but a Microsoft Band should work just fine too. And last but not least, Microsoft Authenticator also offers one-click push notifications, with Microsoft explaining that “you only need to click the “approve” button in the notification to complete your login. (And in most cases, you won’t even need to open the app to complete the approval.)” Obviously, the app is available free of charge and can be downloaded from the Windows Store right away (Windows 10 Mobile is mandatory).",

      "text": "Brazil to Replace Open Source Software with Microsoft Products GO Windows 10 and Office likely to be adopted by the government Nov 11, 2016 09:34 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​ The Brazilian government is reportedly pondering an en masse transition from open source software to Microsoft products, including here Windows 10 and the Office productivity suite. ZDNet writes that Brazil is asking federal government bodies to express the intention of buying Microsoft software by Friday, November 11, in an effort to “generate cost efficiencies and standardize the IT applications across departments.” Previously, the government was betting big on open-source software, pretty much because of the reduced licensing costs, but at the same time, authorities pushed for continued development of similar products that could help address the need for a wider range of solutions and options. But it appears that the lack of interest from developers, as well as the lack of skilled professionals, caused this plan to fail, so Brazil is now looking to migrate from its open-source model to Microsoft as part of what’s described as the biggest purchase of products developed by the Redmond-based software giant that ever took place in the country. Microsoft scoring big Specifics are not available for the time being, but it appears that Windows 10 and Office are two of the products that government departments are most interested in, along with Windows Server that should help set up the needed infrastructure to manage data. Microsoft hasn’t issued a statement given the fact that negotiations are still under way behind the closed doors, but there’s no doubt that if Brazil goes for its own products, this is a major win for the American giant, especially because it replaces open-source software. In the last few years, open-source solutions have been more widely adopted, not only in the consumer market, but also among authorities across the world, and the city of Munich has pioneered this transition. And yet, recent reports indicate that even Munich is considering a potential return to Windows and Office , as some departments are complaining about the efficiency of the LiMux operating system and the other open-source software solutions.",

      "text": "Microsoft Gives Apple Users More Time to Trade Their MacBooks for a New Surface GO Redmond extends MacBook trade-in program Nov 11, 2016 09:02 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​ Microsoft launched a trade-in program earlier this month to convince Apple users to give up on their MacBooks and instead buy a Surface, and the company has just extended the end date for a reason that’s yet to be disclosed. Originally supposed to end on November 7, the trade-in program will now run through November 23, obviously while supplies last (so if you don’t hurry up, you might not be able to take advantage of this offer and get a Surface in exchange for your MacBook). The plan here is to convince MacBook users to switch to Microsoft Surface by offering them substantial discounts when giving up on their Apple devices, but for the moment, it’s not known how many buyers actually purchased new Windows 10 devices using this offer. Up to $650 in store credit And yet, Microsoft is giving quite impressive price cuts if you bring in a used MacBook and depending on production year, model, working condition and available accessories, you could receive as much as $650. “To be eligible for trade-in, you must own the qualifying device, device must power on battery must hold charge and not be required to be plugged in to operate, and be in fully functional, working condition without broken/missing components, cracked display/housing, liquid damage, modification(s) or have device warranty seal broken to be considered working. Cannot be password protected, and include original chargers/accessories. Must contain hard drive,” Microsoft explains. The store credit that customers receive can be used for the purchase of a Surface Pro 4 or a Surface Book, as both of them are positioned as direct MacBook competitors, although they provide more functionality, such as touch support. The trade-in offer is only available in the United States and for the moment, there are no plans to expand it beyond its borders, although there are many people out there who’d happily give up on their old MacBooks for a new Surface model.",

      "text": "Hacker Compromises Microsoft’s Windows 10 Browser in Just 18 Seconds GO Microsoft Edge was hacked twice at this year’s PwnFest Nov 11, 2016 06:36 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft Edge, which the Redmond-based software giant praised on several occasions for its high level of security, was hacked twice at PwnFest, with one of the attacks being successfully completed in no less than 18 seconds. Security experts from Chinese firm Qihoo 360 managed to steal the show after they managed to break into Microsoft Edge and WMware Workstation without user interaction, The Register is reporting. In the case of Microsoft, there were two successful exploits, both of which were based on SYSTEM-level code execution in the browser. One of the vulnerabilities was exploited by a security researcher team at Qihoo 360, while the other one was discovered by South Korean hacker Lokihardt, who managed to break into the browser in just 18 seconds. Their efforts were rewarded with $140,000, but details of the exploits were submitted to Microsoft in order to patch them and prevent other successful attempts in the future. According to the same report, a Qihoo team also managed to hack VMware Workstation 12.5.1 and received an award of $150,000 for discovering the exploits. Patch Tuesday fixes Microsoft has already patched some security flaws that the hackers planned to use in their exploits and the company will most certainly do the same with the other ones that allowed the hackers to break into the browser, but given that details have been shared privately, no user is put at risk in the meantime. For example, the November 2016 Patch Tuesday rollout brought us MS16-129 , which is a cumulative security update for Microsoft Edge that blocks Remote Code Execution flaws, and likely some of which were supposed to be used at PwnFest (although exploiting them requires user interaction, whereas hackers’ attempt didn’t involve such a thing). “This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Microsoft Edge. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users with administrative user rights,” Microsoft explains. The bottom line here is that there’s no hackerproof software out there no matter the developing company and this is why it’s always critical to run up-to-date applications on your computer.",

At then event JungHoon “Lokihardt” Lee, a security researcher from South Korea and Beijing-based security firm Qihoo 360’s team revealed the two different ways with which hackers could exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge browser. The teams used the browser that ran on Red Stone1, which is the 64-bit version of Windows 10 Anniversary Edition. Also Read: Turns out iPhone 5c can be hacked with a $100 hardware \nPwnFest offers hackers and security firms a chance to showcase their talents regarding how the vulnerabilities on specific platforms can be used by cyber-criminals. A cash prize is offered to the successful participants and the good thing is that the platform developers learn about prevailing in their software or systems. The platforms included in the list are Google Pixel running on Nougat (Android Version 7), Apple Safari running on MacOS Sierra and Adobe Flash via Microsoft Edge running on Red Stone 1. \nThe target platforms and the cash reward offered against each are listed below: \nThe hackers managed to fully compromise Microsoft Edge twice and also broke VMWare Workstation twice without the involvement of user interaction. The VMWare hack was also performed remotely and a virus was introduced to the system through SYSTEM-level remote code execution. Qihoo was given 30 hours to rework the Edge bug. \nBoth Lee and Qihoo 360 were awarded $140,000 for obtaining SYSTEM-level code execution on Windows Edge and also bagged $150,000 for compromising VMware WorkStation 12.5.1. According to the team from Qihoo 360, it took them 6 months starting from March to identify the chained vulnerabilities. These included out-of-boundary write exploits, probably use-after-free, and confirmed out-of-boundary read.

      "text": "Why Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce are Battling for This $36 Billion Industry The CRM market is about to face some serious upheaval. Founder and CEO, ToutApp @ Tawheed WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement \nThe key to a successful business is happy customers and repeat business. If you don't already know this, you should. \nYou're also probably familiar with programs known as Customer Relationship Management platforms, or CRM for short. They're used to help manage customer contacts, and the industry for them is growing faster than ever. \nGartner predicts that the CRM market will be increasing to a $36.5 billion worldwide market by 2017. This will make it the fastest growing category for worldwide enterprise software led by giants like Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, Microsoft and Adobe. \nAt the same time, nearly $300 million of Venture Capital investment has already been invested into startups seeking to disrupt how this kind of sales and marketing technology works. \nWhat is it that makes this category so appealing? Why is CRM forecasted to grow faster than other enterprise software categories? Why is Gartner forecasting even bigger growth for CRM than they did earlier this year? \nThe answer is simple: disruption . CRM is Getting Disrupted \nLast month at Microsoft's Ignite conference , Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft) and Shantanu Narayen (CEO of Adobe) announced a deeper integration between Microsoft's Dynamics CRM and Adobe's Marketing Cloud. \nThis announcement was, in effect, a silent declaration of war against the well entrenched Salesforce, SAP and Oracle for the fast-growing $36 billion CRM market. \nMost CRM software today, including Salesforce, is primarily used for data entry. Salespeople are required to go to customer meetings, and then log in every day and enter what they did into the CRM system so that their managers can forecast accurately. \nThis type of software is often referred to as \"Systems of Record\" software. It's where all the data is entered and stored so that you can get a proper ledger of your business. Why Workflow Software Is Important \nEventually, this will evolve into a broader \"workflow\" type of software--and here's why that's important. \nWorkflow software will be able to automatically capture data for digital information workers. And with the advent of AI, that data can be analyzed in real-time. Insights can be delivered directly to salespeople so that they too can do their jobs more effectively. \nThe beauty of workflow software is that it'll truly unify other functions seamlessly as well. Sales and marketing people work through workflows that equally touch support, operations, finance, legal and other functions. \nA company's customer record can be unified and focused on driving communications workflows across the whole enterprise. The difference is subtle but important. The Future of CRM \nInstead of being a place where you do data-entry, CRM becomes a piece of software that helps you do your job seamlessly and communicate while the data-entry gets done for you. The data gets analyzed automatically--and insights, next steps and training are delivered to you in real-time. \nCan you imagine the software that houses all of your customer data? One that streamlines communications and workflows both internally and externally across your company, and perfectly forecasts whether you'll hit quarterly expectations? \nI can. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.  ",

      "text": "The Microsoft Bing Ads team continues to quietly build out a native search advertising network, testing it with a handful of advertisers, and plans to roll out the platform early in 2017.\nRik van der Kooi, Microsoft search advertising corporate VP, told Search Marketing Daily at the company's annual Bing Next Ads event in Redmond that the ad units not only expand on Microsoft's ad services, but also provides the company's syndication partners and their advertisers will a slew of new opportunities to use what he calls \"re-imagined\" search.\nPublishers like AOL, which is a Bing Ads syndication partner, could take advantage of this type of search ad through their portal and on Huffington Post. \nBing Ads pilots are focused on commercial verticals such as automotive, financial services and travel, and selectively building a network of experiences where intent exists. The ads could have images of just text. \nVan der Kooi said the team plans to reach out to other publishers within the next few months to expand the network as the Microsoft Bing Ads team continues to \"redefine\" search on publisher sites and create new opportunities for marketers by identifying that user intent exists outside of traditional text and image ads on search engines.\n\"Search is a service that is ultimately supply constrained,\" he said. \"We have enough demand and more advertisers seeking to create new connections or ad clicks. Many of the content services are demand constrained, so this is a way to connect the dots between the two.\"\nvan der Kooi explains that Microsoft's technology scrapes the page and run the analytics against it and based on outcome determines what ad will provide the highest value, which he says is a much better way to target ads compared with display that relies on demographics. Search takes advantage of finer intent signals.\nWhat does Microsoft Bing mean by Intent? When Market Watch visitors come to the site to research investments options, they come with the intent of researching financial options. There's an opportunity for financial companies to capitalize on the intent.\nIn another example, cruise ships, airlines and automotive rental companies would have an opportunity to reach out to potential travelers who visit travel sites looking for vacation options. And finally, people who use Microsoft Outlook Email are signed in users with the potential of being served a native ad because Microsoft has access to the data and search records.",

      "title": "Satya Nadella: The Man Who Is Transforming Microsoft (Fortune)",
      "text": "Photograph by Veronique de Viguerie November 11, 2016, 6:30 AM EST The Man Who Is Transforming Microsoft On the road with Satya Nadella’s traveling revival show. \nA blustery autumn afternoon in Dublin. Sudden clouds have cooled the red rays of a setting sun, and the resulting grays cast soft shadows on the faces of students lazily thumbing their smartphones in the lobby of the library at St. Patrick’s College Drumcondra. Behind them more than a dozen children, teachers, and administrators sit quietly. They’re awaiting the arrival of Satya Nadella, chief executive of Microsoft msft , the Seattle-area technology titan that was once the largest and most powerful company on the planet. \nGlass doors swing open and in strides Nadella, a clutch of senior staffers in his wake. He makes a beeline toward the waiting schoolchildren, pumping the hands of several administrators along the way. He sits and asks four students, each about 10 or 11 years old, what they have been working on. A boy with Robert Plant locks indulges, gesturing to a tablet computer as he haltingly explains the three-dimensional world he has coded in the game Minecraft —Nadella’s first major acquisition as Microsoft’s CEO. Nadella responds with a huge grin. “Amazing,” he says. “I need one of those.” \nAnd then Nadella is on his feet again. He’s six feet tall, but he’s got the lean physique of a long-distance athlete and a shaved head, both of which accentuate his taut silhouette, making him seem taller. Nadella runs 30 minutes each morning, preferring the treadmill to spare his 49-year-old knees from the ravages of concrete. He is deeply protective of this time; it’s one of the few moments in his highly orchestrated day when he’s alone with his thoughts. \nNadella discussing the intricacies of Minecraft coding with schoolkids in Dublin. More than mere ceremonial stops, the visits allow him to glean intelligence on how customers are using Microsoft products. Photograph by Veronique de Viguerie \nBut Nadella consistently reserves time for sessions with children—partly because they are the next generation of customers, and partly because it keeps him grounded. Nadella moves to another group of kids and then shifts his attention to a teenage student who is blind. The young woman has been working on building accessibility features using Cortana, Microsoft’s speech-activated digital assistant . She smiles and recites the menu options: “Hey Cortana. My essentials.” Despite his transatlantic jet lag Nadella is transfixed. “That’s awesome,” he says. “It’s fantastic to see you pushing the boundaries of what can be done.” He thanks her and turns toward the next group. \n“I have a particular passion around accessibility, and this is something I spend quite a bit of cycles on,” Nadella tells me later. He has two daughters and a son; the son has special needs. “What she was showing me is essentially how she’s building out as a developer the tools that she can use in her everyday life to be productive. One thing is certain in life: All of us will need accessibility tools at some point.” All the better if Microsoft can provide them. \nAnd then Nadella is gone. The executive spent just a few minutes with each group of children, tearing through the room like a tempest. By the time the twentysomething students milling around St. Patrick’s realize that an important person has descended upon their campus, he has disappeared—on to the next room, the next city, the next country in a whirlwind four-day tour that will take him to the European continent and through some of his company’s largest markets. \nWhen Nadella replaced Steven Ballmer as Microsoft’s CEO in February 2014, he inherited what you might diplomatically call a growth crisis. Undiplomatically, you might call it an existential one. “Microsoft is unable to connect with the new generation of users,” wrote Global Equities analyst Trip Chowdhry in a 2010 research note to his clients, about as damning a sentence as you can muster for a technology company. \nMicrosoft, the behemoth of Windows and Office, was fast approaching its 40th anniversary. It had the kind of cash reserves that military dictators kill for and the market share of business-school dreams. But none of the new products the company had produced under its second CEO—from its Bing search engine to its Zune, Kin, and Lumia mobile devices—generated anywhere near the revenues of the smash hits created under its first, cofounder Bill Gates. \nMicrosoft entered the twilight of Ballmer’s tenure as the most successful and wealthiest desktop-software company the world had ever seen—at a time when the world had moved on to search engines, social networking, mobile devices, and cloud computing. For the first decade of the 21st century, Microsoft was the world’s most valuable company, topping out at more than $600 billion. Apple aapl ended that run in 2010, riding its legendary turnaround under CEO Steve Jobs . By this point, for the first time in its history Microsoft was facing the prospect of a decline in its core business. \nSince Nadella took charge, the company has been engineering a stunning turnaround of its own. He has taken a company focused on personal computing but showing promise in its enterprise and cloud-computing businesses , and turned that equation on its head. In the past three years Microsoft sheared the $9.4 billion phone business it acquired from Nokia and sold its Bing mapping-data assets to Uber. It plowed billions into the construction of data centers around the globe to support its now cloud-ready products. And it made substantial leaps transforming its original software business from permanent licenses, where revenue is a one-time affair, to subscriptions, where revenue is recurring. \nNadella has even struck an audacious deal, plunking down $26.2 billion for business-networking company LinkedIn, the largest acquisition in Microsoft’s history. That’s a massive check to write, and “largest acquisition in Microsoft’s history” is a dubious title given the company’s, um, checkered track record in that realm. Optimism, it’s fair to say, has returned to Redmond. “Satya is a great leader for Microsoft,” says Ballmer, who is still the company’s largest individual shareholder. He adds that Nadella “has done a great job improving perceptions of the company in ways that can advance its agenda— with developers, industry participants, and investors.” \nAs rival Apple—with a market capitalization of $600 billion, still the world’s most valuable company—weathers criticism of ennui under CEO Tim Cook , Microsoft has sharpened its focus under Nadella. In October the company’s shares surged past their all-time high price of $59.56, recorded in the heady days of the dotcom bubble and at the tail end of a decade that the company unquestionably ruled. Never mind that because of aggressive stock buybacks that reduced the company’s share count, Microsoft’s market cap is $460 billion, far below the old peak. \nStill, the share-price resurgence was no small matter. For more than a decade Microsoft was a dead stock walking. Seemingly overnight the company was back with a vengeance. At its helm is a skinny, contemplative student of the world who revels in asking questions and couldn’t be bothered by so trivial a pursuit as warring with the company’s rivals. \nThe Palais Des Congrès, a hulking and angular 1970s-era convention center in the 17th arrondissement of Paris, was constructed on the former site of Luna Park, the largest amusement park ever built in the French capital. In the early 1900s the site was a monument to leisure. Today it is a temple to trade, with more than 344,000 square feet of glossy exhibition space on eight floors. \nOn a sunny October day the Palais is humming with thousands of people who have come for Microsoft Experiences, the company’s annual customer conference in France. Brightly colored booths promoting mobility and collaboration technologies pack the exhibition area. Attendees scurry between technical talks on DevOps and brainstorms about digital banking. Satya Nadella is No. 5 on our Business Person of the Year list. Click here to see the full list . \nInside one session, the “Blockchain Hackademy,” Nadella stands at the center of a scrum of engineers. He inspects a display showing energy-monitoring software and peppers an executive with questions. Nearby, a man wearing a costume in the shape of a Tetris block dances and hands out brochures about supply chain traceability. In Dublin, Nadella met his future customers; in Paris he is scouting future technologies. “From Bill to Steve to me, the worldview we’ve had is ‘long-term relevance,’ ” he later tells me. “It’s the batting average. You may strike out sometimes, but you’ve got to be able to, in this tech business, catch enough of them to survive in the major leagues.” \nNadella is behind schedule today, owing to some extended meetings with government officials earlier in the morning. “I’ve oftentimes described the role that Satya is in as almost like a head of state,” says LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner, comparing him to the CEOs of Apple, Facebook, and Google googl . “Tim Cook’s job, Mark ’s job, Sundar ’s job—it’s akin to that in terms of serving multiple constituencies.” \nNadella prepares for a speech at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. Photograph by Veronique de Viguerie \nThe CEO’s schedule stipulates that he’ll remain at the blockchain session for 30 minutes, but he disappears through a side door in only a handful. His usual half smile has given way to a grimmer expression, and he charges down the crowded hall with his staffers in tow. Nadella moves so quickly that I lose him in the throng. When I finally find him, he is seated behind an unmarked door, getting makeup for his keynote and reviewing points with Caitlin McCabe, his fastidious chief speechwriter. \nNadella’s address will begin the same way as all the others he delivers this week. He will first cite Microsoft’s mission to “empower every person and organization on the planet to achieve more” and acknowledge his own beginnings in India as a sign of the power of technology to democratize society. He will quickly move to painting a future of computing anchored in the so-called cloud. He will acknowledge the various forms this future takes—“small screens, large screens, in your living rooms and your conference rooms”—and echo the view that the world is facing a “fourth Industrial Revolution.” (After mechanical, electrical, and digital, it’s a blurring of the three through the cloud-powered Internet of things.) And since he is in Europe, where data privacy laws are notably stringent, he will punctuate each address with no fewer than three mentions of the word “trust.” \nI will listen to Nadella give a version of this speech four times this week—in Dublin, Paris, Berlin, and London. The bulk of his preparation happens months before at Microsoft headquarters. There Nadella, McCabe, and company workshop ideas and test them out on a real audience. (“To get the brutal, honest feedback,” he says.) Onsite, the CEO reviews only localized elements meant to cater to his audience—a partnership with Allied Irish Bank in Dublin, a deal with Renault-Nissan in Paris. \nAs Nadella prepares for his keynote speech in France , his chief of staff, a towering Princeton man who could double as a chief of security, stands guard outside the door. Every three minutes a staffer checks on his progress. Eventually Nadella emerges, slightly more at ease. He overhears my voice and pauses to ask how I’m doing, having followed him across international borders twice in 48 hours in pursuit of this story, with two more countries to go. I ask him in kind. “Halfway, is it?” he says, referring to his week’s breakneck schedule. “Not even,” I reply. He smiles and chuckles at our mutual misfortune, then marches into battle. \nIn many ways, Nadella was an unusual choice to lead Microsoft in a moment that called for transformation. He is a 24-year veteran of the company. He is an electrical engineer, not a product visionary. \nBut closer scrutiny reveals a man who managed to thrive as an exception to a corporate culture built on type-A personalities—the very kind that his predecessor embodied. It is a skill that helped propel Nadella’s unlikely rise, says Blake Irving , who joined Microsoft the same year as Nadella and went on to work with him in the company’s cloud-computing division before becoming CEO of GoDaddy. \n“There are two types of conversations you’d have at Microsoft when you’d explain things,” Irving says. “One type of person waited for a break in the argument to argue back. The other listened to learn. That was Satya.” Well before he was named CEO, Nadella “could suspend his disbelief and opinion to listen to you thoughtfully. The slight difference between listening to argue and listening to learn is not subtle. It’s huge. Satya is soft-spoken but energetic, which is a weird combination.” Satya Nadella CEO, MICROSOFT How did a soft-spoken man rise in a combative culture? Photograph by Joe Pugliese \nSatya Nadella—officially Nadella Satyanarayana—was born in Hyderabad, India, in 1967. He is the only child of Bukkapuram Nadella Yugandher, an officer for the Indian Administrative Service, the country’s civil service agency, and the late Prabhavati Yugandhar, a professor of Sanskrit. He grew up at a time when communist guerrilla fighters called Naxalites clashed with the government of Indira Gandhi. \nThe civil unrest shaped Nadella’s view on how to mobilize change . “One afternoon I saw two photographs that haunt me still,” he recalled at a 2015 dinner held in honor of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “I saw pictures of two people who were lying, overturned, on charpoys [rope beds] with two transistor radios— Philips transistor radios— next to them. In subsequent years I came to understand much more about these two people. What I saw that day were two photographs of dead revolutionaries. The year was 1970, and the district was Srikakulam. They were schoolteachers who decided to leave teaching. I think about their lives and lives of others who have followed similar paths. I think about what those people could have achieved with the true empowerment of technology and other resources.” In his first month as CEO, Nadella gave each member of his management team a book called Nonviolent Communication . \nFor years, Microsoft “cultivated leaders who wanted to run their own show,” Nadella says. No longer. “To run the show you have to work as a team.” \nFor most of his childhood Nadella attended the Hyderabad Public School, an opulent institution founded to serve the children of aristocrats. Between cricket games Nadella met his wife, Anupama, whom he married in 1992. After HPS, Nadella obtained a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Manipal Institute of Technology. Meticulous, driven, and inquisitive, Nadella then moved to the U.S. to study computer science at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee—his master’s thesis concerned graph coloring and parallel algorithms—and work as a software engineer at Penta Technologies. After graduation, Nadella relocated to California to take a job at Sun Microsystems, which was just beginning its ascent at the dawn of the era of personal computers. At 25, Microsoft poached him and brought him to Redmond. \nNadella was “super-young, awkward, and insecure, still trying to grow into the potential he had,” his hiring manager, Richard Tait, told the Puget Sound Business Journal in 2014. But he was incredibly smart and had a deep understanding of the computer systems that businesses were using. “He was a secret weapon for us.” \nIt isn’t until I get to London that I finally sit down with Microsoft’s CEO. By the time I arrive, Nadella has ticked almost every box on his daily schedule: government meetings, check; keynote speech, check; educational event with children, check. I catch him leaving the offices of the Economist on an unusually warm day in the British capital. There’s a spring in his step, perhaps because he’ll be home soon. We pile into a waiting black van, and his driver takes off toward Luton Airport, 34 miles northwest of London. \nI ask Nadella how this European trip fits into his broader strategy since he became CEO two years ago. He notes the tactical importance of the company’s cloud build-out in Europe and the “words and actions” needed to smooth its progress. (Once an antitrust bête noire, Microsoft can enjoy one benefit of no longer being the biggest, baddest boy on the block: a bit less scrutiny from regulators. The company is now content to let Brussels officials tangle instead with Alphabet and Facebook fb . For its part, Microsoft is positioning its data centers as investments that support European data-protection laws.) \nNadella articulates a broader purpose to his foreign missions. “What does a CEO get to do? You’ve got to pass judgment on an uncertain future and curate culture,” he says. “For both, I feel, I learn a lot from these trips.” \nThat’s what Nadella does: He learns, and others learn with him. The CEO extracted intelligence in each European capital. In car rides from the airport he received briefings on how regional businesses are faring. In meals with partners Nadella got up to speed on issues in a target market. (“They’re trying to size you up,” he says. “What is this guy like? What is he trying to get done with this company?”) In closed-door meetings with officials he digested government priorities and pushed Microsoft’s interests. (“Government leaders will give it to you straight: ‘Okay, here’s your relevance to me,’ ” Nadella says.) In solo speeches he clarified the company’s priorities to rank-and-file employees. \nNadella admires the skyline of Paris’s business district in between meetings. Photograph by Veronique de Viguerie \n“I’m a fundamental believer—because of maybe where I grew up—in the role of a multinational company,” he says. “You’ve got to be able to think about operating globally. If a for-profit entity is only profit seeking, then you’re not going to be a long-term profitable company. That’s kind of a paradox of business, I think.” \nAs is controlling the direction of a company that operates in 192 countries. I ask Nadella how he assembled his senior leadership team to spark the change he wanted to see at Microsoft. In 2015 he consolidated the company’s engineering efforts under three executives—Terry Myerson, Scott Guthrie, and Qi Lu (who has since left Microsoft for health reasons)—and bid adieu to several more, among them former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop. His resulting management team, from CFO Amy Hood to Guthrie, whom Nadella earlier appointed to replace him as head of the Cloud and Enterprise Group , comprises mostly longtime company veterans. Can Microsoft really change from within? Has its moment of clarity, more than a decade in the making, truly arrived at the hands of people who also presided over some of Microsoft’s greatest flops? \nNadella has done “a great job improving perceptions of the company in ways that can advance its agenda,” says Steve Ballmer. \nYes, Nadella maintains—if you fix the culture. “I’ve optimized for people who want to work as part of a team,” he says. For years Microsoft “cultivated leaders who wanted to run their own show.” No longer. “To run the show you have to work as a team. That’s a very different Microsoft. That’s at a premium for me.” In his chosen leaders Nadella prizes the abilities to bring clarity, create energy, and suppress the urge to whine. “I say, ‘Hey, look, you’re in a field of shit, and your job is to be able to find the rose petals,’ as opposed to saying, ‘Oh, I’m in a field of shit,’ ” he says. “C’mon! You’re a leader. That’s what it is. You can’t complain about constraints. We live in a constrained world.” \nBefore long I run up against my own constraints, and the van slows and pulls to the side of the six-lane highway to let me out. I ask Nadella if there’s anything I missed in my barrage of questions at 60 mph. He pauses. “I sometimes feel that business success is celebrated in much more narrow ways,” he says. “Real business success is not only surplus that you’ve created for your own core constituency but the broader surplus. After all, what is capitalism? Being able to get productivity gains that actually help the broader economy in society.” \nPerhaps. So far Nadella has taken huge strides. He has managed to gain the market’s confidence and the goodwill of his own employees. His expensive push to reorient the company to the cloud rather than the desktop has proved shrewd. On the eve of his third anniversary of becoming Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella is riding a hot hand—but it’s a long, daunting road back to becoming the largest and most powerful company on the planet. \nA version of this article appears in the December 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline “Satya Nadella’s Traveling Revival Show.”",

      "text": "By Kyle LeClair on November 11, 2016 \nShown off previously at events such as Gamescom and Microsoft’s pre-PAX [email protected] event, Tequila Works and Cavalier Game Studios’ isometric supernatural murder mystery The Sexy Brutale already seems like one of 2017’s most promising indie games. And in preparation for its current release window in the first quarter of next year, Tequila Works is now releasing a series of character trailers for all of the doomed guests in the game’s cursed perpetual party, beginning with one for Reginald Sixpence, AKA “The Clockwork Baron.” \nAppropriately enough, Reginald was the focus of the gameplay demo shown off at the aforementioned events, where the goal was to save him from a grisly demise, figuring out how to do so via a series of time loops and peeking in on various events while making sure not to get caught spotted by assailants and supernatural forces. As mention in the trailer below, he also happens to be the one who crafted the majority of mysterious mechanisms found in the titular casino/mansion. So what motivations led to his demise, and how does he fit into everything else? We’ll find out next year, when The Sexy Brutale hits PC and consoles. In the meantime, we eagerly anticipate the bio of the next victim… Post navigation",

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft has released today a new update to the Outlook Mail and Calendar app on Windows 10 Mobile which brings quick actions on notifications to the production ring (via Windows Central ). To use this handy feature, you’ll first need to turn on notifications banners in the settings. Once you get a new notification, you can just swipe down on it from the home screen to display the two quick actions buttons. If you missed the notification banner, you can still access the quick actions in the notification center. Quick actions can be accessed from both the home screen and the notification center. \nQuick actions can be configured in the settings (those quick actions will be the same than the in-app swipe actions) if you want to change the default options which are “Delete” and “Set flag.” To try this feature, make that you have downloaded the latest version 17.7466.41148.0 of the Outlook Mail and Calendar app.",

As an example, the Microsoft Store started selling refurbished Surface devices two months ago , and there is also a current trade-in program for MacBook owners looking to switch to the increasingly popular 2-in-1 form factor. \nBut as of today, on Veteran’s Day, the US Microsoft Store is currently offering up to 10% discounts on select hardware, accessories, Office 365 subscriptions and more for Military, vets, and their families. The offer will be valid in the US and Puerto Rico until December 31, 2016 or while supplies last. Here are the detailed conditions: It’s only available for active, former or retired military personnel and family members in the United States. A maximum of one item can be purchased per order. This offer excludes Xbox One consoles, Xbox Live Gold subscriptions, Windows phones with contract, refurbished products, Office 365 University, and services. This Military discount is not combinable with other promotional pricing. Military Deals on the US Microsoft Store. \nIf you’re eligible for these military deals, we invite you to check this dedicated web page to see what is available for purchase. As an example, you will be able to save 10% on Office 365 subscriptions but only 5% on Surface devices and other PC accessories. In this story stream:",

In-memory technology can dramatically speed processing for big data workloads, and the technology has become increasingly popular. \n\"In-memory technology helps optimize the performance of transactional (OLTP), analytics (OLAP), as well as mixed workloads (HTAP),\" blogged Rohan Kumar, general manager of Microsoft's Database Systems group. \"These technologies allow you to achieve phenomenal performance with Azure SQL Database—75,000 transactions per second for order processing (11X [performance] gain) and reduced query execution time from 15 seconds to 0.26 (57X [performance gain]).\" He also noted that the new in-memory capabilities do not carry an extra fee. \nSeveral other vendors offer in-memory technology, notably SAP with its HANA platform.",

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft is being investigated for anti-competitive practices in Russia, due to a complaint from Kaspersky Lab. \nThe Russian security firm has taken umbrage with Microsoft’s security software Windows Defender, which it accuses of blocking competitor software from working properly. Kaspersky claims Microsoft is imposing an unfair time limit for third-party antivirus programs to work with Windows 10 upgrades, thus replacing it with Windows Defender. \nIt said that this compatibility time window has been reduced from two months to six days in Windows 10. As a result, anyone updating to Windows 10 will find that their Kaspersky software is no longer working and they have been moved over automatically to Windows Defender. \nMicrosoft’s justification for shorter timeframes for software to adjust to the OS is down to the fact that it is releasing more builds more frequently. \nKaspersky filed its complaint with the Federal Anti-monopoly Service (FAS), prompting the agency to begin an official investigation on Thursday into the accusations. \nMore: New Windows 10 security update proactively hunts down viruses when your PC is idle \nThe actions from Microsoft give the company “unreasonable advantages” for Windows Defender, according to Anatoly Golomolzin, deputy head of the FAS. “Our task is to ensure equal conditions for all participants on this market,” he said. \nMicrosoft, on the other hand, said it has yet to receive an official notification from the FAS regarding this investigation and will respond once it has had an opportunity to review it. “Microsoft Russia and Kaspersky Lab have a long history of cooperation in different areas. Microsoft is committed to work in full compliance with Russian law,” a spokesperson said. \n“The company is foisting its Defender on the user, which isn’t beneficial from the point of view of protection of a computer against cyberattacks,” said Kaspersky founder Eugene Kaspersky , where he likened the disagreement to David and Goliath, with Microsoft pushing out other security software developers. \nKaspersky Lab has said it will file a similar complaint against Microsoft with the European Commission. \nMicrosoft may have an upward battle when going up against Russian regulators, though. The government has consistently favored native software companies and government agencies have been known to only use Russian-built software among staff, citing apparent security concerns.

      "text": "\nIf you are worried about Ransomware (malware which encrypt your PC and demand payment in return for your data) Microsoft has a simply message – upgrade to Windows 10, use Edge and Windows Defender and you will be well protected.\nMicrosoft notes that Windows 10 Anniversary Update is more ransomware-resilient than ever before, offering defence in depth, starting with using Microsoft’s own Outlook.com email service.\nWith email a major channel for malware distribution, Microsoft’s email services now use machine learning models and heuristics to catch malware distributed in email before it even gets to your PC.\nThe other major channel for malware is your browser, and if you use Edge Microsoft has taken a number of measures. First the Flash player is quarantined in its own isolated container and even the whole browser runs at lower privilege, so that exploit running in the browser cannot execute another program.\nIf malware does get through (e.g. via Chrome) the next layer of protection is the new and improved Windows Defender, which is enabled by default, and which can respond to new threats faster using improved cloud protection and automatic sample submission features to block malware “at first sight”. The application also features improved behavioral heuristics to help determine if a file is performing ransomware-related activities (e.g. accessing and modifying a large number of files), and then detect and take action more quickly.\nFor enterprise users Microsoft released Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection which can be combined with Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection to make it easier for companies to investigate and respond to ransomware attacks. Combined with other significant security advances, such as Credential Guard, Windows Hello and others, Microsoft says Windows 10 Anniversary Update is the most secure Windows ever.\nTo prevent damage by Ransomeware Microsoft recommends:\nUpdate to the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and accept the default security settings within Windows 10. Keep machines up to date with the very latest updates. Ensure that a comprehensive backup strategy is implemented and followed. The Block at First Sight cloud protection feature in Windows Defender is enabled by default. For IT Pros, if it was turned off Microsoft recommend turning it back on, and also recommend incorporating another layer of defense through Windows Defender ATP and Office 365 ATP. We would also add that back-up with versioning is also important and easily available to Windows 10 users.\n\nI have found an unused SD card slot with a low profile SD card is a pretty cheap and easy way to keep your data secure locally, and OneDrive of course provides the cloud back-up for free. Store your important files on OneDrive, which also features versioning, meaning you can always roll back if a file does become compromised, and enable file history on your PC ( Settings> Update and Security > Backup ).\nRead more about Microsoft’s Ransomware Protection measures at Microsoft here .",

      "title": "Steve Ballmer says phones made him 'drift apart' from Bill Gates",
      "text": "By James Walker 1 min ago in Technology Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer discussed his decision to turn Microsoft into a hardware company in a recent interview. Ballmer said his smartphone push \"strained\" his relationship with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, causing them to \"drift apart.\" Ballmer made the comments during an interview with Bloomberg earlier this month. He talked about his achievements during his 14-year tenure as Microsoft CEO, focusing on the company's move into smartphones and tablets. He admitted regret at his handling of the hardware business, saying he should have entered the market sooner. When Ballmer finally made the call to start making smartphones, it created disagreements amongst Microsoft's board. This caused a fracture in the relationship between Ballmer and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. The two \"drifted apart\" over the issue of whether Microsoft should be building its own devices. \"It was definitely not a simple thing for either one of us,\" Ballmer told Bloomberg . \"There was a little bit of a difference in opinion on the strategic direction of the company.\" Steve Ballmer was succeeded as CEO by Satya Nadella in February 2014. Under Nadella, Microsoft has transitioned back to being a software company. It has laid off much of the smartphone business it acquired from Nokia and scaled back or cancelled other hardware projects. The company retains a strong foothold in some areas of the devices industry though. Its Surface tablets and HoloLens augmented reality headset have been particularly well received since Nadella took over. These developments were started by Ballmer. He \"pushed Surface\" to Gates, paving the way for today's highly successful business. When Microsoft unveiled the original device in 2012, it was forced to take a $900 million write down on unsold inventory though. While Surface is now profitable, the same can't be said for Microsoft's virtually non-existent phone business. It currently commands less than 1% of the market. Smartphones in particular caused a \"climax\" in the disagreements between Ballmer and Gates. \"There was a fundamental disagreement about how important it was to be in the hardware business,\" said Ballmer . \"I had pushed Surface. The board had been a little - a little reluctant in supporting it. And then things came to a climax around what to do about the phone business.\" Microsoft bought Nokia's devices division for $9.5 billion. Under Nadella, it has since written down almost the entire value of the purchase after consistently failing to gain any significant market share. Ballmer is famous for having claimed \"there's no chance\" that Apple's iPhone would ever \"get any significant market share\" because it cost too much. In the interview with Bloomberg, he addressed the quote, noting he hadn't considered Apple's carrier subsidy-based business model. \"I wish I'd thought about the model of subsidizing phones through the operators,\" he said. \"You know, people like to point to this quote where I said iPhones will never sell, because the price at $600 or $700 was too high. And there was business model innovation by Apple to get it essentially built into the monthly cell phone bill.\" Ballmer suggested his biggest achievements were made after Bill Gates left his full-time position at Microsoft in 2008. In the years since, Ballmer launched the Bing search engine, giving Microsoft experience in running data centres and cloud computing. This knowledge was then used to build cloud services including Office 365 and Microsoft Azure, platforms that are now critical to Nadella's running of the company and two of the biggest money-makers for Microsoft. Ballmer now owns the Los Angeles Clippers NBA team. He is also still one of the largest holders of Microsoft stock and remains optimistic for the company's future. Microsoft's stock price recently leapt to a record high on the back of strong growth in cloud services and Surface hardware, businesses that Ballmer brought to the company. Nadella has led many of his projects to fruition and Ballmer agrees with his current direction. \"I see the stock price flying sky high and all you can say is the market certainly agrees with the direction Satya is taking the company and I'm super excited about that,\" Ballmer said during the interview.",

Microsoft and Pizza Hut have partnered to give away a free Xbox One S every hour through December 24.\nEvery customer who orders the Triple Treat Box — containing two medium pizzas, bread sticks, and a giant cookie — will be given an entry code for a “chance to win an Xbox One S 500GB console and custom Pizza Hut designed controller, as well as an instant offer for $10 off select Xbox One games while supplies last.”\nThe controller, which you can see in the image above, features the Pizza Hut logo in its center so your friends will know you received your console with a side of marinara dipping sauce.\nMore: Microsoft’s Xbox Preview Program will soon offer two models for Xbox One testers\nAlso available as part of the promotion are $10 vouchers toward the purchase of “select Xbox One games.” The current listing on Microsoft’s website suggests that new games such as Gears of War 4 , Forza Horizon 3 , and ReCore are available as part of the promotion, as well as earlier Xbox One games like Rise of the Tomb Raider and Sunset Overdrive . Pretty much any game included in the offer will be a great way to introduce yourself to the system.\nThe Xbox One S is available in retail stores and online for $300, but should you not win one with your pizza, you may want to consider purchasing the original Xbox One, instead.

      "text": "Microsoft's iOS app augments hues for color-blind folks 'Color Binoculars' is an free app that enhances the real world for anyone with color blindness. Share Save \nColor Binoculars landed on the App Store today, promising to infuse the real world with color for anyone with the three most common forms of color blindness . This isn't the first app designed to help color-blind folks see a broader spectrum of colors, but it comes from two Microsoft software engineers (one of whom is color blind), and its straightforward filter method is simple to use. \nThe app uses the iPhone camera to adjust colors in a way that makes them easier to distinguish for color-blind people. The enhanced image shows up on the iPhone screen, allowing users to pick out flowers, choose matching outfits or take in the beauty of fall, for example. \nTom Overton and Tingting Zhu started working on Color Binoculars during Microsoft's 2015 Hackathon and they finished it in the company's Garage program, which helps experimental apps go public. Overton is color blind, so he was both a developer and the app's main tester. Tom Overton and Tingting Zhu (Image credit: Scott Eklund / Red Box Pictures) \n\"It's an app that helps color blind people distinguish color combinations that they would normally have trouble telling apart,\" Overton tells the Microsoft blog . \"For example, since I have difficulty distinguishing between red and green, our app makes reds brighter and greens darker so that the difference is more obvious. It replaces difficult color combinations, like red and green, with more easily distinguishable combinations, like pink and green.\"",

      "text": "  Keep on tooting that horn, Microsoft. For the fourth month in a row, the Xbox One outsold the PlayStation 4. Since the two consoles launched three years ago, the PlayStation 4 has consistently outsold the Xbox One in all but a small handful of months. Starting in July, though, that changed. The price of the original Xbox One dropped in preparation for the Xbox One S, and the One S itself seems to have continued the trend since then. In that time, Sony launched the PlayStation VR and a slimmed down refresh of the original PlayStation 4, but those haven’t been enough to let them catch up. Microsoft released updates to two big franchises in that time, as well – Gears of War 4 and Forza Horizon 3 . Black Friday could put the PlayStation 4 back on top If this trend is going to change, though, it’s this month. Black Friday is coming and a pile of deals will accompany it. But, more importantly, the PlayStation 4 Pro is now on shelves. We’ve speculated in months past that potential PlayStation owners might be holding out for the beefed up system, and now we’ll see if that’s true. Neither manufacturer has been forthcoming with numbers in recent years, so it’s impossible to tell how much ground Microsoft has covered during this hot streak. As the PlayStation 4 Pro settles into the market and Microsoft’s own amped up console, currently code-named Scorpio, approaches release, it’s possible we could see the ball shift back and forth a few times in the coming months.",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL – November 11, 2016 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Facebook (NASDAQ:( FB - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Amazon (NASDAQ:( AMZN - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Apple (NASDAQ:( AAPL - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Microsoft (NASDAQ:( MSFT - Free Report ) – Free Report ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:( GOOGL - Free Report ) – Free Report ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free . Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog: Why Tech Stocks (FB, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL) Are Tanking Today Shares of some of the world’s largest tech companies, including Facebook (NASDAQ:( FB - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Amazon (NASDAQ:( AMZN - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Apple (NASDAQ:( AAPL - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Microsoft (NASDAQ:( MSFT - Free Report ) – Free Report ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:( GOOGL - Free Report ) – Free Report ), are in the red today as investors continue to adjust for Donald Trump’s upset victory in the presidential election. The prevailing concern surrounding tech companies under a Trump presidency is the potential changes to manufacturing and distribution that the Donald would make. For example, Trump has voiced his desire for Apple to build its products in the United States, as opposed to its current operations in China and other places abroad. Shares of the Cupertino-based tech giant slid nearly 3% in morning trading Thursday, and the stock is now down about 4% since Tuesday afternoon. Apple CEO Tim Cook was forced to send out an internal memo in the wake of the election results, reassuring employees that Apple’s “North Star” hasn’t changed and suggesting that they all move forward together. Microsoft stock also fell Thursday, with shares falling about 2.6% in morning trading. The company responded to the election results in two public ways, including a post from CEO Satya Nadella on newly-acquired LinkedIn (LNKD) that congratulated President-elect Trump and asserted that Microsoft’s goals have not changed. While Nadella remained primarily non-partisan, the CEO did link to a blog post from the company’s chief legal head Brad Smith. It was here that the sense of Microsoft’s paranoia about the future of tech became apparent; Smith made it clear that the company was ready to stand up to the government to advocate for “clearer and more modern” laws. The brutal performance of tech stocks was spread pretty evenly throughout the entire industry on Thursday. Facebook and Alphabet both slipped about 4.2% in morning trading, while Amazon fell nearly 5%. Overall, the market’s reaction to the election results seems to assume a quick adoption of the policies Trump ran on. Money is pouring out of technology and renewable energy and back into traditional energy sources and American industry. Only time will tell what President Trump actually does, and his specific policy initiatives remain relatively unclear. For now, investors seem to be trading based on his rhetoric, which may or may not manifest itself in actual changes. The market just can’t tell for sure what it’s getting right now.

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft’s Security Bulletin has been a cherished tradition for sharing highlights about patches and security fixes that it releases. Sadly, on yesterday’s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft officially declared the retirement of Security Bulletins come this January 2017. \n“Security update information will be published as bulletins and on the Security Updates Guide until January 2017. After the January 2017 Update Tuesday release, we will only publish update information to the Security Updates Guide,” the Microsoft team said in a statement published yesterday. \nThe situation is not all that disappointing, though, as Microsoft also announced a new portal called Security Updates Guide , which is already live. It will be an official replacement for the intricate Security Bulletins system and can be best described as a searchable database of security updates released for Windows and other products. But users can’t help but feel the nostalgia as Security Bulletins since they have always been a reliable source for revealing patched vulnerabilities like the MS16-129 . \n“This month we released a preview of our new single destination for security vulnerability information, the Security Updates Guide. Instead of publishing bulletins to describe related vulnerabilities, the new portal lets our customers view and search security vulnerability information in a single online database.” \nAs great as the newly launched Security Updates Guide database idea sounds, users are having a hard time wrapping their head around it and believe that the way information will now be presented will fail to be well-received. \nThe Security Updates Guide database lists publication dates, KB Article IDs, and affected products in a table. Moreover, it features advanced search functionality, including a filter to limit the listing to a particular time period, and a text or keyword search option that enables users to find updates by product, KB article or CVE. \nSome industry experts have suggested that Microsoft retiring its Security Bulletins is long overdue, and have been long expecting it since August when the company announced a new cumulative update model for Windows 7 and 8.1 modeled after Windows 10 . The company further announced that instead of releasing small individual patches that address specific issues only, a monthly update release that addresses several or all issues will be instituted instead. Microsoft further elaborates that there will be two update releases each month, one including the OS related updates while the other including only security fixes.",

      "text": "0 0 \nAfter several complaints about Surface Pro 3 battery issues, with the most recent one being acknowledged seven weeks after its filing, Microsoft is rolling out a new firmware upgrade which fixes all issues and ends all Surface Pro 3 battery problems , at least for now. \nThe now denounced Surface tablet, which has been a persistent source of displeasure, is subject to extremely rapid battery drain. So much so that it goes from full to nothing in less than an hour and a half. The battery problems with the Surface Pro 3 started way back in August and ranged from poor battery life to not being charged at all. \nThis has been the second most significant issue with Surace Pro batteries that emerged this year. The first one affected some devices shipped with batteries manufactured by Simplo, while the current one being attributed to LGC batteries . Though Microsoft never mentioned the names themselves, it did admit a simple firmware bug led sensors to report and display erratic battery charge and capacity. \nAlthough Microsoft was prompt in releasing a fix hardly a month later, users again started experiencing similar, and sometimes even worse, battery behavior. To top it off, even previously unaffected batteries now joined the defective range. Microsoft initially refused to accept the issue, which led some users paying up to $450 in out of warranty replacement charges. \nWhen battery problems first originated with Surface Pro 3, there was speculation that Microsoft purposely triggered the issue, considering that it started happening right after the warranty period for the Surface Pro 3 expired. To subdue these theories, Microsoft offered a refund to the device owners who already paid for an out-of-warranty exchange for the device. Now that a wave of complaints has risen again, Microsoft, after initially denying the issue, has finally started the refunding process again and claims they have contacted the owners privately as well. Surface Pro owners who are still waiting to receive an email regarding the matter should contact Microsoft Support here to claim their refund. \n“We’ve gathered additional details about which customers were affected and are committed to making sure that the people who experienced this issue are taken care of,” the company said. “We have reached out to those customers and all refunds were processed in October 2016.”",

      "text": "Slack vs. Microsoft Teams vs. Facebook Workplace: Which Team Collaboration Tool Will Reign Supreme? 11 November 2016, 2:23 pm EST By Regina Festin Tech Times Facebook - The World's Largest Social Network Now Playing Slack is the reigning king of online work collaboration apps, but Microsoft and Facebook are not planning to back away from the competition with their respective Teams and Workplace platforms. With their similarities and differences, which app will reign supreme? ( Microsoft ) Advertisement \nCollaborating and chatting with coworkers in the past were all about whiteboards and walled rooms. These days, team collaboration is more on emailing, video calling and instant messaging. \nApps such as Basecamp, Trello, Asana, Slack, Skype among others were developed to serve such purpose — to provide a convenient environment that users and team members can access wherever they are and at any time. \nDespite the lackluster success of Microsoft's Skype app, Slack has become the de facto king of online workplace collaboration platforms. Since its launch in 2013, the company's value rose to more than $3 billion with over 1.25 million users worldwide and 33,000 paid teams using it. \nIt looks like Microsoft and Facebook have not been sitting idly admiring Slack's success, as the two tech giants were reportedly working on their own versions of an online workplace collaborative app — Microsoft Teams and Facebook Workplace. So what do these new apps have that will make users ditch Slack ? Slack vs Microsoft Teams \nSlack and Microsoft Teams have the basics covered with the availability of general chat rooms and one-on-one private messaging. Both platforms also offer users the ability to create personal channels for certain tasks and invite whoever they want. Plus both apps allow users to search through different channels, files and team member profiles. \nMicrosoft Teams, however, has a feature that alerts a team member and directly points them to the specific content they should see within the said channel. So there is no need to dig through a lengthy conversation after logging in a few hours later. Second, Microsoft Teams has a polling tool feature to easily know the team's reactions to an idea or a subject. \nSlack users first need to download a plug-in to access the same feature. \nMicrosoft Teams also makes GIFs and memes readily searchable for those badly needed icebreakers during work. While audio and video chat is present for both platforms, Microsoft Teams created chatbots to let users go over a chat, browse the interface or provide information on specific team members. \nMicrosoft has also integrated all Office 365 apps and services such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, SharePoint, Skype and OneNote within the Teams app. Slack vs Facebook Workplace \nFirst unveiled last January 2015 as Facebook at Work, Facebook's Workplace app is currently in beta phase for more than a year. It already has 1,000 companies and more than 100,000 teams using it including the Royal Bank of Scotland and Danone. \nWorkplace's distinct advantage against Slack and other platforms is that its user interface was based on what a quarter of the world's population are using — Facebook. \nJust like the original Facebook, users can find a News Feed section, chat in groups or privately, share documents and do audio or video calls within the chat rooms. \nA relatively new feature, Facebook Live , is also present on the Workplace app that developers hope could facilitate live Q&A sessions to open up communication and transparency, a function that Slack lacks at this time. \nFurthermore, where Slack's monthly subscription tags at $6.67 per account, Facebook Workplace's monthly subscription is rather cheap at $3 each for up to 1,000 users, $2 for 1,001 to 10,000 active users and $1 for more than 10,001 users. \nThe worldwide availability of both Microsoft Teams and Facebook Workplace has yet to be announced.

      "text": "\nWhen it comes to cancer, one of the best predictors of recovery is how early the disease is diagnosed, so it is a pity many people turn to their search engine long before they turn to their doctor when they have symptoms suggestive of serious lung disease.\nOf course the vast majority of persistent coughs are bronchitis rather than lung cancer, but Microsoft researchers have discovered that, using machine learning to juggle a number of factors, they could predict with up to 40% accuracy which users making concerning searchers would actually end up with a cancer diagnosis.\nUsing a massive anonymized database of 5 million searchers and working backwards from users who had searches such as “I have just been diagnosed with lung cancer,” which are then followed up with behaviors that provide evidence of a recent diagnosis, such as multiple queries on treatment options and side effects, they have found using a number of criteria they could predict who would actually develop cancer up to a year in advance.\nSome searches, such as those related to hoarseness and cigarettes, were obvious red flags, but Microsoft’s machine learning labs were also able to identify factors deduced from the data, such as age, gender and location, which indicated areas with economic deprivation, high smoking levels, older houses with higher radon levels, and frequent long distance travel as relevant pointers to the disease.\n“Here, we are not just looking at the text of the queries; we also consider the locations that people are in when they issue these queries and we tie that back to contextual risk factors linked to those locations,” says study co-author Ryen White, chief technology officer for health intelligence at Microsoft Health in Redmond, Washington.\nUsing their model they could identify 1.5% to 40% of likely victims a year in advance, with the accuracy depending on how many false positives they would tolerate, ranging from a low 1 in 1000 to a very low 1 in 100,000.\n“People tend to whisper their health concerns into search engines on a regular basis,” said co-author Eric Horvitz, technical fellow and managing director of Microsoft’s research lab in Redmond. “This kind of data can serve as a complement to more formal clinical information.”\nThe study has just been published in the JAMA Oncology and extends research that team members published last June on the feasibility of using the text of questions people ask search engines to predict diagnoses of pancreatic cancer. It will not find any immediate application but may inform future screening systems that can catch cancers earlier in their progression.\nWith Microsoft however committed to solve cancer computationally , can I suggest a pop-up from Cortana suggested a visit to your doctor would not go far amiss and may actually save a few lives.\nRead the full report at Microsoft here .",

      "text": "Dinsan 0 Microsoft Confirms Office Apps Support For Chrome OS, But… \nContrary to earlier reports , Microsoft is NOT dropping MS Office Android apps support for Chrome OS. \nEarlier this week, we reported that Microsoft’s Office apps are not working on most of the Chromebooks which currently have access to Google Play Store. \nMicrosoft reached out to 9to5Google and confirmed that this temporary as they work with Google to improve the experience on Chrome OS. \n“Our strategy has not changed. Office for Android is supported on Chrome OS devices via the Google Play Store. While Google Play on Chrome OS is in beta, we are partnering with Google to deliver the best experience for Chromebook users and plan to make the apps available on all compatible devices by general availability.” Free Version Only For 10.1″ And Smaller Screens \nDoes that statement from Microsoft mean that all Chromebooks get free MS Office apps through Google Play Store? \nNo. \nAccording to Microsoft, the core viewing, creating, editing and printing experience is free in Office apps for iOS, Android and Windows 10 Mobile, on devices 10.1” or smaller . If users want advanced features, an Office 365 subscription is required. \nNow, what about devices with screens larger than 10.1 inches? “an Office 365 subscription is required to unlock the ability to create, edit or print documents.” That means most of the Chromebooks, except the Chromebook Flip will not have full access to Android version of Microsoft Office apps. \nI know that this is not going to make Chrome OS users completely happy, but you must understand Microsoft’s position as a software company as well. Who would give away their premium software free?",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 1 hour ago with 8 comments \nMicrosoft updated its MSN Weather app for Windows Insiders on the Fast ring today, bringing the version number to 4.17.72.0. The big new feature for the app is a transparent Live Tile. \nSuch a feature has been heavily requested for some time; Weather is one of very few Microsoft apps that comes pre-installed on a Windows phone and doesn't include a transparent tile. Users are bound to switch their focus to the new Skype Preview app, which launched as recently as the Anniversary Update but still has a solid blue tile. \nIn you're simply not feeling the transparency, you'll still have the option to go back to the old Live Tile. It's on by default, so to get rid of it, tap the hamburger menu on the top-left, select Settings, and toggle off the option that says \"Transparent live tiles\". \nThe update is live for both PCs and phones, but only for Windows Insiders on the Fast ring. You can download or update your MSN Weather app right here . If you're on the Production ring (non-Insiders), you'll likely see this update pushed to you within the next few weeks.",

      "title": "Weather app for Windows 10 gets transparent Live Tile, other MSN apps may follow",
      "text": "  \nA lot of Windows Phone fans chose Microsoft’s phone offering because of the, once, amazing interface featuring a dark theme, vibrant colours and Live Tiles. These Live Tiles often have their own colour that overlaps the wallpaper and the highest request for Microsoft’s apps like Skype, Office, Money and many more is to implement a transparent tile. This may seem like a minor thing to some, but the Windows 10 Mobile community is very serious about this small design choice. \nThe Weather app got updated today , including the highly requested feature you just read about. The new transparent tile features a transparent background, showing your accent colour or your wallpaper, when the Live Tile functions are inactive and a coloured background with coloured icons, like before, when the Live Tile shows you the current weather information. This is something the update may get criticised for as this can be seen as a “fake” transparent tile. The transparent Weather tile can be seen on the left \nThe other MSN apps may also get a transparent tile soon. I tweeted this out myself, after a couple of sources claimed it all at once, surprisingly just after the release of the above mentioned update. Transparent tiles coming for #MSN Sport, MSN Money and MSN #News on #Windows10 . pic.twitter.com/zA9ZQKDMmJ \n— Dennis Bednarz (@denaxin) November 11, 2016 \nThe changes should roll out to Fast Ring users in the coming weeks, starting with the News app, with the other two following shortly after that. The roll out may probably be the same as with the dark theme for the same apps. They won’t get it at the same time, and the updates will be rolled out very inconsistently. When the updates have been tested, they shall go to the Slow Ring and Release Preview and finally head towards regular consumers. \nAs trustworthy as sources may be, a leak doesn’t always mean thet something is guaranteed. Microsoft might change their mind, as they have done in the past, so don’t hold your breath.",

      "text": "  \nMalware of all kinds can be a terrible experience and costly in terms of lost productivity, destroyed data, and the release of potentially embarrassing or valuable proprietary information. Ransomware, though, is in its own class of bad, not only threatening data but also directly costing victims money in response. \nMicrosoft understands this, and has published a post over at the Windows blog letting its customers know just how committed the company is to defending against ransomware: \nRansomware is one of the latest malware threats that is attracting an increasing number of cyber-criminals who are looking to profit from it. In fact, in the last 12 months, the number of ransomware variants have more than doubled. Its premise is deceptively simple: infect users’ devices, and then deny them access to their devices or files unless they pay a ransom. However, the methods and means attackers are using to perpetrate ransomware attacks are increasingly varied, complex and costly. \nIn response, Microsoft is taking some specific steps aimed at slowing down ransomware and providing customers will tools to combat it: Six of the top 10 ransomware threats use browser, or browser-plugin-related exploits, so we made it harder for malware authors to exploit Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge. We increased detection and blocking capability in our email services, increasing the number of ransomware-related attachments being blocked. We added new technology to Windows Defender to reduce detection time to seconds, increasing our ability to respond before the infection can occur. We released Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection which can be combined with Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection to make it easier for companies to investigate and respond to ransomware attacks. \nMicrosoft is focusing on a few areas to deal with ransomware. They’re working to prevent it by hardening the browser against exploits, protecting email, and applying machine learning to the task. Detection is being enhanced via improvements to Windows Defender. Finally, the company is responding by providing some defense after a breach ahs already occurred. \nThe company has some advice for Windows 10 users as well: \nWe have made significant improvements in protecting customers from ransomware in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. To help protect against ransomware and other types of cyber threats, we suggest you: Update to the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and accept the default security settings within Windows 10. Keep machines up to date with the very latest updates. Ensure that a comprehensive backup strategy is implemented and followed. \nThe Block at First Sight cloud protection feature in Windows Defender is enabled by default. For IT Pros, if it was turned off we recommend turning it back on, and we also recommend incorporating another layer of defense through Windows Defender ATP and Office 365 ATP. For more information about each of these technologies and techniques and how they work, please download our white paper Ransomware Protection in Windows 10 Anniversary Update. \nWe recommend that you head Microsoft’s advice, and that if you haven’t already upgraded to Windows 10 Anniversary Edition, that you get that done as soon as you can. Security and privacy rely on updated systems that leverage all of the work that companies like Microsoft are putting into it. Let us know in the comments if you think Microsoft is doing enough to combat ransomware.",

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft Garage released an app to help people with color blindness, called Color Binoculars. Available on iOS , Color Binoculars helps colorblind people distinguish the difference in colors they normally wouldn’t see. The app was created by two Microsoft software engineers, Tom Overton and Tingting Zhu, and is being released as a Microsoft Garage app. \nOverton explains how Color Binoculars helps people with color blindness: \n“It’s an app that helps colorblind people distinguish color combinations that they would normally have trouble telling apart. For example, since I have difficulty distinguishing between red and green, our app makes reds brighter and greens darker so that the difference is more obvious. It replaces difficult color combinations, like red and green, with more easily distinguishable combinations, like pink and green.” Color Binoculars camera filter \nMicrosoft Garage is responsible for other experimental apps on iOS and Android, including Video Breakdown , Arrow Launcher , and many more.

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft has been working on unifying their operating systems into one since the migration from a Windows CE kernel in Windows Phone 7 to the newer Windows NT in Windows Phone 8. The progress of the project today is what Windows 10 has become. \nHowever, as the migration isn’t as simple as one might think, some legacy code still remains on platforms like Xbox or phones. One of these parts of the code is the Bluetooth settings page, with multiple others like “Extras” and the network settings page, which recently got updated featuring the same underlying code as its desktop counterpart. \nThe Bluetooth settings page that mobile fans of Microsoft’s operating system are currently “enjoying” is just a reskinned and poorly ported version from Windows 10 Mobile’s predecessor. This may change in the near future as come new information has been leaked onto the web , disclosing a screenshot of an internal build-powered emulator. The new page seems to be powered by the same code that the desktop version uses, which means that it could get bugfixes and general support a lot faster in the future, as Microsoft’s polish on their main Windows 10 version would transfer over to mobile. \nThe new page may be released as early as the next Fast Ring Build, judging by the speed of internal builds reaching us. When the time comes, many Windows 10 Mobile users will be happy with the change because what’s offered right now is far from an optimal experience.",

      "title": "Microsoft: Secrets Behind The Envisioning Center Doors 11/11/2016",
      "text": "Envision a home where glass in kitchen cabinets, on walls and in picture frames doubles as video phones. Where blackboards keep a running tally on the future plans of those living in the household, and smart shelves with sensors tell you why your basil in the potted plant is dying or thriving.\nTake a walk into future through the eyes of Microsoft. It felt a little like being at Disneyland with all the real-life animation and walls turning into full-sensory video telephone systems that provide insight into far-off lands, but in reality it's pieces of technology either readily available, on the drawing board, or in the minds of researchers that Microsoft engineers created and experiment with for use in a variety of applications. Microsoft calls the space the Envisioning Center. I had an opportunity to take a tour Thursday.\nThe center -- although no photos are allowed -- offers a clear picture of how Microsoft will integrate the work from across its business divisions, such as advertising, chatbots and cloud services with ERP and CRM business tools, and Xbox and HoloLens. It's also clear how data can play a role for advertisers and how the company will evolve to lead the next evolution of devices and services. \nThe Envisioning Center is a place for Microsoft to showcase its technology and its view of the future for home and office spaces. The space in various forms has been around for between 15 and 20 years. I visited the space in early 2000s, when the focus was on radio frequency identification technology and near-field communication sensors that tallied up your purchases as you walked in the front door with packages after shopping for the day.\nThe sensors would identify the product and enter it into a database, so the home owner would have a running inventory of the items — clothing to kitchen items and furniture to electronics. At that time retailers were tagging everything with RFID chips and focusing on automating inventory systems. Each home would have a server rather than being connected to the cloud.\nFast-forward 15 years and the focus turns to cloud services, sensors and video, along with a whole bunch of data that advertisers will have an option to use.",

Speculations and rumors about the technological aspect of this upcoming smartphone have spread all around, yet Microsoft has not officially confirmed any of these. \nAccording to Vine Report , this rumored gadget will retain the Microsoft Surface's trademark with the \"all-metal body device.\" Rumored specs include the Carl Zeiss 20-megapixel premium back camera with loads of fantastic tech-related features for everybody's convenience. Advertisement \nTechnological conveniences include a barometer, compass, fingerprint reader, and proximity sensor. Many people speculate the phone variants to run in the latest operating system for mobile, the Windows 10. Speculations even say that the smartphone may run on the Intel Atom X3 processor. \nIts premium variant may have at least 8 GB of RAM. On the other hand, the low-end variant will be 3GB. All three variants will have a starting 512 GB in their storage capacities. Regarding its display, a 5.5-inch AMOLED will be at work here. \nOne spectacular highlight this wonderful gadget may feature is the fingerprint scanner. This type of scanner may even appear on both the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the iPhone, with both smartphones slated to come out next year. \nThe Lumia smartphone series' moderate success made many people to believe that Microsoft will be more patient with this upcoming device.

      "text": "Share This Tweet This \nApple has recently unveiled the new version of its MacBook laptop series. The most highlighted MacBook Pro feature is the Touch Bar which sports customizable app-specific virtual buttons. The feature can adapt whatever program you might be using at the time, so long as the program supports the bar. \nMacBook Pro's Touch Bar is compared to Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon adaptive keys, which the Chinese Company has removed later after the poor execution and feedback from the users. According to some reports, Microsoft was researching on the use of the adaptive keyboard. \nBut, later Microsoft had decided not to go with the said technology because they didn't build the computers back then reported, The Next Web . Advertisement \nThe study on this plan had started in 1999, with an idea that PCs could display action keys and hide other parts of the keyboard based on context, according to The Verge . Steven Bathiche, director of research in Microsoft has spent years on this innovative feature. Since 1999, the research continues for many years with the number of prototypes. In 2009, a study was halted with the conclusion of \"Adaptive Keyboard.\" \nCurrently, Microsoft has Surface series of laptops available in the market. After Apple's latest Mac series launch the rivalry is set to get fiercer. \nSo, what else Macs have? \nIn terms of Hardware, MacBook Pro models marks larger touch pads, which are much lighter than their predecessors. Both the variants have four Thunderbolt ports with similar shape to USB Type-C. The keyboard and touchpad are also reinvented. The whole body is made up of aluminum. Advertisement \nThe price of the device is depending on the region and the country. The 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar is priced at $1,500 and Touch Bar variant will cost $1,800. The 15-inch MacBook Pro is priced around $2,400. The 13-inch MacBook Air is available at $1,000. \n",

But hei good bargains to be found, wonder if we will see a flood of old style ps4s for black Friday & if Nintendo will remember that they've got a new console coming out in March so they need to sell their Wiiu s not just hold on hoping someone will think £250 is good price for a console that will be replaced in a few months",

      "text": "\nRussian anti-virus company Kaspersky is accusing Microsoft of abusing its control of Windows to squash other anti-virus companies and promote their own product Windows Defender.\n“We think that Microsoft has been using its dominating position in the market of operating systems to create competitive advantages for its own product,” said Eugene Kaspersky, the CEO of the company. “[Microsoft] is also creating obstacles for companies to access the market, and infringes upon the interests of independent developers of security products,” he complained.\nKaspersky has a number of issues, and claims to have filed complaints with antitrust authorities in the European Union, Russia, and elsewhere over what it claims are anti-competitive practices by Microsoft.\nOne of his complaints was that when a user upgrades to Windows 10, Microsoft automatically deactivates any “incompatible” security software it finds on the system and installs Defender instead. Microsoft would of course say that they protect users by default when unprotected by another application (such as when that app has been deactivated due to being incompatible.)\nKaspersky complained that independent software developers were given just seven days before the release of Windows 10 to make their software compatible with the new operating system, leaving too little time to make sure their application was compatible.\nEven when the other anti-virus app was compatible Microsoft still prompted users to switch to Windows Defender, which then de-activated the alternate service.\nHe also complained that Microsoft made it harder in Windows 10 for users to know when their existing license for a security product might have expired so they don’t renew it in a timely fashion. When the app expired Microsoft simply deactivates the product and turns Defender on instead.\nAt the end of 2015 Microsoft held 16 percent share of the antivirus market share, followed by Avast and Malwarebytes with 15 percent and 11.6 percent share respectively according to market share numbers from OPSWAT. Kaspersky had a market share of around 4 percent.\n“Actually, Microsoft’s actions aren’t only making things worse for users and killing off the whole ecosystem of independent developers; they’re also undermining users’ trust in Microsoft,” Kaspersky said.\nKaspersky Lab want antitrust authorities to force Microsoft provide new Windows versions and updates in a quicker fashion to independent developers so they can maintain compatibility of their software with the operating system.\nKaspersky Lab also want Microsoft to explicitly inform users about the presence of potentially incompatible software on their systems when upgrading Windows and about the need to install compatible versions of the same software after the upgrade. Lastly, the company wants regulators to ensure that Microsoft does not enable Windows Defender by default on end-user systems and instead require explicit permission from users before doing so.\nIn a statement today Microsoft denied any knowledge of a formal complaint, noting “The company hasn’t received an official notification from [Federal Antimonopoly Service],” saying “As soon as we get it, we will review it carefully.” Microsoft however noted that they had a long and productive history of working with Kaspersky Labs.\nWe know some of our readers trust 3rd party ant-virus vendors more than Microsoft to defend their system, and it does seem Microsoft does not do much to ensure these companies remain a healthy part of the Windows ecosystem. At the same time being very considerate of their needs (which ultimately involve making money of Windows users) would leave many users vulnerable by default.\nDoes Kaspersky have a case? Let us know below.\n",

      "title": "Microsoft’s ‘Color Binoculars’ app aims to help people who are color blind",
      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nMicrosoft has made a big push with its apps on all operating systems over the last year or so, and it looks like that’s only set to continue — in fact, it has just released an app to the Apple App Store that might not be very wide-reaching in terms of how many people use it, but it should be very useful for those who do. \nThe app is called Color Binoculars, and it essentially changes the colors of the phone’s display to make them more distinguishable for people with color blindness. You simply have to take a photo with the camera — for example of a bouquet of flowers — and the app will simply apply a filter to make colors easier to distinguish. \nMore: Russia investigates Microsoft for allegedly blocking Kaspersky software \nColor Binoculars was developed by two Microsoft engineers, one of whom is color blind, and development on it began during the Microsoft Hackathon in 2015. Later, it was finished in Microsoft’s Garage program, which is aimed at making experimental apps more public. \nThe app has switches for three different kinds of color-blindness — red/green, green/red, and blue/yellow — so most people who have color blindness should find the app helpful. \n“It’s an app that helps color blind people distinguish color combinations that they would normally have trouble telling apart,” said Tom Overton, the engineer at Microsoft who also served as the app’s main tester due to his color blindness, in a blog post . “For example, since I have difficulty distinguishing between red and green, our app makes reds brighter and greens darker so that the difference is more obvious. It replaces difficult color combinations, like red and green, with more easily distinguishable combinations, like pink and green.” \nYou can download the app for yourself from the Apple App Store .",

Instead the company noted its long history of cooperation with Kaspersky Lab and its commitment to complying with Russian laws. “The company hasn’t received an official notification from [Federal Antimonopoly Service],” the statement said referring to the body that enforces Russian fair competition laws. “As soon as we get it, we will review it carefully,” \nAt the end of last year Microsoft led the market with an early 16% share, followed by Avast and Malwarebytes with 15% and 11.6%, respectively, according to market share numbers from OPSWAT .

      "title": "Windows 10 Redstone: A guide to the builds",
      "text": "Computerworld | Nov 10, 2016 10:45 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nMicrosoft never sleeps. Even before the Windows 10 Anniversary Update was rolled out, the company began work on the next two major updates to Windows 10 , code-named Redstone 2 and Redstone 3. (Redstone 1 was the code name for the Windows 10 Anniversary Update.) Redstone 2 will likely be fully ready in the spring of 2017. It's not yet clear when Redstone 3 will be finished. \nIf you want to test drive the upcoming updates, you don't have to wait until their final releases. As it did with the Anniversary Update, Microsoft has been releasing public preview builds, each a little bit closer to the final version. The updates are being tested and delivered the same way that those for the Windows 10 Anniversary Update were -- first to members of Microsoft's Insider Program via a series of public preview builds and then, when they are final, via Windows Update. \nWe're making it easy for you to keep track of when builds are available. What follows is a list of every preview build of Redstone 2, starting with the most recent. When Redstone 2 is finished and Redstone 3 builds become available, we'll list those as well. \nFor each build, we've included the date of its release and a link to Microsoft's announcement about it. \n(Note: This covers only previews for the PC version of Windows 10, not the phone version.) \nWe'll update this page as new builds are rolled out so you'll always be up to date. Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14965 \nRelease date: November 9 \nThis minor build adds minor features. The Sticky Notes app has been updated to include more languages, improved text input while typing and a few bug fixes. Windows Ink Workspace gets some minor improvements, including an upgraded protractor and faster loading of Sketchpad. It’s also now easier to connect to an external monitor from a tablet -- you can do it from the virtual touchpad instead of a mouse. There are also the usual host of bug fixes and small improvements, including one that stops Internet Explorer from crashing right after loading. Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14955 \nRelease date: November 3 \nThis minor build is the first to use a new Microsoft platform for publishing updates, called the Unified Update Platform (UUP) , although only the mobile build is delivered with UUP -- it will still be a while before PC updates will be delivered using it. Microsoft says that UUP will lead to smaller update download sizes -- 35% smaller from one major update to another. Aside from that, build 14959 can support an app that runs on just-announced Microsoft hardware, including the Surface Studio : Paint 3D Preview , which adds 3D modelling tools to Microsoft Paint. (The app isn't in the new build; it has to be downloaded separately.) \nThe build also includes a variety of bug fixes and small improvements, such as better controlling of scaling of virtual machines in Hyper-V Virtual Machines, and squashing a bug related to Windows' automatic brightness setting. Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14955 \nRelease date: October 25 \nThis minor build includes updates to Windows’ built-in Mail and Calendar apps. You can now open mail messages in a new window. You can also use @mentions: When you type the @ symbol in the body of an email and follow it with your contact's name, Windows pulls the contact's email address from your contact list and adds it to the To: field. The build also includes a variety of fixes. For example, it fixes a bug which wouldn’t allow people to sign into some apps -- such as MSN News and Groove -- with their Microsoft account. Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14951 \nRelease date: October 19 \nThis minor build adds new features for users who have a precision touchpad. It allows you to record your favorite keyboard combinations and assign them to gestures; you can also change the audio volume with a gesture. Windows Ink gets some improvements as well, including the addition of stencils and the ability to use Windows Ink in the Photos app. The camera interface has been simplified and there are a variety of bug fixes and minor improvements. Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14946 \nRelease date: October 13 \nThis minor build lets you customize how your touchpad works, notably by letting you customize three- and four-finger gestures and taps. To do it, go to Settings > Devices > Touchpad and look for the “Other gestures” section. The Wi-Fi settings page has been redesigned, and includes a new setting that lets you have a turned-off Wi-Fi turn back on automatically after a certain amount of time elapses. The build also includes a variety of bug fixes. Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14942 \nRelease date: October 7 \nThis minor build updates the Photos app, including a horizontal bar that makes it easier to navigate and view photos. The build also lets you collapse the app list on the Start menu by going to Settings > Personalization > Start and turning on “Hide app list in Start menu.” Windows Update gets a new icon. There are also a variety of bug fixes and minor improvements. Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14936 \nRelease date: September 28 \nThis minor build adds several new extensions to Microsoft Edge, including the Microsoft Personal Shopping Assistant, which lets you save products from several web sites in one location, along with price alerts and comparison shopping. Also new is the Turn off the Lights extension that lets you turn a web page black around a video you’re watching, so you can more easily focus on the video. The build also includes a variety of bug fixes for problems such as Explorer.exe crashing frequently. Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14931 \nRelease date: September 21 \nThis minor build focuses mainly on small bug fixes. In addition, you can now track traffic in the Maps app by tapping the traffic icon in the app bar. You can also send SMS and MMS messages using Skype on a Windows 10 PC if you have a Windows 10 phone with Skype and Skype is set as the default messaging app. Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14926 \nRelease date: September 14 \nThis minor build adds a “Snooze” feature to Edge so that you can set Cortana reminders on pages you’re viewing. The Cortana reminder appears as a notification and in Action Center, which lets you open that site in Edge. This is helpful for people who keep tabs open as a way to remind them to do something on a site. \nInsiders will appreciate another change: If you’ve uninstalled an app, that app won’t be reinstalled when you upgrade to the newest Preview build. So, for example, if you uninstall the Amazon Kindle app, it won’t be re-installed when you go to a new Preview build. \nThere are also a number of bug fixes in the build as well. Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14915 \nRelease date: August 31 \nThis minor build has only one new feature: It enables Windows Insiders to download their Insider preview builds, OS updates and app updates from other PCs on their network and from PCs on the internet. This should lead to faster downloads and updates. It needs the Windows Update Delivery Optimization feature to be turned on (it's turned on by default). If you want, you can turn off the feature entirely and just download your updates the usual way, straight from Microsoft. \nThere are also a variety of bug fixes -- for example, to make the power button on the Start menu work and to correct an issue that had turned off Cortana's text-to-speech capabilities. Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14901 \nRelease date: August 11 \nThis first public preview build of Redstone 2 included no new significant features; instead, it focused on Windows 10's plumbing. An announcement about the preview build on Microsoft's Insider Hub (accessible only to those who are running Windows 10) noted that in the first Redstone 2 build, \"You won't see any big noticeable changes or new features just yet...we are focusing on making some structural improvements to OneCore.\" \nOneCore, the announcement went on to note, \"is the shared core of Windows across PC, tablet, phone, IoT, Hololens and Xbox. It is essentially the heart of Windows.\" \nThe announcement warned that the build might be buggy.

      "title": "Windows 10 Sticky Notes Become More Insightful in More Languages",
      "text": "Microsoft extends its Sticky Notes Insights capabilities to more languages and regions in Windows 10 preview build 14965. Sticky Notes, a Windows Ink Workspace app, is bringing its Cortana-powered capabilities to more users across more parts of the globe. The latest Windows 10 preview build (14965) contains an update to the stylus-friendly app (it also supports keyboard input) that enables Insights to work with additional languages and in more regions of the world. Powered by Cortana, Microsoft's virtual assistant technology, Insights scans the content of a sticky note and highlights dates, addresses, flight numbers and other items that Cortana can help keep track of. For example, if a user scribbles a date and time, Insights allows users to quickly set a Cortana reminder. If Insights finds an address or phone number, it can launch the Maps or Skype app, respectively. In build 14965, those options are available to a wider, more international audience. In an update to the Windows Blog this week, Dona Sarkar, head of the Windows Insider early-access program, said that Microsoft's developers have enabled address recognition for Great Britain and Spanish speakers in the U.S. Phone number recognition is now available in all regions where English, German, Spanish, French and Italian is spoken.Flight detection is now available for travelers in more languages and countries, including Brazil, France, Germany, India, Japan and Spain. Insight can now spot email and URL addresses in practically every language except Chinese, Japanese and Korean, which Sarkar assured Microsoft is working on.For those Windows 10 users that keep an eye on Wall Street, stock ticker recognition has been enabled for several language and country pairs, including English/Australia, Portuguese/Brazil and Spanish/Mexico. Finally, time-based Cortana reminders can now be set in Australia, Great Britain and India. Apart from smarter, more worldly Sticky Notes, build 14965 also includes enhancements for tablet users that want to use an external monitor, but don't necessarily want to attach more input devices in order to interact with the second screen. \"You can now drive content on a second display from your tablet without ever having to attach a mouse,\" Sarkar wrote. \"The virtual touchpad lets you do more with a tablet and a second screen—just connect to another monitor, PC, or TV, go to Action Center and tap on the 'Project' Quick Action to extend your screen.\" Windows Ink Workspace, the operating system's hub for stylus apps, now includes a quick link to pen settings and bumps the number of recently used pen-enabled apps to six. Under the hood, Microsoft has shortened the time it takes to load the Sketchpad app when a selected sketch is bathed in virtual ink. The on-screen protractor tool now shrinks and expands with a spin of a mouse scroll wheel. The operating system's handwriting recognition has been improved, added Sarkar. Additionally, the Microsoft Pen and Windows Ink settings screen now features a \"Get to know my handwriting\" link, which launches the handwriting training tool.",

      "text": "Envision a home where glass in kitchen cabinets, on walls and in picture frames doubles as video phones. Where blackboards keep a running tally on the future plans of those living in the household, and smart shelves with sensors tell you why your basil in the potted plant is dying or thriving.\nTake a walk into the future through the eyes of Microsoft. It felt a little like being at Disneyland with all the real-life animation and walls turning into full-sensory video telephone systems that provide insight into far-off lands, but in reality it's pieces of technology either readily available, on the drawing board, or in the minds of researchers that Microsoft engineers created and experiment with for use in a variety of applications. Microsoft calls the space the Envisioning Center. I had an opportunity to take a tour Thursday.\nThe center -- although no photos are allowed -- offers a clear picture of how Microsoft will integrate the work from across its business divisions, such as advertising, chatbots and cloud services with ERP and CRM business tools, and Xbox and HoloLens. It's also clear how data can play a role for advertisers and how the company will evolve to lead the next evolution of devices and services. \nThe Envisioning Center is a place for Microsoft to showcase its technology and its view of the future for home and office spaces. The space in various forms has been around for between 15 and 20 years. I visited the space in the early 2000s, when the focus was on radio frequency identification technology and near-field communication sensors that tallied up your purchases as you walked in the front door with packages after shopping for the day.\nThe sensors would identify the products and enter each as a line item in a database, so the home owner would have a running inventory of the items — clothing to kitchen items and furniture to electronics -- in the home. At that time retailers were tagging everything with RFID chips and focusing on automating inventory systems. Each home would have a server rather than connecting to the cloud.\nFast-forward 15 years and the focus turns to cloud services, sensors and video, along with a whole bunch of data that advertisers will have an option to use to target. That's the next phase in advertising.",

      "text": "Microsoft Research has been working on building technology that analyzes site visitor's behaviors to optimizes content, pricing and ad serving in real-time. It learns from the actions that visitors take on the Web site to personalize recommendations and news.\nThe technology will change the way advertisers and publishers think about optimization.\nThe platform, Decision Service, uses machine learning to make choices on the content to serve in real-time by quickly integrating and processing new data from clicks and views. It optimizes based on the end metric marketers preset in the system, such as increasing click-through rates or purchases, rather than accuracy or precision recall.\nLiHong Li, senior researcher at Microsoft Research, and Gal Oshri, program manager at Microsoft Research, speaking at the Bing Ads Next event in Redmond, Washington walked through how the platform works.\nAn ongoing test with MSN in which the editorial team chooses about 20 articles and their rankings shows how data from views and clicks funneled into the platform in near real time produces a revised optimization model every five minutes. It led to nearly a 27% lift in click through rate and improved the overall engagement with the page, having an indirect outcome by increasing advertising clicks by 9%.\nThe research and data behind the modeling creates an unbiased evaluation, solving many of the problems behind traditional machine learning in real-time scenarios, Oshri said. \"This is important for applications like News, because when a new story gets published you need to react quickly. A breaking news story can become less popular in less than an hour.\"\nThe same can be done for ecommerce sites. In one instance that led to a 38% increase in revenue per click the company monitored visits, clicks and purchase through a banner advertisement.\nThe technology can potentially \"site hope\" in which the platform optimizes for content, advertisements, and pricing for the same visitor.\nThe research group, which published a paper on the topic, also tested the platform with a media Web site to recommend videos at the bottom of article pages. There hasn't been any tests optimizing programmatic TV, but researchers say it's possible.\nIn one test, Microsoft doesn't choose the ads the visitor sees initially, but rather what they see after clicking on the ad, he said. The optimization comes on the second click where the Decision Service chooses the event based on the data.  \nPrivacy also plays a role. Each application of the platform gets customized per publisher, advertiser, or ecommerce site. The user data remains in their respective systems and not shared with other systems. The user information is stored by the application not Decision Service.",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Book Review 2016: Device Specs, Features Hard To Beat; Better Than Apple MacBook Pro 2016? By Bruce Berkowitz , Parent Herald November 11, 11:20 am The new version of the Microsoft Surface Book is being hailed as the ultimate laptop/tablet hybrid.(Photo : Surface / YouTube) \nThe verdict is out according to the current Microsoft Surface Book Review 2016 and the competition will find its features as a tough opponent. The Surface Book is being hailed as the \"ultimate laptop\" by Microsoft. Advertisement \nThe two-in-one Microsoft Surface Book works well as a detached pen tablet, maintains fast performance and has a well-designed case, a relaxed keyboard, and an excellent battery life. Microsoft has started shipping out an updated version of the Surface Book and it comes equipped with a larger battery that can run up to 16 hours, a second fan, and a doubled graphics performance. \nMicrosoft's Surface Book that has a Performance Base is the updated version of last year's model. It's priced at $2,399 and its design has an iconic look specifically engineered for a laptop with a detachable tablet screen. \nWhen compared to Apple's MacBook Pro, the Microsoft Surface Book is more practical and can be used as an everyday tool. It has stylus modes and full tablet capability which is perfect for creative work. The Surface Book also included the legacy ports like the SD card slot and the full-size USB 3. \nAll the improvements are under the hood and the exterior design of the Microsoft Surface Book is similar to the first model. Just like other second-generation devices, the new Surface Book is more of a fine-tuning of the original and skips the definition of a new product. \nThe Microsoft Surface Book was cleverly designed with a new fulcrum hinge, comes with a backlit keyboard, and a magnesium case that's pretty solid when compared to other laptop/tablet hybrids. This makes the Surface Book a striking piece of hardware engineering that can blow away most of Microsoft's competitors. \nAfter two generations, the fulcrum hinge on the Microsoft Surface Book is still pretty to look at but it doesn't necessarily give much of a functional advantage. There's also a specific button located on the function row which is next to the delete key that allows the detachment of the screen from the keyboard. Microsoft Surface Book review: the laptop, evolved https://t.co/54fdG6r2R0 pic.twitter.com/rzDP5S0ybV \n— The Verge (@verge) October 24, 2015 \nAfter the whole process, users can use the Surface Book as a tablet they can take anywhere or re-attach the display to fold it back to be used as a tabletop surface. All this attention to detail is the main reason why the Microsoft Surface Book is one of the top-selling laptop/tablet hybrids in the market today. \n  Related Articles",

      "text": "Microsoft is expanding it cloud container management portfolio with the preview release of its private container image repository. Microsoft rolled out the welcome mat for Kubernetes this week. It's a big step in rounding out the company's cloud container ecosystem, but the company isn't stopping there. This week, the company shared more details on its upcoming Azure Container Registry (ACR) service. On Nov. 16, Microsoft will release a preview of ACR, which will serve as a private registry that customers can use to host and manage Docker-formatted container images. \"Azure Container Registry integrates well with orchestrators hosted in Azure Container Service, including Docker Swarm, DC/OS and Kubernetes,\" assured Microsoft in a Nov. 7 announcement on its website. \"Users can benefit from using familiar tooling capable of working with the open source Docker Registry v2.\" ACR enables customers to manage images involving any type of container deployment, Microsoft assures. It supports both Windows and Linux container images in same registry, along with open source command-line tools (Docker login, push, etc.). Customers can also use ACR to help automate their container development, security scanning and testing workflows using Visual Studio Team Services and third-party solutions like TwistLock.Based in San Francisco, TwistLock is a software startup that adds another layer of security to container applications. Taking things a step further than technologies like Docker Notary, Twistlock's Container Security Suite analyses changes in the runtime environment to detect potential vulnerabilities and help harden containerized apps. This summer, the company raised $10 million in a Series A round of financing led by TenEleven Ventures and backed by YL Ventures and Rally Ventures. Earlier this week, the company announced Twistlock 1.6 featuring a Runtime Radar, which visually indicates how container images interact with one another. Elsewhere in Microsoft's growing cloud services portfolio, the company recently announced that Azure Search is now available in Canada. The \"search-as-a-service\" allows customers to add advanced search capabilities to their mobile and web applications. Also available to Canadian customers is Azure IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service) Backup, a data-protection product that enables customers to store backups of their Windows servers and client systems and applications, including Exchange and SQL Server. On Nov. 8, Microsoft announced that five more of its cloud services adhere to the U.S. federal government strict security standards, for a total of 18 Azure Government solutions that adhere to the FedRAMP High baseline. The newcomers include Azure Backup, Notification Hubs, Service Bus, Site Recovery and the company's StorSimple hybrid cloud storage product. Azure DocumentDB, Microsoft's NoSQL cloud database solution, gains a new guided \"quick start\" experience that generates a personalized, working sample app for new DocumentDB account in mere seconds. Customers can also now restore their DocumentDB databases and collections by contacting Azure support (DocumentDB data is automatically replicated and backed up at regular intervals). In a security-enhancing move, Microsoft added firewall rules and IP filtering support to DocumentDB, enabling customers to restrict traffic to select IP addresses and ranges. Finally, the solution now supports Polygon and LineString objects for geospatial indexing and querying. Both objects are commonly used to enable geo-fencing capabilities in mobile, telematics and Internet of Things applications.",

      "text": "Microsoft updates Xbox app for the holidays, brings new social and community features By 0 \nMicrosoft just announced today that Xbox Live and the Xbox Android app will be getting a rather huge update with a lot of new features in tow. Microsoft is aiming for people using the app and program on different platforms – Windows 10 PC, iOS, and Android – to be able to communicate better and build more game-relevant communities within the app. \nThe Xbox Holiday Update brings social connections all around, especially for you guys who use the Xbox Android app. Microsoft said in its post that it aims “to foster a welcoming experience on Xbox Live where everyone is included, respected, and supported.” In that sense, the features are understandably more for community building and groups within the app. See the video below for an overview of the new features. \nThe new Clubs feature are gamer-created and managed groups that help people meet and grow communities of gamers who love the same things you do. Virtually anyone can join or create a Club, so you’ll probably see a Club for just about everything – from cat memes to virtual reality. The “ Looking for Group ” feature will help you find others who are currently playing the same game as you are. There will also be the new Group Messaging feature goes across all platforms and is to be your standard messaging for groups of people within the Xbox ecosystem. \nAndroid users can update their Xbox apps via the Google Play Store now, as the update is already currently rolling out. Same with Windows 10 PC and iOS users, by the way.",

      "text": "The new Microsoft Surface Book has now started to collect its share of reviews. In unanimous regard, the Surface Book is poised as an impressive and powerful device with a stellar battery life, but is it too expensive? ( Microsoft ) Advertisement \nA year ago Microsoft unveiled its first laptop, carrying the naming scheme of its Surface tablets released previously. Upon release, many reviewers were impressed by the Surface Book, earning it glowing platitudes across publications. \nNow, Microsoft has released a second iteration of the Surface Book , bearing much of the same vaunted pleasantries the last year model offered: a better-than-average battery life, a svelte and premium design, a detachable display that enables tablet mode and a hinge that lets you fold the laptop all the way back, like the Lenovo Yoga Book . \nThe biggest changes in the new refresh are mostly its increased power capacity by up to 30 percent, resting under the chassis, updated processors and under-the-hood improvements. Besides that, it's the same Surface Book released last year. \nReviews have started filtering in for Microsoft's two-in-one hybrid laptop and here is a congested list of what they think about the powerful but pricier offering that directly rivals Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro. \nThe Same Surface Book, But Slightly More Powerful \nThe new Surface Book houses a Skylake chip, Intel's powerful sixth-generation processors. a Surface Book model called Performance Base which comes with an Intel Core i7 chip, up to 16 GB of RAM, Intel Graphics 520 and a discrete Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M graphics card. \n\"As you'd expect, the benchmark scores are very, very good,\" wrote Engadget's Dana Wollman, speaking of the laptop's performance. The Surface Book surpassed the HP Spectre x360, Asus ZenBook 3, Dell XPS 13, Razer Blade Stealth and the HP Spectre 13 on standard benchmarking tests such as PCMark 7, PCMark 8, 3DMark 11 and Atto for disk reading and writing. \nDespite its sixth-generation Intel processors, the Surface Book remains outfitted with a dual-core chip, which is a disappointing drawback considering its steep price point. \n\"The new Surface Book has faster performance, better multitasking, better battery performance: enough to make a difference, but not necessarily enough to eclipse the competition,\" CNET's Scott Stein opined , adding that the power of the Surface Book still isn't up to the task of virtual reality rigs such as the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, despite its separate graphics card. \nThe Surface Book Battery Life \nA video playback of 16 hours seems like a bold promise but in Wollman's review and test run, the Surface Book was able to last 16 hours and 15 minutes playing a looped video with the screen's brightness set at 65 percent. \n\"[T]here's barely anything else like [the Surface Book's battery life] on the market,\" she said. Many companies are guilty of claiming a battery capacity a few notches higher than its real-world performance but the Surface Book seems to stack up pretty well in that regard. \nPCWorld's Gordon Mah Ung mirrored the praise, heavily impressed by the Surface Book's battery life. \n\"[I]t has stupidly long battery life that bests all the laptops we've tested,\" he wrote . \nIt's important to note that users will only get the promised battery life when the display is attached to the base, since the battery is housed in the Surface Book's chassis. When detached, tablet mode can only last up to four hours, as proven in the same video playback test done by Engadget. \nIs The Surface Book i7 Too Expensive? \n\"If you've been hoping for a Surface Book 2, this is not the machine you've been waiting for,\" wrote The Verge's Dan Seifert, as a preface note-ender to his Surface Book review. \nThe Surface Book boasts an impressive performance that's better than the version that came before it, a battery life currently unbeatable by other laptops offering the same configurations and a beautiful, all-metal premium form that doubles as a tablet. These are all impressive and admirable for Microsoft except for the price. \nTo get the new Surface Book models, expect to shell out a starting price of $2,399 which nets you a Core i7 processor, 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB SSD. For an even break-banking $2,799, you'll get double the RAM and internal storage. A full terabyte option is also available at a whopping price point of $3,299. \nOverall, there's a unanimous regard for the Surface Book as a formidable two-in-one hybrid that packs a beefy performance and a stellar, lasts-as-promised battery life. It is heralded by Microsoft as the \"ultimate laptop,\" and the reviewers proves that it deserves this moniker. \nWhile these things might be true, the Surface Book is a very expensive laptop, especially considering that other potential customers are more likely to opt for similarly priced laptops that have more powerful configurations at a less expensive price. So unless you're willing to throw around $3,000 for the best Surface Book model, you're better off trying to look for something else that fits your budget.  ",

      "text": "Microsoft has long offered free mobile versions of Word, PowerPoint, and other Office apps, but the company is set to exclude more devices from that offering as Google blurs the line between notebooks and mobile devices.\nGoogle is gradually implementing the ability to run Android apps on laptops and desktops powered by its Chrome operating system, and Microsoft announced this week that it will include Chromebooks with screens larger than 10.1\" in an existing policy that prevents larger Android devices from running free Office apps.\n\"After signing in with a free Microsoft account, the core viewing, creating, editing and printing experience is free in Office apps for iOS, Android and Windows 10 Mobile, on devices 10.1\" or smaller,\" Microsoft said in a statement to 9to5Google .\nWhile users who have opted in to the beta version of the Google Play store for Chrome OS might be disappointed that they can't run the free Office mobile apps, the policy makes sense from Microsoft's point of view, since the 10.1\" screen size restriction is not new.",

      "text": "\nEarlier today Microsoft pushed out an update to MSN Weather that brought an optional transparent Live Tile for Mobile. That was not all, however, as the software giant is updating all the MSN apps including News, Money, and Sports as well – at least for those on the Insider Fast Ring.\nThe most interesting feature, however, is for MSN News v4.17.72.0, which finally grabs a 'Chaseable' Live Tile. Announced at Build earlier this year the feature now shows you the article on the Live Tile at the top of the app when opened.\nFor MSN News Microsoft describes the feature in the changelog as \"Live tile articles now appear at the top of My News (for the News app).\" In playing with the app for a few minutes, we noticed that the Tile rotates through stories and those stories are all at the top of the My News area as expected. It makes finding the Live Tile content much easier.\nAlso, there are the usual improvements:\nPerformance, reliability and accessibility improvements General bug fixes This is one of the first times we have seen Microsoft apps embrace Chaseable Tiles, which were introduced to developers with the Anniversary Update. Hopefully, as more PCs and Mobiles get on the Anniversary Update, we'll see more developers get on board (that includes our apps too).\nUsers in the Slow and Release Preview Insider rings should expect the new app to hit their devices in the coming week, with a final push to Production (non-Insiders) shortly after that.\n",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base review: A professional laptop-tablet hybrid with a steep price | Financial Post",
      "text": "FarkIt \nMicrosoft Corp. has been attempting to create a culture of innovation these past few years, experimenting with new products that are aimed squarely at the premium device market. \nAn example of such is its Surface Book, first released in October 2015. The laptop-tablet hybrid was not necessarily a new idea, as other companies have tried in the past, but the execution was an attempt to combine high performance and a unique design to create something that professionals and creatives would use daily. Related Microsoft Corp is taking on Slack with its own corporate team-chat service called Microsoft Teams \nThe original Surface Book was largely praised by users and critics alike, though they still found some tweaks that could be made and hardware limitations. So now, a year later, Microsoft has listened to the feedback and made improvements to the device that will be welcomed additions by professionals for round two. What’s new (and not) for 2016 \nOfficially called “Microsoft Surface Book with Performance Base,” the latest iteration has a mix of important updates that add significantly more power for those who need it and other changes that are a little more lacklustre (though still an improvement). \nSixth generation Intel Core i7 processors are the standard, instead of opting for i5 chips in entry options. Nice, but it’s still the same sixth generation processor that we had last year. \nAlso standard is a dedicated graphics card, namely the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M with 2GB GDDR5 of memory. This is twice the power as the original Surface Book, meaning more intensive programs such as video editing, photo editing and even gaming will run smoother or take less time to render. \nThe battery is also now bigger, adding 30 per cent more life to the unit for a total of (what Microsoft claims) up to 16 hours of video playback. It’s definitely noticeably longer and lasts all day, but I found it would hit around 11 to 13 hours depending on my use that day. \nOtherwise, the rest of the changes are subtle design tweaks. The unit is thicker just ever so slightly plus a little heavier, which Microsoft says is to accommodate the bigger battery. The keyboard is also angled down slightly for a better typing experience, the hinge gap when closed has shrunk to help keep unwanted bits out and the Pen is harder to lose with a magnet that sticks on the side. \nIn summary, the major changes are essentially twice the graphic capabilities, longer battery life and standard i7 processors to give professionals a more powerful option if they want to pay for it. Hardware: A desktop experience in a hybrid \nIt’s hard to deny the fact that the Surface Book with Performance Base is impressive to use and very nimble in what it can be used for, like with the first generation. \nYou can use it like a touchscreen laptop that has enough power to do professional and creative tasks, plus the simple and mundane. \nHold a button at the top of the keyboard and you can then detach the screen to turn it into a tablet. However, because the dedicated graphics card and extra beefy battery are in the base of the device, the tablet on its own will be a bit more limited in what it can do. \nIf you want a tablet with the extra power though, you can attach the screen to the base backwards and fold the hinge to have a (heavier) experience but now with the performance boost. \nAnd though Microsoft had considered moving to the smaller USB-C for this Surface Book, like Apple has done with its new MacBook Pro, instead there are standard sized USB ports for better compatibility with devices. There is also still an SD card slot and a power cable with a magnetic attachment in case someone trips over your cord so they don’t bring your Surface Book to the ground — two features Apple removed from their new MacBook Pro. \nThe 13.5” display looks great with a wide viewing angle and the touchscreen (and included Pen) is generally pretty responsive. Sometimes there are hiccups with the touchscreen, but more on that later. \nThe Surface Book’s weight is probably its biggest flaw. Though it’s certainly manageable at 3.63 pounds, compared to competitors it does feel a little bulky at times. But I personally like the design, including the fancy Fulcrum Hinge, and am willing to add a bit more weight to gain the extra power. Software: A touch-first approach so you can mark up (nearly) anything \nOf course, a product like this is only as good as its software, and that’s something Microsoft has struggled with for the past number of years (and operating systems). But now with Windows 10 and its touch focus, it feels like Microsoft is beginning to find its niche. It just took a couple of operating systems, and sometimes user outcry, to get to this point. \nBoth the operating system and all of Microsoft’s programs are designed with touch in mind. You can quickly mark up nearly anything, from Word documents and Excel spreadsheets to web pages and sticky notes. Quick note taking is always a tap away, which is great for meetings, jotting down thoughts on the go and the like. \nWindows 10 is also very customizable, as is often the case with Microsoft’s operating systems. For a tablet/touch experience specifically, it is particularly refreshing for those who like to tinker as other companies such as Apple tighten up what all you change. Windows 10’s settings are searchable, too, so if there is a specific button that you want to customize — say, the Pen or trackpad — just look it up and you’ll probably find it. \nThen there is the professional third party software. AutoCAD, Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop other programs work natively for a touch screen experience and the added performance boost helps make things more seamless. It would be nice to see more companies make a touch-optimized version of their software, but since this is the full version of Windows 10 it can still run any program like a regular PC only with the added ability of a touch screen. \nGaming has its limitations on the Surface Book, but can run many new games at decent or average settings. Definitely do not expect to be able to use VR headsets on the Surface Book with Performance Base though. Both of these factors are a little bit frustrating considering how much cash you’re dropping for the device, but then again it isn’t the demographic Microsoft is chasing after. \nWindows 10 still has some room to grow and finesse, too. Sometimes weird hiccups happen that might force you to close an unresponsive application, or a touchscreen feature won’t respond properly and you need to minimize the window then reopen it to make it work properly. But it doesn’t happen too often, and at lot of these seem to be more Windows being Windows than a problem with the hardware itself. \nThat said, it does feel like Windows 10 is beginning to get things right, finally. Microsoft seems to be working hard to create a better experience for the average consumer and professional users, no doubt thanks to the competition that takes a similar approach. Of course, you have to make compromises with both MacOS and Windows 10, so it’s more a question of what software solution works best for you (or your business) and then deciding on the hardware from there. \nBut one thing to consider here is the soon-to-be-released Windows 10 Creators Update, which has some pretty fun and innovative features that will work especially nice on the Surface Book such as 3D Paint or other augmented reality tools. Overall thoughts (and that scary price tag) \nThe Surface Book with Performance Base is not for everyone. Starting at $3,129 and customizable to well above $4,000, it is Microsoft’s most expensive laptop yet and clearly aimed at professionals as a premium product with the corporate and creative worlds in mind. \nThankfully, if you don’t need all of this power and just want a hybrid experience for basic or school use, Microsoft is still selling its first generation Surface Book with a starting price of just $1,799. So there are options. \nBut if you’re looking for a Windows device that can quickly adapt to various professional needs, collaborate well with other professionals and work with services across a variety of platforms (including Apple and Google’s Android), then the Surface Book with Performance Base is solid option. \nThat is, of course, if you can afford it. \nFinancial Post ",

      "text": "Comments 0 Advertisement \nEarlier this week while I was on the Microsoft Campus for the annual MVP Summit, we were treated to a new Fast Ring build in the Redstone 2 development branch aka the Creators Update. \nThis release, Build 14965, is the 12th PC build pushed out to testers since testing of the third major update to Windows 10 began back on the 11th of August. \nMany times the builds have plenty of work in them that is under the hood but not always items that we can grab screenshots of and talk about. With this new build there are a couple new features that we can show you plus I discovered some new functionality that shows the steps towards replacing the Control Panel with the new Windows Settings app continues to move forward. \nLet's start with the new Virtual Touchpad. This feature will be very useful to tablet users who are casting/projecting their screen to an external monitor/TV and do not have a keyboard/mouse attached to their device. \nThis on screen touchpad will allow you to interact with the screen you are casting directly from your tablets screen. \nTo get started with this just right click the Taskbar in Build 14965 and select Show touchpad button . \nThat will add this icon near your System Tray: \nJust select that and you will get an on screen touchpad to use on your device: \nBy default it appears in the lower right hand corner of the screen and for right now it can not be moved from that location. \nThis virtual touchpad does accept gestures and its functionality can be adjusted in Windows Settings > Devices > Touchpad . A feature like this makes a lot of sense with so many tablets out there and the capability to project those screens on to secondary monitors/TVs. Ultimately, I would like to see it have a more defined appearance and allow for it to be placed in other spots on the screen however, it works very well as it is right now. \nThe Windows Ink Workspace got a few small tweaks with the biggest one being the expansion of the Recently Used list which now shows the last 6 most recently used ink related apps instead of just the last five. \nFinally a favorite shortcut menu of many Windows users, often referred to as the Power User menu, that is accessed in the lower left corner of the Windows 10 Desktop by either a right click or hitting the Windows Key and the X button has started to see some of its menu entries directing to the new Windows Settings app instead of the legacy Control Panel. \n1. Programs and Features = Apps & features \n2. Power Options = Power & sleep \n3. System = About \n4. Network Connections = Network & Internet Status \n5. Settings = Windows Settings \nThanks to Jason Cartwright ( @techAU ) for the tip on this. Turns out that another tip on Twitter indicates these changes may have started in one of the last few builds. No matter when it did begin, there is most definitely a continued effort to move the majority of system related settings out of the legacy Control Panel. Whether that is a goal to be met in the Creators Update next year or not remains to be seen. \nHave you seen anything that stands out in the latest Windows 10 Creators Update build? \nBut, wait...there's probably more so be sure to follow me on Twitter and Google+ .",

      "text": "Microsoft co-founder's academic search engine adds neuroscience Semantic Scholar helps researchers dig through 10 million papers in the fields of computer science and neuroscience. Share Save \nResearchers, scientists and academics around the world publish roughly 2.5 million scientific papers each year, on top of a backlog of more than 50 million papers dating back to 1665. Plus, the rate at which researchers publish these academic papers keeps rising , a la Moore's Law. It's impossible for scientists to read every paper published in their fields, and searching for a specific study can be a daunting task. \nEnter: Paul Allen , Microsoft co-founder and leader of the non-profit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. The Allen Institute's latest effort is Semantic Scholar , a scientific-paper search engine powered by machine learning and other artificial intelligence systems. \nSemantic Scholar went live in November 2015 with a focus on computer science papers. Today, the service expanded to include neuroscience, bringing the search engine's database to more than 10 million papers . Semantic Scholar is pitched as a sophisticated alternative to Google Scholar, and it uses AI systems and natural language processing algorithms to help parse each paper. \nThis is just the beginning for Semantic Scholar. By the end of 2017, Allen and his team plan to incorporate the full library of medical research into the service.",

      "text": "Veritas Backup Exec 16 backs up Microsoft Azure, Windows Server 2016 by Sonia Lelii Senior News Writer Trying to rebuild the Backup Exec brand, Veritas adds support for Microsoft Azure, Windows Server 2016 and Hyper-V Server. The upgrade is part of the new Veritas' cloud focus.   \nVeritas Technologies LLC has expanded support for its Backup Exec software to include the Microsoft Azure cloud, Windows Server 2016 and Hyper-V Server 2016. Download this free guide Archive vs. Backup and Why You Need to Know the Difference \nDifferentiating data backups from archives is one of the most common questions among IT pros when it comes to data recovery. Download this invaluable guide to discover why you need to know the difference between the two, and for important tips and best practices on building or refining the best data archiving strategy for your organization.

It protects data with a one-pass backup and granular file, folder and object recovery with encryption. Backup Exec already supported the Amazon Web Services and Google clouds, as well as third-party clouds that support the Simple Storage Service protocol . The latest version, Backup Exec 16, is expanding support to Azure . \nBackup Exec is one of Veritas' two major backup applications, along with its flagship enterprise NetBackup product . Backup Exec is used mainly by SMB and midmarket customers. Customers moving to the cloud \nAndy Spencer, global product marketing lead for Veritas, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., said a 2016 data protection survey commissioned by Veritas of 906 SMB and midmarket IT customers found cloud backup on the rise . Respondents were asked where they planned to store their data in three years. \nCustomers said 45% of their data is on physical hardware, and they expect that to drop to 33% by 2019. Thirty-seven percent of their data is on virtual devices, and they forecast that to rise to 39%. Data stored in the cloud is predicted to rise from 18% to 27%. Backup Exec 16 allows the cloud to be used as a backup target. \nMost of the respondents (69%) said they prefer a unified backup and recovery product that protects virtual, physical and the cloud. \n\"That is why we are investing in the cloud ,\" Spencer said. \"We will continue to support physical devices during the next three years. Virtual systems have been doing well since VMware released backup APIs. And customers are moving data to the cloud, but not all of it. Customers need backup products that protect all that data.\" \nThe cloud figured prominently in the new direction Veritas laid out in September at Veritas Vision. That was the vendor's first user conference after Symantec spun out the Veritas data protection business into an independent company at the start of 2016. Following the split, Veritas is trying to establish itself as a player in the cloud and data management markets, as well as data protection. \nBackup Exec sales suffered when Veritas was part of Symantec. Under the security giant, Veritas was slow to support new Windows and VMware platforms on Backup Exec, and it upset customers by abruptly changing the interface and workflow processes in Backup Exec 12 . \nBackup Exec 16 became generally available this week. \nJason Buffington, principal analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group Inc., which is in Milford, Mass., said it would be easy for Veritas to be distracted while going through this separation, but it's continued to build up its product set with Backup Exec 16. \n\"Now they are past the separation, I would say Veritas is unencumbered,\" Buffington said. \"And folks shouldn't think of Veritas as the NetBackup company. To me, the story is that Veritas is moving forward.\" \nVeritas claims more than 2 million Backup Exec customers. Next Steps",

      "title": "Why military veterans make exceptional tech workers, and how Microsoft is helping them land jobs - GeekWire",
      "text": "November 11, 2016 at 8:00 am November 11, 2016 at 3:24 pm GeekWire Gala tickets on sale now! Sponsored by \nThis special series focuses on important community issues, innovative solutions to societal challenges, and people and non-profit groups making an impact through technology. \nMilitary veterans Bernard Bergan (left) and Ryen Macababbad went through the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy and now work for the Redmond tech giant. \nBernard Bergan spent six years as an information system analyst for the U.S. Army, including one deployment in Afghanistan. He saw combat, lost friends, and experienced a lot as a sergeant in the Special Forces unit. \nBut when it came time to leave the military in 2013 and an opportunity to land a job at Microsoft arose, Bergan felt the nerves. Transitioning from the military back to civilian life isn’t easy, let alone to start a fast-paced career in technology at the world’s third-most valuable company. \n“Saying I was a bit nervous and hesitant is an understatement,” Bergan told GeekWire. \nBergan spent the next 16 weeks in the first cohort of Microsoft Software & Systems Academy (MSSA), a first-of-its-kind formal IT training program designed to help service members transition from the military to civilian life. \nTwo-and-a-half years later, Bergan is flourishing at the Redmond tech giant as a technical account manager for Microsoft’s Premier product. He credits the company for providing that bridge from active duty to a career back home. Bernard Bergan spent six years as an information system analyst for the U.S. Army. Photo via Microsoft. \nBergan is one of more than 350 veterans who have gone through the academy, which provides training for IT-related careers and guarantees an interview for a full-time job at Microsoft. About 30 percent of graduates land jobs at Microsoft, and others find positions at companies like Amazon, Dell, Accenture, the Department of Defense, and Facebook. The tech giant continues to invest in the program and there are plans to expand to nine regions servicing 14 bases across the U.S. within two years. Once the program is fully operational, Microsoft expects to graduate 1,000 people each year. Chris Cortez. Photo via Microsoft. \nMicrosoft made a commitment in 2014 to expand the diversity of its workforce . MSSA fits perfectly with that mission. \n“Veterans are exactly the type of talent we are looking for to evolve the face of IT beyond the traditional four-year degree,” said Chris Cortez, a 33-year Marine Corps veteran who now is vice president of military affairs at Microsoft. \nThe Microsoft campus in Redmond and a battlefield in the Middle East are certainly different places. But Cortez explained how active duty experience — whether it be with the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, etc. — can be invaluable for a career in tech. \n“They are trained to quickly assess, analyze and fix a situation with the resources at hand while working with a diverse group of people as a team,” he said. “Who better to bring into the company to create a diverse and inclusive workforce, expand the way we solve problems, and fuel creativity than folks who are adept in the skills that are incredibly applicable to the IT industry.” \nAdded Cortez: “Companies look for these traits in the people they recruit; it’s about hiring great people. If you hire the right people, your company will thrive.” \nThe program has been a win-win for both service members and Microsoft, which is quickly learning about the quality of talent that comes from veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces. \n“We are investing more in the program,” said Kathleen Hogan, executive vice president of human resources at Microsoft. “We are getting exceptional talent.” Ryen Macababbad spent more than a decade in active duty. Photo via Microsoft. \nRyen Macababbad is another beneficiary of MSSA. She served in the Army for eight years, working as a technician for military intelligence systems, and deployed once to Iraq and once to Afghanistan. After her second deployment, Macababbad knew she had to come home and transition back to civilian life. Like Bergen, she too had lost a friend in combat, and it was time to regroup. \nMacababbad thought about going to college and finishing a computer science degree. But a quick glance at a flyer for MSSA changed everything. \n“It’s basically allowed me to accomplish a dream of mine,” said Macababbad, who is a program manager on the Azure team and is closing in on her 3-year anniversary with Microsoft. \nMacababbad, a self-described computer geek, explained that military service members are one of the untapped talent pools that IT companies need to consider. Veterans know what it means to adapt in different environments and learn on-the-go. They are trained to think outside-of-the-box because you never know what to expect in combat. \n“These are individuals that are extremely trainable,” noted Macababbad, who was honored by the White House earlier this year and got a special shout-out from Michelle Obama . “They are disciplined; they have self drive; they have the ability to not only learn but also accomplish great things under high-stress environments.” \nBergan echoed that thought. He said MSSA is reaching out to a talented group of people that, for the most part, have been hidden from tech companies. There were 495,000 unemployed veterans in 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . \n“Knowing how to perform at the highest level where things were life and death with other people — that same mental toughness and grit applies in the tech industry,” Bergan explained. Microsoft Executive Vice President of HR Kathleen Hogan. Photo via Microsoft. \nMSSA originally started out of a need. Cortez explained that there are few opportunities for veterans to acquire in-demand IT skills. The initial MSSA cohort launched in 2013 on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, just south of Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond. \n“Since then, the program has grown not only by the numbers but through the support and commitment of everyone at Microsoft,” Cortez added. Hogan, a 13-year Microsoft veteran who became EVP of Human Resources in late 2014 , noted that Microsoft’s idea of diversity extends beyond gender or race. “It’s diversity of experience, too,” she said. “Those who come from the military have unique experience. They come in with a real work ethic and high integrity. A lot of them have done really unique things in the military and have skills we can leverage at Microsoft.” That diversity of thought helps lead to better thought process, better decision making, and better answers, Hogan explained. It helps Microsoft build better products, with all types of customers in mind. It also ties into the company’s mission statement : “To empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.” We are open to different types of talent. It’s not about lowering the bar; it’s about expanding our pool. “We used to think that engineers and developers had to come from these 16 schools and had to be computer science majors,” Hogan said. “That’s still great talent. But we did some analysis that showed how folks we hire from different schools and different degrees have been equally successful at Microsoft. We are open to different types of talent. It’s not about lowering the bar; it’s about expanding our pool.” Bergan said that veterans know all about diversity, given that the military itself is made up of a diverse cross-section of the population. \n“You bring that same experience of working with people from all over the world and country to the table,” he said. “The mission has to get accomplished no matter who showed up and was on the team that day.” \nMacababbad added that the military helps engrain a “different way of thinking” that is valuable for tech companies. \n“Having different ways of thinking and getting people who all think differently in the same room — that is really what drives innovation,” she said. “Microsoft has been a strong supporter of getting those creative thinkers in the same organization so we can continue to innovate.” Sponsor Post \nThis is part of a special series of stories by GeekWire — underwritten by the Singh Family Foundation and Seattle-area business leader Steve Singh — focusing on important community issues, innovative solutions to societal challenges, and people and non-profit groups making an impact through technology.

      "text": "  \nSome malware hides in the shadows, taking over systems and using them for nefarious activities, such as the denial of services attack that took down the internet a few weeks back. Others are purely destructive, randomly wreaking havoc without concern for who’s affected, or how. \nRansomware is different. It doesn’t destroy data, but merely locks it away behind unbreakable encryption. Far from hiding itself, ransomware announces its presence as a demand for cash in exchange for the encryption key needed to unlock the victim’s data. As a company, Microsoft is keenly aware of the impact of ransomware on its customers, and it has taken significant steps to combat the problem, as the company outlines in a Windows blog post . \nMore: Cybersecurity firm: ransomware has hit epidemic levels \nAccording to Microsoft, the number of ransomware types in the wild has more than doubled in the past year, and the newer types display increased complexity and cost. Browser-based exploits account for 60 percent of all ransomware vectors, something the company has addressed in both Windows 10 and its Edge browser. \nIn addition, Microsoft has addressed vulnerabilities in its email services, added new technology to Windows Defender to more quickly detect and respond to threats, and combined Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection with Windows Defender’s version to help companies in particular attack the threats. These efforts have been combined with Credential Guard, Windows Hello, and other Windows 10 Anniversary Update-specific efforts to lock down Windows 10. \nMicrosoft details their efforts to protect against ransomware in the blog post. Highlights include the use of browser hardening techniques to place vulnerable code like Adobe’s Flash Player in isolated containers where damage can be contained. The company is also applying its vast machine learning infrastructure and knowledge to the issue of identifying, analyzing, classifying, and responding to specific attacks in minutes rather than hours. \nMore: Here are three good free antivirus programs for your PC \nWhile Microsoft has taken significant steps to address malware in general and ransomware specifically, it also has advice for its customers. Not surprisingly, updating to Windows 10 Anniversary Update and accepting default security settings, and keeping machines updated, is at the top of the list. Because ransomware is a threat primarily to vital personal and business data, a comprehensive backup strategy that is consistently implemented is next on the list. \nMicrosoft asserts with some confidence that Windows 10 is the most secure Windows ever, and the company has certainly a invested massive amount of time and money in supporting that statement. As the operating system used by roughly 90 percent of all PCs, Windows is particularly important to ensuring security across the internet, and Microsoft appears to be taking serious steps to help.

The device was another victim of the sale of Nokia’s mobile division to Microsoft and was ultimately cancelled before coming to market, and now lives on in the realm of what could have been.\nIt has leaked out in various prototype forms in the past, but today Nokibar appears to have a production device, complete with plastic wrapper, in action, and has demonstrated how it works in the video below.\nThere is no point in lamenting the device much now, but it seems likely we will never see a Windows Phone-inspired smart watch again, so have a good look below.\n",

Microsoft is aiming for people using the app and program on different platforms – Windows 10 PC, iOS, and Android – to be able to communicate better and build more game-relevant communities within the app.\nThe Xbox Holiday Update brings social connections all around, especially for you guys who use the Xbox Android app. Microsoft said in its post that it aims “to foster a welcoming experience on Xbox Live where everyone is included, respected, and supported.” In that sense, the features are understandably more for community building and groups within the app. See the video below for an overview of the new features.\nThe new Clubs feature are gamer-created and managed groups that help people meet and grow communities of gamers who love the same things you do. Virtually anyone can join or create a Club, so you’ll probably see a Club for just about everything – from cat memes to virtual reality. The “ Looking for Group ” feature will help you find others who are currently playing the same game as you are. There will also be the new Group Messaging feature goes across all platforms and is to be your standard messaging for groups of people within the Xbox ecosystem.\nAndroid users can update their Xbox apps via the Google Play Store now, as the update is already currently rolling out.

      "text": "Print A report noted that Pawn Storm, also known as Fancy Bear, “started to expose much more targets to these vulnerabilities” after Adobe patched a use-after-free vulnerability in its Flash player. \nA new security report casts doubt on Microsoft's attempts to downplay a zero-day exploit used by the Russian APT group Pawn Storm. \nEarlier this month, a company executive characterised the threat actor's use of the exploit as a “low volume spear-phishing campaign”, although a Trend Micro report published Wednesday noted that the APT, known also as Fancy Bear, APT28, Sofacy, and Stronium, “started to expose much more targets to these vulnerabilities” after Adobe patched a use-after-free vulnerability (CVE-2016-7855) in its Flash player. \nTrend Micro threat researchers Stephen Hilt and Feike Hacquebord wrote in the report , entitled Pawn Storm Ramps Up Spear-phishing Before Zero-Days Get Patched , that the firm saw “several campaigns against still-high-profile targets since 28 October until early November 2016.” \nPawn Storm's expanded use of the exploits is “standard adversary behaviour,” according to Invincea CISO Chris Day. In an email to SC Media, he wrote that attackers use high-value exploits more broadly after the tools are discovered and are “declining in utility against high-value targets”. \nMicrosoft encouraged customers to upgrade to Windows 10 and enable Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), a feature that Terry Myerson, executive vice president of windows and devices, promised would “detect Stronium's attempted attacks. However, the software giant did not patch the privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2016-7255) affecting Windows Operating System until 8 November, more than a week after Google disclosed the zero-day. \nPawn Storm is the same APT group that has been linked to hacks of the US Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ), Democratic National Committee ( DNC ), the Olympic drug-testing agency WADA , and email accounts of Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta , former Secretary of State Colin Powell , and other individuals. \nThe APT group “gathers geopolitical information that would be specifically relevant to Russia and it uses the information to leverage future attacks,” according to Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology senior fellow James Scott. He wrote in an email to SC Media that the group “uses spear-phishing campaigns, sophisticated malware, and zero-day exploits” to infiltrate networks of European governments, NATO affiliates, military, security, and news organisations “with the intent of exfiltrating state information that could be used to influence policy decisions, public opinion, or geopolitical issues.” \nMicrosoft has gone to great lengths to dispute Google's characterisation of a known zero-day exploit as a “critical” flaw. Last week, a representative for the software company told SC Media that the company disagrees “with Google's characterisation of a local elevation of privilege as ‘critical' and ‘particularly serious,' since the attack scenario they describe is fully mitigated by the deployment of the Adobe Flash update released last week.” The spokesperson claimed that the attack “was never effective against the Windows 10 Anniversary Update due to security enhancements previously implemented”.

Reuters/Pichi Chuang \nMicrosoft came out with a new laptop in last month's launch event, but it was not the Microsoft Surface Book 2, which will not arrive until next year. \nThe Redmond-based tech giant is expected to use the seventh-generation Intel processor, Kaby Lake on the new iteration of its successful notebook. \nThe Kaby Lake will do wonders in the Microsoft Surface Book 2 all around. First off, it will make possible the use of USB 3.1 Type-C and Thunderbolt 3 support. \nThe former should make for faster and more efficient data transfer and battery charging. The latter is dubbed the fastest, most versatile connection to any dock, display, or peripheral device, which should offer sleek connectivity and performance on the Microsoft Surface Book 2. \nThe Intel Kaby Lake will also be built on a 14-nanometer technology, which is said to boost the performance of chips by 12 percent compared to the Skylake, which is the one on the original Microsoft Surface Book and the i7 version launched last month.
