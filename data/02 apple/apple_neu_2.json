      "text": "Apple’s new iBooks StoryTime app brings children’s books to TV screen November 11, 2016 - 18:19 AMT \nPanARMENIAN.Net - Without any fanfare, Apple has released a new app for tvOS that’s designed to let children and parents read books together before bedtime. iBooks StoryTime is available to download from the App Store on Friday, November 11, and promises to give families a \"different way to experience classic kids' books and discover new favorites,\" The Verge reports. \nYou can use the app to read books on your TV, using the Siri Remote to flip pages, and the app also supports iBooks with the Read-Aloud function. This means there’s pre-recorded narration for the book with automatic page-turning. In some cases there are also sound effects and words are highlighted onscreen as they’re read aloud. Users can purchase iBooks wherever they like, and if their Apple TV is connected to their iCloud account, the titles will automatically appear on the app. \nAvailable Read-Aloud books include Lava, based on the Pixar short, The ABCs of Cookies, The Little Red Hen, Green Eggs and Ham, Meet Tracker, and Goodnight Moon. And anyone who downloads the (free) app will also get a copy of Dora's Big Buddy Race Read-Along Storybook for free to see how the format works on the big screen. Related links:",

      "text": "By Paul Hill Neowin LLC @_paulh93 · 1 hour ago with 6 comments \nOn August 1, 2016, Twitter announced the first annual Twitter Awards with the aim to “recognise and celebrate the amazing creative work of our ad clients all over the world.” The Awards are split into six categories: #Live, #Impact, #Creativity, #Scale, #Customer, and #Growth. In the last day, the results were announced with Apple claiming the #Customer award, which “celebrates businesses that excelled at using Twitter for customer service and made loyal friends for life by treating their customers like, well, family.” \nApple won the award for its @AppleSupport Twitter account, which it uses to help customers with general queries or problems they have with Apple hardware or software. \nRegarding Apple’s win, Twitter wrote: \n“The average online customer service response time is a long, grueling 17 hours. Hours! @AppleSupport decided to do something about that sad stat and use Twitter to respond to customer inquiries and comments. Because of the live nature of Twitter they were also able to pick up conversations with customers at any time, and incorporate rich media into responses to provide even more help to people when and where they need it most.” \nTwitter continued on to say: \n“@AppleSupport has received outstanding customer feedback and generated more than 150,000 likes and Retweets since its launch in March 2016. @AppleSupport ranks #1 among support accounts for average engagements and average engagements for followers’.”",

      "text": "With a zeal for making the world a better place, Lisa Jackson leads Apple's environmental initiatives. (Photo by Paula Burch-Celentano) \n\nIt’s a big and endless job responsibility to bear: “Leave the world better than you found it.” \nThat’s one of the mantras and operating principles of Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, the multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. While many workers might be daunted or even amused by such a directive, his employee of three years, Lisa Perez Jackson (E ’83), finds inspiration in the broad goal. \nJackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, says she starts by breaking down the broad goal into more manageable pieces. \n“I almost look at it in classic engineering fashion, where you have to come in and say, what does that mean? How do you focus that into places where we can really change things?” she said, noting that Apple wants to espouse meaningful and impactful projects that actually make a difference in people’s lives. \nThe company’s core values, all of which touch Jackson’s role, include accessibility of products (“so that everyone has a right to use technology”), education, environmental stewardship, inclusion and diversity, privacy, and supplier responsibility. \nENGINEERING ROCK STAR \nJackson, a New Orleans native and member of the Board of Tulane and the School of Science and Engineering’s Board of Advisors, returned to her hometown in late June to speak at the 4,000-attendee American Society for Engineering Education conference. \nHer arrival at the convention center that day was typical New Orleans: It was pouring rain and a brass band was playing in the background. But if the weather and the music disrupted her train of thought en route to an interview and then the day’s keynote speech, an onlooker would not have noticed. And yes, there were onlookers: Engineering rock stars have their fans, too.",

I go back to my apple wallet earlier this week and it is gone! I spent 2 hours on the phone with Apple for them to tell me there was nothing they can do and that they no longer use passbook. \n\nThe directions that Sephora has on their website are out dated. I used Sephora's instructions on how to add my gift card and now I am out 75 dollars because it disappeared from my Apple wallet since I guess it was not compatible.",

OLED display technology has been heralded as the next big thing for easily a decade, thanks to some inherent benefits such as energy efficiency and the possibility for innovative flexible form factors, among others.

      "text": "\nCall relay, part of Apple's Continuity features, lets you answer and place calls from your iPhone using your Mac, without having to scramble to find your phone. Because call relay uses the same phone number, carrier, and plan as your iPhone, the person on the other end can't tell the difference. It also shows you the caller's number, contact picture, and more, so you don't lose out on any features. Best of all, it's really easy to use — here's how!\nContinuity call relay requirements In order for call relay to work, both your iPhone and Mac need to be:\nRunning iOS 8.1 or later on iPhone, OS X Yosemite or later on Mac. Connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Logged into the same Apple ID (iCloud account). How to enable or disable call relay on the Mac Launch FaceTime from the Dock or Finder. Click on FaceTime in the top menu. Click on Preferences... Click the checkbox next to Calls from iPhone .\n\nTo disable Call Relay, just repeat the same steps at uncheck the box.\nBear in mind that neither the FaceTime app on the phone nor the one on the Mac actually need to be active or running to enable your Mac to make and take calls. It's just that the preferences to manage this feature are kept within FaceTime settings. You can safely exit out of FaceTime on the Mac and still expect it to work.\nHow to enable call relay on your iPhone Launch the Settings app on your iPhone. Tap Phone . Tap Calls on Other Devices . Tap the switch next to Allow Calls on Other Devices . Tap the switch next to each device on which you want to allow calls.\n\nHow to answer a phone call on your Mac Answering a call is one simple step:\nClick on Accept to answer when the notification pops up on the top right of your screen.\n\nHow to decline a call on your Mac Click Decline when the notification pops up on the top right of your screen. Alternatively, you can click the dropdown arrow and choose to be reminded of the call in 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or an hour.\n\nHow to place a phone call on your Mac Launch FaceTime from the Dock or Finder. Enter someone's name or phone number where it says Enter a name, email, or number . Click the phone button . Click the number under Call using iPhone .\n\nQuestions?

      "text": "| Cool Stuff Found \nCheck this out: Apple has apparently added some intelligent storage management to the iOS update process. Mac Geek Gab listener Paul sent in this screenshot of his 16GB iPhone upgrading from iOS 10.1 to iOS 10.1.1. It’s a message telling him that he doesn’t have enough room to run the update. Once upon a time, he’d have been on his own to do something about that. But, iOS is offering to delete Excel from his iPhone, run the iOS update, and then reinstall Excel for him. All automatically. That is seriously cool. [ Update: David Nelson pointed me to an article at MacRumors showing this feature was introduced in iOS 9. I missed it back then, and I’m guessing others did, too. One way or another, I like it.]",

      "text": "Next year's iPhones were already expected to yield the kind of big hardware changes that -- the iPhone 7-Plus' dual-lens camera excepted -- were absent from this year's models. A new report suggests the changes could be even larger than previously expected.\nAll of that is going to make for an interesting iPhone sales cycle, given it will arrive in a year that (given Apple's history) wouldn't normally see big hardware changes.\nBarclays analyst Blayne Curtis, who in 2015 was among the first to report the iPhone 6S would contain new haptic feedback technology (we now know it as 3D Touch), said checks indicate that next year's iPhones will feature \" a bezel-less design ,\" with larger displays and curved edges being placed on devices that have form factors similar to those of the iPhone 7 and 7-Plus.\nBecause of the new design, the phones, which he respectively calls the iPhone 8 and 8-Plus, will reportedly sport 5-inch and 5.8-inch displays, larger than the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays found on the 7 and 7-Plus. Curtis also speculates the screen-size upgrades could lead to Apple's ( AAPL ) low-end iPhones -- a role currently held by the 4-inch iPhone SE -- featuring 4.7-inch displays.\nLike many others , Curtis reports Apple plans to launch iPhones sporting more versatile OLED displays for the first time next year, with Samsung ( SSNLF ) and LG Display acting as the suppliers. However, he adds OLEDs will only be used by the iPhone 8-Plus due to supply constraints.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

      "text": "Markets Today Apple's iPhone 8 Just Keeps Looking Better and Better A new report indicates Apple's 2017 iPhones will have larger displays than this year's models. This, along with other rumored improvements, could make fiscal 2018 estimates look conservative. Eric Jhonsa Nov11,20165:21PMEST \nNext year's iPhones were already expected to yield the kind of big hardware changes that -- the iPhone 7-Plus' dual-lens camera excepted -- were absent from this year's models. A new report suggests the changes could be even larger than previously expected. \nAll of that is going to make for an interesting iPhone sales cycle, given it will arrive in a year that (given Apple's history) wouldn't normally see big hardware changes. \nBarclays analyst Blayne Curtis, who in 2015 was among the first to report the iPhone 6S would contain new haptic feedback technology (we now know it as 3D Touch), said checks indicate that next year's iPhones will feature \" a bezel-less design ,\" with larger displays and curved edges being placed on devices that have form factors similar to those of the iPhone 7 and 7-Plus. \nBecause of the new design, the phones, which he respectively calls the iPhone 8 and 8-Plus, will reportedly sport 5-inch and 5.8-inch displays, larger than the 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays found on the 7 and 7-Plus. Curtis also speculates the screen-size upgrades could lead to Apple's ( AAPL ) low-end iPhones -- a role currently held by the 4-inch iPhone SE -- featuring 4.7-inch displays. \nLike many others , Curtis reports Apple plans to launch iPhones sporting more versatile OLED displays for the first time next year, with Samsung ( SSNLF ) and LG Display acting as the suppliers. However, he adds OLEDs will only be used by the iPhone 8-Plus due to supply constraints. Prev 0 of 3 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "Apple starts selling something it's never sold before By Mark Jones, Komando.com photo courtesy of shutterstock \nAre you one of the millions of people who purchased a new iPhone 7 or 7 Plus? They were released in September and as usual, crowds were lined up for hours waiting to get their hands on one. You can't really blame people for being excited over some of the iPhone's newest innovations. \nHowever, since 2017 is the 10-year anniversary of the iPhone, we're expecting big things out of next year's models. That's why you might want to wait for the iPhone 10 before buying a brand new one. If you can't wait another year for a new phone, you're in luck. For the first time ever, Apple is selling refurbished iPhones. \nYou have been able to purchase a refurbished iPad, iPod or Mac from Apple online for a while now. The tech giant just recently made refurbished iPhones available online for the first time. \nRefurbished options currently are the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus ranging from $449 to $589, depending on the model and storage size. Those prices are 15 percent cheaper than new models. Source Apple \nOn its site, Apple says that all of its refurbished products are tested and certified and include a one-year warranty. All refurbished iPhone models are unlocked, SIM-Free and include a brand new battery and outer shell. You will also receive free shipping and free returns on all of Apple's refurbished products. \nThese refurbished phones are most likely coming from Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program. A large number of iPhone 6S models were traded in when iPhone 7 models were released. \nA refurbished 6S Plus with 64GB of memory is selling for $589. Even though that's less than the cost of a new model, it might seem a little steep. With that in mind, if you can hold off on buying a new phone, you might want to wait for next year's model. \nWould you consider buying one of these refurbished iPhones?

      "title": "Apple’s Tim Cook Reacts to Donald Trump’s Election",
      "text": "Over the last several days, the biggest Apple news was notable for how little was actually made public by the company.\nIn fact, the biggest Apple statement this week likely came from CEO Tim Cook in an internal memo to employees that leaked online. In the memo, Cook attempted to quell unrest among his ranks after Tuesday’s election that saw the American people pick Donald Trump as the country’s next president. The note was all the more notable in light of Cook’s decision not to support Trump during his candidacy.\nThis is Fortune’s weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week's roundup, click here . \nBut Cook and Trump was just the tip of the iceberg. Rumors about the iPhone and iPad were flying fast and furious and there was some speculation about Apple’s future. And certainly no week would be complete without some mention of Apple’s upcoming MacBook Pro.\nWhile it was a quiet week for Apple AAPL , it still had some important headlines. Read on for the biggest Apple news this week:\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nApple CEO Tim Cook sent a memo to employees on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. In it, Cook urged unity among his employees and said it’s time for everyone to move forward. He also reassured employees that regardless of the election results, Apple’s mission and focus will not change. Apple will offer larger displays in its iPhones next year , Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn told investors on Friday. The iPhone 8, as they’re calling it, will ship with a 5-inch screen , and the larger iPhone 8 Plus will deliver a 5.8-inch display. The screen will run from one edge of the smartphone to the other, the analysts say. In addition, their supply chain sources say Apple is preparing new iPads for March. Apple’s MacBook Pro hasn’t been released yet but it’s already popular . According to new data from research firm Slice Intelligence, the MacBook Pro’s preorders have already exceeded sales over the last year for its top Windows-based competitors. It’s well on its way to becoming the best-selling laptop released in the last two years. That success has reportedly prompted Apple to ramp up MacBook Pro production and satisfy heavier-than-expected demand. For the first time since 2007, Apple is selling refurbished iPhones . When customers go to its e-retail store, they can buy refurbished iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus units. All of the available devices have been certified and come with both a new battery and one-year warranty. Customers can save $100 or more buying the refurbished iPhones rather than the new models. Apple could be planning to release a Jet White version of its iPhone 7 , according to rumors. The Jet White version would come with a glossy finish similar to the Jet Black iPhone 7. Apple hasn’t signaled it’s planning a new iPhone 7 color, however, so the rumor should be taken with the proverbial grain of salt. The Apple News app on iOS, which lets users read content from both small and large media outlets, is driving significant traffic to those publishers . Some media outlets reported in a study by the Nieman Journalism Lab that their audience has soared by 500% because of Apple News . If you’re shopping this holiday season, beware of fake retail apps. Earlier this week, there were hundreds of fake retail apps available in Apple’s App Store , mobile analytics company Branding Brand told The New York Times . Apple has since removed the offending apps , which mimicked real stores from prominent companies, including Dollar Tree and Nordstrom , but Branding Brand says fake apps are cropping up all the time in iOS. Their goal? To steal sensitive customer information, including credit cards.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple’s Tim Cook Reacts to Donald Trump’s Election \nOver the last several days, the biggest Apple news was notable for how little was actually made public by the company. \nIn fact, the biggest Apple statement this week likely came from CEO Tim Cook in an internal memo to employees that leaked online. In the memo, Cook attempted to quell unrest among his ranks after Tuesday’s election that saw the American people pick Donald Trump as the country’s next president. The note was all the more notable in light of Cook’s decision not to support Trump during his candidacy. This is Fortune’s weekly roundup of the biggest Apple news this week. To see last week’s roundup, click here . \nBut Cook and Trump was just the tip of the iceberg. Rumors about the iPhone and iPad were flying fast and furious and there was some speculation about Apple’s future. And certainly no week would be complete without some mention of Apple’s upcoming MacBook Pro. \nWhile it was a quiet week for Apple AAPL , it still had some important headlines. Read on for the biggest Apple news this week: Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter Apple CEO Tim Cook sent a memo to employees on Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. In it, Cook urged unity among his employees and said it’s time for everyone to move forward. He also reassured employees that regardless of the election results, Apple’s mission and focus will not change. Apple will offer larger displays in its iPhones next year , Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn told investors on Friday. The iPhone 8, as they’re calling it, will ship with a 5-inch screen , and the larger iPhone 8 Plus will deliver a 5.8-inch display. The screen will run from one edge of the smartphone to the other, the analysts say. In addition, their supply chain sources say Apple is preparing new iPads for March. Apple’s MacBook Pro hasn’t been released yet but it’s already popular . According to new data from research firm Slice Intelligence, the MacBook Pro’s preorders have already exceeded sales over the last year for its top Windows-based competitors. It’s well on its way to becoming the best-selling laptop released in the last two years. That success has reportedly prompted Apple to ramp up MacBook Pro production and satisfy heavier-than-expected demand. For the first time since 2007, Apple is selling refurbished iPhones . When customers go to its e-retail store, they can buy refurbished iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus units. All of the available devices have been certified and come with both a new battery and one-year warranty. Customers can save $100 or more buying the refurbished iPhones rather than the new models. Apple could be planning to release a Jet White version of its iPhone 7 , according to rumors. The Jet White version would come with a glossy finish similar to the Jet Black iPhone 7. Apple hasn’t signaled it’s planning a new iPhone 7 color, however, so the rumor should be taken with the proverbial grain of salt. The Apple News app on iOS, which lets users read content from both small and large media outlets, is driving significant traffic to those publishers . Some media outlets reported in a study by the Nieman Journalism Lab that their audience has soared by 500% because of Apple News . If you’re shopping this holiday season, beware of fake retail apps. Earlier this week, there were hundreds of fake retail apps available in Apple’s App Store , mobile analytics company Branding Brand told The New York Times . Apple has since removed the offending apps , which mimicked real stores from prominent companies, including Dollar Tree and Nordstrom , but Branding Brand says fake apps are cropping up all the time in iOS. Their goal? To steal sensitive customer information, including credit cards. \nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: ",

      "text": "Apple’s wireless AirPods release date leaked   12:22 pm   Apple’s innovative wireless AirPods are slated to hit store shelves later this month, not January 2017, as previously reported. Apple AirPods made its debut along with the new iPhone 7 series in September. During the launch, the company had promised to release the hearing accessory in late October, but it never materialized. Now, it has come to light that Apple AirPods will be made available on November 17 onwards with shipping to kick-off on either November 18 or 19, ApfelPage reported citing a German consumer who booked the AirPods on authorised Apple re-seller Conrad.As of now, there is no word whether this arrangement is limited to Europe or worldwide. Apple has not made many official comments on this matter. We just have to wait for a few more days to really know if this official release schedule of Apple AirPods is true or an false alarm. For those uninitiated, Apple AirPods is powered by Apple’s proprietary W1 chip. It also with dual optical sensors and accelerometers in each AirPod that work with the W1 chip to detect when AirPods are in your ear, so they only play when you are ready to listen.If the user removes the AirPods, iPhone automatically pauses the music. Users can also access Siri by double tapping the AirPods to select and control the music, change the volume, check your battery life or perform any other Siri task. With an additional accelerometer in each AirPod, it intuitively knows whether user is speaking, enabling a pair of beam-forming microphones to focus on the sound of your voice, filtering out external noise to make your voice sound clearer.Another interesting aspect of the AirPods is its ultra-low power consumption. Apple’s W1 chip operates at one-third of the power of traditional wireless chips, enabling AirPods to deliver up to 5 hours of listening time on one charge. The custom-designed charging case holds additional charge of more than 24 hours of total listening time,ensuring AirPods are charged and ready to go anytime. Air Pods will be sold as a separate accessory for $159 in US with a charging case. [Note: It costs Rs. 15,400 in India]",

      "text": "Apple’s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come in Jet Black, Matte Black, Silver, Gold, and Rose Gold. It’s a lineup from which, if you haven’t noticed, the Space Gray option has been removed. So with five colors on offer, two of them immediately stood out to consumers. They were the Jet Black iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 in Matte Black, both of which are beautiful looking handsets in their own rights, but the Jet Black is the hardest to find, which must mean it’s the best seller.\n\nJet Black iPhone 7 vs. iPhone 7 Matte Black If you haven’t seen either of the iPhones in these striking new colors yet, the best way to do so is in person, either at an Apple Store or a retailer. However, the next best thing is online, so let’s have a look at each in some detail.\nMatte Black The Matte Black iPhonw 7 is made from matte anodized aluminum. Imagine an old iPod Nano; it looks sharp. In fact, it looks so dark that it’s much darker than the defunct Space Gray ever was. Of the two colors, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in this color are still available.\nJet Black Some have described the Jet Black iPhone 7 as being “Piano Black.” The handset has been super polished to get this look; if you held one, it would feel/look like glass. As other ways it has been described, this may be a little retro. But some feel that it looks a little like the iPhone 3G with its black polycarbonate finish. Of the two colors here, this one is the harder to come by at the moment.\nWhich one will you choose? Most companies are quite secretive about how their products are manufactured, but that’s not something that Apple does. Instead, it is keen to show consumers and the press how the engineering process works. For many a reason, unlike others, it wants to show how sophisticated the process of creating the iPhone has become.\nTo that end, it has even gone as far as producing iPhone 7 design videos, in which you can see handsets like the Jet Black iPhone 7 being created. If you take a look at the video below, narrated by Jony Ive, you will notice that all of the color variants other than the Jet Black are created with the same anodized matte finish.\nJet Black negatives While the Jet Black iPhone 7 is considered to be the most stunning of the colors available, it is not free from problems. To start with, it is a magnet for scratches, which many have complained about on social media.\nImage Source: Twitter Apple itself have warned owners about the Jet Black variant, that its highly polished surface will show micro-abrasions. But this is nothing new, as the older iPhones which were made from polycarbonate were also prone to scratches. However, this is just a warning; if you decide to choose the Jet Black iPhone 7, you will need to be very careful with it. Even the most careful of owners have reported scuffs appearing in the first week of use.\nWhen the Rose Gold iPhone 5s was released, it was considered to be almost like a piece of jewelry, and so is the Jet Black iPhone. The best thing to do is place it in a protective case, but get the case before the phone arrives. That way you’re taking no chances.\nWhich iPhone color you go for should just be based on the color you like, not “Scratchgate.” After all, if you’re going to spend so much money on a phone, you should protect it in a case, no matter what color it is.\n\nThe post Jet Black iPhone 7 vs. iPhone 7 Matte Black: Which One Do You Want? appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "\nKnow how to use the tools your given to keep your phone and your data secure.\nGoogle, Apple , and Microsoft have great tools for managing your online security . Some implementations may be technically better than others, but you can be reasonably sure that your data — both on the phone and in the cloud — is safe. If you need more reassurance or have different needs, third-party companies are available that with the big three to provide enterprise-grade security assurances. No method is 100% secure, and ways to get around it are found regularly; then patched quickly so the cycle can repeat. But these methods are usually complicated and very time-consuming and rarely widespread.\nThis means you are the weakest link in any chain of security. If you want to keep your data — or your company's — secured you need to force someone to use these complicated time-consuming methods if they wanted to get into your phone. Secure data needs to be difficult to obtain and difficult to decipher if someone does get hold of it.With Android, there are several things you can do to make someone work really hard to get your data — hopefully so hard that they don't bother trying.\nUse a secure lock screen \nHaving a secure lock screen is the easiest way to limit access to the data on your phone or the cloud. Whether you just left your phone on your desk while you had to walk away for a moment or two or if you've lost your phone or had it stolen a lock screen that can't be simple to bypass is the best way to limit that access.\nThe first step is to lock the front door.\nIf your company issued you a phone or you work for someone with a BYOD policy there's a good chance your phone is forced by a security policy to have password protection and your IT department may have assigned you a username and password to unlock it.\nAny method that locks your phone is better than none, but generally a random six-digit PIN is enough to require someone have special knowledge and tools to bypass it without triggering any self-destruct settings. Longer randomized alpha-numeric passwords mean they will need the right tools and a lot of time. Entering a long complex password on a phone is inconvenient for you and we tend not to use things that inconvenience us so alternatives have been thought up that use patterns, pictures, voiceprints and a host of other things easier to do than typing a long password. Read the instructions and overview for each and decide which works best for you. Just make sure you're using one.\nEncryption and two-factor authentication Encrypt all of your local data and protect your data in the cloud with two-factor authentication on your account logins.\nRecent versions of Android come encrypted by default. Android 7 uses file-level encryption for faster access and granular control. Your corporate data may have another level of security to reinforce this. Don't do anything to try and lessen it. A phone that needs to be unlocked to decrypt the data is one that only someone dedicated is going to try to crack.\nOnline accounts all need to use a strong password and two-factor authentication if offered. Don't use the same password across multiple sites and use a password manager to keep track of them. A centralized spot with all your account credentials is worth risking if it means you'll actually use good passwords.\nKnow what you're tapping on Never open a link or message from someone you don't know. Let those people email you if they need to make the first contact, and offer them the same courtesy and use email instead of a DM or a text message to get in touch with them the first time. And never click a random web link from someone you don't trust. I trust the Wall Street Journal's Twitter account, so I'll click obscured Twitter links. But I won't for someone I don't trust as much.\nTrust is a major part of security at every level.\nThe reason isn't paranoia. Malformed videos were able to cause an Android phone to freeze up and had the potential to allow elevated permissions to your file system where a script could silently install malware. A JPG or PDF file was shown to do the same on the iPhone. Both instances were quickly patched, but it's certain that another similar exploit will be found now that the \"right\" people for the job know where to look. Files sent through email will have been scanned and links in the email body are easy to spot. The same can't be said for a text message or a Facebook DM.\nOnly install trusted applications \nFor most, that means Google Play . If an app or link directs you to install it from somewhere else, decline. This means you won't need to enable the \"unknown sources\" setting required to install apps that didn't originate from a Google server in the Play Store. Only installing apps from the Play Store means Google is monitoring their behavior, not you. They are better at it than we are.\nIf you need to install apps from another source you need to make sure you trust the source itself. Actual malware that probes and exploits the software on your phone can only happen if you approved the installation. And as soon as you're finished installing or updating an app this way, turn the Unknown sources setting back on as a way to combat trickery and social engineering to get you to install an app manually.\nNone of this will make your phone 100% secure. 100% security isn't the goal here and never is. The key is to make any data that's valuable to someone else difficult to get. The higher the level of difficulty, the more valuable the data has to be in order to make getting it worthwhile.\nSome data is more valuable that others, but all of it is worth protecting.\nPictures of my dogs or maps to the best trout streams in the Blue Ridge Mountains won't require the same level of protection because they aren't of value to anyone but me. Quarterly reports or customer data stored in your corporate email may be worth the trouble to get and need extra layers.\nLuckily, even low-value data is easy to keep secure using the tools provided and these few tips.\n",

      "text": "Pinterest \nNext year will be the 10 th anniversary of the iPhone. According to many reports, Apple is planning something big for its 2017 iPhone, most likely called the iPhone 8. There have been plenty of rumours saying that there will be a major redesign, and even the latest rumour says so. According to Barclays supply chain analysts, the iPhone 8 will feature bezel-free design, and come with larger displays of up to 5.8”. \nThe current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have displays of 4.7” and 5.5” respectively. According to the rumour, Apple will be increasing the displays to 5” and 5.8” for the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The larger variant will use OLED technology, while the 5” iPhone 8 will use a regular LCD display. Concept image of an iPhone without its Home Button by Martin Hajek \nWe’ve seen rumours saying that Apple will also ditch its signature home button on the iPhone 8 however, Barclays does not believe so. The analysts says that the screen’s dimensions in the casing will “extend vertically as well as horizontally” overlapping the home button, but without any visuals, it doesn’t seem to make any sense. Apple Watch Series 2 Now Available for Purchase on Apple Malaysia's Online Store \nOf course, it’s still early and things could change; even Barclays does not seem confident at their report, saying that the design “didn’t sound 100% locked down”. Let’s hope that Apple has something exciting lined up for its 2017 iPhone because after using a similar design for three generations, it’s definitely time for a change.",

The device looks like a small bluetooth headset, and works quite similar. The biggest advantage that many people will find usefull is the SIRI system which sounds and works exactly the same as on the Iphone. All you need for this system to work is a car with a bluetooth connection. After that you simply configure the car with Iphone and then the Iphone with Mobile home. You can clip the device to the sun visor and press it only once to wake up SIRI. The biggest downfall is that this device needs to be connected to the internet all the time which can be hard for a moving vehicle.",

      "title": "Apple’s New MacBook Pro: Fast and Light, but Not for Everyone",
      "text": "  The benefits? The new laptops are faster, much thinner and lighter than the previous generation, and they have about 10 hours of battery life. The Touch Bar’s virtual buttons transform depending on the app you are using, unlocking the potential for software makers to create custom shortcuts. \nAdvertisement   I tested the new MacBook Pros — which cost $1,500 to $2,800, depending on the model — while gathering reactions to the new computers from engineers and information technology professionals over two weeks. I concluded that while the new laptops are capable enough for many professionals, there is no need to rush to buy one. Here are the highlights and lowlights of the new MacBook Pros: USB-C: Stock Up on Adapters With the new laptops, Apple has gone all in on USB-C , the next-generation USB port. This small, oval-shaped connection is expected to replace the bulkier, rectangular port known as USB-A on many computing devices and accessories in the next few years. In my tests, having only USB-C on the MacBook Pros was the biggest change. The previous MacBook Pros included USB-A and some other types of ports, including HDMI, for connecting devices like printers and monitors. Now the USB-C ports will be the only way to hook up just about everything, including power chargers, external screens and photo-card readers, to the laptop. The entry-level MacBook Pro has two USB-C ports, and the higher-end models include four. What this means in the near term is that you may have to buy adapters to plug in devices with different connectors. Annoyingly, that includes the iPhone power cable, which has a USB-A connector. So to charge an iPhone on a new MacBook Pro, for example, you have to hook up the cable to a dongle that connects USB-A and USB-C devices. The transition to USB-C might be a headache, but it is easily resolved by picking up some inexpensive adapters. I bought mine from Monoprice . In the long run, Apple’s shift to USB-C will help set an industry standard, said Brian Denslow, a technician for TechCollective, an information technology consulting company in San Francisco. The goal is to reach a point where all peripheral devices are made with a USB-C connector. So eventually you won’t need adapters. “We’re going to cut ties with the past and go with the new standard, finally,” Mr. Denslow said. Touch Bar: A Blank Slate With the Touch Bar, Apple intended to replace some outdated keys with a versatile strip that adapts to the apps you are using. Apple also built a fingerprint sensor into the Touch Bar. \nAdvertisement   The Touch Bar is a breeze to get the hang of, but I didn’t find it helpful in streamlining tasks. If you open the Photos app, for example, the Touch Bar displays thumbnails of photos in your library, and you can tap one to select a photo to edit. That’s neat, but why not just select the photo on your laptop screen? When using the Safari browser, you can use the Touch Bar to select a different browser tab — but using keyboard shortcuts (Command+1 to choose the first tab, for instance) is quicker. The Escape key also exists as a virtual button on the Touch Bar. I didn’t mind that because I rarely use this key, but the design decision made Mr. Leventhal, the software engineer, wince. He said the physical Escape key was crucial for coders, and not being able to press it seemed crippling. The jury is still out on whether the Touch Bar will be a must-have. When switching back to a laptop with a normal keyboard, I didn’t feel as if I was missing anything. But much like the iPhone on Day 1, the Touch Bar is essentially a blank slate, and the onus is on app developers to make it more compelling. Speed and Memory Limits Many Apple loyalists have fixated on the memory constraints and underwhelming performance of the new MacBook Pros. The new models have a maximum of 16 gigabytes of RAM — the same limit as the previous MacBook Pro — and roughly the same processor speed as the last professional notebooks. But that’s not the full story. The new notebooks are much faster in some ways than older models, while other parts are only slightly faster. In speed tests run with the app Geekbench 4, the 15-inch MacBook Pro’s computer processor was only 10 percent to 17 percent faster than the 15-inch model released in 2012. Yet the graphics processor, which is crucial for heavy computing tasks, in the new MacBook Pro is about twice as fast as the one in the older model, and the storage drives are much faster, too. The RAM limit might irk users who need power. The more RAM you have, the more applications you can open and the more quickly your computer can juggle them. The problem, in theory, is that in a few years if your future apps hog more memory, you won’t be able to add more memory to MacBook Pros because the most they can hold is 16 gigabytes. Wait for the Early Adopters Professional Mac users are too divided on the MacBook Pro for me to make a blanket recommendation. One thing is sure: For casual users or anyone buying their first laptop, who may just want a computer for web browsing and lightweight apps, the MacBook Pro is overkill. A Chromebook, like the $430 Chromebook 13 from Dell, or the $1,000 MacBook Air , Apple’s least expensive notebook computer, are slower and have lower-resolution screens, but they are powerful enough for your needs. The new MacBook Pros are probably powerful enough for most professionals. But if you consider yourself a power user and are skeptical about the MacBook Pro, you might wait to see whether the initial concerns are borne out after early adopters start using their machines. Plenty have already bought them: Apple said early orders for the new MacBook Pro have been stronger than for past professional notebooks. \nAdvertisement   On the plus side, these notebooks are fast, with high-resolution screens and responsive keyboards. But the Touch Bar so far feels gimmicky, and not many devices or accessories come with USB-C connectors yet. The MacBook Pros are also expensive, and some users may end up spending thousands of dollars above the retail price for add-ons like extra storage. So if you aren’t ready to make the jump to USB-C and you don’t want to spend a big chunk of your savings, it’s reasonable to wait for the new Apple notebooks to realize their potential or drop in price. Mr. Leventhal says he is exploring other options such as a Hackintosh — a generic PC that is modified to run the Mac operating system. “It’s a dark place where you’re doing something that is basically illegal and spending a ton of time to even make it feasible, but I have no good options,” he said.",

      "text": "What to do when Apple tells you there’s not enough storage to re-sync iCloud Photo Library Funky things happen if you turn off iCloud Photo Library and then turn it back on. Senior Contributor, Macworld Nov 14, 2016 5:00 AM \nJoe Sarsero writes in with an issue about disabling and re-enabling iCloud Photo Library in macOS. His wife turned iCloud Photo Library off with her 250GB set of photos and videos on a Mac with about 100GB of storage remaining on the drive. She then re-enabled it. She had full-resolution images turned on, so she didn’t lose any media in the process. (As to why, he didn’t say, but I did the same thing recently!) \nHowever, Joe writes: \nAn error message appeared stating that photos in iCloud could not be downloaded to the Mac because there was not enough disk space. She would need to enable the Optimize Mac Storage setting in order to use iCloud Photo Library again on the Mac. I don’t understand what is happening. Full-resolution images are already on Mac. \niCloud and macOS are very, very bad at what should be a rudimentary sync operation. Apple must be using techniques that let it compare whether a photo in Photos for iOS or macOS already exists in the synced set at iCloud and on each connected device. \niCloud Photo Library restarts the sync from scratch if you disable and re-enable the option. \nAnd yet, when I tested disabling and re-enabling iCloud sync, as Joe’s wife did, I was told I didn’t have enough storage at iCloud, even though I had nearly 90GB free and my library is about 115GB. That library was already stored in iCloud in identical form. \nInstead of first comparing photos in iCloud with those on my system, I wasn’t able to proceed without upgrading my storage and then later downgrading it. (Apple lacks automatic pro-rated refunds, and even though it says you can email to obtain such a refund, I received no response to my email.) \nThere’s some sense in this: Apple doesn’t want you to start an operation that will fail. But it could also predict whether it would work or not. \nJoe’s wife experienced the reverse: I’m guessing she has a 500GB iCloud subscription, required to store a 250GB library, and thus had enough “room” to upload a full new set, if Photos decided it needed to. That prevented her from seeing the error I did. \nHowever, lacking enough free storage on the Mac to download that same amount of data, the download error displayed. There’s not much you can do about, because you can’t force iCloud to “believe” all the images are already synced. \nI had assumed, as with most sync systems, Apple computes a kind of mathematical shorthand or signature that lets it compare two media files without uploading or download the entire file. If so, it should be a matter of minutes to scan and compare even tens of thousands of items. I have to conclude Apple doesn’t do that. \nI can think of a few scenarios that might help Joe and spouse: \nMove enough other files off the boot drive temporarily to an external drive to free up the space iCloud demands. \nSwitch to optimize, and hope that Photos doesn’t actually delete any or many full-resolution images. It should sync one at a time, and thus not flush full-resolution files unless it runs very low on space, which won’t occur. After the sync, turn back on the full-resolution option. \nCopy the library to an external drive with sufficient free storage and set it as the primary Photos library, then enable iCloud Photo Library, and, after syncing, copy it back to the main drive and point to it as the main library—and hope that Photos retains the sync status. \nSadly, in each of these options, I fear that Apple will download all images afresh instead of just confirming that they’re synced. In my upload situation that I note above, my system seemingly re-uploaded 115GB of data, even though it was all identical and the final outcome resulted in no changes. \nI have a uncapped gigabit internet, and was able to let the process take many hours. Joe notes, “We have poor bandwidth speed and data caps,” which makes the problem even worse. \nI wish I had a better advice. If you can take the computer to a friendly person or location with very high-speed internet and no overage charges, that may be your best bet.

      "text": "Luxury watches get smarter Wearable technology is handicapped by batteries. The Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) Watch has 18 hours of battery life, and a Fitbit Flex needs to be recharged every five days. Compared to traditional watches with batteries that last for years, smart wrist accessories are excruciatingly limited. \nBut Bay Area-startup Matrix Industries wants to free us from battery woes. Its first wearable is charged by body heat. \nThe PowerWatch uses thermoelectrics, a material which converts temperature differences into electricity. On a small scale, it's still a relatively nascent technology, but you'll find it in picnic coolers that plug into your car or seat coolers in luxury vehicles. \nHere's how it works: When electron particles are heated and move from the side touching your body to the exposed watch face -- which tends to be cooler -- it creates a voltage difference that generates power. This charges the battery, so you don't need to connect it to a power source. \n\nThe power meter is prominently displayed as a ring around the watch, highlighting the changes in the battery level. We tested how the watch's prototype responded to body heat by power walking around a conference room. The battery level ticked up in response to the movement. \nRelated: Apple Watch sales are way down: Are smartwatches still cool? \n\"When you exercise, your skin gets warmer, so you'll generate more power,\" Akram Boukai, Matrix Industries cofounder and CEO, told CNNMoney. \"It's kind of motivational.\" \nThe PowerWatch is similar to other fitness trackers and includes calorie, sleep and step tracking. A companion app displays those stats and highlights many watts of power you've generated throughout the day. \nWhile it doesn't have as many capabilities as the Apple Watch or a Fitbit, it's a way for the company to demonstrate how the tech could be incorporated into wearables in the future. Boukai and his team plan to take thermoelectric energy harvesting to healthcare, manufacturing and shipping industries. \nFor example, Boukai anticipates it will help patients with hearing aids avoid the need to constantly change their batteries. It could also assist those with pacemakers who have to replace their batteries every five to 10 years. \nThe process of pushing thermoelectrics into the size of a watch couldn't have happened five years ago. But improvements in microprocessors have made it possible to build something that fits on the wrist. \nLarger wrists, that is. Matrix is launching its watch line for men first , starting November 14 for $99.99. The price will eventually jump to $170 when it hits retail stores late next year. The company plans to debut watches for women in the future. \nThe startup, which was founded in 2011, has raised $8.5 million from investors including Khosla Ventures, 3M Corporation and Sand Hill Angels. \nCNNMoney (San Francisco)   9:00 AM ET",

      "text": "PanoMoments' '360-degree living photos' are a kind of mashup between 360-degree images and Apple's Live Photos. It's not quite video, and it's not a static image: PanoMoments can be created using any robotic panorama head (though the company is producing a specialized one), uploaded to their website for conversion and viewed on the web, with a VR headset or on a mobile device. Varying the time it takes for the device to complete a full rotation gives the resulting product a 'live photos' feel or a more time-lapse effect. \nClick to view this PanoMoment. Note that you will need to be running Google Chrome version > 52.x or viewing on a modern Android/iOS smartphone. The process for creating a PanoMoment begins with the camera of your choice (ideally a larger sensor ILC) and a circular fisheye lens. Using PanoMoments' PanoCatcher Loop or any panorama head, the camera is rotated 360-degrees while capturing at least 120 images. Convert your images to equirectangular format, upload them to PanoMoments.com and voila - you've got a PanoMoment. You can upload up to 20GB worth of images for free, while a 'Pro' membership will get you 500GB.\nAt the moment, PanoMoments' creators are looking for funding through Kickstarter to help with building costs. Currently, a $270 pledge will get you a PanoCatcher Loop along with a 1 year Pro membership.\nHead over to their Kickstarter page to learn more and see additional PanoMoments.",

      "text": "(CNN)– Wearable technology is handicapped by batteries.\nThe Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) Watch has 18 hours of battery life, and a Fitbit Flex needs to be recharged every five days. Compared to traditional watches with batteries that last for years, smart wrist accessories are excruciatingly limited.\nBut Bay Area-startup Matrix Industries wants to free us from battery woes. Its first wearable is charged by body heat.\nThe PowerWatch uses thermoelectrics, a material which converts temperature differences into electricity. On a small scale, it’s still a relatively nascent technology, but you’ll find it in picnic coolers that plug into your car or seat coolers in luxury vehicles.\nHere’s how it works: When electron particles are heated and move from the side touching your body to the exposed watch face — which tends to be cooler — it creates a voltage difference that generates power. This charges the battery, so you don’t need to connect it to a power source.\nThe power meter is prominently displayed as a ring around the watch, highlighting the changes in the battery level. We tested how the watch’s prototype responded to body heat by power walking around a conference room. The battery level ticked up in response to the movement.\n“When you exercise, your skin gets warmer, so you’ll generate more power,” Akram Boukai, Matrix Industries cofounder and CEO, told CNNMoney. “It’s kind of motivational.”\nThe PowerWatch is similar to other fitness trackers and includes calorie, sleep and step tracking. A companion app displays those stats and highlights many watts of power you’ve generated throughout the day.\nWhile it doesn’t have as many capabilities as the Apple Watch or a Fitbit, it’s a way for the company to demonstrate how the tech could be incorporated into wearables in the future. Boukai and his team plan to take thermoelectric energy harvesting to healthcare, manufacturing and shipping industries.\nFor example, Boukai anticipates it will help patients with hearing aids avoid the need to constantly change their batteries. It could also assist those with pacemakers who have to replace their batteries every five to 10 years.\nThe process of pushing thermoelectrics into the size of a watch couldn’t have happened five years ago. But improvements in microprocessors have made it possible to build something that fits on the wrist.\nLarger wrists, that is. Matrix is launching its watch line for men first , starting November 14 for $99.99. The price will eventually jump to $170 when it hits retail stores late next year. The company plans to debut watches for women in the future.\nThe startup, which was founded in 2011, has raised $8.5 million from investors including Khosla Ventures, 3M Corporation and Sand Hill Angels.",

      "text": "YouTube/Real Time with Bill Maher \nHalf the nation needed comic relief after seeing their candidate fail to win the 2016 presidential election. And liberal comic and political commentator Bill Maher delivered on his Friday night HBO show \"Real Time with Bill Maher.\"\nWhile the show was filled with many laugh-out-loud funny moments (as well as a \"We're still here\" call to action for Democrats and others appalled by Trump's divisive campaign rhetoric), there was a particularly funny idea from Maher for Apple. During a shtick on what Democrats should do now, he said (emphasis ours):\nIt’s now Liberal’s Turn to become Doomsday-prepping gun nuts. They just need survival products tailored to our lifestyle like freeze-dried kale and quinoa salad, pomegranate-scented emergency candles, camouflage in Pantone spring fashion colors of pale dogwood and hazelnut and most importantly, the Apple iDefender. It’s like any other shotgun only twice as expensive, only accepts Apple’s proprietary iShells, and they removed the barrel sight to make it thinner. \nHere's the clip:\nRAW Embed \nAnd, as we are all painfully aware these days, we live in a very divided nation, so Maher was an equal opportunity offender to the other side. During a bit called Future Headlines, he also took on Samsung (as well as driverless cars and a pretty funny joke about MSNBC's liberal news commentator Rachel Maddow):\nRAW Embed  \nNOW WATCH: Trump goes on a tweetstorm less than 48 hours after promising to be more 'restrained' on Twitter \n",

      "text": "Sometimes it seems like Apple's products never go on sale. There's usually a good handful of deals every year around Black Friday, however, especially if you're shopping for an iPad or Apple Watch.\nThe best deals this year seem to involve the iPad Mini 2 , iPad Air 2 , 9.7-inch iPad Pro , Apple Watch Series 1, iPhone 7 and a handful of MacBooks. These are the Black Friday specials that Best Buy , Walmart and Target are advertising so far.\nGift cards are your holiday iPhone bonus.\nPhoto by Sarah Tew/CNET iPhone: Get a gift card Target, Walmart and Best Buy are all offering gift cards with the purchase of an iPhone 7 , 7 Plus or even older iPhones on a number of carriers, but the deals vary subtly. CNET's Lynn La broke down the deals in detail.\nBest Buy: iPhone 7 deal. If you buy an iPhone 7 (not a 7 Plus) on an AT&T Next, Verizon Device or Sprint 24-month installment plan, Best Buy will give you a store gift card. The 256GB model comes with a $250 store gift card, but this is an in-store deal only. If you buy a 32GB or 128GB iPhone 7 (online or in-store), you'll still receive a gift card -- just not for $250. For more information, check out Best Buy's Black Friday ad .\nTarget: iPhone 7 or 7 Plus deal. If you buy either an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, you'll receive a $250 Target gift card. This is an in-store exclusive. iPhones need to be bought on an AT&T Next, Verizon Device or Sprint 24-month installment or lease plan. For more information, check out Target's Black Friday ad .\nWalmart: deal on lots of iPhones. Walmart gives you a $250 store gift card for any iPhone you buy in-store on an AT&T Next or Verizon Device installment plan. This includes the iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus and SE. For more information, check out Walmart's Black Friday ad .\nThe Series 1 Apple Watch has a faster processor, but you can't swim with it.\nPhoto by Sarah Tew/CNET Apple Watch Series 1 for under $200 Target is selling the Series 1 Apple Watch, which has a faster processor but isn't fully swimproof and lacks the GPS of Series 2 . At $198, it's $70 less than Apple's $269 starting price. This is a good Apple Watch model, and the best deal out there we've seen.\nPencil not included.\nPhoto by Sarah Tew/CNET 9.7-inch iPad Pro, $150 off Target is selling the 9.7-inch iPad Pro starting at $449, although it isn't clear which models will be sold. Still, for the base 32GB model, that would be $150.99 savings. Best Buy is offering a slightly less attractive deal of $125 off all 9.7-inch iPad Pros.\niPad Mini 2 for $200 You can save $70 off the normal $269 price of the 32GB iPad Mini 2 . Target and Walmart are both offering the Mini 2 for $200. The Mini 2 is getting long in the tooth with an older processor, but it's a serviceable mini iPad for kids and travel.\niPad Air 2, save $125 If you're shopping for a larger-screened more affordable iPad, the iPad Air 2 (which also has a much better A8X processor versus the A7 on the Mini 2) will be on sale at Target starting at $274. For the 32GB base model, that's a good deal.\nStill a solid laptop, and it has normal ports.\nPhoto by Sarah Tew/CNET MacBook Air for $799 The 13-inch, 128GB model of the MacBook Air is on sale for $799 at Best Buy , the lowest price we've seen yet for a MacBook. The 256GB model is $999, also not a bad deal: both save a couple hundred dollars, but remember that the Air doesn't have a Retina Display. It does, however, has phenomenal battery life (and normal USB ports).",

      "text": "Tags : Apple - Apple + Wearables - Wearables + Remember Google Glass? Sure you do. The smart spectacles never lived up to the very first video that showed us what a typical day in the life of a Google Glass wearer would be like . But as it turned out, there were some things about the device that didn't appeal to consumers, especially the $1,500 price tag. Thanks to the built-in camera, there was also the douche bag effect that tainted all Glass wearers and led to numerous eateries, theaters and bars banning the device from their premises.Now, it appears as though Apple wants to try its hand at producing smart glasses. Apple's intelligent spectacles would wirelessly pair with a user's iPhone in a manner similar to how the Apple Watch links to an iOS powered handset. In addition to showing images from an iPhone, the smart glasses would also employ Augmented Reality.Don't expect Apple's smart glasses to be available soon. Apple has ordered some parts and components for testing according to Bloomberg, but not enough to indicate that mass production is imminent. According to one person who apparently is in the know, the product wouldn't see the light of day until 2018. Back during the summer, Apple CEO Tim Cook raved about AR and the rumored glasses could be Apple's first AR product. Hopefully Apple learned something from Google's problems and doesn't promise more than it can deliver. \"(Augmented Reality) is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it. Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.\"-Tim Cook, CEO, Apple Take a nostalgic look at Google's first video for its 'Project Glass' video by clicking on the video at the top of the story.",

Apple has already begun talking with potential suppliers and has ordered small quantities for testing. If Apple proceeds with this project, a tentative introduction would be 2018, at the earliest.

      "text": "Apple is working on smart glasses (AAPL) Kif Leswing, provided by Published 7:00 pm, Monday, November 14, 2016 \nAP / Matthew Sumner for Getty Images \nApple is working on a pair of smart glasses. \nThe product would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, according to Bloomberg sources . The project is advanced enough to be in talks with suppliers, according to the report. \nThe smart glasses would be Apple's first in a category of product that was originally pioneered by Google, with Google Glass. Like Google Glass, Apple's smart glasses product would be geared towards information conveyance, instead of immersive augmented reality experiences like the products that Magic Leap is developing and Microsoft Hololens. \nThe glasses \"may use augmented reality,\" according to a Bloomberg source. The project is in \"early product testing.\" \nThe smart glasses will connect to an iPhone for processing, in order to keep its weight down and keep the design of the frames stylish without adding too many additional electronics. \nOne main component of any pair of Apple smart glasses would be its lenses. Last week, Upload VR entrepreneur-in-residence Robert Scoble wrote in a Facebook post that Apple's optics partner is Carl Zeiss, which produces a lens called Zeiss Smart Optics. \nThomas Alt, who joined Apple after the company bought Metaio, an AR company he was the CEO of, is listed as an inventor on a glasses patent assigned to Carl Zeiss. His LinkedIn profile lists him as \"Director of Procurement, Strategic Deals Team\" at Apple. \nA Zeiss spokesperson declined to comment on any partnership with Apple. \n\" I do think that a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have AR experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day, it will become that much a part of you,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said last month in Utah . \nApple develops many projects internally and they often do not ultimately result in a full product that goes on sale. Apple is working on integrating augmented reality into its software, and the glasses would likely be its first hardware product targeted the AR market. \nKnow what Apple's smart glasses project is called?

Photo: Reuters \nSan Francisco: Apple Inc. is weighing an expansion into digital glasses, a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, according to people familiar with the matter. \nWhile still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a secret project. \nApple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn’t ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. \nShould Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. The Cupertino, California-based company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. \nChief executive officer Tim Cook is under pressure to deliver new products amid slowing sales of the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of Apple’s revenue. In July, he expressed enthusiasm for augmented reality after the rise of Pokemon Go, a location-based game that uses the technology. AR, as it’s known, adds images and other digital information to people’s view of the real world, while virtual reality completely surrounds them with a computer-generated environment. \nThe glasses may be Apple’s first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft Corp.’s Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software start-ups in the field, Metaio Inc. and Flyby Media Inc., followed in 2015 and 2016. \n“AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” Cook said in a 26 July conference call with analysts. “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” \nApple has AR patents for things like street view in mapping apps. It was also awarded patents for smart glasses that make use of full-fledged virtual reality. Apple is unlikely to leverage VR in a mass-consumer product, Cook suggested in October. \n“I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me, but I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now,” he said during an onstage discussion in Utah. \nApple’s challenge is fitting all the technology needed into a useful pair of internet-connected glasses that are small and sleek enough for regular people to wear. Google’s attempt to develop internet-connected eye wear flopped in part because its tiny battery ran out quickly. Google Glass, as it was called, also suffered a privacy backlash and poor public perception of its external design. \nAfter that disappointment, technology companies largely turned their immediate focus to VR and away from AR. Google recently introduced a VR headset alongside its Pixel smartphone, and Facebook Inc.’s Oculus VR unit has teamed up with Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd on a similar headset. Microsoft has the most public AR offering. Its HoloLens product shows holographic images in a user’s field of vision. \nApple’s effort may be more difficult because the chips, batteries and other components that will be available in a year or two may still not be small enough and powerful enough to build slim glasses capable of handling compelling AR experiences. \nHowever, given time, technical challenges may play to Apple’s strengths. The company specializes in turning technology that others have struggled with into easy-to-use devices for the masses. For example, Apple simplified fingerprint technology into an unlocking mechanism for the iPhone and took touch screens mainstream with the original iPhone. \nAugmented reality “is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it,” Cook said last month. “Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.” Bloomberg",

Apple is a huge company, and so it makes sense that it would regularly investigate new products but ultimately decide to scrap them if it can’t build those products exactly how it wants. \nAll that said, Apple CEO Tim Cook has expressed interest in augmented reality in the past, saying things like “AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this” and “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” While Google Glass ultimately failed, Apple could learn from Glass’s mistakes and use improved technology to release headwear that fares better than Google’s effort. \nWhat do you think of today’s report?

      "text": "Samsung is buying Harman for $112 per share.. \nShould it have been Apple that bought it instead?. \nAmazon is expanding its Home Services business, the latest in an ever-growing web of business ventures. . Should Apple Have Bought Harman Instead Of Samsung? Shares of Harman (NYSE: HAR ) soared 25% Monday, after it was announced that Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) will buy the company for $112 per share , valuing the company at $8 billion. I was a shareholder in Harman for a long time, but big forex headwinds and a few other obstacles routinely overshadowed all the positives going on at the company and the stock's valuation. I was lucky that I didn't stubbornly hold on to Harman and got out when I did. Well, with the exception of it now being acquired. In any regard, the stock had stumbled to sub-$65 levels earlier this year, so the buyout price actually looks pretty attractive. Shares traded to new 52-week highs on the news, but the offer is well below the company's all-time over $140 per share. But, that's how it goes sometimes. The acquisition puts a suite of high-quality automotive businesses (ranging from cyber security and infotainment to audio products) squarely in the hands of Samsung, which is poised to grow its footprint across the technological world. I think the biggest question for a lot of investors came down to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ). When people are clamoring that Apple should do a deal to buy a specific company, you can basically rule it out as a buyout for the Cupertino, CA. giant. The company does a lot of deals, but they are mostly for the under-the-radar type of names. And despite boasting a market cap north of $565 billion, it would have been very un-Apple like to shell out $8 billion for a company, given that it's largest acquisition to date is just $3 billion, which it paid for Beats a few years ago. Harman though, would have made a lot of sense, mostly for its connected car products. Apple hasn't exactly shown its growth potential, especially after it reported a YoY decline in both revenues and net income in fiscal 2015. First it was the TV . Then it was the car . For years, that's what we've heard will take Apple to the next level. But all we really got out if it were the Apple Watch, a TV app and a bunch of jumbled news on its \"Project Titan\" plans. Don't get me wrong. One can't expect Apple to churn out a brand new product like the iPhone or iPad every few years. At some point though, it needs to grow. If it can't do that on its own, it needs to - like every other big company in seemingly every other industry and sector - turn to M&A to fuel that growth. Maybe Apple's content with inventing its own products and building its mountain of cash so high it will one day go private. Who knows. But it makes sense to me and a lot of other investors that M&A would be a reasonable path for growth going forward. Harman would have been a great way to build out the Apple ecosystem in the car. Yes, Apple could do it from scratch. But Harman already has great relationships with premium brands and Apple could expand upon that. Down the road, if its self-driving product is in the works and does make it to market, it would have a much easier platform to deliver it upon, rather than again trying to start from scratch. Of course, Apple could always swoop in and outbid Samsung, but it seems unlikely given Apple's previous M&A history. For Samsung, I think management purchased an excellent company and did so at a great price. Harman is a quality player in the automotive and consumer world, and given where the connected car is rapidly headed (highlighted by Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA ) lights-out earnings report last week ), whoever owns this company is bound to benefit. Amazon Expands Home Services Have you used Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Home Services yet? The company's service ranges from painting, cleaning and remote tech support, among many other things . The company has apparently seen explosive growth, at least when it comes to those willing to do the work. Service providers have increased 1,500% since Amazon introduced the offering last year . More providers should expand the market and should also allow for higher quality work. At least, that's the hope. As a result of the promising development, Amazon is spreading the service to new markets, including Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Cleveland and San Antonio, among others. The Amazon Services business is actually pretty cool. While yes you can use it just to find someone to paint a room, it's more connected than that. For instance, on the Amazon site users can buy a select TV and get 60% off the install price for having it mounted on the wall via an Amazon Home Services worker. This can be used in countless measures, whether its redecorating a room or ordering electronics. The business shows how much more Amazon is willing to expand. Yes, the e-commerce business is big - the actual buying and shipping of a product. But remember what else it does: Cloud storage, Amazon Home Services, Kindle devices and Prime memberships. The company has even toyed with getting into the bricks-and-mortar business with its grocery ambitions - something that has some serious potential if executed correctly . There's a number of other things the company does too. Will Amazon \"strike gold\" with all of these businesses? Of course not. That can't be expected. But can it turn a few of these businesses into profitable, multi-billion ventures? Definitely. The secular trends that have been put into place - like streaming, e-commerce, etc. - only speak well for Amazon's future, as it's favorably positioned for the long haul. I guess the big question investors are faced with isn't whether Amazon will be successful, but rather, at what point is it a buy? Tech and FANG stocks in particular have had a rough go as of late . Despite this, the broader indices have powered higher. So should an overall market downturn hit, it could make the current slide even worse. Shares are down 7% over the past three days and there's a lot of people scratching their heads as to why. The stock is down more than 15% from its 52-week highs. For reference, the stock's Brexit-fueled low is around $683. Will it get there again or bottom beforehand?

Sorry Computerworld | Nov 14, 2016 3:39 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nDid you just get your iPhone 7? Well, be prepared to get excited for the iPhone 8. \nBecause that is what Apple fans are talking about these days. And why wouldn't we be discussing the new features an iPhone will sport almost a year before its release? But between an edgeless display and innovative wireless charging tech, it does sound kinda cool. \nIn IT Blogwatch, we wait. And wait. And wait some more. \nSo what is this about the iPhone 8? Adie Pie has the background : The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have just started to roll out...but the tech world is already buzzing about the next...iPhone...iPhone 8, the 10th anniversary smartphone from Apple is looking to change the face of the iPhone. ... If early reports are to be believed, Apple...will offer the iPhone 8 in an edgeless design...the future iPhone offerings will also be larger than the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. \nHow large, exactly? Joe Rossignol has the details : Apple will release new 5-inch and 5.8-inch iPhones with curved, bezel-free designs next year...analysts...said the borderless design will allow for the new iPhones to be the same overall size as current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models...the analysts said only the 5.8-inch model will use OLED display technology, which can be sharper, brighter, and more energy efficient than LCD technology. \nA good start, but what else do we know so far? Tasneem Akolawala fills in the blanks : The...OLED panels will allow the iPhone 8 screen to bend at the edges and introduce curved-edges on all sides. The OLED panels...will be manufactured by Samsung and LG for now...analysts also suggest that Apple's 3D Touch may see a change to a new \"film-based solution\"...Apart from that, the iPhone 8 is tipped to sport an all-glass back, a new A11 processor, and a new Touch ID system. \nGot all that? There is one more rumor swirling around about the upcoming iPhone 8. Joe M. is in the know : The latest rumor about the iPhone 8 has to do with wireless charging...Apple is apparently looking to make wireless charging truly wireless. The company is supposedly looking to implement...[a] module into the iPhone 8 that will connect to a transmitter...plugged into a wall outlet. This setup will then allow the iPhone 8 to charge as long as it's within 15-feet of the transmitter. \nSo, what do you think? Ready for an iPhone 8? Jules Wang has some words of wisdom to share : Alright, getting our expectations...set in 2016 for a 2017 product. We’re sure nothing will change. RELATED TOPICS",

Unlike the simulated world of virtual reality, AR supplements with images and information the user’s normal view of the world. \n“ We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an earnings call in July, talking about the need for Apple’s devices to work with other developers' products, such as the successful Pokémon Go game. [ITWorld DealPost: The best in tech deals and discounts. ] \nThe company has also hired VR and AR experts and made some acquisitions that could help it meet its AR goals. Apple has discussed the glasses project with potential suppliers , reported Bloomberg on Monday, citing people familiar with those discussions. \nThe company may be close to a prototype stage as it is said to have ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing. The company hasn’t, however, ordered components in numbers that would suggest that mass production plans are imminent, a person told Bloomberg. \nApple could not be immediately reached for comment. The company will be entering a crowded markets where Microsoft is pushing its AR glasses, called HoloLens , while Facebook-owned Oculus VR is targeting the VR market. Google launched its VR headset called Daydream View that will work with compatible phones including the company's Pixel smartphones. \nApple’s glasses will be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, if the company goes ahead with the project, according to a Bloomberg source. New product categories, including the AR glasses, could help the company make up for falling iPhone sales. RELATED TOPICS",

Reuters/Stephen Lam \nBank Australia is now offering Apple Pay. Australia’s first customer-owned bank announced on Tuesday that it is joining several banks and credit unions in Australia that are using Apple’s contactless payment app. \nFor the company, signing up with Apple Pay is the obvious next step. More than 60 percent of its nearly 130,000 customers around the country use Apple device when accessing the bank’s digital banking services via mobile. \n“Bank Australia is proud to be among the early financial institutions in Australia to offer its customers Apple Pay,” Bank Australia Managing Director Damien Walsh said in a statement. “Our customers have been asking us for Apple Pay, and we’re excited to respond.” \nThe announcement follows Cuscal’s deal with Apple Pay earlier this month, which allowed 31 of the banks and credit unions under it to use the app. Cuscal is one of the country’s largest card issuers, and Bank Australia is one of its clients. \nRead more: Apple Pay wins deal with 31 Australian banks, credit unions \nApple Pay was previously only available to American Express and ANZ customers in Australia. Apple is still in dispute with the country’s other major banks – CBA, NAB and Westpac – and several others over the access to the tech giant’s NFC antenna. The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) is assessing the case. \nApple Pay in Australia: ACCC denies big banks authority to bargain with Apple \nApple Pay is a mobile payment and digital wallet that allows users to make payments using their some of their Apple devices, including iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone SE and Apple Watch. The users’ credit or debit card numbers are not stored on the device or on Apple servers; instead the service assigns a unique Device Account Number to users’ device to make each transaction more secure.",

      "text": "It's lunchtime on Monday, which means it's about time for a new iOS beta. This week, Apple has released iOS 10.2 beta 3 to registered developers, following last week's release of the second version.\nLast week brought us an exciting bundle of things like new emoji, wallpapers, and our first look at Apple's new TV app. To see what's new in this version, you can head to Settings-->Software Update and find the download, provided that you're a registered developer (or able to Google).\nDON'T MISS: The 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2\niOS 10.2 beta 3 is available immediately as an over the air (OTA) update, and it can also be downloaded from Apple’s developer website and installed using iTunes. For now, it’s only available to people who are registered for Apple’s paid developer program (or users who follow the simple instructions to get around Apple’s restrictions and gain access to developer betas), but iOS 10 public beta 3 should follow closely behind.\nWe've rounded up the best features that you should expect on your phone when Apple finally releases the master version of iOS 10.2 to the general public. Among the best changes are new emoji -- awkward canoe incoming -- that TV app we talked about, a new screen effect in Messages, and a new Emergency SOS feature that promises to be equal parts lifesaving, and incredibly annoying.\nTrending right now:\nThe 5 best new features coming to your iPhone in iOS 10.2 Best Buy’s Black Friday sale includes a killer deal no other store else has Amazon’s 13 best deals: 4K TVs, Sony speakers, iPhone 7 screen protector, Christmas lights, more See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Apple reportedly working on Google Glass-style AR devices  25   Apple is weighing an expansion into digital glasses , a risky but potentially lucrative area of wearable computing, Bloomberg cited people familiar with the matter as saying. \nWhile still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a secret project. \nApple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions. The company has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing, the people said. Apple hasn’t ordered enough components so far to indicate imminent mass-production, one of the people added. \nShould Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, another person said. The Cupertino, California-based company tests many different products and is known to pivot, pause, or cancel projects without disclosing them. Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. \nThe glasses may be Apple’s first hardware product targeted directly at AR, one of the people said. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has beefed up AR capabilities through acquisitions. In 2013, Apple bought PrimeSense, which developed motion-sensing technology in Microsoft Corp.’s Kinect gaming system. Purchases of software startups in the field, Metaio Inc. and Flyby Media Inc., followed in 2015 and 2016. \nApple has AR patents for things like street view in mapping apps. It was also awarded patents for smart glasses that make use of full-fledged virtual reality. Apple is unlikely to leverage VR in a mass-consumer product, Cook suggested in October. Related links:",

      "text": "Apple is considering an expansion into the wearables market with the launch of its own line of smart glasses, Bloomberg News reported Monday.\nThe device would connect wirelessly to the user's iPhone, displaying images and other information to the glasses wearer, Bloomberg reported, citing unidentified people described as familiar with the matter. The device, which the story said is still in the exploration phase, might also include augmented reality, Bloomberg reported.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhile a smart-glasses play could help expand Apple's footprint in the wearables market, it's not without its pitfalls. The company is already the leading smartwatch maker, but that market is said to be in decline .\nMeanwhile, the smart-glasses market is tricky. The biggest player in that sector so far has been Google with its Google Glass, but it couldn't shake a nerd factor that made the $1,500 wearable uncool. Google paused the project in January, discontinuing production of the costly prototype. The company is reportedly working on a new model that is less nerdy.",

      "text": "CEOs look to bring together their divided customers, workers   Apple CEO Tim Cook is telling his employees to \"keep moving forward.\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is saying \"progress does not move in a straight line.\" T-Mobile's CEO John Legere tweeted \"let's see what an out of the box, non-typical, non-politician can do for America!\" \nCEOs of major companies are taking stands about the results of the election — a departure from the traditional model of not mixing politics with business that major brands have long espoused. \nSome are using it as an opportunity to bring their employees together following a divisive election campaign. Others are using it as an opportunity to stress their companies' values and mission, or an opportunity to make nice with Trump, who many CEOs were publicly against during the campaign. \nThe men and woman who head the nation's biggest companies know that having a hostile relationship with the Trump administration could make doing business difficult. They also know that they operate in liberal bastions like New York and San Francisco just as much as in Trump-leaning places like Fort Wayne, Indiana, or Charleston, West Virginia. \n\"Neutral is the best policy,\" says John Challenger, CEO of workplace consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas. \nT-Mobile's Legere, who long was vocally opposed to Trump, congratulated the president-elect on Twitter for his victory, while holding off on judging the president-elect's policies. Meanwhile another telecommunications executive, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, himself an immigrant and personally opposed to Trump, sent an email to employees saying that \"it's our obligation to accept the will of our fellow Americans and respect the new leader.\" \nIt's possible that Legere and Claure made nice because the president appoints the chairman and commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission, an agency that holds enormous influence over the telecommunications industry. All five FCC commissioners will see their terms expire during Trump's first term. \nCEOs of automakers, including Ford's Mark Fields, have also struck a conciliatory tone, partly because Trump has called for the repeal or renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has allowed the automakers to set up shop in Mexico tariff-free. \nMany CEOs publicly expressed hope that the tensions dividing the country will diminish, and that American consumers will set aside their fears and get back to what they do best: shop. \n\"We are hoping that in the postelection we are just going to see people ready to spend,\" said Marvin Ellison, CEO of JCPenney. \nCEOs and companies that try to bring people together are \"going to be the winners,\" says Dr. Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University's Lubin School of Business. \"That always works better from a brand perspective,\" he says. \nWall Street, which donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, also now faces an administration that could provide both profit and peril. \nTrump has said he wants to roll back some of the regulations in the Dodd-Frank law that was passed after the financial crisis, a move that would benefit big Wall Street banks. But the Republican Party's platform also contains a provision calling for the return of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Great Depression-era law that broke up big banks. \nThere's talk of a massive, $1 trillion infrastructure program that could rely on tax credits to private funding sources. Many of those programs will require Wall Street's army of investment bankers and lawyers to help underwrite and finance. \n\"The president-elect's commitment to infrastructure spending, government reform and tax reform — among other things — will be good for growth and, therefore, will be good for our clients and for our firm,\" said Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, according to a transcript of a voicemail he sent companywide. \nIn an email to his employees, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the election of Trump shows \"the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face.\" \nTrump's victory drew a range of responses from CEOs in Silicon Valley, where popular sentiment had tilted strongly against Trump because of his statements on immigrants, women, overseas manufacturing and the use of encryption in consumer products like Apple's iPhones. \nIn a postelection email to employees, Apple CEO Cook didn't mention Trump by name but acknowledged that many people had strong feelings about the outcome of the vote. Cook had let it be known during the campaign that he didn't support Trump, although he generally avoided taking a public stance on the candidates. In his email, Cook said Apple would continue to support diversity. \nCook didn't mention encryption, which he has previously argued is essential to protect consumers' privacy. But he added, \"While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple's North Star hasn't changed.\" \nMicrosoft's chief executive was more conciliatory. In a post on LinkedIn, the social networking site that Microsoft is buying, Satya Nadella wrote: \"We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday.\" But Nadella added that Microsoft is committed to \"fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.\" \nFacebook's Zuckerberg, who had previously criticized Trump's call for building a wall on the Mexican border, sounded subdued in a post on his own social network. \n\"I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children,\" he wrote. \"This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line.\" \nThe most combative response came from the CEO at Grubhub, an online food delivery service based in Chicago. Matt Maloney said in an email to employees that he rejects Trump's \"nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics,\" adding that anyone who disagrees should immediately resign \"because you have no place here.\" \nMaloney later backtracked in a tweet that said \"Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees — even those who voted for Trump.\" \nOther companies have taken the election and its aftermath as a marketing opportunity, most notably airlines. British Airways ran ads on Facebook urging people to visit London, using the tag line \"had enough of this house?\" under a photo of the White House. Air New Zealand ran ads on Instagram and elsewhere highlighting the results of the election and inviting people to visit New Zealand. Spirit Airlines promoted a 75 percent off sale for flights to Canada. \n___ \nAP Technology Writer Brandon Bailey contributed to this report from San Francisco.

      "text": "Apple looks like it may be moving into the world of augmented reality glasses. A report suggest that Apple has talked about the project with potential suppliers for Google Glass-style headsets. The report says its unclear when a finished product will be unveiled, but the earliest time frame for a reveal is 2018. Scroll down for video Apple looks like it may be moving into the world of augmented reality, by considering expanding into wearable glass headsets. Chief Executive Tim Cook, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality THE END OF GOOGLE GLASS Alphabet discontinued its own wearable glass headset, Google Glass, and closed the social media account linked to the device earlier this year. This ends its attempt to popularise the expensive devices with consumers. The device received plenty of attention when it was launched in 2012, but quickly ran into problems with its awkward appearance and privacy concerns over video recording. A report by Bloomberg cites 'people familiar with the issue' who asked not to be identified. The wearable headset would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images, along with other information and may use augmented reality, according to the report. Chief Executive Tim Cook, who has been struggling with a slowdown in iPhone sales in recent quarters, said earlier this year that the company would continue to invest a lot into augmented reality. 'AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,' Mr Cook said in a conference call with analysts. RELATED ARTICLES",

      "text": "Sometimes it seems like Apple's products never go on sale. There's usually a good handful of deals every year around Black Friday, however, especially if you're shopping for an iPad or Apple Watch.\nThe best deals this year seem to involve the iPad Mini 2 , iPad Air 2 , 9.7-inch iPad Pro , Apple Watch Series 1, iPhone 7 and a handful of MacBooks. These are the Black Friday specials that Best Buy , Walmart and Target are advertising so far.\nGift cards are your holiday iPhone bonus.\nPhoto by Sarah Tew/CNET iPhone: Get a gift card Target, Walmart and Best Buy are all offering gift cards with the purchase of an iPhone 7 , 7 Plus or even older iPhones on a number of carriers, but the deals vary subtly. CNET's Lynn La broke down the deals in detail.\nBest Buy: iPhone 7 deal. If you buy an iPhone 7 (not a 7 Plus) on an AT&T Next, Verizon Device or Sprint 24-month installment plan, Best Buy will give you a store gift card. The 256GB model comes with a $250 store gift card, but this is an in-store deal only. If you buy a 32GB or 128GB iPhone 7 (online or in-store), you'll still receive a gift card -- just not for $250. For more information, check out Best Buy's Black Friday ad .\nTarget: iPhone 7 or 7 Plus deal. If you buy either an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, you'll receive a $250 Target gift card. This is an in-store exclusive. iPhones need to be bought on an AT&T Next, Verizon Device or Sprint 24-month installment or lease plan. For more information, check out Target's Black Friday ad .\nWalmart: deal on lots of iPhones. Walmart gives you a $250 store gift card for any iPhone you buy in-store on an AT&T Next or Verizon Device installment plan. This includes the iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus and SE. For more information, check out Walmart's Black Friday ad .\nThe Series 1 Apple Watch has a faster processor, but you can't swim with it.\nPhoto by Sarah Tew/CNET Apple Watch Series 1 for under $200 Target is selling the Series 1 Apple Watch, which has a faster processor but isn't fully swimproof and lacks the GPS of Series 2 . At $198, it's $70 less than Apple's $269 starting price. This is a good Apple Watch model, and the best deal out there we've seen.\nPencil not included.\nPhoto by Sarah Tew/CNET 9.7-inch iPad Pro, $150 off Target is selling the 9.7-inch iPad Pro starting at $449, although it isn't clear which models will be sold. Still, for the base 32GB model, that would be $150.99 savings. Best Buy is offering a slightly less attractive deal of $125 off all 9.7-inch iPad Pros.\niPad Mini 2 for $200 You can save $70 off the normal $269 price of the 32GB iPad Mini 2 . Target and Walmart are both offering the Mini 2 for $200. The Mini 2 is getting long in the tooth with an older processor, but it's a serviceable mini iPad for kids and travel.\niPad Air 2, save $125 If you're shopping for a larger-screened more affordable iPad, the iPad Air 2 (which also has a much better A8X processor versus the A7 on the Mini 2) will be on sale at Target starting at $274. For the 32GB base model, that's a good deal.\nStill a solid laptop, and it has normal ports.\nPhoto by Sarah Tew/CNET MacBook Air for $799 The 13-inch, 128GB model of the MacBook Air is on sale for $799 at Best Buy , the lowest price we've seen yet for a MacBook. The 256GB model is $999, also not a bad deal: both save a couple hundred dollars, but remember that the Air doesn't have a Retina Display. It does, however, has phenomenal battery life (and normal USB ports).",

      "text": "Concept rendering of Apple glasses Apple is working on augmented reality digital glasses that will show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision and connect wirelessly to your iPhone, reports Bloomberg .\nThe tech giant has apparently talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people close to the negotiations, and has already ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing. Though Apple hasn’t ordered enough components to indicate the start of mass commercial production just yet, the signs are promising.\nGoogle was infamously the first big player to try its hand in the digital glasses market with the Google Glass, which failed miserably due to privacy concerns and the fact it was a $1,500 product with poor software and battery life. Google showed their hand too early; it was essentially a beta product that simply wasn’t ready to hit the market. Apple won’t do that. It’s developing this behind close doors, and we won’t see anything on its website until it’s absolutely ready to be shipped.\nIt’s also worth pointing out that many companies, including Apple, test new technology, only to scrap them at a later date if it proves to be too tricky or costly. We don’t know for sure that Apple’s digital glasses will hit the market, but we do know that CEO Tim Cook is enthusiastic about the technology.\n“AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” Cook said in a July 26 conference call with analysts. “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.”\nIf testing is successful, we can hope to see the glasses sometime in 2018.\nIn other news, you can now make video calls with WhatsApp .\n",

      "text": "Apple wants to sell you a $300 photo book about its products We're holding out for the BookBook Pro. Share Save \nApple is known for two things: design and modesty. Okay, one thing. Today, the company announced a new photo book that \"chronicles 20 years of Apple design,\" called Designed by Apple in California . \nDedicated to the memory of its co-founder and former CEO, Steve Jobs, the new book intends to highlight both Apple's design process as well as its products. It features 450 photos of gadgets past and present, shot by Andrew Zuckerman, a photographer who is perhaps most famous for his Creature book and subsequent sequels. Designed by Apple in California employs Zuckerman's signature style: bold imagery contrasted against white backgrounds. In a foreword, Apple's Chief Design Officer Jonathan Ive says: \n\"While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say.\" \n\"We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.\" \nThe book itself is a linen-bound hardcover volume, available in two sizes. There's a small $199 (£169) 10.2\" x 12.75\" and a larger $299 (£249) 13\" x 16.25\" edition. Both will be available online and in select Apple stores around the world starting tomorrow, Wednesday November 16th.",

      "text": "Apple \nApple's latest product isn't a new iPhone or laptop. It isn't even a computer. \nIt's a new hardbound book called \" Designed by Apple in California .\" The glossy picture book looks back at some of Apple's iconic designs, like the original iPhone or the first Apple Watch. \n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer said in a press release. \n“This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines,” he said. \nThe foreword is written by Ive, too. Here's an excerpt: \"While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.\" \nApple \nIt looks like a handsome book. Its pages are gilded with silver, it's bound with linen, and is published by Apple. It comes in two sizes, small, with is about the size of an A4 piece of paper, and costs $199. \nThe large is 13-inches by 16.25-inches and it costs $299. \nApple says that it was developed over an eight-year period, and it is dedicated to former CEO Steve Jobs. \nApple \nIt goes on sale at some Apple Stores on Wednesday. The complete list of retail locations is on Apple's website .",

This new update will bring in a few new features to Apple devices. By: FE Online | Published: November 15, 2016 5:43 PM The SOS button will be the first functionality that Apple has decided to keep in India only. (Source: Reuters) \nApple’s latest version of operating system iOS 10.2 is about to be launched as its third beta version is now available to developers. This new update will bring in a few new features to Apple devices. For India, though, there is a good news, the SOS button will be the first functionality that Apple has decided to keep in the country only. However, the panic button, SOS was added by the company in its 10.2 beta version launched earlier. But in the new third beta, it has got rid of that functionality except for India, according to a report in MacRumours. In order to test the third beta version of the OS, anyone can signup on the company’s website. The panic button is a much-needed facility in smartphones in India. The Indian government had issued a ruling that all smartphones and mobile devices must have an SOS button for emergency situations. \nApple might have decided to keep the feature because of that mandate. However, this ruling by the Indian government to be implemented from January 1, next year. Smartphone makers have asked for an extension of the date to April 1. In order to use the SOS button, iOS 10.2 beta users need to go to ‘Settings’ and the ‘General Menu’. The Emergency panic button is present in the options. Users can even personalise the settings in the choices, which includes a countdown and also the number of times the button is required to be clicked. As of now, the emergency number is 112 till a new number is adopted from next year, the same time when SOS becomes mandatory in mobiles. 112 gets saved as default emergency number while more contacts can be added to the list, through the Health app. \nAlso read | Apple considering wearables expansion with digital glasses \nThere are other new features in the latest beta version, which include a new TV app and improved TV functionality, a Send With Love Screen Effect to send heart signs via Messages. The TV app is currently available only for the US, and will be introduced in rest of the world when the Videos app is phased out.  ",

      "text": "Apple is releasing a coffee table book about how awesome it is Posted Snapchat’s Spectacles are now on sale near Tulsa, Oklahoma \nApple never looks back, except when it does, which is every month now. The company announced that it is releasing a hardbound photo book showcasing some of the most iconic Apple designs from the last 20 years. \nThe book will be released tomorrow on Apple.com and in flagship American Apple stores. They will be available in two sizes. The small one will cost $199 while the big one will cost $299. \nThe cover of the book is completely white with an embossed Apple logo on the front cover. You can read “Designed by Apple in California” on the spine — the title is embossed as well. \nBased on the photos on Apple’s website, the book doesn’t contain any text. It’s a collection of 450 photos shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman. There’s no background and products seem to float in the air. It starts with the first iMac in 1998 and ends with the Apple Pencil in 2015. \nThis could be a nice present for the holidays, and it’ll definitely shine in Apple stores. But Apple is a technology company. It seems a bit weird that the company would release a photo book. \nFirst, Apple likes to say that it rarely looks back and only moves forward. A book dedicated to products that you can’t even buy in Apple stores is odd. \nSecond, releasing a book that shows that you’re awesome isn’t the coolest move ever. Sure, Apple likes to brag and say that “this is the biggest update in iPhone history” during press conferences. But it serves a purpose — selling more products. \nFinally, the press release quotes Apple’s Chief Design Officer Jony Ive quite a lot. The book starts with the iMac, which happens to be Jony Ive’s first design assignment at Apple. \nThis book seems like Ive’s pet project, showcasing his own work at Apple. In particular, you won’t find the Apple II or Macintosh. It won’t change the face of the company, but it’s definitely an odd product. It shows that Apple’s corporate culture is changing. designed-by-apple-in-california-1",

      "text": "Apple reportedly working on Google Glass-style augmented reality glasses Following Snapchat's lead, is the world finally ready for AR glasses? on Nov 15, 2016, 8:30 AM TechSpot \nIn a bid to expand its product portfolio amid slowing iPhone sales, Apple is reportedly exploring the potential of an augmented reality set of glasses that sound an awful lot like Google Glass. \nSources familiar with the matter tell Bloomberg that although it’s still in an exploratory phase, Apple has reportedly met with potential component suppliers and even gone so far as to have ordered a small quantity of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing purposes. \nShould Apple decide to proceed with a consumer product, sources say it won’t be unveiled until 2018 at the earliest. \nAnyone that has kept current with Apple news shouldn’t be surprised by the development. The Cupertino-based company has been buying up augmented reality and virtual reality companies left and right over the past couple of years and has even spoken publicly about its interest in the space. \nSome of its more recent acquisitions include Swiss motion capture company Faceshift , German augmented reality firm Metaio, Kinect developer Primesense , AI image classification systems startup Perceptio and San Diego-based startup Emotient . \nIt’s possible that Apple purchased some of these companies with the intent of using technology for its Titan car project but that’s pure speculation on my part. Speaking of, it is believed that Apple has moved away from the idea of creating its own self-driving vehicle and is instead focusing on developing autonomous driving software that automakers could utilize.

Following the launch of a new iPhone , we always start hearing rumors about what might be next in fairly short order. This time it’s the iPhone 8, even though if we follow Apple’s design cadence, this next phone will actually be the iPhone 7s — unless, of course, Apple actually changes up its product names in recognition of the iPhone’s upcoming tenth anniversary (the iPhone turns 10 on June 29, 2007). \nAccording to analysts from Barclay’s Research (via MacRumors ), the next-generation iPhone will feature a bezel-less screen and larger displays — up to 5.8-inch for the iPhone 7s/8 Plus variant, and 5 inches for the standard model. Currently, Apple offers 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch devices, along with the smaller, budget-oriented iPhone SE. Apple will shrink its bezel sizes to increase display size modestly without meaningfully increasing the phone’s actual size. Exactly how much “meaningfully” is is open to debate. I personally find the iPhone 6 / 6s / 7 disagreeably larger than the previous iPhone 5s, despite the fact that the gap is relatively small. \nThe current argument is that only the larger iPhone will actually use an OLED display, while the smaller devices would stick to conventional LCDs. This kind of approach may make sense for Apple , which could continue to offer three different product platforms — a small device for users who prefer them or have smaller hands, a mid-size screen that’s still edging towards a larger display, and a premium model with all the attendant 10th Anniversary branding. Historically, Apple hasn’t gone in for anniversary products, at least not under Jobs, but there was the (in)famous 20th Anniversary Macintosh, introduced in March, 1997: At least we know where Johny got his inspiration for the Mac Pro \nDesigned by Johny Ive, the TAM offered a 250MHz PowerPC 603e, 32MB of RAM, a 12.1-inch active matrix LCD (640×480 or 800×600), a 2GB ATA HDD, and a vertically mounted SuperDrive. Those aren’t bad specs for 1997 hardware, but this is a machine that debuted at $7,500, which some of you may recognize as slightly more money than the average PC cost circa 1997. The TAM sold so badly that Apple had to cut the price to $1,995 by March 1998. When customers complained, Apple gave them a free PowerBook to compensate, thus making this the only disaster in which Apple gave away thousands of dollars in free hardware to compensate people for selling them a lemon . Hey, the pre-Jobs-return period wasn’t all bad. \nThe chances that Apple creates an equivalent boondoggle today are slim. Apple won’t take such a disastrous path forward for the iPhone 8, but the spotlight is going to be on the company to demonstrate some serious improvements or benefits to its hardware. Apple, meanwhile, may see the event as a chance to regain some sales momentum. When the first large Apple phones were released two years ago, they triggered huge sales thanks to pent-up demand for larger phones on iOS. Now that people use devices significantly longer than they used to, Apple may be hoping to capture some significant upgrade momentum as older iPhones in the 6 and 6s families hit two and three years old. A tenth anniversary sales leap thanks to a large OLED screen upgrade would only be a temporary improvement, but Wall Street doesn’t tend to look much beyond quarterly reports anyway. \nThere are rumors that Apple will remove the Home button altogether for the iPhone 8, but it’s not clear if this will actually happen. Apple may have gotten rid of the physical button, but the concept of a Home button region has been constant on iDevices since day one, even though Android devices haven’t used front-face buttons for years. If Apple intends to hit its 10-year anniversary intro it’ll need to roll the iPhone 7s/8 out more quickly than its previous devices, and we’ve already seen how well that approach worked for Samsung this year.

We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an earnings call in July, talking about the need for Apple’s devices to work with other developers’ products, such as the successful Pokémon Go game. \nThe company has also hired VR and AR experts and made some acquisitions that could help it meet its AR goals. Apple has discussed the glasses project with potential suppliers , reported Bloomberg on Monday, citing people familiar with those discussions. \nThe company may be close to a prototype stage as it is said to have ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing. The company hasn’t, however, ordered components in numbers that would suggest that mass production plans are imminent, a person told Bloomberg. \nApple could not be immediately reached for comment. The company will be entering a crowded markets where Microsoft is pushing its AR glasses, called HoloLens , while Facebook-owned Oculus VR is targeting the VR market. Google launched its VR headset called Daydream View that will work with compatible phones including the company’s Pixel smartphones. \nApple’s glasses will be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, if the company goes ahead with the project, according to a Bloomberg source. New product categories, including the AR glasses, could help the company make up for falling iPhone sales. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "Apple considering creating ‘smart glasses’ with augmented reality tech By Dan Pye ● 18 minutes ago \nApple is considering creating its own digital glasses as part of a further push into wearable technology, Bloomberg reports. People familiar with the matter said the company is in the “exploration phase” with the glasses, which would pair wirelessly with an iPhone to display images and possibly project augmented reality elements into the user’s field of vision. Apple recently patented an augmented reality mapping system , and KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expects the company to begin integrating AR into its existing product lines within the next few years . \nSources said Apple has ordered “small quantities of near-eye displays” for testing purposes, but hasn’t committed to any large scale orders that would hint at mass producing the product yet. Other people familiar with the discussions said even if Apple were to proceed with the glasses, customers wouldn’t see them until 2018 at the earliest. CEO Tim Cook has said AR will likely become a “core technology” for the company, telling an audience that unlike the much more immersive virtual reality, AR has the potential to integrate seamlessly into daily life. “I can’t imagine everyone in here getting in an enclosed VR experience while you’re sitting in here with me, but I could imagine everyone in here in an AR experience right now,” he said.",

Unlike the simulated world of virtual reality, AR supplements with images and information the user’s normal view of the world. \n“ We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an earnings call in July, talking about the need for Apple’s devices to work with other developers' products, such as the successful Pokémon Go game. MORE ON NETWORK WORLD: 3D printing will transform these five industries \nThe company has also hired VR and AR experts and made some acquisitions that could help it meet its AR goals. Apple has discussed the glasses project with potential suppliers , reported Bloomberg on Monday, citing people familiar with those discussions. \nThe company may be close to a prototype stage as it is said to have ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing. The company hasn’t, however, ordered components in numbers that would suggest that mass production plans are imminent, a person told Bloomberg. \nApple could not be immediately reached for comment. The company will be entering a crowded markets where Microsoft is pushing its AR glasses, called HoloLens , while Facebook-owned Oculus VR is targeting the VR market. Google launched its VR headset called Daydream View that will work with compatible phones including the company's Pixel smartphones. \nApple’s glasses will be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, if the company goes ahead with the project, according to a Bloomberg source. New product categories, including the AR glasses, could help the company make up for falling iPhone sales. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": "Apple is thinking about launching its own smart glasses, according to a Bloomberg report. The device is said to be similar to the Google Glass, and will connect to the iPhones of its users. ( Apple ) Advertisement \nAccording to an exclusive Bloomberg report, Apple is thinking about launching its own smart glasses. \nIf the company pushes through with its plan, Apple would be entering a product category that was pioneered by the now defunct Google Glass. Apple Smart Glasses Rumors \nBloomberg said that, according to sources familiar with the matter, Apple is still in the exploration phase for its smart glasses project. \nThe Apple smart glasses, however, is being planned to be able to wirelessly connect to iPhones, as well as show pictures and information to wearers. The device could also be utilizing augmented reality technology. \nThe exploration phase is at a seemingly advanced stage though, as Apple is already speaking with potential suppliers for the product. The company has even ordered near-eye displays in small quantities from a certain supplier to use for testing, the sources added. \nThe orders for components are too small to signal that mass production is starting any time soon, one of the sources said. Another person added that, if Apple would decide to move ahead with the smart glasses project, the introduction for the product would be by 2018 at the earliest. Similarities And Differences With Google Glass \nThe description of the smart glasses that Apple is working on makes it seem like the device would be similar to the Google Glass, which ended sales in early 2015. Both devices will be focused on providing information to users, instead of immersing them in augmented reality experiences such as the Microsoft HoloLens or functioning as a social media tool such as the wildly popular Spectacles of Snap. \nHowever, by connecting to the iPhone, the Apple smart glasses would circumvent a few of the challenges that Google Glass experienced, namely keeping weight down and streamlining design. With a constant connection to the iPhone, similar to how the Apple Watch works, the Apple smart glasses will not need to include too many electronic components as it can draw its functionalities from the iPhone. The Fate Of The Apple Smart Glasses \nApple has been known to develop many projects internally, and often, these projects do not result in a product that the company releases for sale. \nEarly in the year, it was reported that Apple has formed a secret team of experts in the fields of virtual reality and augmented reality to work on the company's own virtual reality headset . As with the report on the Apple smart glasses, no product announcement is expected soon for the project. \nThe acquisition of components from suppliers reveals that Apple is serious about its smart glasses, but only time will tell what the fate of the project will be.

      "text": "New iPhones are nice and all, but perhaps the biggest news out of Apple’s September event was that Nintendo was making its first ever mobile game, Super Mario Run. We now have a release date: December 15. If you’re not familiar, the game is Nintendo’s take on the common “endless running” genre. Mario keeps running, and you tap on the screen to make him jump. It’s not something totally original at first glance, but this is Nintendo were talking about – there’s likely to be a few twists thrown in to make it better than your average mobile game. There are…\n\nThis story continues at The Next Web",

      "text": "Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo \nApple is reportedly working behind the scenes on a new digital glasses product. The device, if Apple ever builds it, will take advantage of augmented reality, laying digital information on top of the real world that a user can see by peering through the glass lenses. \nThat sort of functionality is similar to what Google attempted with the failed Google Glass product. A user would peer through a small glass lens to see additional information, for example. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said that he sees a future in augmented reality and that his company is betting big on the technology over virtual reality, which blocks a user out from the real world. \nBloomberg , which broke news of the story this week, said Apple wouldn’t launch the product until 2018 at the earliest. It also said Apple is just now starting to talk to suppliers. The news outlet said Apple is still “in the exploration stage.” \nIndeed, there’s already evidence of this. Apple has several patents related to augmented reality, a few images of which are included above. It also acquired German augmented reality firm Metaio last year, and it has reportedly poached top AR talent from competitors, including a HoloLens engineer from Microsoft . Do consumers even want digital glasses? \nApple will need to prove to users that the glasses are not only functional but fashionable. Google had a hard time with the latter. Google Glass also faced criticism because the camera function could be used by a wearer without someone else’s knowledge. Oddly enough, Snapchat’s Spectacles, which launched last week, seem to have fallen nicely in the middle, allowing a user to record video while also looking relatively normal. \nIt’s smart of Apple to at least consider this space. It’s one of the only big tech players that hasn’t really launched a VR or AR product. Microsoft, Samsung, LG, Google and others have all dabbled in one or the other. We’ll see if Apple decides to enter.

The hardcover edition is available in two sizes. ($199 for a smaller 10.20\" x 12.75\" version, and $299 for a larger 13\" x 16.25\" edition) and is titled Designed by Apple in California. It's dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs, with all photos shot by Andrew Zuckerman. \nIn the forward, Jony Ive writes: \"While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.\" Read More",

Some of the showcased designs date as far back as 1998's iMac. It also features information on the materials and techniques that Apple's design team used the past two decades. The book is named “Designed by Apple in California” .Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer, explained that the book is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs himself. Ive also explained the reasoning behind creating the book. The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve's motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future. This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines. “Designed by Apple in California” will be available in two different editions – Small (10.20” x 12.75”), which will set you back $199 and Large (13” x 16.25”), carrying a $299 price tag. The book will be available at Apple's online store and select Apple Stores around the world, such as the ones in London, Syndey, Paris and Berlin, starting tomorrow (16 November, 2016).

      "text": "Super Mario Run iOS Release Date Confirmed   08:51 PST \nNintendo announced a new game at Apple’s iPhone 7 event back in September. The company says that the game – Super Mario Run – is “the first-ever mobile game featuring the most iconic video game hero of all time.” The game was demonstrated by the creator of Mario himself, Shigeru Miyamoto. Nintendo promised to provide a confirmed release date later this year. Today, the company has confirmed the Super Mario Run iOS release date. \nSuper Mario Run is exclusive to iOS initially, it’s compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices running iOS 8.0 or higher. It’s the first game that has been developed just for mobile devices. Mario runs forward on his own in this game but relies on the tap of a single finger to jump over obstacles, pull off some cool moves, avoid enemies, collect coins, and reach the flagpole to complete courses. \nIt’s going to be available as a free download from the App Store. Players will be able to try elements of the game’s three modes for free. They will then have to make a one-time payment of $9.99 to get unlimited access to each of the three modes in Super Mario Run. \nSuper Mario Run is going to be released in the United States as well as an additional 150 countries and regions on December 15th. It will support English, Japanese, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Russian and traditional Chinese languages. It’s going to be released for Android in 2017 . \nFiled in Cellphones . Read more about Apps , iOS and Super Mario Run . Source: businesswire Related Articles",

      "text": "Apple said to be considering wearable glasses, augmented reality Apple said to be considering wearable glasses, augmented reality By Joel Hruska on November 15, 2016 at 11:48 am Comment \nWhen the idea of wearable computing was first proposed, analysts and industry executives jumped on the concept like rats off a sinking ship. Tablet sales were already fluttering, ahead of their long slide, smartphones clearly weren’t going to carry the market forever, and various companies from small players like Fitbit and Pebble to entrenched companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft all were hungry to open a new frontier in wearable computing. \nSince then, consumer appetite for wearables has been decidedly mixed. Google Glass, which debuted in 2013, was a mediocre product with lousy battery life, an unimpressive camera, and a four-digit price tag. The only thing that truly stood out about Google Glass was the self-entitled attitudes of the people who thought owning a set had magically transformed them into special snowflakes who didn’t care whether other people were interested in being surveilled by someone else’s face computer. We’ve seen some weak demand for smart watches from companies like Pebble or Apple, and some success for fitness trackers and other, similar wearables. But nobody has yet cracked the code on mass market hardware — probably because the fundamental UI and battery life challenges that make designing wearables difficult haven’t really been solved yet. Dedicated devices have also seen generally better uptake than general-purpose hardware. Sadly, even Apple isn’t going to be building Iron Man suits anytime soon. \nNow, Apple reportedly wants in on this nascent action, or is at least considering the matter. That’s the news from Bloomberg, who notes that the hardware would connect wirelessly to the iPhone, show objects and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and could be an augmented reality device. The firm has reportedly ordered near-eye displays and tracking technology, but is thought to be experimenting with the equipment rather than prototyping hardware for near-term manufacturing. The report pins 2018 as the soonest we’d see any such device in-market. \nApple has acquired some AR companies already, and Cook seems bullish on the concept. “AR can be really great, and we have been and continue to invest a lot in this,” Cook said in July. “We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.” Coincidentally, Pokemon Go had just launched at the time. It’s not clear why Cook would actually chase the wearable market, given the criminal lack of wearable dongles (wongles?) and the general lack of a head-mounted use-case that consumers would want and could afford (HoloLens is pretty cool, but it’s also a $3,000 developer toy). \nBut perhaps more to the point, Apple, historically, doesn’t try to lead the industry in inventing new devices. Instead, it comes from behind and reinvents early iterations into a far better form factor than what was previously available. The iPhone was far from the first smartphone, but it was the first smartphone with a nearly buttonless front and a touchscreen for all device interaction, and that also didn’t require a stylus. \nGoogle grabbed for the early wearable market with Glass, and gave us a legendary nickname and a lot of grumpy hipsters. Apple has followed up with the Apple Watch, and, well, few seem to care so far. Steve Jobs’ best feature was his willingness to tell analysts and investors to pound sand when it came to building good products, as opposed to products Wall Street thought were good. \nThink of the Glassholes, Tim. Think, wait, and give hardware designers and software gurus another four or five years to cut power consumption, develop use cases, and create a product people want to buy. Tagged In",

      "title": "Apple could be planning new wearables push, starting with smart glasses",
      "text": "Apple Watch \nIt appears that Apple might be getting in on the smart glasses game, a risky market in which Google famously failed with its botched Google Glass project. The much-maligned Google Glass project was scrapped after becoming the subject of online mockery for its awkward product design and high price tag. According to Bloomberg , however, we may see Apple-branded smart glasses as part of Apple’s new wearables push, following on the success of the Apple Watch. \nIt’s important to note that these are still rumors, but Apple may have already approached potential suppliers to acquire small quantities of near-eye displays for internal testing. Speaking with unidentified sources within Apple, Bloomberg claims that the contemplated Apple smart glasses would connect wirelessly to iPhones , and would display images and other information in the wearer’s field of view, and might even employ a version of augmented reality. \nThe augmented reality angle lends a little more credence to these rumors than they might otherwise warrant. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been an outspoken proponent of AR in the past, mentioning on a conference call earlier this year that the company has invested a lot of time and money in AR and plans to continue to invest in the nascent technology. \nMore: The next Apple Watch could have biometric authentication and gesture controls \nIf anyone could pull this off, it would be Apple. The firm has a long history of building on existing technology by simply improving on design, and in fact some of its greatest success stories have been innovative takes on existing — and popular — technologies. The iPod, iPhone, and Apple Watch all built on existing technology by seeking to improve the design and user experience. While the Apple Watch may still be in the early stages in terms of market acceptance, the iPod and iPhone have had an immense impact on their respective market spaces, transforming them entirely. \nSo while it’s likely a long way off, and may never happen, Apple-branded smart glasses could be just the kick that augmented reality needs to get off the ground as a ubiquitous, everyday piece of technology.
