      "text": "Visual Studio For Mac Release Confirmed By Microsoft  26 PST \nMicrosoft’s primary coding tool has always locked developers to the Windows platform as they couldn’t get the tool for its biggest rival, Mac OS. That changes today. Microsoft confirmed through a blog post that it’s releasing Visual Studio for the Mac. This may not make sense to most people who don’t keep up with news about developer tools, but many have actually been waiting for this to happen for a very, very long time. They will certainly appreciate that Visual Studio is being released for Mac. \nThis is all part of Microsoft’s strategic shift towards its cloud offerings. Programming tasks were normally carried out on local servers in the past but most developers now used cloud services like Microsoft’s Azure and Amazon’s AWS because they don’t lock them into a specific platform. \nMicrosoft will want to retain professional users who want to have the flexibility to work on their projects through any platform that they want so it’s imperative that Visual Studio be available for the second most popular operating system out there. Mac users will no longer need to set up a virtual Windows machine just to be able to use this development tool. \nMicrosoft is going to release a preview of Visual Studio for Mac later this week at its Connect() conference. Further details will be revealed at the event. \nFiled in Computers . Read more about Mac (Apple) , Microsoft . Source: webcache.googleusercontent Related Articles",

      "text": "| Topic: Cloud \nMicrosoft's datacenter in Cheyenne, Wyoming, will be completely powered by wind, some of which will come from the Happy Jack wind farm. Image: Black Hills Energy \nMicrosoft has signed its largest wind deal yet, to give it 237 megawatts of wind energy to power its datacenter in Cheyenne, Wyoming. \nThe new wind deal brings Microsoft's total investment in US wind energy projects to 500 megawatts, and takes it a step closer to building a \"responsible cloud\", said Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer at Microsoft. \nSmith said characteristics of Microsoft's wind-energy deal will also make it more affordable for cities and states to switch to cleaner energy. Part of that plan involves Microsoft hooking up its datacenter backup generators to the local grid. \nMicrosoft's wind-energy deal will support the 178-megawatt Bloom Wind Project in Kansas via a contract with Allianz Risk Transfer (ART), which announced a financial instrument in May to offer Bloom stable long-term revenues to offset its high upfront costs. \nMicrosoft says it's the first buyer to join ART's arrangement. The project is expected to launch commercial operations in Q3 2017. \nThe Bloom Wind Project will give Microsoft 178 megawatts, while the remaining 59 megawatts will come from a partnership with Black Hills to purchase energy from the Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind farms in Wyoming. \nCombined, Microsoft says these sources will produce enough energy each year to power its Wyoming datacenter. \nUnder a similar arrangement, Google in June bankrolled the development of new wind farms in the south of Norway by buying their total output for 12 years. In that instance, the 160-megawatt capacity wind farm is expected to be fully operational by late 2017, offering Google's European datacenters more renewable energy. Google has purchased renewable energy from 18 providers around the world, representing over two gigawatts of renewable energy capacity. \nMicrosoft's Smith highlights that connecting the company's backup generators to the grid offers a new way of expanding Black Hills Energy capacity without raising rates for consumers. \n\"Microsoft and Black Hills Energy established a new tariff, available to all eligible customers, that lets the utility use our datacenter's backup generators as a secondary resource for the entire grid,\" explained Smith. \n\"Unlike traditional backup generators that run on diesel fuel, these natural gas turbines offer a more efficient solution and, more importantly, ensure the utility avoids building a new power plant.\" \nMicrosoft says about 44 percent of its datacenter energy is from wind, solar and hydropower. It's aiming to raise that figure to 50 percent by 2018. Join Discussion",

      "text": "Reddit \nMicrosoft is not brand you’d associate with anti-virus software, unless you mean it in a pejorative sense. But starting Windows 8, the company has turned its Windows Defender into a full-blown anti-malware, anti-virus program to exactly change that negative image. Not exactly a good news for creators of anti-virus software like Kaspersky Labs . In fact, according to the company’s Eugene Kaspersky, Microsoft is being downright anti-competitive. In a rather vocal blog post, the Russian billionaire has revealed that he is taking his complaints to the EU’s and Russia’s anti-trust bodies, where Microsoft already doesn’t have good standing. \nThe bottom line of Kasperky’s rant is that Microsoft is exhibiting some very anti-competitive behavior in an effort to have its own Windows Defender suite running over third-party tools like Kaspersky. That ranges from a convoluted system that either ends up disabling or even uninstalling third-party anti-virus software in favor of Microsoft’s own. Usually these triggers happen when upgrading Windows itself or when third-party software expire. That and the fact that Microsoft bundles Windows Defender for every Windows installation. \nBut that isn’t only Kaspersky’s beef. It also criticizes Microsoft for not giving it (and presumably other anti-virus makers) enough time to prepare their suites for new Windows updates. Kaspersky is asking government authorities to require Microsoft to give it (and presumably other third-party software makers) an even earlier copy of future Windows 10 updates to widen the window of time. \nWhile there might be a few valid points to Kasperky’s complaints, especially the part about automatic removal of incompatible programs during updates, some might look at the situation as a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Kaspersky has been involved in a few controversies of its own, especially those that claim that it resorts to shady practices to sabotage rival anti-virus makers. \nNot that Microsoft is completely blameless. The situation also reeks of the same bundling accusations hurled at it regarding Internet Explorer and even Windows Media Player. In both cases, Microsoft complied with sanctions and restrictions, though the market didn’t seem to care much for those special “clean” versions of Windows when they were made available. \nAs for the update window situation, Microsoft has an Insider Preview program in place exactly for that, giving both developers and users early access to Windows updates. So far, no other third-party developer, big or small, has complained about not being given enough time, and it would seem that Kaspersky is aiming for some special treatment in this case.",

      "text": "Microsoft will release Visual Studio for the Mac You don't have to run Windows to use one of the world's best-known developer tools. Share Save \nIf you needed any further proof that Microsoft is welcoming cross-platform development with open arms, you just got it. In a prematurely revealed blog post , the company has revealed that it's working on Visual Studio for Mac -- yes, one of the mainstays of the Windows world is headed Apple's way. This isn't really intended for Windows development (you'd need Boot Camp or a virtual machine to run your creations), but you can write Android, iOS and Mac apps ( thanks to Xamarin ) as well as server software through .NET Core. And importantly, Mac and Windows users can share projects. You won't have to convert your work just to make sure that everyone in your team can use it. \nYou'll get to download a preview edition of Visual Studio for Mac sometime during Microsoft's Connect() conference, which kicks off November 16th. It's not certain when you'll see a finished version, but the timing of the preview likely puts the polished release sometime in 2017. \nThe Mac version may seem odd at first blush. Wouldn't this discourage developers from writing on or for Windows? However, it's more logical in the context of Microsoft's \"mobile first, cloud first\" strategy. If you're already building apps on a Mac, you might as well build them in a tool that makes porting to Windows easier -- and Microsoft would rather you write for its cloud platform on a Mac than risk losing you to a rival offering. The Redmond crew no longer benefits greatly from making you buy a Windows PC to write code, and the new Visual Studio reflects that reality.",

      "text": "Tweet \nIn a white paper and blog post, Microsoft makes the claim that changes introduced in Windows 10 Anniversary Update make it the most secure version of Windows ever. The company is particularly proud of its ability to fight ransomware, but also points to security features such as Credential Guard and Windows Hello. \nMicrosoft says that Windows Defender -- recently complained about by Eugene Kapsersky -- is to thank for this. Cloud-based protection and faster updates mean protection is more effective than ever. \nIn the white paper, entitled Ransomware Protection in Windows 10 Anniversary Update , Microsoft says that Windows 10 computers are 58 percent less likely to be hit with ransomware when compared to Windows 7 machines. In addition to the white paper, a blog post by Rob Lefferts (director of program management, Windows Enterprise and Security) goes on to explain things in a slightly more accessible way. \nHere are some of the many ways we’re fighting back against ransomware: Six of the top 10 ransomware threats use browser, or browser-plugin-related exploits, so we made it harder for malware authors to exploit Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge . We increased detection and blocking capability in our email services, increasing the number of ransomware-related attachments being blocked. We added new technology to Windows Defender to reduce detection time to seconds, increasing our ability to respond before the infection can occur. We released Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection which can be combined with Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection to make it easier for companies to investigate and respond to ransomware attacks. \nCombined with other significant security advances, such as Credential Guard, Windows Hello and others, we’ve made Windows 10 Anniversary Update the most secure Windows ever. \nLefferts says that an update to Microsoft Edge which enables the browser to run Flash Player in an isolated container and better protection for email are also key factors in security improvements.",

      "text": "Microsoft doubles wind power investment to 500 megawatts   1:05 pm - Author Jon Martindale \nMicrosoft has made another large investment in clean energy by signing two new agreements to purchase additional wind power. These deals will see it acquire a further 237 megawatts of green energy, nearly doubling its total to 500 megawatts. Microsoft considers this another step on the road to making its cloud servers and datacentres run on entirely clean energy. \nHowever Microsoft doesn’t plan to stop there. Although it still has some ways to go until its own energy uses are completely countered by clean energy production, it plans to bust through that ceiling and keep on going. Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, said that he wants to see Microsoft offer clean energy to communities surrounding Microsoft enterprises in the future too. \nMicrosoft latest wind initiative takes advantage of the Allianz Risk Transfer (ART) program, which through a proxy revenue swap – that gives a fixed payment for wind power, rather than basing it on power output or fluctuating energy prices – makes the whole system much more attractive. Although Microsoft is one of the first to take advantage of this scheme, it is expected to massively accelerate global wind power adoption. \nThe second deal Microsoft struck to leverage new wind power for its datacentres is with Black Hills Energy. Together they made another unique partnership, in which Black Hills will be able to leverage Microsoft’s own back up generators if required during peak times, thereby foregoing the need to build a new power plant to cover the local community in the case of power spikes. \nThose generators make use of natural gas, rather than diesel, which is a far cleaner energy solution than the alternatives. \nDiscuss on our Facebook page, HERE . \nKitGuru Says: It’s good to see companies like Microsoft investing heavily in cleaner energy solutions. While consumers can all play their part in helping to turn around climate change, we really need industry to come along for the ride, as it has a bigger impact on our environment than all of us put together.",

      "text": "Still a little disenchanted you won’t be able to purchase even a lightly revised Surface Pro 5 with one of those fancy new Intel Kaby Lake processors inside for the holidays? How about the refreshed Surface Book with Performance Base ? We’re guessing that one strikes your fancy, but simply feels too darn expensive .\nWell, the “first-gen” models are definitely not too shabby, despite their somewhat advanced age, and at the right price, we bet you won’t give Kaby Lake or the battery life-enhancing “Performance Base” a second thought on Black Friday or Cyber Monday.\nYes, ladies and gentlemen in love with Microsoft’s in-house convertible Windows 10 tablet/laptop designs, there are big discounts coming on “select” Surface Book and Pro 4 configurations.\nBetween November 24 and 28, the higher-end, higher-res, more “professional” 13.5-incher shall cost $1499 instead of $1899 with Core i5 Skylake power, a 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM and discrete dedicated NVIDIA GeForce GPU, while a 128GB i5 Surface Book featuring integrated graphics is to set you back $1249 after a $250 markdown across Redmond’s “full retail channel.”\nAs for the 12.3-inch Surface Pro 4, you’ll be able to save a whopping $430 on a 256GB i5 8GB variant bundled with a black type cover, or $200 off the list price of a 128GB i5 4GB config. That’s in addition to what third-party sellers like Best Buy have up their sleeves, and other Microsoft-direct Black Friday deals on the Xbox One S, Lumia 950, 950 XL and numerous Windows 10 PCs.\nThe post Microsoft will shave up to $430 off Surface Pro 4, $400 off Surface Book this Black Friday appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "AARP and Frank Abagnale Launch Effort to End the Tech Support Scam Microsoft Survey Finds Two-Thirds of Consumers Have Encountered the Scam  36   WASHINGTON , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- With U.S. consumers falling victim to the \"technical support scam\" in greater numbers than ever before, the AARP Fraud Watch Network today launched an initiative to raise awareness of the scam and educate consumers about how they can protect themselves. A survey released last month by Microsoft found that over the past year two-thirds of consumers have experienced the tech support scam, in which fraudsters pose as technicians from one of the major computer companies. AARP's effort to educate consumers includes online content, advertising and media appearances featuring renowned security expert and Fraud Watch Network Ambassador Frank Abagnale . AARP Fraud Watch Network \"If you or someone you know receives a call or an email from someone identifying themselves as a technician with Microsoft, Google, Apple or some other well-known technology company, it is likely to be a scam. Just hang up the phone,\" said Abagnale. \"The large computer firms never make proactive calls or send email to provide unrequested technical support.\" Executing the scam via telephone, email or even pop-up ads, the scammers inform a targeted person that a virus or some other security problem has been detected on the victim's computer, and offer to make a repair. Instead, their goal is to gain control of the computer, access personal files and passwords, and obtain credit card information to charge the consumer for the supposed repair or a warranty program -- which proves to be worthless. The Microsoft survey indicates that 20% of the people surveyed around the world continued with a potentially fraudulent interaction after the first contact. This means that the victim downloaded harmful software, gave the scammers access to their computer, visited a scam website, or provided a credit card or other forms of payment. Interestingly, of the victims who continued interacting with the scammers, half were millennials (ages 18-34). Thirty-four percent were between ages 36-54, and 17% were age 55 or older. Abagnale advises consumers never to give control of their computer to a third party, nor to provide a credit card number to pay for unsolicited repair services or warranty programs. For more tips about how keep yourself safe from technical support scammers, visit the new Fraud Watch Network web page at: www.aarp.org/TechScams . The site includes detailed descriptions of how fraudsters execute their scams, video and other content, and a list of recommended \"Dos and Don'ts\" when dealing with a suspected fraudster. An educational booklet , published by Microsoft and the FWN, can also be downloaded from the site. Abagnale , who was named AARP Fraud Watch Ambassador in 2015, has been associated with the FBI for more than four decades, and has advised and consulted with hundreds of financial institutions, corporations and government agencies around the world. Abagnale's story was told in his best-selling book, Catch Me if You Can , and in the 2002 movie of the same name, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks . The AARP Fraud Watch Network was launched in 2013 as a free resource for people of all ages. The website provides information about fraud and scams, prevention tips from experts, an interactive Scam-Tracking Map , fun educational quizzes, and video presentations featuring Abagnale. Users may sign up for \"Watchdog Alert\" emails that deliver breaking scam information, or call a free helpline at 877-908-3360 to speak with trained volunteers.

      "title": "Microsoft launches Outlook Customer Manager with dedicated iOS app",
      "text": "Microsoft today is launching Outlook Customer Manager, a tool designed to help companies keep track of relationships with current and future customers — without going beyond Outlook.\nThe tool is available for free to companies that pay for Office 365 Business Premium subscriptions. Companies enrolled in the First Release track will get first access, and it will become available more widely over the next few months. (Microsoft is looking to give the feature to Office 365 Enterprise E3 and E5 customers, too.) Once it’s been turned on, an icon for the tool will show up in the home tab of Outlook 2016 for Windows. There is no plan to bring the tool to Outlook.com.\nA dedicated iOS app is available now for eligible customers — it will come to the App Store later — and the tool will become available later on other mobile platforms, Microsoft says.\nOn Outlook 2016 for Windows, to the right of emails, the Outlook Customer Manager will show end users relevant files for the people they’re interacting with, along with notes, tasks, and a timeline containing an automatically generated log of interactions. That’s all data that already lives in Office 365, but now it’s been brought together for easier access. The data can even be made available to end users’ colleagues.\nThe tool lets end users browse through a spreadsheet-style collection of all deals, and a Focused feature shows the most important projects at the top.\nIf this sounds a bit like customer-relationship management (CRM) software, well, it sort of is and sort of isn’t.\n“As your business needs grow, you can move to Dynamics 365 to take advantage of enhanced customer information, process efficiency and consistency, and deeper financial and customer insights,” Microsoft says in a blog post .\nOf course, the context to keep in mind here is Salesforce’s recent moves. After buying RelateIQ, Salesforce last year introduced SalesforceIQ , which brings sales data into the email client in a way that’s similar to what Outlook Customer Manager is now doing. Heck, in March, Salesforce went a step further and brought the tool to Outlook .\nWhile the two companies do compete in the CRM business, they have had a partnership that has yielded multiple products. But Microsoft’s acquisition of LinkedIn — and especially the bidding war leading up to it — seems to have garnered some attention. And Microsoft’s decision to launch something like SalesforceIQ could be interpreted as Microsoft reminding Salesforce that it can do just fine going it alone — even if this could just be seen as Microsoft doing another thing to make sure its CRM offerings are competitive with the best that’s out there.\n“Because your data stays in Office 365, you don’t waste valuable time setting up connectors to other software or services, or managing separate products,” Microsoft wrote.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

Some have been written on newspapers while others have been more obscurely scratched into a dirt road. Either way, today Dona did the complete opposite of her usual hints. Hey #WindowsInsiders : we are buried in bug bash bug triage, so no new builds today. Have a wonderful day! <3 \n— Dona Sarkar (@donasarkar) November 14, 2016 \n“No new builds today,” she tweeted today. The team seems to be knee deep in the feedback from November’s Bug Bash event held just this last weekend. During which, we’ve seen Insiders tackle quests against some issues with Groove, Camera, Contacts, and more. Hopefully, we’ll see the fruition of the Bug Bash in the coming weeks as Microsoft works towards the release of next year’s Windows 10 Creators Update . \nIf you were waiting with bated breath for an Insider build today, now you can go about your day knowing that today’s just an ordinary day in the world of Windows 10 Insiders.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft today introduced a new Office 365 service: Outlook Customer Manager. As the name implies, the new Office 365 service essentially allows users to keep track of their customers and get all the data about a certain customer in one place. Outlook Customer Manager is mostly targeted towards small businesses who don’t really need the power of a full-fledged CRM like Dynamics 365.\nOutlook Customer Manager will be integrated right into Outlook’s desktop apps, and it’ll also have a dedicated a mobile app. On Outlook Customer Manager, businesses will be able to add tasks for a certain customer, keep track of the deals, as well as the upcoming meetings. The service also has a neat little view where users can see all the tasks and other things they need to finish with a certain customer on a day.\nAnother neat feature of Outlook Customer Manager is that it can be accessed easily on Outlook. For instance, when you get an email from a customer asking about a project you’re working on for them, you can simply click on their profile and Outlook Customer Manager will be able to show a bunch of data about the customer on the sidebar.\nOutlook Customer Manager is the latest addition to Office 365 for small business to help them keep track of their customers and business meetings. The software giant recently introduced Bookings, which is also a service targeted towards small businesses that aims to streamline the process of booking appointments.\nSimilar to Bookings, Outlook Customer Manager is only available to those part of Office 365’s First Release program. The service will initially be able to Office 365 Business Premium users, but Microsoft could be bringing it to subscribers of the E3 and E5 plans. The dedicated mobile app for Outlook Customer Manager is only available on iOS, but it should be available on Android when the service is generally available.",

      "text": "by Brandon Hill — Monday, November 14, 2016 Hell Freezes Over As Microsoft Releases Visual Studio For Mac Microsoft ’s big slip-up is our gain, as the Redmond software giant today accidentally hit the publish button a little too soon on a major announcement. The company will be hosting the Connect() developer conference later this week, but one of the biggest announcements was pushed through today: Visual Studio for Mac.\nMicrosoft is well aware that developers are more platform agnostic these days, which explains why the company is reaching out to the Mac community — something that would have seemed unheard of just a few years ago with the PC-centric Visual Studio suite. Based on the app development platform Xamarin Studio (which Microsoft acquired last year), Visual Studio for Mac retains all of the core traits of its Windows counterpart, while at the same time features a “UX [that] is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS .\" \nInterestingly, Mikayla Hutchinson, Senior Program Manager for the Xamarin Platform, takes a page from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella ’s playbook by stating that this marks “true mobile-first, cloud-first development tool for .NET and C#”. \nMicrosoft developed this Mac-centric version of Visual studio to use the same building blocks as its PC counterpart, while at the same time maximizing compatibility between Mac and PC platforms: \nIts IntelliSense and refactoring use the Roslyn Compiler Platform; its project system and build engine use MSBuild; and its source editor supports TextMate bundles. It uses the same debugger engines for Xamarin and .NET Core apps, and the same designers for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android... \nAlthough it’s a new product and doesn’t support all of the Visual Studio project types, for those it does have in common it uses the same MSBuild solution and project format. If you have team members on macOS and Windows, or switch between the two OSes yourself, you can seamlessly share your projects across platforms. \nWith Visual Studio for Mac, developers will be able to target many of today’s most popular platforms including Android , iOS , macOS and of course the Universal Windows Platform ( UWP ). \nGiven that this news was leaked out early, the software preview isn’t quite ready yet for developers to download and try out. You’ll have to wait until later this week when Visual Studio for Mac is officially announced.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft adds Outlook Customer Manager to Office 365 SMB plan Microsoft is adding a new customer relationship management tool that is accessible via Outlook to its Office 365 Business Premium plan for no additional cost for subscribers. | Topic: Cloud \nMicrosoft is adding another new service to its Office 365 Business Premium plan called Outlook Customer Manager. \nMicrosoft officials described the service as a tool for managing customer relationships from inside Outlook.The tool will be available for no extra cost in the Office 365 Business Premium Plan, officials announced on November 14. \nOutlook Customer Manager automatically organizes customer information like emails, meetings, tasks, deals and deadlines in a timeline next to users' inboxes. \nMicrosoft has been beefing up its highest end small and mid-size business (SMB) plan, Office 365 Business Premium, with a number of new services lately . \nLast month, Microsoft posted and then pulled a sign-up page for \"business apps for Office\" that touted a handful of mobile-first, cross-platform apps, including MileIQ, Bookings, Invoice, Spend, Point, and Presence that apparently will be part of the Office 365 Business Premium plan. \nSome of the applications either already have been or are in the midst of being added to the Office 365 Business Premium plan, such as the MileIQ mileage tracker and Bookings automatic scheduling applications. Just this week, Microsoft announced that Bookings could be integrated directly with business users' Facebook pages .) Microsoft bought Mobile Data Labs , the company behind the MileIQ app, in November 2015. \nOffice 365 Business Premium is Microsoft's most comprehensive Office 365 subscription plan for small businesses. It costs $15 per user per month if paid monthly, or $12.50 per user per month if paid annually. It includes the full set of locally-installable Office applications for up to five PCs and/or Macs per user, as well as Exchange Online, Skype for Business Online, SharePoint Online, Yammer enterprise social-networking, and 1 TB of OneDrive for Business cloud storage. \nMicrosoft officials said that Microsoft also is planning to bring Outlook Customer Manager to Office 365 E3 and E5 plans \"in the future.\" The feature will begin rolling out to Business Premium subscribers, starting with those in First Release, \"in the coming months.\" Join Discussion",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nMicrosoft on Monday announced that it was committing to buy all 178 megawatts of production from the Bloom Wind wind farm under construction near Dodge City. \nIt will be part of 237 megawatts of alternative energy the company is buying to supply, through the grid, its Cheyenne, Wyo. data center. \nConstruction has started on the wind farm, 54 towers spread across 15,000 acres of privately-owned land about 20 miles south of Dodge City in Ford and Clark counties. It will be operational in the third quarter of next year. \nCapital Power will operate Bloom Wind and has contracted all of the facility’s output to a subsidiary of Allianz, a large European insurer under a 10-year financial swap contract. Allianz is selling the power to Microsoft for 10 years. \nMicrosoft is one of a number of large companies buying wind as the price has, in many cases, fallen below conventional generation. Microsoft said that it will generate half of the electricity at its data centers from wind, solar or hydropower by 2018. Related content",

      "text": "  \n(Microsoft) Shown in the photo is Surface Pro 4. Rumor has it that Microsoft will unveil the Surface Pro 5 in January 2017 and release it in the market two months later. \nThere's still no definitive date as to when the new Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will be coming to the market but if these slew of recent hints be of any indication, it could be deduced that the purported device might be hitting the shelves by next year. \nAccording to reports , the price of the current-gen Surface Pro 4 is expected to be slashed off in time for the most awaited Black Friday sale this year. In Amazon, the 256 GB with 8 GB of RAM with Core i5 processor now has a $1,076 price tag from its original of $1,299. \nThe much higher tier, the 256 GB with 16 GB RAM, Core i7e processor, is selling at $1,498.99 instead of $1,799 while the 512 GB with 16 GB RAM, Core i7e processor is at $1,767.98 from $2,199. \nThese are just some of the many deals being offered for the Surface Pro 4. As added by a report , these awesome discounts could be foretelling the Redmond-based tech giant's move to finally roll out the newest iterations of the Surface Pro line. Advertisement \nSpeaking of its delay, a publication pointed out the rumors saying that the coming of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 is being stalled because of the 14-nanometer Intel Kaby Lake processor. It's also speculated that Microsoft is looking to release the laptop tablet hybrid in time with the second major Windows 10 update â the Windows 10 Redstone 2 OS. \nThere's no telling how much the alleged device would cost but several theories are banking on the U.S. $899 entry level price. A 4K UHD model is also speculated to bear a $1,599 sticker price. \nAs of its release date, there are reports saying that Microsoft could be planning to release their newest offering at the same time Apple unveils their iPad Pro 2, which will be in the early 2017. \nWatch out for more updates.

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIf you were wondering why we haven't heard much about Valve's Steam Machine living room gaming PCs for a while, it seems there may be a good reason for that: Windows 10. \nWhen the first Steam Machine was revealed in 2013 , there was plenty of buzz around Valve's plans to launch console-style PCs focused on gaming, and some speculated that they might even become a serious competitor to Xbox and PlayStation. But Valve delayed the launch of the first Steam Machines until 2015 , to work on improving its Steam Controller, and it wasn't until last November that Alienware launched its version . Benchmarks showing that gaming performance on Valve's SteamOS was far from remarkable did little to boost the appeal of the platform. \nIn an interview with PC Gamer , Alienware co-founder and general manager Frank Azor noted that there was a considerable shift in the market between Valve's original Steam Machine announcement, and when the devices were finally ready to go on sale - and things have changed even more since then. \n\"I think the landscape two years ago was very different to what it is today,\" Azor said, adding: \nThe catalyst for the Steam Machine initiative was really around what Microsoft’s decisions were with Windows 8, and if you remember that operating system, it really stepped away from gamers in a big way. We were concerned as an industry that we were going to lose PC gamers on the Windows platform to any other platform that was out there, whether it was console, Mac OS X, Android. \n\"We had to take matters into our own hands,\" he continued, \"because we couldn’t rely on Microsoft. So we did that, and we started pursuing the path that we did.\" But Valve's delayed launch gave Microsoft time to reassess its approach to gaming, and it did so in a big way with its latest OS. \n\"Valve ran into some delays with the controller, and while that was occurring, Windows 10 was being released,” Azor explained. \"I think Microsoft learned a very valuable lesson – a lot of valuable lessons – with Windows 8 and tried to correct those with Windows 10. It’s more gamer focused, I would say. Every subsequent release has focused on gamers. Although their execution isn’t perfect, it’s definitely improved compared to Windows 8.” \nMicrosoft's renewed focus on the gaming experience appears to have made Valve's proposition far less relevant today - at least as far as Azor is concerned. \n\"I think the need right now, for Steam Machines and for SteamOS, isn’t as great as it was two years ago,\" he said, \"and that’s contributed to the reason why the momentum has faded. We still offer SteamOS and the Steam Machine platform with the new version of the Alpha – the new Steam Machine R2 – and we still sell hundreds of units, thousands of units every month. But it’s not a major initiative for us like it was two years ago because it’s not necessary right now. We’re in a good place with Windows.\"",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe folks over at Microsoft seem to be very committed to doing \"good\". Not only does the company produce products that make the world better (Windows, Skype, and Office to name a few), but through its noble Winsiders4Good initiative, Dona Sarkar and other Microsoft employees are aiming to improve people's lives using technology. \nToday, Microsoft announces yet another way that it is helping humanity. The Windows-maker makes its \"largest ever\" purchase of wind energy -- 237 megawatts. In other words, the company will be using less fossil fuels, and reducing its overall carbon footprint. \n\"Microsoft has contracted with Allianz Risk Transfer (ART) to fix its long-term energy costs and purchase the environmental attributes connected with the new, 178-megawatt Bloom Wind project in Kansas. The project is the first to use a novel structure developed by ART and designed to offset high upfront costs associated with the creation of large-scale wind projects. Microsoft is the first buyer to participate in this structure, which has the potential to bring clean energy projects online at a faster pace\", says Microsoft. \nThe Windows-maker further says that it has \"contracted with Black Hills Corp. subsidiary Black Hills Energy, under a long-term agreement, to purchase 59 megawatts of renewable energy certificates from the Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind projects, which are adjacent to Microsoft' Cheyenne, Wyoming, datacenter. The combined output of the Bloom and Happy Jack/Silver Sage projects will produce enough energy on an annual basis to cover the annual energy used at the datacenter\". \nAs stated earlier, these two deals combined equals a massive 237 megawatts. This is not Microsoft's first wind rodeo, however. Besides these new deals, it was already committed to at least 263 megawatts. \nWhile using wind is not necessarily the most financially sound investment, it is certainly better for the Earth's environment and climate. It seems Microsoft is putting the Earth before profits, and that rocks! The Windows-maker deserves major kudos, not only for its investment in alternative energy, but investing in our planet's overall future too.",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft Teams is a chat-based application meant to be an extension to the Office 365 office suite promoted by the giant. Its main purpose is to help teams in a business orientated environment better communicate and share the progress of current projects so that all team members are up to date and connected. \nWhile people can currently check out the preview version of the software, it was noticed that Microsoft Teams isn’t currently part of the Windows Store . This raised questions since the application was expected to make a debut on Microsoft’s online store. \nHowever, a recent session of Ask Me Anything took place in which anxious followers of Microsoft Teams development didn’t hesitate to ask whether or not users would get to see the work efficiency boosting program on the Windows Store. \nMicrosoft confirmed that they would be making it available, although they did not specify when that exact moment will come. Since no official date was shared with the public, speculation pointed to a possible early 2017 addition to the Windows Store. \nWe are working on that. We will be in Windows Store via Desktop Bridge which will enable capability to have Win 10 notifications and live tile updates \nThis scenario is quite plausible as by the time we reach this release date, Microsoft Teams will have also left its Preview phase and gone on to full-retail mode. \nMicrosoft users that weren’t completely sold by the rumor will have to unfortunately wait a bit longer until Microsoft makes an official announcement about when Teams will become available in the Store. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "With the advent of Windows 10, Microsoft has slowly ramped up the competitiveness of Windows’ built-in software such as browsers (Microsoft Edge), app and game gateways (the Windows Store and Play Anywhere), and security products (Windows Defender). This is leading at least some company leaders to worry that Microsoft is trying to push out third-party software when Microsoft-made solutions are readily available.\n\nThe latest Microsoft competitor to take a stand is Eugene Kaspersky, founder of security company Kaspersky Labs. Recently, Kaspersky announced in a blog post that his company was filing complaints of anticompetitive behavior by Microsoft in “various countries (including the EU and Russia).” It’s not clear if Kaspersky Labs is complaining to officials in the United States.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "title": "Microsoft Details Anti-Ransomware Protection in Windows 10",
      "text": "Microsoft Details Anti-Ransomware Protection in Windows 10 By Ionut Arghire   Microsoft’s latest desktop operating system release, which started rolling out to users in early August in the form of Windows 10 Anniversary Update , is packing improved ransomware resilience, the Redmond-based tech giant says. Numerous new ransomware variants have emerged over the past 12 months alone, swith popular threats including Locky , CryptXXX , and Cerber , which target Windows, and Microsoft appears determined to tackle them at the OS level. Other platforms aren’t safe from ransomware either, as variants such as Linux.Encoder , KeRanger , and Lockdroid have shown. Microsoft decided to make Windows more ransomware-resilient because the number of such threats spotted in the wild in the past 12 months has more than doubled, Rob Lefferts, Director of Program Management, Windows Enterprise and Security, Microsoft, says . The company integrated the Windows 10 Anniversary Update with the necessary technology to protect against these threats, and now it has decided to detail them in a newly published whitepaper (PDF). Some of the enhanced security features in the latest platform update include email protection that blocks malware sent through suspicious URLs or attachments, along with anti-exploit protection in Microsoft Edge , meant to block malicious code from silently downloading and executing an additional payload on the victim’s system. On top of that, there’s the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) that Microsoft revealed in March. Additionally, Microsoft packed both Office 2016 and Office 2013 with macro-blocking features, which should prevent document-borne ransomware and other types of malware from being executed on vulnerable computers. As Lefferts explains, the purpose of different ransomware variants is the same: to infect the device and then deny access to files on it or to the entire device. What differs, however, is the method that attackers use of perpetrate their attacks. To ensure that ransomware is successfully blocked, Microsoft packed Windows 10 not only with the above mentioned security features, but also with new technology in Windows Defender, so that detection happens in seconds, before infection occurs, Lefferts says. Other Windows 10 security capabilities include Credential Guard, Windows Hello and others, all meant to turn Windows 10 Anniversary Update the most secure Windows version. Windows 10 devices are 58% less likely to encounter ransomware compared to those running Windows 7, Microsoft explains. The tech giant also explains that its strategy to stop ransomware involves prevention, detection, and response. Thus, the company didn’t focus only on stopping ransomware before it reaches the device, but also on blocking it from running on compromised machines and on providing the necessary intelligence to IT and Security professionals. Related to prevention, Lefferts mentions browser hardening, where Adobe Flash Player, the most commonly exploited browser plug-in, runs in an isolated container in Microsoft Edge. There’s also email protection, where attachment types most popular among cybercriminals are blocked, and machine learning, where cloud infrastructure is leveraged to identify and block malware more quickly. Better detection is available through a new and improved Windows Defender, which is enabled by default in Windows 10. “We’ve also improved Windows Defender’s behavioral heuristics to help determine if a file is performing ransomware-related activities, and then detect and take action more quickly,” Lefferts says. The Windows Defender ATP in Windows 10 Anniversary Update allows companies to detect attacks that have impacted others. The service combines security events collected from the machines with cloud analytics and should be able to detect signs of attacks and alert the enterprise security team. Details on ransomware attacks would be available in the Windows Defender ATP console, allowing respondents to determine where it might be moving next in the network. The aforementioned whitepaper details even more of the security enhancements that Microsoft packed inside Windows 10 Anniversary Update. To take advantage of them, the tech company says, users should update their devices as soon as possible. A recent Duo Security report has revealed that 65% of the company’s clients’ Windows users are still running Windows Vista and that tens of thousands are still using Windows XP. 88% of XP users are still using Internet Explorer 8, and 20% of all Internet Explorer users are using a version that has already reached end-of-life status . Running outdated operating systems and applications puts not only users, but also enterprises at risk.",

      "text": "Microsoft Corp. committed to its largest wind-power purchase to date with a deal to buy 237 megawatts of capacity from projects in Wyoming and Kansas.\nAllianz Risk Transfer AG’s Bloom Wind Project in Kansas and Black Hills Corp.’s Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind farms in Wyoming will provide all of the power needed by a data center in Cheyenne, Wyoming, under two long-term contracts cover, according a Microsoft blog post Monday. Terms weren’t disclosed.\nUnder a new arrangement with Black Hills’s utility in Wyoming, backup generators at the data center will be available as a secondary resource to provide power to the local grid when needed. That means the utility can avoid building a new power plant.\n“This is a small step toward a future where other customer-sited resources may help make the grid more efficient, reliable and capable of integrating intermittent energy sources like wind and solar,” Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in the post.\nMicrosoft’s data centers will get about 44 percent of their electricity from wind, solar and hydropower sources this year and 50 percent in two years, Smith said. The company already has deals for 20 megawatts of solar power and 285 megawatts of wind, according to the blog post.\nThe top 50 U.S. corporate buyers of solar and wind energy will add 17.4 gigawatts by 2020 and another 63.4 gigawatts by 2025 to meet their own goals, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.",

Microsoft also unveiled a virtual reality gaming head set titled the HoloLens, a tablet titled the Surface Pro 4 and a phone titled the Lumia 950. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) Advertisement \nInterest in 2-in-1 laptops is gaining ground. The world has Microsoft to thank for following the emergence of its Surface Book and Pro product lines. \nIn line with this, it is inevitable that tech competitors will be unveiling their respective handy computers down the road. Judging that the Windows 10 format is conducive enough to run those types of machines, the competition for the best laptop is on. Advertisement \nWith the presence of the sixth generation Core i5 and Core i7 processors, it is without doubt that Microsoft's items are, by far, the most powerful units. Add to that the integration of the Nvidia GTX 965M graphics accessory and the entire gaming experience has never been this efficient. \nIn addition, the 13.5-inch Surface Book provides a 3000x2000-pixel resolution. Aside from its 8GB and 16GB RAM capability, the laptop presents models with 128GB, 256GB, 512GB and 1TB SSD storages. \nFor a lightweight machine, the battery is effective enough to sustain power up to 16 hours. Moreover, the stylus supported-device provides a detachable base which easily transforms it into a tablet. \nIn contrast, the Spectre X360 surfaces with a seventh generation Core i5 and i7 processing units. HP has come up with a 13 and 15-inch screens that portray a 4K-capable 3840x2160 resolutions. \nAside from the 8GB and 16GB RAM models, it has also added a 4GB variant. Hewlett-Packard's item reveals a graphic processor that is equipped with Intel HD graphics 620. \nCompared to the Surface Book, the display cannot be detached but the frame is foldable enough to become a tablet. Battery power can be utilized up to 12 hours of video playback. \nMeanwhile, the Lenovo Yoga 910 offers a highly-efficient 2-in-1 Windows set-up . The processor is fired up by a seventh generation Intel Core i7 which runs up to 16GB of DDR4 RAM. SSD storage hits a maximum of 1TB of memory. \nJust like the Spectre, Lenovo's 13.9-inch screen provides a 4K or 1080p resolution. The laptop's all the way back-bendability allows it to assume a tablet stance. In addition to JBL stereo speakers, the Yoga 910 is also equipped with a backlight keyboard. Battery life extends up to nine hours. \nOverall, both HP and Lenovo have identical features on their products. That makes the Surface Book unique in a certain way. If it's about efficiency plus a detachable frame, the Microsoft device may have the edge. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. ",

      "text": "\nLast month at the big Windows 10 event, Microsoft introduced the new Surface Dial along with the new Surface Studio. Surface Dial is what Microsoft likes to call “a new tool for the creative process” that allows users to be able to interact with apps like StaffPad and Photoshop very instance. For instance, you can use the Surface Dial to change the color on Photoshop or Windows Ink. Additionally, you can also use Surface Dial to control things like the volume or the music you’re playing on Spotify.\nAt the Windows 10 event last week, Microsoft showed off a bunch of apps running on the Surface Studio that utilize the Surface Dial. Today, one of the apps, StaffPad, is adding support for the Surface Dial to its Windows 10 app. With the Surface Dial support, composing music on StaffPad gets much easier as the Dial can immensely help with the editing process. For example, you can use the Surface Dial to manipulate the notes on your music on StaffPad or use it to Undo/Redo a change you made. In addition to this, there’s a neat feature which lets you copy paste certain part of your music using the Surface Dial. Here’s a demo:\nIn addition to the Surface Dial support, the latest update for StaffPad also brings a number of new features and improvements, including things like improved support for printing of sketch layer strokes, and new keyboard shortcuts.\nAll of the new features are part of StaffPad’s November update, which you can download from the link below. And if you’re interested, you can get the Surface Dial here. \nWP-Appbox: StaffPad ($69.99 + , Windows Store) → \n",

      "title": "Microsoft Black Friday deals discount Surface Book, Surface Pro 4",
      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo Microsoft announced on Monday that it will heavily discount the Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 between November 24 and November 28. As a fan of both products, this a Black Friday deal I recommend you take advantage of.\nBetween the aforementioned dates, Microsoft will cut $430 off of select Surface devices. That includes $400 off of the Surface Book i5. No, that’s not the new Surface Book with Performance Base, but it offers the same quality build design, detachable display, Microsoft Pen support and more. The i5 model typically starts at $1,499, so it’s still expensive, but much less so.\nMicrosoft will also discount the Surface Pro 4 with a special “exclusive Best Buy bundle” that includes the Surface Pro 4 with 128GB of storage and a Type Cover for $599. Microsoft didn’t say specifically, but my guess is that discount applies to the entry-level model that typically costs $899 and includes a Core M processor.\nMicrosoft’s Black Friday deals include all sorts of goodies Microsoft has plenty of other deals, too, including discounts on Windows 10 computers made by Dell, ASUS and more. Hit the source to see what’s coming.\n\n\nSource : Microsoft ",

      "title": "Kaspersky: Windows 10’s antivirus integration anti-competitive",
      "text": "tweet \nEugen Kaspersky, head of the Russian security company Kaspersky Lab has accused Microsoft of anti-competitive practices in the Windows 10 operating system. \nKaspersky complains that Microsoft pushes Windows Defender on Windows 10 devices to the detriment of third-party antivirus vendors. \nWe think that Microsoft has been using its dominating position in the market of operating systems to create competitive advantages for its own product. The company is foisting its Defender on the user, which isnâ€™t beneficial from the point of view of protection of a computer against cyberattacks. The company is also creating obstacles for companies to access the market, and infringes upon the interests of independent developers of security products. \nMicrosoft’s own solution, Windows Defender, ships with Windows 10 to protect users on a basic level against threats. \nWindows Defender can be best described as basic protection. Independent tests by organizations such as AV Tests have shown that Windows Defender does not offer the same level of protection as most third-party antivirus solutions. \nWhile that is the case, it protects against many major threats that users may be exposed to while using the computer. \nMicrosoft designed Windows Defender to jump in if no third-party antivirus program is found on the computer the operating system is running on. If the user installs a third-party product, Windows Defender will disable itself automatically to avoid conflicts. \nKaspersky’s lengthy complaint comes down to this: Windows 10 may deactivate installed third-party antivirus solutions during system upgrades because of incompatibilities. The operating system may furthermore push notifications that “tell” the user that Windows Defender protection is turned off even if a third-party product is installed, and will turn on Windows Defender a couple of days after a third-party product expires. \nIf you dissect the claims, you may come to the conclusion that there are two sides to the story. First, that it seems appropriate for Windows 10 to turn on Windows Defender if no or expired third-party products are found on the system. \nThis raises the question whose fault it is when that happens. \nSecond, that Windows 10 has its fair share of issues including those affecting the incompatibility check during system upgrades. If you upgraded Windows 10 to a new version, or from an older version of Windows to Windows 10, you may have noticed the following behavior. \nThe upgrade assistant notifies you that software XY is incompatible with Windows 10. You upgrade anyway, and install software XY after the upgrade on the system without issues and it runs just fine on it. \nKaspersky suggests two changes to level the playing field. First, that Microsoft provides third-parties with new versions of Windows and updates in “good time”. Second, that the install and notification system changes to make it clearer to users that the process will remove third-party antivirus software. Closing Words \nIt is clear that the current system of checking for incompatibilities is problematic for companies affected by it as it is likely that a percentage of users won’t re-install these products after upgrades complete. Notifications about these things, and others, could be better as well to help users better understand the implications. \nNow You : What’s your take on the claim? \nGhacks needs you.

      "text": "\nWe’ve heard that Project Scorpio, Microsoft’s next big Xbox console, will be the most powerful ever with 6 TFLOPS of computing power. Xbox head of marketing Aaron Greenberg revealed some interesting details on how Microsoft plans to tackle gaming in 4K.\nSpeaking to GameTransfers , Greenberg said during the Xbox FanFest in Mexico City that, “This will really bring the most powerful console you’ve ever seen. It will bring these really true 4K, really incredible visual games that we’ve never seen before on the console.\n“People who have spent thousands of dollars on a high-end PC are getting that experience. How do we bring that to scale in a console in your living room? That’s a big part of what Project Scorpio is about.”\nIt also seems that all first party titles from Microsoft will run in native 4K on the console. “Any games we’re making that we’re launching in the Scorpio time frame, we’re making sure they can natively render at 4K.”\nProject Scorpio is currently slated to release in Holiday 2017.",

Today, Microsoft announced that the new Surface Studio and Surface Book with Performance Base devices are now certified to run Siemens NX software.\nJoe Bohman, Vice President of Product Engineering Software for Siemens’ product lifecycle management (PLM) software business told the following regarding the new Surface devices.\nSurface Studio and Surface Book offer our users a more flexible and creative platform for design thanks to a combination of touch, pen and traditional inputs to develop ideas in a more natural manner. The high-resolution display on Surface Studio really gives a greater sense of confidence and precision when looking at complex shapes and offers a better understanding of the aesthetics during the design process. Adding Surface Dial brings a whole new degree of flexibility and control especially when interacting and changing designs.\nThe Siemens NX certification is granted only to devices that have passed their series of hundreds of tests, which weigh a device’s ability to deliver a highly satisfactory end-user experience.

      "text": "Microsoft on HoloLens: ‘Opportunities are there for game makers’ Microsoft say that videogames aren't leading the HoloLens, but there's opportunities for developers.   Kevin Joyce \nDespite the increasing availability, Microsoft’s HoloLens still only officially exists in a development capacity. It remains far from becoming a consumer product, and yet developers are continuing to push the agenda for videogames on the platform. According to Leila Martine, director of product marketing at Microsoft, this is because it’s videogames that pave the way for public awareness. \n“I am probably saying something out of turn, because I’m not sitting in the room when they’re making these decisions in Redmond, but I do know that it causes me great consternation every time they go to a gaming conference and they show HoloLens. Because when that happens, all that journalists want to talk about is games,” stated Martine in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz . “I have Case Western University, which is one of these most phenomenal case studies [with its education product that teaches anatomy]. But they’ll get like 300,000 YouTube views, which is still great for a B2B scenario. But Minecraft … are you kidding me? Those views are in the bazillions.” \nMicrosoft has never denied the opportunity HoloLens provides for videogames, however the company has openly stated that the device is not intended as a gaming platform first-and-foremost. It’s the developers, according to Martine, who are ready to capitalise on the opportunities for videogames that HoloLens brings. \n“We are definitely seeing games developers in demand,” says Martine. “Part of that is because Unity is a core way to be able to build on this right now. With their heritage in gaming and with the demand coming from these new places, it is a pretty hot place for these games developers to be. Then we are seeing who has the appetite to move outside of gaming and capture opportunities that are coming from, quite frankly, places they haven’t worked with before. It could be a power plant looking to visualise their plant, or training simulations for pilots or engineers. With the Unity capability, these opportunities are there for game makers.” \nOf course, the greatest issue facing HoloLens’ readiness for mainstream adoption remains its price tag. Currently sitting at $3,000 USD, the device is a far cry from the oft considered expensive virtual reality (VR) platforms now within reach of consumers, Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, which both retail for under $1,000. \n“Unlike some of the other ones that are out there on the market, you don’t need a high performance computer to go with it,” defends Martine. “Everything you need is right on that device. And that device is really unique in terms of it capabilities, and the team has done a tremendous amount to bring it to market in a very short amount of time.” \nOfficially revealed back in January 2015 , Microsoft’s HoloLens still has no path to consumer release outlined for it. However, the company did recently reveal plans to partner with external manufacturers for a range of low cost VR devices .

      "title": "Microsoft is going to pretend to release Visual Studio for Mac",
      "text": "On Wednesday, Microsoft is hosting its Connect() developer conference in New York City, but the company has accidentally let slip a couple of pieces of news a bit early. Posts were published to MSDN Magazine (though they've now been removed) earlier than intended.\nThe biggest news is that Visual Studio is coming to the Mac—or, at least, a piece of software named Visual Studio is coming to the Mac. Microsoft has always had a surprising willingness to give different products similar names, a move that generally provokes more confusion than it does enlightenment. The same seems true here.\nVisual Studio for Mac isn't, in fact, Visual Studio at all. Instead, it's the latest iteration of Xamarin Studio, the cross-platform C# development environment that Microsoft inherited when it bought Xamarin, developers of cross-platform .NET-based mobile development tools, last year .\nThese are two very different products, and the real Windows Visual Studio is the more capable product. However, the two offerings are less different than they once were. Even without Microsoft's ownership of the company, the Xamarin platform was set to align more closely with the .NET platform thanks to Microsoft's open sourcing efforts : many components that Xamarin had to develop independently could be dropped in favor of the \"real\" .NET versions. In particular, the Roslyn C# compiler and MSBuild build tool and project files are shared between real Visual Studio and the new Visual Studio for Mac. The interface designers for building Android and iOS apps using the Xamarin platform are also shared. This means that if a project builds in one, it will build in the other. Thus, developers on different platforms can easily contribute to the same projects; teams can in principle be made of a mix of Windows and Mac developers.\nFor those wanting something a little lighter weight, Microsoft's other weirdly branded product, Visual Studio Code (which, again, has no real shared heritage with \"Visual Studio\"), remains a cross-platform text editor and simple development environment.\nMSDN Magazine also spoiled a little snippet of news about the real Visual Studio. Hitherto, the development of the next version of Visual Studio has used the awkward name Visual Studio \"15,\" Quote: marks and all. With the current version being \"Visual Studio 2015,\" this made it all too easy to stumble and refer to the wrong one by accident. But \"15\" now has a proper name: it will be \"Visual Studio 2017.\" It's still not finished, but a release candidate will be released at the Connect event.\nVisual Studio 2017 contains a laundry list of new, incremental improvements to C++, C#, F#, debugging, and more. In some ways, its biggest improvement is not to the core product itself but its installer. Currently installing and updating Visual Studio is a tremendously tedious affair that takes far longer than seems reasonable. Uninstalling is also aggravating, as many of the dependencies have to be removed separately. The new installer promises to be faster, allowing smaller installations that only include the features you need and enabling clean one-shot uninstallation.",

      "text": "In late 2016, Microsoft and Apple seem to have swapped places. The Surface Studio and Surface Book with Performance Base continue to push the envelope in performance and design while Apple appears to be spinning its wheels. Ebbs and flows in technology and even within companies are expected. It happened to Microsoft, and it may be going on with Apple and their new MacBook Pro line right now.\nFor many people, the MacBook Pros set the bar for laptops. In fact, you could argue that everything Microsoft does in hardware is to outdo Apple regarding quality and design. It's not a coincidence that the Surface line is priced to match Apple's products. Even Microsoft's ads frequently call out Cupertino .\n\nOur friends over at iMore have just reviewed all three of the new Pros including the 13\" without Touch Bar, the 13\" with Touch Bar, and the dream machine 15\" with Touch Bar.\n\nUnless you live under a rock, you likely know that Apple's announcement of these devices was met with mixed responses even from diehard Apple fans. That's what makes iMore's review interesting as our colleagues are knee deep in the Apple ecosystem. ",

      "text": "Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech \nMicrosoft has a problem: many developers use Macs -- and Mac developers aren't as likely to code for Microsoft platforms if they don't have tools built for their operating system. \nThat may be why Microsoft announced Monday that a full, native version of its Visual Studio IDE (Integrated Development Environment; a place to code, debug and test) is coming to the Mac. \nAccording to an official Microsoft blog post (since pulled from the web), it'll launch in preview at Microsoft's Connect(); developer event later this week, and will \"look and feel like a native citizen of macOS.\" \nThere's one catch: it's not exactly a built-from-the -ground up version of Visual Studio, but rather ( as long-time tech journalist Tim Anderson points out ) a rebranding of Xamarin. Microsoft bought Xamarin in February 2016 . Perhaps that distinction is why Microsoft pulled the blog post. Microsoft declined to comment. \nIt's also not technically the first chunk of Visual Studio to make its way to Mac. That would be Visual Studio Code , when went open-source last year.",

The offer allows IT administrators to make the switch without any additional cost until March 31, 2017. \nThe offer is being targeted for medium to large business team sites and my sites that have at least 150 licenses. It also comes with assistance from the Fast Track team to help migrate the services and build an executable plan to learn the new services on the cloud. \nData cannot exceed 10 TB per Office 365 tenant or 75% and above of the target site collection quota. If you’re looking for more information on how to get on the FastTrack to transferring SharePoint 2013 on-premises services to Office 365, Microsoft has shared a full FAQ about the offer and a full list of potentially migratable site content on their site.

      "text": "Microsoft is trying to prevent antivirus companies from offering their software for Windows 10 , according to complaints filed in the European Union and Russia last week.\nFollowing a complaint from antivirus software maker Kaspersky Labs, Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) opened an investigation into Microsoft's practices related to Windows Defender , the built-in antivirus software in Windows 10.\nThe Russian investigation claims Microsoft has reduced the timeframe for third-party developers to ensure their software is compatible with Windows 10 from two months to six days. If the software doesn't meet certain requirements within that timeframe, it's replaced with Windows Defender.\n\"Since 'Microsoft' itself develops antivirus software—Windows Defender that switches on automatically if third-party software fails to adapt to Windows 10 in due time—such actions lead to unreasonable advantages for 'Microsoft' on the software market,\" FAS Deputy Head Anatoly Golomolzin said in a statement . \"Our task is to ensure equal conditions for all participants on this market.\"\nRussian cybersecurity expert Eugene Kaspersky said his company, which is one of the largest third-party antivirus providers, has filed similar complaints with the EU.\n\"The trend is clear: Microsoft is gradually squeezing independent developers out of the Windows ecosystem,\" Kaspersky wrote in a blog post . He cited several troublesome aspects to how Windows 10 handles antivirus software, such as automatically deactivating third-party antivirus programs when users upgrade from a previous operating system.",

      "text": "Sony and Microsoft have aligned themselves with AMD for current-generation console hardware, and those relationships look set to continue. However, for the Switch, Nintendo chose AMD rival Nvidia, which supplies the Tegra system on a chip (SoC) at the heart of Nintendo's next home console.\nLast week, Nvidia revealed during an earnings call that its gaming revenue increased by $463 million compared to Q2, according to NeoGAF . \"I guess you could also say that Nintendo contributed a fair amount to that growth,\" Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said during the call.\nWhile we have yet to experience the Nintendo Switch , Huang pointed out that Nvidia has been working with Nintendo for two years on the Switch and \"several hundred engineering years have gone into the development of this incredible game console.\"\n\nRemembering that this was an earnings call aimed squarely at investors, Huang was extremely positive about the Switch. \"I really believe when everybody sees it and enjoy it, they're going be amazed by it. It's really like nothing they've ever played with before,\" he said.\nBut Huang also highlighted a key point about Nvidia's relationship with Nintendo. Nintendo is well known for investing in hardware architecture for the long term. You need only look at the DS/2DS/3DS to see that. So he believes it will be the same for the Switch going forward; he envisions, \"a relationship that will likely last two decades.\"\nIt's a fair point to make. If the Switch is successful, then Nintendo will certainly want to follow it up with a Switch 2 in 5-8 years time. Nvidia will be front of the line to provide the SoC for that machine, too. And even if the Switch fails, Nintendo will likely want to maintain the relationship it has built with Nvidia's engineering team to help create whatever comes next, even if it ends up being a smartphone.",

      "text": "Tweet \nMicrosoft accidentally revealed that Visual Studio is making its way to the Mac. A blog post published in error on MSDN shows that the company plans to bring its coding tool to the Apple platform. \nTransforming Visual Studio into a cross-platform development tool is an interesting move for Microsoft, and something it has resisted for quite some time. The official announcement is due at Connect later this week, but the leak means that we already have all the details we need. \nWhile the original blog post has vanished from MSDN, there's still a cached version available that reveals all. The Mac version of the tool continues Microsoft's focus on mobile and the cloud, and it won’t be long until developers are able to get their hands on the software. \nIn the blog post Microsoft says: \nAt Connect(); in November, Microsoft is launching a preview of Visual Studio for Mac. This is an exciting development, evolving the mobile-centric Xamarin Studio IDE into a true mobile-first, cloud-first development tool for .NET and C#, and bringing the Visual Studio development experience to the Mac. \nAs this is a preview, it's likely that there will be teething issues to start with, but developers will be pleased to see that Microsoft is giving them an alternative to running Visual Studio in a virtual environment.",

      "title": "US stocks wobble as tech losses cancel out bank gains",
      "text": "NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are little changed Monday as technology companies like Apple and Microsoft take big losses on fears about their overseas revenue. That's cancelling out huge gains for banks, which are trading higher as bond yields rise to their highest levels since January. Higher bond yields, in turn, are hurting shares of companies that pay big dividends. Energy companies are slipping with the price of oil. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average gained 11 points, or 0.1 per cent , to 18,858 as of 1:35 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1 point to 2,163. The Nasdaq composite sank 11 points, or 0.2 per cent , to 5,226.\nTECH TROUBLES: Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Those stocks have struggled over the last few days as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas.\nApple gave up $3.01, or 2.8 per cent , to $105.42 while Facebook declined $2.90, or 2.4 per cent , to $116.12 and Microsoft slid $1.18, or 2 per cent , to $57.84. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $16.07, or 2.1 per cent , to $755.68.\nBANK BONANZA: Bank stocks continued to surge, as they've done since the election. Higher bond yields point to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of President-elect Trump to lead to higher inflation.\nInvestors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Goldman Sachs made the biggest gain among Dow stocks as it rose $5.96, or 2.9 per cent , to $209.90 and Bank of America rose 93 cents, or 4.9 per cent , to $19.95. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.64, or 3.4 per cent , to $79.33.\nDOING DEALS: South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes products for connected cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.06, or 25.2 per cent , to $109.71.\nMENTORING: German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose $5.67, or 18.5 per cent , to $36.35.\nDIG IT: Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.82, or 15.7 per cent , to $13.48 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it's too low. Belden stock added 67 cents, or 1 per cent , to $70.37.\nBONDS: Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose sharply, to 2.22 per cent . Bond trading was closed Friday for the U.S. Veterans' Day holiday. The 10-year yield, which is a benchmark for interest rates on home mortgages and other kinds of loans, finished at 2.06 per cent on Thursday. The day before the Nov. 8 presidential election the yield was 1.83 per cent .\nCURRENCIES: The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.21 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0755 from $1.0845.\nENERGY: With the dollar gaining strength, benchmark U.S. crude fell 58 cents, or 1.3 per cent , to $42.83 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 70 cents, or 1.6 per cent , to $44.05 a barrel in London.\nThat pulled energy companies lower. Anadarko Petroleum fell 99 cents, or 1.6 per cent , to $60.05 and Exxon Mobil lost 85 cents, or 1 per cent , to $84.82.\nDIVIDEND PAYERS DIVE: Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Phone and utility companies and household goods makers traded lower. Those stocks are most appealing to investors when bond yields are low. American Tower fell $4.39, or 4.2 per cent , to $101.32 and Duke Energy lost 87 cents, or 1.2 per cent , to $74.37.\nRead More TRUMP FACTOR: Stocks went into a long skid as the presidential campaign came to its conclusion, but in the last few days stocks have risen as investors hope a Trump presidency will mean cutbacks in regulations that affect energy and banks, among other businesses. The Dow has reached record highs, with the biggest recent gains going to financial firms Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, machinery maker Caterpillar and drug company Merck.\nOVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 rose 0.4 per cent and Germany's DAX added 0.2 per cent . The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 per cent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 per cent after a strong reading on Japan's economic growth. The dollar has been particularly strong against the Japanese yen lately and that's helped the country's exporters. Most other Asian markets fell. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 1.4 per cent .\n____\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay\nMarley Jay, The Associated Press",

      "text": "\nFollowing a major new redesign recently , Microsoft is releasing a pretty sweet update for Bing on Android. Bing has picked up a major update on Android, adding some interesting new features. The latest update brings a new feature called 360 Search which uses your device’s camera to show nearby places such as restaurants, shopping malls, etc. The feature is a lot like the City Lens feature from HERE Maps on Lumia phones — so if you have used a Windows Phone device in the past, this feature will be quite familiar to you.\nIn addition to 360 Search, the latest update also introduces a dedicated new Music page to the Bing app. As you may have already guessed, the new Music tab shows the trending songs and the trending artists on Bing. There’s also a song identifier feature which simply allows you to detect a song that’s playing around you right now.\nMicrosoft is also adding a new Events page, similar to Facebook Events which allows you to find the upcoming events near you. For example, Bing will be able to show you the upcoming concerts near you, or sports game schedules. The update lastly brings a new Lottery page which displays the winning numbers, drawing schedules and jackpots.\nIf you are an Android user and you use Bing, you can download the latest update for Bing from the Google Play Store here. \n",

      "text": " AARP\nMicrosoft Survey Finds Two-Thirds of Consumers Have Encountered the Scam\nWASHINGTON , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- With U.S. consumers falling victim to the \"technical support scam\" in greater numbers than ever before, the AARP Fraud Watch Network today launched an initiative to raise awareness of the scam and educate consumers about how they can protect themselves.\nA survey released last month by Microsoft found that over the past year two-thirds of consumers have experienced the tech support scam, in which fraudsters pose as technicians from one of the major computer companies. AARP's effort to educate consumers includes online content, advertising and media appearances featuring renowned security expert and Fraud Watch Network Ambassador Frank Abagnale .\n\"If you or someone you know receives a call or an email from someone identifying themselves as a technician with Microsoft, Google, Apple or some other well-known technology company, it is likely to be a scam. Just hang up the phone,\" said Abagnale. \"The large computer firms never make proactive calls or send email to provide unrequested technical support.\"\nExecuting the scam via telephone, email or even pop-up ads, the scammers inform a targeted person that a virus or some other security problem has been detected on the victim's computer, and offer to make a repair. Instead, their goal is to gain control of the computer, access personal files and passwords, and obtain credit card information to charge the consumer for the supposed repair or a warranty program -- which proves to be worthless.\nThe Microsoft survey indicates that 20% of the people surveyed around the world continued with a potentially fraudulent interaction after the first contact. This means that the victim downloaded harmful software, gave the scammers access to their computer, visited a scam website, or provided a credit card or other forms of payment.\nInterestingly, of the victims who continued interacting with the scammers, half were millennials (ages 18-34). Thirty-four percent were between ages 36-54, and 17% were age 55 or older.\nAbagnale advises consumers never to give control of their computer to a third party, nor to provide a credit card number to pay for unsolicited repair services or warranty programs.\nFor more tips about how keep yourself safe from technical support scammers, visit the new Fraud Watch Network web page at: www.aarp.org/TechScams . The site includes detailed descriptions of how fraudsters execute their scams, video and other content, and a list of recommended \"Dos and Don'ts\" when dealing with a suspected fraudster. An educational booklet , published by Microsoft and the FWN, can also be downloaded from the site.\nAbagnale , who was named AARP Fraud Watch Ambassador in 2015, has been associated with the FBI for more than four decades, and has advised and consulted with hundreds of financial institutions, corporations and government agencies around the world. Abagnale's story was told in his best-selling book, Catch Me if You Can , and in the 2002 movie of the same name, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks .\nThe AARP Fraud Watch Network was launched in 2013 as a free resource for people of all ages. The website provides information about fraud and scams, prevention tips from experts, an interactive Scam-Tracking Map , fun educational quizzes, and video presentations featuring Abagnale. Users may sign up for \"Watchdog Alert\" emails that deliver breaking scam information, or call a free helpline at 877-908-3360 to speak with trained volunteers.\nAbout AARP\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of nearly 38 million that helps people turn their goals and dreams into 'Real Possibilities' by changing the way America defines aging.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nMicrosoft wants to make it as easy as possible for developers to create Windows software — whether they happen to work on a PC or otherwise. To that end, the company has announced plans to bring its Visual Studio coding environment to MacOS for the first time ever. \nVisual Studio is a coding environment that can be used to create software for Windows, as well as services and apps for the web. The decision to offer the program to Mac users demonstrates a major change of course for Microsoft, as the company has previously seemed eager to keep developers chained to their PC. \nIndeed, it seems that Microsoft may have intended to wait a little longer before sharing the news that Visual Studio will soon be available on MacOS. A blog post making the announcement briefly went live on the MSDN Magazine Blog before being deleted, according to a report from The Verge . \nMore: Microsoft’s Cortana may get to know you better to make conversation more natural \nWhile the software’s user interface has been inspired by the Windows version, the post notes that the new release will “feel like a native citizen of MacOS.” It also confirms that Visual Studio Code, the slimmed-down version of the software intended for straightforward code editing, will be making the jump to Apple hardware. \nThe MacOS version of Visual Studio will be based on Xamarin Studio, which Microsoft acquired earlier this year. \nThis is not the only move Microsoft has made to bring Windows closer to other operating systems in recent months. In March, the company unveiled plans to bring the Bash shell to Windows 10, working in collaboration with the company responsible for Ubuntu. \nVisual Studio for Mac will seemingly be announced at Microsoft’s Connect 2016 event, which takes place from November 16 to 18 in New York City. Based on the leaked blog post, a preview build is set to be made available following the announcement. Also watch: HP Spectre Review ",

      "text": "Microsoft today announced a small but significant update to Skype for Web : Guest accounts. If you want to start a Skype conversation with someone quickly and don’t want to sign up for an account, this is for you.\nSkype for Web beta first arrived in November 2014 , and the service launched out of beta in June 2015 . This year, Microsoft has added more features and is working on removing the plugin requirement .\nSkype for Web made it possible to use the service without first downloading Skype. Now, Skype for Web lets you chat and make voice or video calls without even requiring an account.\nAll you have to do is go Skype.com , hit start a conversation, and add your name. You will then be given a link that you can share with whomever via email or a social network. Anyone who clicks the link can join using their Skype app, or as a Guest if they’re using Skype for Web. You can invite up to 300 people to chat and up to 25 people on a voice or video call for free.\nThese conversations are set to last for 24 hours. If you want to use other features, like continue the conversation for longer, call a phone number, or translate a conversation in real-time with Skype Translator, you’ll need to login or get a Skype account.\nThis is a great addition to the Skype service, though it’s coming incredibly late. Think about how you would share such a link: Aside from email, most of the existing options already offer you a way to chat or make a call.\nIn other words, while guest accounts do reduce the barrier to entry for Skype, chances are usage will be low. Nobody is going to go get a link to start a Skype call when they can just hit the call button in Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat, Line, and so on.\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft and Amazon are in a battle for cloud supremacy and while both platforms offer compelling services, the real winner the past couple of years has been the user. Today, Amazon is announcing a further reduction in pricing and if history is any judge of what will happen next, expect Microsoft to follow close behind with price cuts.\nThe cuts announced today , which Amazon says is their 53 rd price reduction, drops pricing up to 25% but the reductions are dependent on your location. The new pricing, for the C4, M4 and T2 tiers is below.\nC4 – Reductions of up to 5% in US East (Northern Virginia) and EU (Ireland) and 20% in Asia Pacific (Mumbai) and Asia Pacific (Sydney). M4 – Reductions of up to 10% in US East (Northern Virginia), EU (Ireland), and EU (Frankfurt) and 25% in Asia Pacific (Singapore). T2 – Reductions of up to 10% in US East (Northern Virginia) and 25% in Asia Pacific (Singapore). With more companies moving to the cloud each quarter as it’s easier, and often less expensive, to utilize cloud infrastructure than build out your own data center, these price reductions will only fuel the growth in this sector.\nEach quarter, Microsoft and Amazon continue to show positive trends in the cloud segments and its one of the contributing factors to why both of their stock prices continue to climb. The opportunity in the cloud segment, with primarily Amazon and Microsoft competing ( although Google is finally starting to make a move in this segment too ) means that each stand to grab a significant portion of the global IT spend each year.\nEven if Google does eventually build out a cloud service that competes seriously with Amazon and Microsoft across all metrics, the market options will still be small for the dollars at stake.\nThe post Amazon Cuts Cloud Costs Up To 25%, Adds Fuel To The Cloud Race appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "title": "Microsoft partner claims Munich should switch from Linux to Windows 10",
      "text": "Microsoft partner claims Munich should switch from Linux to Windows 10 This also just in, sun rises in the east. \nThere have been stories recently that Munich, which has been using Linux for years, is considering switching to Windows 10 . Who started these stories? Accenture , a Microsoft partner. \nMunich is the center of a PR struggle between the Linux and Windows desktops. \nAccenture, a professional services company, isn't just any old Microsoft partner. It's Microsoft's Alliance Partner of the Year in 2016 . That makes the ninth year in a row and twelfth time overall that Microsoft global sales has recognized Accenture as Microsoft's top selling partner. Read this Read More \nI am shocked-- shocked --that Accenture thinks Windows 10 would be the better choice. \nAs soon as the project was completed, Microsoft claimed the Linux/open-source project cost more than 60 million Euros . XP and Office, Microsoft claimed would have cost only 17 million Euros. \nThis latest \"news\" is just Microsoft and buddies' latest public relations move. It's not that 15,000 PCs are that important to Accenture's or Microsoft's bottom line. They aren't. What is important is to discourage corporate and government buyers from seeing a Linux desktop success story. \nTrue, there may never be a year of the Linux desktop. LiMux, Munich's customized Ubuntu and OpenOffice desktop, is never going to be the most popular Linux in Germany, never mind the world. But, Android is now the most popular end-user operating system of all. Worse still, if you're business depends on selling Windows licenses, Google is merging Android and Chrome OS into one operating system. \nYou may not see Android and Chrome OS as Linux success stories, but they are. More to the business point, Microsoft knows these are rivals to its Windows product line. Microsoft has already admitted that it won't make its self-imposed deadline of having Windows 10 installed on a billion devices by mid-2018. \nWill Accenture and Microsoft chase out Tux the plucky Linux penguin? It's hard to say. It's become a city-government political fight. Governments being what they are, a decision won't be made at the earliest until the summer of 2017. \n15,000 PCs won't help Microsoft meet its new 2018 deadline for a billion Windows 10 PCs. But, any prominent Linux desktop success story won't help them either. Microsoft has finally gotten that they must adopt Linux and open-source software on the cloud , but on the desktop, it's still Windows all the time. \nRelated Stories:",

      "text": "Microsoft Stock Caught in Tech Downdraft (MSFT) By Richard Saintvilus | November 14, 2016 — 2:07 PM EST \nTechnology stocks like Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) were broadly shunned out of the post-election rally that the stock market enjoyed last week. Although the Vanguard Information Technology ETF ( VGT ) rose 1.86%, it grossly underperformed the 14% surge enjoyed by the SPDR KBW Bank ETF ( KBE ), which reached a new 52-week high last week. \nMSFT shares closed Friday at $59.02, up 0.55%. The stock has lost almost 4% since making a 52-week high at $61.37 on Oct. 25. The effects that President-elect Donald Trump's pro-American trade policies might have on large multinational tech companies have been cited as a reason to avoid Microsoft shares in the near term. (See also: The Trump Effect on Large Tech Multinationals .) \nLess favorable international trade deals could pressure Microsoft, which generates 47% of its revenue in the U.S., meaning more than half of its revenue comes from overseas markets. RBC Capital Markets analysts noted last week that Trump's victory could lead to a slight decline in IT spending. Accordingly, the analysts said, \"We think the software market could trade with a multiple to the market.\" \n\"Trade with a multiple to the market\" means that stock prices of software companies could come down. Currently, stocks such as Microsoft trade at a premium to the market, not \"with\" the market. Based on Friday's closing price, Microsoft shares are valued at a forward P/E of 20 for 2017, which is three points above the S&P 500 ( SPX ) index average. \nHowever, if applying a multiple that aligns with the market, Microsoft stock would trade today at a price of $50.50 per share, or about 14% below current levels. Under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft is seeing stronger-than-expected growth in its cloud business and enjoying higher profit margins , which have been the reasons it has earned a higher multiple. (See also: Microsoft's Secret Weapon: Cloud Division .) \nWhile it's too early to determine whether its cloud business or its profit margins will decline, Microsoft stock has nonetheless begun to trade on expectations that growth under President-elect Trump could be tougher to achieve.

      "text": "Views Show More Show Less \n- [Nick] Thanks for joining me for a quick introduction to Microsoft Teams. I'm Nick Brazzi. Teams is an online collaborative communication environment where members of an organization can have real time conversations, share files, and plan meetings through video chat. While Teams will not be a full final release until sometime in the first quarter of 2017, it is available as a preview, and almost all of the features of teams are ready to use. We'll start by seeing how to enable the preview for your organization, and how users can access it on the web, on a desktop application, and a mobile app for phones and tablets. \nWe'll see how you can organize your coworkers into teams, and initiate conversations that all team members can contribute to. I'll show off the video chat based meetings, I'll initiate an on demand meeting, and look at how to schedule a meeting for the future, and invite people to attend. And we'll see how to share files, and even edit certain files, in collaboration with your teammates. If you're excited about Microsoft's brand new collaborative communication tool for Office 365, I think this short course will help you quickly get started using Microsoft Teams.

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nMicrosoft let the cat out of the bag today: the software giant will launch a preview of Visual Studio for Mac at this week’s Connect conference.\nThe company posted and then pulled a MSDN Magazine article announcing the software development tool will soon be compatible with Macs.\n“At its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio. If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home,” reads the blog post.\n“Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor.”\nThe blog post went on to say that “compatibility is a key focus of Visual Studio for Mac. Although it’s a new product and doesn’t support all of the Visual Studio project types, for those it does have in common it uses the same MSBuild solution and project format. If you have team members on macOS and Windows, or switch between the two OSes yourself, you can seamlessly share your projects across platforms. There’s no need for any conversion or migration.”\nUntil recently, such a crossover would be unheard of. But, under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has changed its focus to be inclusive of all developers’ preferences.\nIt also comes at a time when Microsoft has turned its focus to the cloud and cloud technologies, which is where a lot of developers are now working.",

      "text": "NEW YORK - U.S. stocks are little changed Monday as technology companies like Apple and Microsoft take big losses on fears about their overseas revenue. That's canceling out huge gains for banks, which are trading higher as bond yields rise to their highest levels since January. Higher bond yields, in turn, are hurting shares of companies that pay big dividends. Energy companies are slipping with the price of oil. \nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average gained 11 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,858 as of 1:35 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1 point to 2,163. The Nasdaq composite sank 11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,226. \nTECH TROUBLES: Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Those stocks have struggled over the last few days as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. \nApple gave up $3.01, or 2.8 percent, to $105.42 while Facebook declined $2.90, or 2.4 percent, to $116.12 and Microsoft slid $1.18, or 2 percent, to $57.84. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $16.07, or 2.1 percent, to $755.68. \nBANK BONANZA: Bank stocks continued to surge, as they've done since the election. Higher bond yields point to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of President-elect Trump to lead to higher inflation. \nInvestors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Goldman Sachs made the biggest gain among Dow stocks as it rose $5.96, or 2.9 percent, to $209.90 and Bank of America rose 93 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $19.95. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.64, or 3.4 percent, to $79.33. \nDOING DEALS: South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share.

Its stock jumped $22.06, or 25.2 percent, to $109.71. \nMENTORING: German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose $5.67, or 18.5 percent, to $36.35. \nDIG IT: Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.82, or 15.7 percent, to $13.48 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it's too low. Belden stock added 67 cents, or 1 percent, to $70.37. \nBONDS: Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. \nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose sharply, to 2.22 percent. Bond trading was closed Friday for the U.S. Veterans' Day holiday. The 10-year yield, which is a benchmark for interest rates on home mortgages and other kinds of loans, finished at 2.06 percent on Thursday. The day before the Nov. 8 presidential election the yield was 1.83 percent. \nCURRENCIES: The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.21 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0755 from $1.0845. \nENERGY: With the dollar gaining strength, benchmark U.S. crude fell 58 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $42.83 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 70 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $44.05 a barrel in London. \nThat pulled energy companies lower. Anadarko Petroleum fell 99 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $60.05 and Exxon Mobil lost 85 cents, or 1 percent, to $84.82. \nDIVIDEND PAYERS DIVE: Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income.

American Tower fell $4.39, or 4.2 percent, to $101.32 and Duke Energy lost 87 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $74.37. \nTRUMP FACTOR: Stocks went into a long skid as the presidential campaign came to its conclusion, but in the last few days stocks have risen as investors hope a Trump presidency will mean cutbacks in regulations that affect energy and banks, among other businesses. The Dow has reached record highs, with the biggest recent gains going to financial firms Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, machinery maker Caterpillar and drug company Merck. \nOVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and Germany's DAX added 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan's economic growth. The dollar has been particularly strong against the Japanese yen lately and that's helped the country's exporters. Most other Asian markets fell. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent. \n  : Business   : Business November 14, 2016 Last  18 PM Markets little changed in midday trading The Associated Press |  Wire Service NEW YORK - U.S. stocks are little changed Monday as technology companies like Apple and Microsoft take big losses on fears about their overseas revenue. That's canceling out huge gains for banks, which are trading higher as bond yields rise to their highest levels since January. Higher bond yields, in turn, are hurting shares of companies that pay big dividends. Energy companies are slipping with the price of oil. \nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average gained 11 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,858 as of 1:35 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1 point to 2,163. The Nasdaq composite sank 11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,226. \nTECH TROUBLES: Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Those stocks have struggled over the last few days as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. \nApple gave up $3.01, or 2.8 percent, to $105.42 while Facebook declined $2.90, or 2.4 percent, to $116.12 and Microsoft slid $1.18, or 2 percent, to $57.84. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $16.07, or 2.1 percent, to $755.68. \nBANK BONANZA: Bank stocks continued to surge, as they've done since the election. Higher bond yields point to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of President-elect Trump to lead to higher inflation. \nInvestors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Goldman Sachs made the biggest gain among Dow stocks as it rose $5.96, or 2.9 percent, to $209.90 and Bank of America rose 93 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $19.95.

      "text": "Translate \nMicrosoft let the cat out of the bag today: the software giant will launch a preview of Visual Studio for Mac at this week’s Connect conference. \nThe company posted and then pulled a MSDN Magazine article announcing the software development tool will soon be compatible with Macs. \n“At its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio. If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home,” reads the blog post. \n“Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor.” \nThe blog post went on to say that “compatibility is a key focus of Visual Studio for Mac. Although it’s a new product and doesn’t support all of the Visual Studio project types, for those it does have in common it uses the same MSBuild solution and project format. If you have team members on macOS and Windows, or switch between the two OSes yourself, you can seamlessly share your projects across platforms. There’s no need for any conversion or migration.” \nUntil recently, such a crossover would be unheard of. But, under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has changed its focus to be inclusive of all developers’ preferences. \nIt also comes at a time when Microsoft has turned its focus to the cloud and cloud technologies, which is where a lot of developers are now working.

      "title": "Major Nelson Announces Big Xbox One Black Friday Deals",
      "text": "Microsoft’s Larry “Major Nelson” Hryb announces that the company will be offering deals on the Xbox One S in the days leading up to Black Friday sales. The buildup toward the holiday season for video games will always have on predictor on the way there in the form of Black Friday sales announcements. The focus on consumers that Black Friday sales always entail ensures that gamers will be able to get a preview of holiday plans from industry giants like Microsoft and Sony, and this season promises to be an even more interesting one due to the recent releases of the Xbox One S , PS4 Slim and PS4 Pro consoles.\nMicrosoft, to its credit, has already been aggressively marketing the Xbox One S with bundles in an attempt to convince gamers to upgrade to the sleeker version of its current-gen console. Today, however, Microsoft’s Major Nelson announced that the company would be taking the next step in providing value to its customers with a number of sales on 1 TB Xbox One S systems that will be implemented in the days leading up to Black Friday.\nAccording to Major Nelson, all 1 TB Xbox One Systems will be $50 off from November 20-23, meaning deals like the Battlefield 1 and Gears of War 4 Xbox One consoles will drop as low as $300 for the first time. Other 1 TB Xbox One bundles like those themed around Halo and Madden NFL 17 will also see a drop in price, which may bolster the Xbox One’s already strong sales even more in the critical weeks leading up to the holiday season.\nAfter Microsoft’s sales, many retailers across the United States will then begin offering their own Black Friday console sales , which will span most of the Thanksgiving weekend until Cyber Monday. Microsoft has also confirmed they will be offering sales on Xbox Live Gold that will include games, television shows, and movies, with that sale slated for a November 18 start exclusively for Xbox Live Gold before eventually opening up to everyone starting on November 22.\n\nMicrosoft’s planned sales on the Xbox One S couldn’t come at a better time, and it’s not just because Black Friday is looming. The recent launch of the PS4 Pro has seen Sony’s console sales triple in the UK in just a week, and Microsoft would do well to ensure that the ground it has gained with the Xbox One S in recent months isn’t lost just before the holiday season begins in earnest.\nSource: Major Nelson (via Gamespot )\n",

      "text": "Comments 0 Advertisement \nLast week, in conjunction with the release of the November Patch Tuesday updates , Microsoft unveiled a new central location where they will begin storing all security bulletins for Microsoft products. \nIt is called the Security Update Guide and will list the monthly Security Update Release Notes and each Security Bulletin for that month. \nThe release notes and security bulletins have not changed and look just like the documents we see each month around Patch Tuesday. It is also not a sign that security bulletins are going away as some sites have reported over the last few days. \nThey are now being stored in a searchable database in a single location to make them more accessible compared to them being scattered on different sites in the past. \nAs you can see the layout is very clean and lists the Release Notes and Security Updates in separate areas with full search and filtering capabilities. \nAccording to Microsoft , this new portal will become the single source for security related bulletins in January 2017: Security update information will be published as bulletins and on the Security Updates Guide until January 2017. After the January 2017 Update Tuesday release, we will only publish update information to the Security Updates Guide. \nAs I said earlier, many sites are reporting that this last sentence means security bulletins will no longer be published but that is a misinterpretation of what the company is planning to do with this important information. By moving it all to one central location, the data will be easier to find and use instead of needing to visit different sites to track it down. \nThis security related data will also remain public as proven by the fact I reviewed this month's security information without even logging into the Security Updates Guide with a Microsoft Account. \nOne other aspect of this change is the addition of an API to help system admins and others track this information remotely: Leverage a new RESTful API to obtain Microsoft security update information. This eliminates the need for you to employ outdated methods like screen-scraping of security bulletin web pages to assemble working databases of necessary and actionable information. \nThis new centralized site and its accompanying API certainly does not indicate any attempt by Microsoft to hide or prevent users from seeing this information now or in the future. \nBut, wait...there's probably more so be sure to follow me on Twitter and Google+ .",
