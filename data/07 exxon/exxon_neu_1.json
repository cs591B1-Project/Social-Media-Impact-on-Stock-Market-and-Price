For more information visit: \nor contact Reed Kathrein, who is leading the firm’s investigation, by calling 510-725-3000 or emailing XOM@hbsslaw.com . \nSeveral financial journalists have reported that Exxon Mobil may have materially misstated its oil reserves. \nFor example, on August 19, 2016, The New York Times emphasized “Exxon Mobil [would] have to leave much of its oil in the ground, which means the company’s valuation of its reserves is off by a significant amount.” The New York Times went on to quote New York Attorney General Schneiderman who stated that, if Exxon’s internal research showed the Company knew of misstatements, “there may be massive securities fraud here.” The Wall Street Journal also quoted a retired reservoir engineer specializing in reserves accounting who stated that Exxon was “particularly reluctant to write down an asset because that removes its value permanently.” \nOn October 28, 2016, Exxon disclosed it might write down nearly 20% of its oil and gas assets if energy prices remained low through the end of 2016. That day, The New York Times reported many other petroleum companies have taken big write-offs to reflect a two-year price slump and Exxon’s potential write-downs “could be the biggest accounting revision of reserves in its history.” \n“Among other things, we’re looking at why Exxon may have chosen a different route than its peers who timely recognized impaired assets and wrote their values down,” said Hagens Berman partner Reed Kathrein. “Accounting rules are quite specific about when assets must be written down.” \nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding Exxon should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new SEC whistleblower program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.

Todd Rosenbluth of CFRA , scoured the changes made by American Funds during the recently-ended third quarter.\nManagers who wield more than $100 million in assets are required to file 13f reports with the SEC every quarter listing stocks they own, as well as the size and value of each stake.\nNotable changes, by American Funds during the three-month period ended Sept. 30 include a 28% increase in its stake in Exxon Mobil ( XOM) to 53 million shares. Also, the firm increased stakes in the oil patch equipment and services companies Schlumberger ( SLB ) and Halliburton ( HAL ) by 16% and 11%, respectively, in the September quarter.\nTechnology is American Funds largest sector. The firm raised its stake in Apple ( AAPL ) by 28% to 62 million, while its position in Intel ( INTC ) rose 7.7%.\nHowever, American Funds trimmed its position in Texas Instruments ( TXN ) by 7.7% to 162 million. The firm also lowered the share count for Costco Wholesale ( COST ), Kroger ( KR ) and Philip Morris International ( PM ), by 16%, 23% and 7.8%, respectively.",

Foti, Jr., remind investors that they have   file lead plaintiff applications in a securities class action lawsuit against Exxon Mobil Corporation ( XOM ) , if they purchased the Company's securities   \"Class Period\"). This action is pending   Texas. What You May Do If you purchased shares of Exxon and would like to discuss your legal rights and how this case might affect you and your right to recover for your economic loss, you may, without   call toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or email KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn ( ). If you wish to serve as a lead plaintiff in this class action, you must petition the Court by January 6, 2017 . About the Lawsuit Exxon and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws. The alleged false and misleading statements and omissions include, but are not limited to, that: (i) Exxon's internal reports   change; (ii) because of these risks, Exxon would not be able to extract its claimed existing hydrocarbon reserves and, therefore, a material portion should have been written down; and (iii) Exxon employed an inaccurate \"price of carbon\" -- the cost of regulations such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system -- in evaluating its future oil and gas prospects to materially overstate the value of its reserves. About Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC KSF, whose partners include the Former Louisiana Attorney General Charles C. Foti, Jr., is a law firm focused on securities, antitrust and consumer class actions, along with merger & acquisition and breach of fiduciary litigation against publicly traded companies on behalf of shareholders.

Advertisement \nIn court filings, the oil company accuses Healey and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman of taking politically motivated actions intended to force the company into complying with their preferred policies on climate change. \n\"The investigations launched by Attorneys General Schneiderman and Healey amount to nothing more than an unlawful exercise of government power to further political objectives,\" Exxon's attorneys write in a Nov. 10 amended complaint. \"The shifting justifications they have presented for their investigations are pretexts that have become more and more transparent over time.\" \nExxon also argues that some of the requests in Healey's civil investigative demand \"appear to target groups simply because they hold views with which Attorney General Healey disagrees.\" \nHealey on Monday denied that her investigation into Exxon was political in nature. \n\"Our position in this litigation is that the authorities in Texas, and specifically the federal court down there, has no jurisdiction over state attorneys general and the work of their offices, and it's been disappointing to see Exxon fight requests for basic information,\" she said. \"Our jobs as attorneys general is to be able to ask questions and when we become aware of instances of potential fraud -- potential fraud on consumers -- it's our job to be able to ask questions, ask companies for information and have companies produce that information.\" \nAsked if she planned to go to Texas for the deposition, Healey said, \"No, I don't, and we'll take it up on appeal.\" \n\"We're vigorously opposing any order to testify or submit to discovery,\" she said. \nIn his order, Kinkeade also advised Schneiderman to be available to give a deposition on Dec. 13. \nHealey said she has not spoken to Schneiderman about the deposition order.",

January gasoline futures jumped as much as 0.75 percent late on Tuesday.\nExxon said the fire was extinguished around 4 p.m. (2200 GMT) and the company had accounted for all staff at the refinery.\nBaton Rouge General Hospital said four people in critical condition were admitted to the regional burn unit, a hospital spokeswoman said.\nThe fire broke out at an 18,750-bpd alyklation unit, which produces high-octane gasoline components, as five people prepared to restart it following repair work, sources familiar with the plant’s operations said.\nA compressor blew out during the restart attempt, the sources said, setting off the blaze.\nTwo operators and two contractors were injured, the sources said. The two operators are women.\nAn Exxon spokesman said details of the fire were under investigation.\nThe refinery is the fourth-largest in the United States, with capacity to refine 502,500 bpd in crude oil.\nThe Baton Rouge plant was hit by flooding in August, forcing Exxon to shut down one of the crude processing units and curtail output at another. The plant returned to normal output in September.",

      "text": "November 25, 2016 4:30am Comments Share: DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \nResearch and Markets has announced the addition of the \"Global Oil Refining Market Outlook - Market Analysis by Geography, By Refinery Complexity (Topping, Hydroskimming, Cracking, Coking), Competitive Landscape, Key Company Information - Growth Trends and Forecasts (2015-2020)\" report to their offering. \nThe global energy demand is predicted to grow by 50% - 60% in the coming 15 years. This growth in demand is a result of increasing world population and an improvement in living standards in developing countries. Even though new and renewable energy sources are gaining popularity around the world, petroleum fuels still remain the major energy source the world over. This trend is expected to continue for the next few decades, and will have all sectors of the petroleum industry as its beneficiaries. \nThe oil that is extracted from the earth undergoes a number of processes that transforms the crude oil into various useful products such as petrol, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene etc. These processes are carried out by refineries having varying degrees of complexity. Refineries are classified as topping, hydroskimming, cracking and coking refineries based on their complexity. Refining forms a major activity of the downstream petroleum industry. \nThe refining industry has been affected by falling crude oil prices. Players in the Asian and European markets are seeing higher margins while the North American players are seeing a reduction in their margins. The transportation industry, which is the biggest consumer of oil worldwide is witnessing a growth, especially in developing countries like China and India. \nSome of the key players in this market are Exxon Mobil Corporation, Shell, Sinopec, BP and Saudi Aramco. \nReport Structure:",

      "text": "Did a Texas judge abuse his power in a case for Exxon? Massachusetts thinks so Filed under Energy at Get Daily Dallas News Headlines Sign Up Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nA federal judge in Texas was accused by Massachusetts of abusing his discretion to help Exxon Mobil Corp. in a fight over whether it misled investors about the financial impact of climate change. \nU.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade set a \"troubling precedent\" by ordering Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to be questioned under oath by Exxon's lawyers, allowing the target of a state probe to \"investigate the investigator,\" her lawyer said in a filing in federal court in Dallas. \nExxon, based in Irving, Texas, sued Healey in its home state in June to block the probe, claiming it was politically motivated. Kinkeade, before ruling on Healey's request to dismiss the lawsuit, ordered her to appear in Dallas on Dec. 13 for the questioning, even though Exxon proposed the deposition be carried out in Boston, where she's based. Fort Worth judge questions prosecutor's 'bad faith' pursuit of Exxon Mobil climate science \nMassachusetts is one of several states investigating whether Exxon misled investors for years about the projected long-term impact of climate change on its businesses, as well as whether Exxon has properly written down the value of its reserves following a global collapse in prices. \n\"The court has made errors of law and abused its discretion,\" Healey's Texas lawyer, Douglas Cawley, said in the filing. \"Allowing discovery to go forward here would set a troubling precedent by allowing the target of a state-government investigation to confound and effectively halt\" the probe. \nDeceptive Acts \nHealey issued the subpoena in April, based on her \"belief that Exxon has engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices that have harmed Massachusetts investors and consumers,\" according to the filing. Her views are based \"principally Exxon's own documents and statements,\" she said. \nExxon said on Oct. 28 that it \"anticipates it will need to make the largest ever write down of the valuation of its fossil fuel reserves in the history of the company,\" according to Healey's filing. Exxon shareholders sued the company in response. \nHealey compared the dispute with Google Inc.'s lawsuit to block a subpoena by Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood in a probe over illegal online content. A federal appeals court in April rejected Google's challenge, ruling it was premature because Hood hadn't yet asked a state court to enforce the subpoena. \n\"We still, in response to our civil investigation demand, have not received one document from Exxon, and yet Exxon is going after the attorney general's entire thought process,\" Healey's lawyers have said. \nHealey Meeting \nKinkeade said in an earlier ruling that he was concerned by Healey's meeting with an environmental activist and attorneys general from other states a day before New York announced a joint plan to pursue Exxon. Her actions raised questions about whether she prejudged the investigation, Kinkeade said. \nThe court-ordered deposition of Healey is a result of Kinkead's finding that the probe may have been initiated in bad faith, Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon, said Monday in a statement. \n\"We have no choice but to defend ourselves against politically motivated investigations that are biased, in bad faith and without legal merit,\" Jeffers said. \nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is running a parallel investigation into Exxon, was added to the company's lawsuit in Dallas and is fighting to avoid being deposed. Kinkeade, in an earlier ruling, advised Schneiderman also to appear in Dallas on Dec. 13. \nThe states are investigating whether Exxon violated securities laws and consumer-protection rules by withholding from investors information allegedly obtained as early as the 1970s that man-made emissions were changing the climate and may impact its businesses. Exxon has denied the allegations, saying the valuation of its assets meets all legal standards. \nThe case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Healey, 16-cv-00469, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas (Fort Worth). \n(Updates with Google comparison in eighth paragraph.) \nTo contact the reporter on this story: Erik Larson in New York at elarson4@bloomberg.net.

      "text": "EXXON SHAREHOLDER ALERT BY FORMER LOUISIANA ATTORNEY GENERAL: Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC Reminds Investors with Losses in Excess of $100,000 of Lead Plaintiff Deadline in Class Action Lawsuit Against Exxon Mobil Corporation - XOM   22:07   NEW ORLEANS   Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC (\"KSF\") and KSF partner, the former Attorney General of Louisiana , Charles C. Foti, Jr. , remind investors that they have until January 6, 2017 to file lead plaintiff applications in a securities class action lawsuit against Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM ), if they purchased the Company's securities between February 19, 2016 and October 27, 2016 , inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). This action is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas . What You May Do If you purchased securities of Exxon and would like to discuss your legal rights and how this case might affect you and your right to recover for your economic loss, you may, without obligation or cost to you, call toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or email KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn (). If you wish to serve as a lead plaintiff in this class action, you must petition the Court by January 6, 2017 . About the Lawsuit Exxon and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws. The alleged false and misleading statements and omissions include, but are not limited to, that: (i) Exxon's internal reports recognized the environmental risks caused by global warming and climate change; (ii) because of these risks, Exxon would not be able to extract its claimed existing hydrocarbon reserves and, therefore, a material portion should have been written down; and (iii) Exxon employed an inaccurate \"price of carbon\" – the cost of regulations such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system – in evaluating its future oil and gas prospects to materially overstate the value of its reserves. About Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC KSF, whose partners include the Former Louisiana Attorney General Charles C. Foti, Jr. , is a law firm focused on securities, antitrust and consumer class actions, along with merger & acquisition and breach of fiduciary litigation against publicly traded companies on behalf of shareholders. The firm has offices in New York , California and Louisiana . To learn more about KSF, you may visit www.ksfcounsel.com . Contact:",

      "text": "Democrats and their progressive allies see a tiny upside to the possibility that President-elect Donald Trump will nominate Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of State. They’d finally get their chance to grill the oil executive under oath. \n \nLiberal hopes of forcing Tillerson to testify before Congress were dashed Nov. 8 when Republicans maintained control of the Senate and easily held onto the House. But they're already eyeing Tillerson's potential confirmation hearing as an opportunity to quiz him on whether the oil giant suppressed decades-old internal research about the threat of climate change, as the company's critics have charged.\nDemocrats might not have the clout to kill his nomination, but they could use the hearing to spotlight the Trump administration’s denial of climate change — and ambush Tillerson on questions that he and Exxon have managed to avoid until now.\n\"Everything is on the table when it comes to [Tillerson] testifying under oath,\" a Senate Democratic aide told POLITICO, adding that he'd \"absolutely get those questions. The fact that they’re not cognizant of that being an issue ... shows a kind of tone deafness to what they’re facing here.”\nExxon, one of the biggest companies in the world, is facing a barrage of criticism from progressives related to a series of investigative reports that allege the company has known for decades that fossil fuels exacerbate climate change. Two state attorneys general — New York's Eric Schneiderman and Massachusetts' Maura Healey — have launched fraud investigations into whether Exxon downplayed the threat of climate change to its business. \nPresidential Transition \nDemocrats to give Trump Cabinet picks the Garland treatment By Burgess Everett and Elana Schor \nExxon has aggressively fought the allegations in court, calling the investigations politically motivated and a violation of the company's free speech. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment for this story. \nEnvironmental activists believe they could also use the confirmation hearings to rally support for tackling climate change and to bash Tillerson, who has long been their No. 1 enemy in the fight against fossil fuels.\n\"[Trump] is handing us campaign opportunities,\" said Jamie Henn, the co-founder of the environmental group 350.org.\nAnd they warn of severe backlash to the pick. \n\"There are plenty of other candidates for secretary of State who don’t bring that kind of baggage to the table and would not engender that kind of firestorm at confirmation hearings,\" said Peter Frumhoff, director of science and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"Of the candidates I’ve seen, none would fare worse than Rex Tillerson.”\nPotential confirmation hearings could also make for an awkward contrast between Trump and Exxon, which has sought to highlight its environmental credentials in recent years. The company says it supports a tax on carbon emissions and has praised the Paris climate agreement. Trump, in contrast, has called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese and has promised to pull out of the Paris deal. \nTillerson became Exxon's CEO in 2006 after decades with the company. He is expected to step down in coming months because he'll reach Exxon's mandatory retirement age of 65 in March. Exxon veteran Darren Woods is expected to replace him.\nPresidential transition \nGOP wagers Americans don’t care about Trump’s conflicts By Darren Samuelsohn \nHe has a long history in the oil industry that Democrats and environmentalists would be certain to mine ahead of any confirmation hearing. Tillerson, for example, has worked extensively in Russia and the company has long done business in that country. But so far, Trump's transition team has barely vetted Tillerson. \nOil industry officials said they aren't worried about the prospect of Tillerson being tapped for secretary of State, arguing the massive company would soldier on without him. And many in the industry view his nomination as a long-shot. \n\"Exxon is a machine so I doubt it would create a hole for the industry, or the company,\" one industry official said.\nIt's unlikely that Tillerson's nomination would face major roadblocks in the Senate. But the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which would approve the nomination, is expected to have 10 Republicans and nine Democrats come January, a breakdown that could complicate Tillerson's nomination if any Republicans announce their opposition.\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a member of the committee, has flexed his muscle in recent weeks, signaling his opposition to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and John Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United States. A Paul spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about Tillerson.\nDemocrats on the committee like Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) are expected to focus on Exxon' record on climate change during the potential hearings. Markey and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who is not on the committee, have made Exxon a regular fixture in floor speeches and press conferences. Markey's spokesman did not respond to a request for comment and Whitehouse's spokesman declined to comment. A spokesman for Sen. Ben Cardin , the top Democrat on the panel, also declined to comment. \nTillerson's nomination would likely win approval unless there was a swell of opposition from Republicans, thanks to a 2013 rules change that allows senators to approve most nominations with a simple majority vote. \nOne lobbyist put it this way: \"No doubt that Whitehouse and Markey would be in full battle dress for this one but thanks to the rules change they voted for, [there's] not much they could do — even if the nominee was Donald Duck.\"",

In doing so, it quotes Exxon’s own attorneys’ acknowledgments of the legitimacy of NYAG’s investigation during a recent appearance in NY Court. “The NY AG has ‘the right to conduct this investigation’” (MTD, p.5 quoting Exxon attorney). \nRecently, in a related proceeding, a New York State Court ordered Exxon to comply with two subpoenas issued by NYAG in furtherance of the investigation. \nThe NYAG’s Motion to Dismiss cites binding legal precedent—including case law from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and United States Supreme Court—to demonstrate why Exxon’s lawsuit should be dismissed. \nThe NYAG’s Motion to Quash cites similar precedent to demonstrate that permitting discovery of the NYAG by Exxon would undermine the integrity of an ongoing law enforcement investigation, (“As former United State Attorney General Robert Jackson put it: ‘Counsel for a defendant or a prospective defendant, could have no greater help than to know how much or how little information the Government has, and what witnesses or sources of information it can rely upon.’” (MTQ, p.2). \nThe Motion to Dismiss can be found here . \nThe Motion to Quash can be found here .
