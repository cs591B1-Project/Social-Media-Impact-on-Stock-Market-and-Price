      "text": "The Final Auto-Lacing Nike Mag Sold for $200,000 More money raised to fight Parkinson's. By Brandon Richard \nThe main round of auto-lacing Nike Mag auctions raised a reported $6.75 million for Parkinson's research. Last night, Nike and the Michael J. Fox foundation were able to push that number even higher. \nAt the foundation's annual gala, Nike Mag designer Tinker Hatfield and Senior Innovator Tiffany Beers were in attendance to not only show their support for their friend Michael J. Fox, but to auction off the final pair of Mags. By night's end, the highly coveted sneakers originally worn by Fox's character Marty McFly in Back to the Future II went for a whopping $200,000 — the most paid for a pair of Mags to date. \nThose who missed out on Mags will have another chance at auto-lacing sneakers soon. The Nike HyperAdapt is expected to release later this month. Watch Now ",

And so we give you ICYMI, a curated recount of the need-to-know stories to keep you up to date. New releases, colourways and industry chatter – it’s all here. ICYMI: The Sneaker Week in Review – November 14 \nThe Nike Air Max 2017 is Released \nIt wasn’t that long ago that images of the Nike Air Max 2017 first appeared online. After a seemingly short lead-up, the latest heir to the Air throne is out on the streets and available worldwide. The futuristic sneaker features a Flymesh upper with concentric padded circles all atop an extra generous full-length Max Air unit. Head to Nike.com – or select retailers including END. – to snare a pair now. ICYMI: The Sneaker Week in Review – November 14 \nRonnie Fieg Announces 50th ASICS Colab \nWhen Ronnie Fieg and ASICS first collaborated way back in 2007, who would have known that the partnership would evolve to be one of the most fruitful and enduring in the game? Ronnie recently began posting an archival recap of the sneakers on his Instagram followed by the announcement that the duo would be dropping their 50th collaborative shoe. We’re expecting that the milestone will be marked in celebratory style with something extra special. ICYMI: The Sneaker Week in Review – November 14 \nPalace x adidas Indoor Pack Drops \nPalace Skateboards released their third colab with adidas for the year. The Palace x adidas Indoor Pack is a low-profile court shoe that gives a nod to both adidas’ football heritage and the UK brand’s love for soccer related silhouettes. The sneaker features a perforated toe, ‘accurate sewing’ and ‘Boost in the back, boss’. It sold out immediately on the Palace website, best to check the ‘Bay if you missed the drop. ICYMI: The Sneaker Week in Review – November 14 \nNike Debut Air Force 1 NYC Pack \nNew York and Nike Air Force 1s are inextricably linked. To celebrate the launch of a brand new flag-ship store in Soho, Nike decked the iconic court silhouette in a selection of treatments paying homage to the Big Apple. The pack featured a return of a classic in all white leather with bright orange and blue accents joined by two limited edition laser-etched versions and was available exclusively at the store. ICYMI: The Sneaker Week in Review – November 14 \nNike Introduces the LunarCharge \nContinuing the new Nike announcements, this week saw our first look at the newest Swoosh silhouette: the LunarCharge . The hybrid sneaker looks a little like an Air Current and masterfully mixes parts from the Nike armoury including neoprene from the Air Flow, eyelets from the Air Max 90, an internal bootie from the Air Presto and a laser-siped sole from the LunarEpic. The LunarCharge drops on November 18. Get ready. ICYMI: The Sneaker Week in Review – November 14 \nThe Parley x adidas UltraBOOST Uncaged Will Release in Large Numbers \nTo round out the week with some good news – the Parley x adidas UltraBOOST Uncaged will be the first of the ongoing eco colab to go into mass-production. The sneaker features an upper constructed from waste-reducing Parley Ocean Plastic, woven together using innovative Tailored Fibre Technology produced from a recycled combination of plastics collected in coastal areas of the Maldives, together with illegal deep-sea gillnets. The next round will see 7000 pairs produced initially, with adidas aiming to produce one million pairs by the end of 2017. ICYMI: The Sneaker Week in Review – November 14",

Headlines were made when the first pair fetched over $100k in Hong Kong, but the third auction has raked in double that. A huge $200k is reported to have been thrown down at the New York city event. A number that reflects the resources pooled by the celebrity gala, but nonetheless one big enough to cause a dint in anyone’s pocket. \n\nThe philanthropic auction winner is yet to come forward, though we’re sure they’ll be sleeping easy knowing their money is being well spent.",

We’ve just received our first look at the sneaker on-foot from Titolo and it looks every bit as good as you’d expect. The Nike LunarCharge drops worldwide at select Nike retailers on November 18. Previous Next \nUPDATE: Nike’s new kid on the block, the LunarCharge, has been turning heads all over cyberspace – and now it’s time to take a closer look. The mashup is looking just as good from every angle, we can’t wait to see how they go on foot. Previous Next \nIt’s not every day that the folks at Beaverton announce they’ve got a new creation coming to stores. What you’re looking at is the newest Swoosh silhouette: the LunarCharge. \nJust like a good DJ – Nike have presented a mix that’s familiar enough, but foreign enough to be intriguing. They’ve done so by building a shoe from a medley of greatest hits. The LunarCharge boasts Neoprene from the Air Flow , eyelets from the Air Max 90 , an internal bootie from the Air Presto and a laser-siped sole from the LunarEpic . Everything is then bundled up into a package informed by the Air Current to produce a banger that’ll make you want to get up and move. \nThe Nike LunarCharge is set to release from select Nike stockists on November 18. \nMore Nike",

The shoe is a nod to the boxes of the Nike SBs of the early 2000s by plastering pink all over a leather upper, and punctuating it with thick streaks of black. White accents show on the midsole and laces, and the shoe’s leather has also been treated with 3M to come to life under light. \nAnyone wanting to grab the ‘Pink Box’ Nike SB Dunk Lows will need to keep an eye on NDC when they release on November 25.",

But the members of the Barron’s Roundtable are another story this year. For the most part, the investment ideas they shared when the Roundtable met Jan. 11 in New York have performed nicely and then some, compared with the Dow Jones industrials and Standard & Poor’s 500 index.

      "text": "\nIt’s been an enormous few days for Ronaldo, as he’s signed mega-contracts with Real Madrid and Nike.\n\n\nStarting with his club side, Cristiano has agreed to stay with Los Blancos until 2021, at which point he’ll be 36.\n\nThe Sunday Times detail that Ronaldo’s new salary with a ‘basic’ wage of €48m per year. However, with “performance-related bonuses on top, he expects to gross more than €50m a year from his new deal.”\n\nHowever, that’s peanuts compared to the new Nike deal, which could see Ronaldo out-earn NBA heavyweight Michael Jordan.\n\nIn an almost unique move, Nike have agreed a “lifetime” partnership with Ronaldo.\n\nHe is just the third athlete to sign a lifetime deal with Nike, joining LeBron James and Michael Jordan.\n\nRonaldo’s new deal with Nike will reportedly pay him $24 million per year for the rest of his life.\n\nAt that rate, the deal will reach $1 billion in total value when Ronaldo is 73 years old.\n\nThe Sunday Times also report how Nike are hoping Ronaldo will be even bigger than MJ:\n\nThe long-term aim of the partnership is to surpass the revenue achieved by Nike from the company’s pioneering lifetime agreement with Michael Jordan.\n\nBoth parties believe that football’s greater global popularity, coupled with Ronaldo’s status as the planet’s most followed sportsman on social media, can generate unprecedented sales of Nike products.

      "text": "How Nike lost Curry to Under Armour \nJM: There have been reports you are frustrated that (Knicks coach) Jeff Hornacek isn't employing the triangle offense enough. Is that the case? \nPJ: No. But when they run it I want them to run it the right way. If you are going to do it, use your skills and run it the right way. I'm not frustrated at all. Derrick Rose missed three weeks of training camp (because of a civil trial). It's totally understandable where we are as a ballclub. We have guards that do a lot of stuff off the dribble. I want them to understand they can do things off the pass. It has to be a combination. \nJM: Can the triangle still be effective in today's game, which has gone the \"space and pace\" route? \nPJ: If you want to learn the fundamentals of the game, you don't bypass any of the basics, like how to make a post pass, how to set up a screen, what pivots you can use to escape pressure and force defenses to react. What are the passing lanes? You have to acknowledge that. You have five players on the floor. If you are going to drive you have to know where players will be on the court. If you are going to make a pass you need space between players and have a certain amount of lanes open. Appropriate space between players is 12-to-16 feet. Eighteen-to-20 feet is a little long to make an appropriate pass. We've extended that to create long lanes to allow players to roll to the basket and stretch the floor. \nJM: So, is it safe to say the Knicks will not be a \"space and pace\" team any time soon? \nPJ: It's my feeling when everybody does the same damn thing it becomes, 'Who has the best Rolls Royce? Who has the best, fastest stock car in this race we are running?' So if you have LeBron, wow, we're going to do the same thing even though we don't have the Rolls Royce? You have to be unique. You have to have something no one else is doing to have genius in this game. It becomes an ownership. I don't care about the triangle. I care about systematically playing basketball. If the spacing isn't right, if guys are standing on top of each other, if there aren't lanes to be provided, or rebounders available to offensively rebound the ball, or we don't have defensive balance when a shot goes up, all of these things are fundamental basketball. I follow it. I'm not railing, 'This is inadequate' or 'This isn't right.' Just show me what will work. Are we running around for no reason? Can we hit the first cutter? Do we have the ability to hit the second option or are we just bypassing plays so someone can hit a 3-point shot? It doesn't make sense to me. \nJM: Which NBA teams impress you? \nPJ: It's obvious Golden State plays a game in which people move the ball, they move themselves, they are creating passing lanes, they get penetration, they hit the open man, they set picks. They get a little wild, but Steve (Kerr) does a really fine job of keeping everyone in their lanes, so to speak. He's a really fine coach with a great command of the game. That \"feel\" for basketball is so important. \n\"I don't care about the triangle. I care about systematically playing basketball.\" Phil Jackson \nJM: What other teams do you like? \nPJ: Cleveland has really gotten better about playing together as a team. They have shown much more resilience defensively and are taking responsibility on the defensive end. The ball still gets stuck. Not everyone has a purpose. They have a role, but they might not feel like they are involved and I like to see all five players being involved in the game. \nSan Antonio continues to do what they do best, running their system, which incorporates a lot of things I believe in, things Pop and I have struggled with each other over for a few years. \nJM: So what is your relationship with Popovich like? \nPJ: We have no animosity. We just played against each other so many times. One time he just stuck guys in the corner and ran the twin towers and that was it. But they've evolved so much. I like the way his teams play. He's using a lot of triangle stuff, a lot of pinch post stuff. It works. \nJM: If you ran into Popovich on the street, what would you say? \nPJ: Where are we gonna have a glass of wine? I have great respect for his ability as a coach and how he keeps his players playing at a very high level. Pat Riley made the move from championship coach to front office executive long before Jackson. Victor Baldizon/NBA/Getty Images \nJM: You, Popovich and Pat Riley are the most decorated coaches of your generation. What separates Riley? \nPJ: Pat has a terrific sense of what he wants to do. Now that I'm president, I have to read all this stuff about the league. Usually it's 'delete, delete, delete.' But I noticed there was something about D-Wade (Dwyane Wade) and Pat's communication breaking down the other day. I wondered about that. I found it surprising. \nJM: It all started when LeBron left, right? Could you have ever imagined Earvin Johnson leaving Riley, or Michael Jordan leaving you? \nPJ: It had to hurt when they lost LeBron. That was definitely a slap in the face. But there were a lot of little things that came out of that. When LeBron was playing with the Heat, they went to Cleveland and he wanted to spend the night. They don't do overnights. Teams just don't. So now (coach Erik) Spoelstra has to text Riley and say, 'What do I do in this situation?' And Pat, who has iron-fist rules, answers, 'You are on the plane, you are with this team.' You can't hold up the whole team because you and your mom and your posse want to spend an extra night in Cleveland. \nI always thought Pat had this really nice vibe with his guys. But something happened there where it broke down. I do know LeBron likes special treatment. He needs things his way. \nJM: You traded for Derrick Rose, which was a gamble. What was your thinking behind it? \nPJ: Mike Conley was the best choice as a free agent, but he's making $30 million a year. That's almost insane. We saw that was going to happen. We had the opportunity to play with Derrick and see if he does have enough left in the tank -- he's 27 years old -- before we have to get into that (free) agent market again. It gave us an opportunity to build a team around him, Carmelo and Kris (Porzingis). \nAnd, having experiences with Joakim (Noah) over the years, not only as a player with talent, but a guy who showed up at my door in Montana, he knows Derrick and he knows how to play with him. It gives us an advantage. Both are coming back into playing form. \nJM: When you say \"coming back into playing form,\" do you feel, as other NBA observers have noted, that Rose and Noah logged too many minutes in Chicago? \nPJ: I've watched Luol Deng's career very closely. He played (among) the most minutes in the league in 2013 (Deng was 13th) and you remember what happened to him in the playoffs. They thought he had spinal meningitis. ( Editor's note: Deng had a spinal tap to test for meningitis that proved to be negative, but spinal fluid leaked into his body and he missed the remainder of the postseason ). It was weird. He got completely depleted, and there was a notion that went along with that; the excess playing time might not have been necessary. I think players get that back again but in a different format. They may not get back to 95 percent but they can be 90 percent with the knowledge of how to play, which gives them an advantage to know when to turn it on. \nJM: Rose is a former MVP, but he is prone to posting a bunch of 7-for-17 games. How do you reconcile that? \nPJ: Most of Derrick's misses aren't jumpers. They are going to the basket -- penetration -- which is really important to have on any team. People are challenging him, which means Joakim and others following him are going to get offensive rebounds, second-chance points. So you understand his shooting percentage isn't going to be all that high, but his penetration is going to create opportunities for others. \nJM: You mentioned you want your guards to create not just off the dribble but also to off the pass. Do you worry Kristaps Porzingis is getting lost in the offense sometimes? \nPJ: Kris is going to shine because he's just that good. What I really want to see him do is develop his game. He's an exceptional shooter and his size is unique. It changes the game in many ways. But he needs to learn how to use his size appropriately in different ways because teams will switch and defend with smaller players. With his back to the basket, he hasn't learned how to do all the positioning and to hold his space. He needs to catch and shoot without bringing the ball down in an area where smaller players can grab it. \nJM: Is he strong enough to play in the post? \nPJ: He's strong enough. Finding a base is always a point of view in the game. Having Pau Gasol for so many years, having long players that don't have a base are what we call 'high cut' players that can get run off the post. The league has allowed more and more of that to be exploited. In the past they had rules about just shoving a guy off the post. Shaq (O'Neal) and (Hakeem) Olajuwon could hold it; everyone else just got run out. \nThe European game is high screen and roll with a double high screen, so Kris hasn't been in the post much. He's got to learn switches, mismatches, when to make the pass, to keep the ball high -- (Dirk) Nowitzki-type things. He's got a great mind, a great learner's mentality, so we're lucky.'' \nJM: What have your learned about Carmelo Anthony since you got here? \nPJ: Carmelo likes communication. He likes a relationship. I was with a number of players who were fine with a player-coach relationship, which involved support, 'How are you feeling?' that kind of stuff. Shaq, Kobe, that's all they wanted or needed. They were busy. I was never the guy who said, 'Let's go out to dinner.' But with Melo, I do that. Not as much as I'd like, but we do it, because he likes that part of it. \nJM: What do you talk about? \nPJ: I do like his activism, his willingness to be an activist. I communicate with him on how to couch activism. My feeling is it can be abrasive if it's not done the right way, but it has to be somewhat abrasive if it's going to be activism. In some ways, it has become vogue to be an activist -- that's true. \nI told Carmelo about how Snoop Dogg, who I know from L.A., approached it in his community. He went to the police graduations in L.A. and spoke to the cadets, which is where the rubber meets the road in our lives. It's not just simply about color and race. It's about the atmosphere in the community. I feel Carmelo could have a reasonable voice in that way. I'm not here to lead him down the road. I'm just here to add some suggestions. \n\"I always thought Pat had this really nice vibe with his guys. But something happened there where it broke down. I do know LeBron likes special treatment. He needs things his way.\" Phil Jackson, on Pat Riley and LeBron James \nJM: What drew you to Jeff Hornacek? \nPJ: He has a learner's mind. I followed this guy since he went to Iowa State. When he came to the pros I wondered, 'Would he have enough athletic talent?' He found a way. He's adaptable. He's also very competitive. I like the way he talks to young players. It's become so restrictive on how much of an intrusion a coaching staff can be in the players' lives. There has to be so many days off, and so many days for players' association meetings and community appearances. \nThese players are spending a lot of time doing things that aren't basketball related. As a result, to take a half hour to teach mindfulness, or to study the mental approach to the game has become almost superfluous. Jeff does yoga with the players, tries to approach it as a holistic thing. I give him credit for it. \nJM: You have an opt-out clause in your contract after this season. Do you plan to exercise it? \nPJ: I have not entertained that. I'm looking for this Knicks team to get back into a situation where they are competitive. Do I have to win a championship before I feel I've done the job I've been asked to do, which is to bring this group back to that competitive level? No, I don't. We're starting to make progress. I like a lot of the things we are doing here. But we've got more to do. \nJM: Lakers executive vice president of basketball operations Jim Buss said if the Lakers didn't make it to the Western Conference finals by 2017, he would step down. It's unlikely the Lakers will meet that goal. Why not go back and run your old team? \nPJ: They're moving forward in the right direction. Luke (Walton) has them engaged, Brian (Shaw) is an associate head coach; they have a core group of guys that will get it done. It was never important to me to go back and be a part of that. Especially not now. I have this job, this commitment. \nJM: Then why bother to include the opt-out clause? \nPJ: The real issue with the opt out was simply my rationale regarding the (potential) lockout. If it was going to happen in December and everybody chose to walk away, there was no way I was going to sit in New York for three, four months when I didn't have a job, because (the players) aren't even allowed to show up to work. So, in that case, I would go back to L.A. \nJM: You are in a bi-coastal relationship with Lakers president and part-owner Jeanie Buss. How difficult has it been to be apart? \nPJ: It's hard. Very hard. It's hard to keep a house out there. I've got eight grandchildren in the Bay Area. FaceTime has really helped me. \nJM: So where's home? \nPJ: My accountant tells me I can't be a California resident anymore. I spend too much of my time in New York.",

      "text": "Nike Football continues to update its inventory, as it now unveils the latest edition of the Nike Tech Craft boot collection this season. \nFeaturing the Mercurial , Hypervenom , Magista and Tiempo silhouettes, the aesthetic consists of an all-black upper and a striking silver Swoosh on each pair. The new pack continues to incorporate Nike’s premium Algeria leather, although, it’s been updated with a subtle and intricate embossing pattern for an even softer feel and responsive touch. \nIn addition, Nike All Conditions Control (ACC) technology is applied to enhance ball control in both dry and wet conditions. The high-cut silhouettes of the range feature Flyknit Dynamic Fit collars, while the Flyknit layer used throughout the rest of the boot has been removed for a more traditional leather structure. This change gives the material the ability to mold to the foot and provide its most natural leather touch.\nYou can purchase your favorite pair from the line in cleated and NikeFootballX versions at select Nike retailers starting Thursday, November 17th.\nh/t: Nike \nAuthor’s Take \nThe post Nike Football Introduces New Tech Craft Collection appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

The Timberwolves young star – as he’s done all season – wore the adidas Crazy Explosive as he dropped a career-high 47 points against the Los Angeles Lakers. Also having a big game in adidas’ premier basketball silhouette was Kenneth Faried of the Nuggets as he went in for 18 points and 14 rebounds against the Blazers. \nOut in Cleveland, LeBron James benched his Nike Zoom LeBron Soldier X for the evening and went with the Nike LeBron 13 Elite, while teammate Kyrie Irving brought out a black/gum pair of his Nike Kyrie 2. In the same game, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist of the Hornets wore a fresh pair of the Jordan Super.Fly while Frank Kaminsky went with the “Hornets” Air Jordan XXXI PE which Kemba Walker debuted earlier this year. \nMake sure to catch up on last’s night sneaker action around the League with the gallery up top.

      "text": "\nFollowing the reveal of its official release date back in September, Nike's Hyperadapt 1.0 model now has an official price tag. The self-lacing silhouette will run you $1,000 USD and will release in three colorway options of Deep Black, Crisp White and Smooth Grey. Not your typical pricing for a pair of sneakers, the news follows the final auction for the $200,000 USD Nike Mag which incorporates the same power lacing system as the Swoosh's Hyperadapt 1.0.\nIt's safe to say that stepping into the future will cost you a pretty penny when the Nike Hyperadapt 1.0 will officially launch on November 28 in the three aforementioned colorways. Will you be adding the upcoming silhouette to your personal collection?\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "Visit the original post to see all 3 images from this gallery. \nNike has announced the price of its highly anticipated self-lacing sneaker, the Hyperadapt 1.0, but fans expecting something reasonably affordable might be left disappointed. The Swoosh says it will begin selling the shoe by appointment only on November 28 for a price of $1,000.\nThe price seems steep but it’s a brand new technology (despite the fact we’ve waited almost 30 years for self-lacing sneakers since they debuted in Back to the Future Part II in 1989) which only recently became reality thanks to the Nike Mag earlier this year.\nPresumably shoes like these use parts which Nike has only just begun manufacturing, but hopefully as they become cheaper to produce, we’ll see self-lacing sneakers at the other end of the market. For now, this is what you’d be getting if you’re willing to part with your $1,000 bucks:\n\nAccording to Nike, when you step in to the shoe your heel will hit a sensor and a high-tech mini-motor will automatically tighten the shoe. Then there are two buttons on the side; one to tighten and one to loosen. You simply adjust it until it’s the perfect fit.\nIs the price justified? Let us know in the comments below.\nIn other sneaker news, Nike SB’s new Dunk Low is inspired by its iconic 2005 pink shoebox.\n \n",

      "text": "A new Nike store is up and running in New York City, and this one is very much different when compared to other Nike stores. ( Nike ) Advertisement \nNike opened a new store in New York City not too long ago, and it's not just a regular Nike store, for this one is filled with technology. It is not surprising when we consider the fact that Nike has dabbled in the technology field several times in the past. \nThe location of the New York store is in a neighborhood called SoHo, which is where some of the biggest brands have their shops situated. Adidas , Apple, and Google. We understand the size of the store is around five-stories tall with 55,000-square-foot space filled with all different time of technologies. \nThe Engadget guys visited the store, and from the images taken , it comes off as a great place to shop for footwear and other sports-related cosmetics. Will This Nike Store Be Selling Tech \nNo, it won't. According to a report from the company, it's all about improving the shopping experience. Whenever folks enter the store, they'll come across 3D printed decorations of all kind, and even a basketball court powered by Kinect. That's impressive right? \nIt gets even better when one considers that it also supports Apple Pay. Well, it gets better for Apple consumers, we should have said. Now, if you're lost as to what you should buy, the store has several large touchscreens on walls to help in the decision factor. \n\"We're leading the transformation of sport retail - offering the best of Nike products, services and experiences under one roof,\" says Heidi O'Neill, Nike's President of Global Direct to Consumer. \"With Nike Soho, we can realize the promise of personalized performance. Powered by immersive digital trials and in-store experts, this store is about elevating every athlete's potential.\" \nAdding technology to the buying experience is a great idea. Folks who are purchasing shoes can use the Kinect-powered basketball court to see themselves in the shoe and how they look while jumping at the hoop. As Nike said, it's all about the experience, an this is definitely one way to go about it. \nIt makes sense for Nike to build a store such as this one, after all, the company is planning to sell its Hyperadapt 1.0 Back to The Future shoes come Nov. 8, 2016. The shoe is designed to lace itself, but don't expect it to work in the same way as the shoes seen in the movie. \nNike has also worked with Apple on what is known as the Apple Watch Nike+ . It's all about fitness tracking with this watch, and it is built on top of the Apple Watch 2, so it will support all the great things Apple has brought to the table.  ",

      "text": "Power-Lacing Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 Will Retail for $1,000 Nov 14, 2016 1 minute read \nAuto-lacing technology is no longer a promise of the future, but an innovation of the present. The Nike MAG is proof to that end. But so is the upcoming release of the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 , due in stores on November 28. \nThe 2016 Nike MAG didn’t require a retail price due to its unique rollout to aid the Michael J. Fox Foundation, which raised millions in support of continued Parkinson’s research. The HyperAdapt 1.0, though, does require such traditional constructs. And for those asking, the retail price is set at $1,000 USD. \nThe shoe is broken down into four key features: a heel sensor that alerts the shoe when a foot is inside, a cable lacing system, unique motor capabilities that tighten and loosen the cables and finally a rechargeable battery to power the LED lights on the outsole. \nAlthough limited in numbers, the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 will drop on November 28 for $1,000. The shoe will rollout in three colorways – White, Black and Metallic Silver. Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 ",

      "text": "\nKobe Bryant's last active signature silhouette has not officially retired as of yet. The Nike Kobe 11 Low EM will don another farewell colorway that sports a Deep Royal Blue-dominated upper that's complemented with Metallic Gold detailing seen on its Swooshes and tongue branding. Subtle red coloring makes its way onto the insoles as well as the heel's stitching as an homage to Bryant's unforgettable achilles injury during the end of his career.\nWhile Kobe fans anticipate the Nike Kobe A.D. , another special edition of the Nike Kobe 11 4KB in \"Liquid Lime\" is set to launch soon as well. The aforementioned Nike Kobe 11 Low EM \"Deep Royal Blue\" does not have a release date as of yet, but has a set retail price of $160 USD. Stay tuned and we'll keep you updated regarding release information.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

By Brendan Dunne \nNike will again recall the height of the SB Dunk's popularity by looking back at bygone eras of its skate imprint. It's doing so with the \"Box Series\" of releases that issues Dunks in colorways inspired by the packaging of Nike SB shoes over the years. \nRumored to release on Black Friday, the Nike SB Dunk Low \"Pink Box\" represents 2005's run of releases. Like other shoes in this vein, the model has a box logo imprinted on the heel. As seen below, the pink pair has a reflective upper that's activated by flashing light. \nOther designs in the \"Box Series\" include the \"Orange Box\" and \"Black Box.\"",

The latest leak from Instagram depicts what looks to be an upcoming pair in a no-nonsense triple black colorway with reflective accents. \nThe Nike Air More Uptempo had a strong retro run in 2016 between the return of original colorways and the introduction of new ones , a run that looks to be continuing into next year with pairs like these. \nThe sneaker release date info for this black/reflective Nike Air More Uptempo isn't available yet.",

      "text": "Nike \nTo live in the future, you've got to pay the price.\nThe Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 — the first mass-market sneaker to use Nike's new self-lacing technology — will cost $720 a pair, a spokesperson for the company has confirmed with Business Insider.\nInterested customers can make appointments to see and purchase the shoe in person starting December 1. It will come in three colors: black, white, and a black/gray.\nThe shoes were first announced by Nike to great fanfare at its innovation conference in March. Nike CEO Mark Parker later went on CNBC to claim that self-lacing sneakers will be as big as self-driving cars in the future, with both mainstream appeal and application.\nThe first shoe, the HyperAdapt 1.0, will feature the signature adaptive fit, which senses when the wearer's foot is in the shoe using a pressure sensor, and automatically tightens the straps until it senses resistance based on an \"algorithmic pressure equation,\" according to Wired . Buttons near the tongue of the shoe provide customized adjustment if the shoe feels too tight or too loose.\nLED lights on the sole will tell you when the shoe is tightening and low on battery charge. The shoes will need to be charged like a gadget to work. It will take three hours to achieve a full charge, which will last two weeks.\nThe technology took 11 years for Nike to research and develop.\n\"We're talking about a project that's maybe the most difficult in the history of footwear,\"  Nike VP Tinker Hatfield told Wired . \nSelf-lacing sneakers first entered the public consciousness in 1989's \"Back to the Future II,\" which featured a futuristic version of self-lacing sneakers called the Nike Mag. Nike produced a few Nike Mag versions and raffled them off for charity, and it  even sent Michael J. Fox a pair. The shoes  raised a total of $6.75 million for Parkinson's disease research. \nNOW WATCH: Cristiano Ronaldo just signed a lifetime deal with Nike reportedly worth $1 billion — here's how he makes and spends his money \n",

      "text": "The Nike Ad That Inspired 'Space Jam' Was Nostalgic Paydirt When Bugs and Jordan hit the court, it was a slam dunk. Animation November 14, 2016 \nSpace Jam turns 20 this year, but few fans remember that facing off against the Monstars was not Michael Jordan’s first time playing with Bugs and Daffy. In 1992, Jordan joined a pickup game with the Looney Tunes in a Super Bowl commercial. The ad didn’t just serve as the core inspiration for Space Jam : it resurrected the Looney Tunes out of cultural irrelevancy and used nostalgia as a marketing hook. That’s a move most millennials are now very familiar with, but in 1996, it was a stroke of unique marketing genius. \nThe Ivan Reitman-produced Space Jam explores Michael Jordan’s departure from the NBA. After deciding to play professional baseball, Jordan is kidnapped by the Looney Tunes and eventually agrees to coach them in a basketball game. Their opponents, led by the cigar-chewing Mr. Swackhammer (Danny DeVito) seek to enslave the toons as attractions in a theme park. \nProduced by Jim Riswold of Wieden + Kennedy, the Portland-based agency that has worked with Nike for decades, “Hare Jordan” was one of the first major examples of market-tested nostalgia, a precursor to today’s commodification of childhoods to energize brand synergy. (A second commercial in 1993 was designed specifically to sell the Air Jordan VII.) \nAfter “Hare Jordan,” Sega, Hertz, McDonald’s, and a slew of other corporations began mixing live-action with animation in advertising, because people “warm to cartoon characters in ways they don’t warm to human beings,” explained Renee Fraser , another psychologist from Los Angeles. But in 1992, Bugs Bunny had two things over Sonic the Hedgehog: Legacy, and Michael Jordan, the most transcendent athlete in the world. \nAlthough 1988’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit? — which also featured Bugs Bunny with other cartoon icons like Mickey Mouse and Betty Boop — was innovative in its use of animation and live actors, it skewed exclusively to an older audience by using its most familiar characters, Mickey and Bugs, as extras, not stars. David Falk, Jordan’s agent, who steered Jordan into Hollywood, knew how to capitalize on that missed opportunity. Falk pushed for a Jordan/Bugs Bunny movie based wholly on “its merchandising potential as for its box-office appeal.” At the same time, Warner Bros. hoped to revive its Looney Tunes franchise during a time when Batman was the box office force to reckon with; in 1992, the year “Hare Jordan” came out, Tim Burton’s Batman Returns was the number one film with the biggest opening weekend to date. \nSpace Jam ’s worldwide gross sales when it hit theaters in 1996 amounted to $230 million. It was shy of Batman Forever ’s $266 million, but the experiment still worked beyond what Warner could fathom. The Chicago-Tribune reported that all tie-in Space Jam merchandise raked in $1.2 billion, with an impact of $4 to $6 billion over time due to the resurged marketability of Bugs, Daffy, Sylvester, Tweety, Marvin the Martian, and the rest. (And yeah, Air Jordans with Bugs on them, those sold a bunch too.) \nAfter “Hare Jordan” and Space Jam Looney cartoons sprung, like The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries , Duck Dodgers , the experimental Loonatics Unleashed which reimagined the characters in a post-apocalyptic setting, and The Looney Tunes Show , a sitcom starring Bugs and Daffy as roommates in L.A. \nThat’s not counting the subsequent video games, tie-in merch, comic books, other films like the theatrical Looney Tunes: Back in Action , and the plethora of direct-to-video features. All told, playing with Michael Jordan was a slam dunk. \nBut the thing 20-somethings today revert to without fail is Space Jam , where Michael Jordan played ball to save the Tunes from aliens. But the film’s origins, “Hare Jordan,” is less drastic and apocalyptic. It was just a game of basketball. Photos via YouTube.com/horace leung",

      "text": "Model Bella Hadid Announces Nike Deal After breaking up with a Puma endorser. By Brendan Dunne \nNike's latest signee is not a promising young athlete, but rather a model with a massive social media following. Bella Hadid , younger sister of Gigi Hadid, announced on Instagram on Monday that she is now \"officially part of the Nike family.\" \nHadid obviously doesn't give Nike much in the realm of top-tier athletes, but it's not hard to see why the brand would want to align with the young model when one considers the combined 8 million followers she has across her Twitter and Instagram accounts. \nThe 20-year-old model previously walked for Puma at Rihanna's FentyxPuma show in February, 2016, and recently broke up with Puma-aligned singer The Weeknd .

Fox Foundation , but the HyperAdapts are the first to be released generally to consumers. \n“When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten,” Nike's Tiffany Beers said upon the unveiling. \n“Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it’s perfect.” \nLED lights placed in the feels will light up when they are tightening, while the battery will last two weeks per charge. Recharging takes three hours. \nEarlier reports on Monday had suggested they’d cost unto $1,000 (£800), so it could have been worse. \nWatch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week \nAre the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 running shoes still on your shopping list?

Gisele Bündchen snagged Under Armour . Gigi Hadid has Reebok . And Bella Hadid just joined the ranks with her new deal with Nike. (In case you thought she peaked at her Victoria’s Secret wings , she’s clearly just getting started.)\nso excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE @NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon ❤️ \nA photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST \nHadid announced the news on Instagram with a photo standing in front of a ginormous N.Y.C. billboard. The ad doesn’t show any portion of her campaign yet, showing a close-up shot and a street style pic, but Hadid assures us there’s more to come.\n“So excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE @NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon,” the model captioned her post .\nRELATED PHOTOS: Unforgettable! 16 Times Gigi Hadid Wore Her Name on Her Clothes \nThe 20-year-old recently booked a coveted spot in the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show (we have a sneak peek of her outfit, here ) and isn’t letting first-time jitters get the best of her. “If you first come into something you’re always a rookie,” she said. “And I think that eventually I will, you know, make my way up the ladder.”\nShe’s showing the same level-headedness with her personal life too. Hadid recently split with her boyfriend The Weeknd after a year and a half together, but she’s staying focused on her career. She even swapped her usual go-to “Abel” necklace (the singer’s first name) with a “Bella” nameplate .\nWhat do you think of Hadid’s big news? What do you think she’ll do next? ",

      "text": "Email \nIf tracking every supermodel move has taught us anything, it’s that you’re not at the top of your game until you get that coveted athleisure deal. Gisele Bündchen snagged Under Armour . Gigi Hadid has Reebok . And Bella Hadid just joined the ranks with her new deal with Nike. (In case you thought she peaked at her Victoria’s Secret wings , she’s clearly just getting started.) A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST \nHadid announced the news on Instagram with a photo standing in front of a ginormous N.Y.C. billboard. The ad doesn’t show any portion of her campaign yet, showing a close-up shot and a street style pic, but Hadid assures us there’s more to come. \n“So excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE @NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon,” the model captioned her post . \nRELATED PHOTOS: Unforgettable! 16 Times Gigi Hadid Wore Her Name on Her Clothes \nThe 20-year-old recently booked a coveted spot in the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show (we have a sneak peek of her outfit, here ) and isn’t letting first-time jitters get the best of her. “If you first come into something you’re always a rookie,” she said. “And I think that eventually I will, you know, make my way up the ladder.” \nShe’s showing the same level-headedness with her personal life too. Hadid recently split with her boyfriend The Weeknd after a year and a half together, but she’s staying focused on her career. She even swapped her usual go-to “Abel” necklace (the singer’s first name) with a “Bella” nameplate . \nWhat do you think of Hadid’s big news? What do you think she’ll do next? Show Full Article",

After months of passive indifference, we’re mere days from the shoe of the future, at least according to ‘Back to the Future’ protagonist Marty McFly. According to notable sneakerhead Jacques Slade , the consumer version of Nike’s self-lacing sneaker will hit shelves December 1 and for a mere $720. You read it right the first time.\nThe shoe is set to be Nike’s first consumer foray into self-lacing technology after a limited edition release last year. The first of 89 pairs made went to Marty McFly himself, Michael J. Fox. The other 88 were sold to benefit the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s research.\nTNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech.\nJoin a chat \nThe limited edition shoe brought considerable interest. One pair even sold at auction for over $100,000.\nNow, you can skip the auction house and get yours direct from Nike . But if we’re being honest, at $720, I think I’ll tie my own damn shoes.",

      "text": "Teen Boy Finds An Unwanted Baby Girl Placed In A Nike Shoebox At His Doorstep; This Story Will Melt Everyone's Heart By Dianne Franc ,   12:50 pm Child was put on a shoeBox by own mother.(Photo : Bloomberg / Contributor) \nA 14-year-old boy from Suffolk County found a baby girl right outside their house's doorstep on November 8 around 9 pm. The baby was inside a Nike shoebox. Advertisement \nIn an article published by The New York Post , Franklin Santos Ulloa, 14, was watching TV when he heard someone crying by their back door. He didn't mind it at first, but after ten minutes, he noticed that the crying seems not to cease. Their neighbor thought it was just a cat making a noise. The boy then opened their back door and found a healthy looking baby girl inside a shoebox. It seems like she was well taken care of before her mother finally decided just to give her up. \nThe baby was wrapped in a blanket with a sweater and a pink hat that is knitted. There was even a bottle of milk right next to her. The baby was just crying the whole time as if she knows she is being abandoned. Ulloa then called his neighbor to tell them what he found. \nHis friend, 37-year-old Victor Romero, answered Ulloa and took a look at the baby downstairs. He called his wife, and they decided to call 911 to report what they saw. Romero thought of still finding the person who left the baby by flashing lights in the area, but he found no one there. \nThe baby was rushed to the hospital nearby, and the doctors declared that she is indeed a healthy one. They weren't given to the people who found her but was rather placed under the custody of Suffolk County Child Protective Services and said that they will still be looking for the child's biological parents. \nKSAT San Antonio also got a hold of this story confirming the age of the infant, who is only six months old. There must be a good reason why her parents just abandoned her like that. \nThese are not the first time that a baby was found in a shoebox somewhere.

After recently announcing that she'll be walking in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show , the 20-year-old supermodel just excitingly told her fans that she's the new face of Nike. To share the celebratory news, Bella posed in front of a New York City billboard that reads \"New York Made.\" \n\"So excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE @NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon,\" she captioned the photo above. There has not been much information released about Bella's work with Nike, but her Snapchat photos indicate that a sneaker collection could be in the works. \nBella will be following in her older sister Gigi's footsteps as the face of a huge fitness campaign. Last month, Gigi laced up her gloves and teamed up with Reebok to represent the #PerfectNever movement. When she isn't on the runway, Bella can often be found rocking stylish athleisure and we cannot wait to see what she has planned with Nike. \nKeep reading to see some of the exciting photos Bella posted from the Nike Lab.

      "text": "Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 is the self-lacing sneakers that will make you feel like Marty McFly, and it's about to be released next month with a pretty hefty price tag. ( Nike ) Advertisement \nGoing against previous reports, the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 self-lacing sneakers are going to cost $720 with an expected release date of Dec. 1. \nInitially, the high-tech Back to the Future shoes were believed to come with a $1,000 price tag and become available on Nov. 28. \nIn other words, the good news is that it's a bit more affordable than once thought, but the bad news is that the moment when everyone can help themselves to it has been pushed back by a few days. Self-Lacing HyperAdapt 1.0's Price And Release Date Confirmation \nFor starters, the renowned YouTuber and sneaker enthusiast Jacques Slade announced the $720 price and Dec. 1 release date of the HyperAdapt 1.0, spreading the word via Twitter. Just CONFIRMED with NIKE. Hyperadapt 1.0 is NOT $1000. It is $720 releasing on 12/1. pic.twitter.com/eqcwybbRyN \n— Jacques Slade (@kustoo) November 14, 2016 \nCorroborating the details is a Nike spokesperson's confirmation to Mashable . \nTo put two and two together, it's pretty much a surefire deal that the self-lacing footwear will come right on time before the holidays kick in full gear and be slightly cheaper than originally reported. A Little Refresher: What The HyperAdapt 1.0 Has In Store \nFor those looking to grab the HyperAdapt 1.0, here's a short look at what it can bring to the table : the sneakers' laces will automatically tighten when the wearer hits a sensor with their heel. \nFor adjustment, they are equipped with two buttons on the side that can loosen or tighten their fit. That means comfort isn't exactly an issue here. \nPowered by lithium-ion batteries that's touted to last two weeks, the shoes have LEDs on the heel and sole to display battery life. Blue means the battery is still going strong, yellow indicates it only has a few days' worth of juice left and red is a sign that it needs to be recharged as soon as possible. \n\"Innovation at Nike is not about dreaming of tomorrow. It's about accelerating toward it. We're able to anticipate the needs of athletes because we know them better than anybody. Sometimes, we deliver a reality before others have even begun to imagine it,\" Tinker Hatfield, well-known designer of many Nike shoes, said . What About Nike's Limited-Edition Air Mags? \nPut simply, the Air Mags are all cleaned out, but that shouldn't come as much of a surprise since there were only 89 pairs produced. \nTo boil things down, strutting down the street in Marty McFly style is a bit expensive, but at any rate, the HyperAdapt 1.0 is one step closer to that futuristic reality. All we need now is the hoverboard, and not one of those \"fake\" and misleading gizmos . \nWith all said and done, what do you think of Nike's self-lacing Back to the Future sneakers? Drop by our comments section below and let us know, especially if you're going to nab a pair. TAG © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission. Related Articles",

(NASDAQ: AAPL - Free Report ). \nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks: \nBull of the Day : \nWith Trump's stunning victory, investors are quickly reallocating their portfolios to prepare for a Republican president, and a Republican-controlled Congress as well. While there are a number of areas that look to benefit from this political situation, one that may do especially well is the defense market. \nThis corner of the economy could benefit from a massive surge in defense spending, as some believe that Trump will look to spend somewhere near $500 billion more on defense , pushing total U.S. defense spending near the one trillion dollar mark. As you might be able to guess, this huge increase is being viewed favorably by the defense stocks, and we have seen several of these surge following Trump's win. Plus, the industry rank here is in the top 20% overall, so there is plenty to like in terms of investment choices. \nOne that might be worth a closer look by investors though, is Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC - Free Report ). This company was recently upgraded into Zacks Rank #1 (strong buy) territory while it could be a prime beneficiary of the Trump defense spending surge. \nOther Factors \nBut beyond Trump, analysts also seem to like NOC's prospects, as we saw a number of analysts raise their earnings estimates on NOC shares, and that was before the election took place. In fact, analysts were already baking in a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 27% for Northrop, and that is before considering Trump's huge spending surge. \nBut before worrying about these lofty expectations, investors should consider that NOC does a great job in earnings season, and that it has a great history of beating estimates. This includes four straight beats of at least four percent, and only two misses in the past five years. \nBear of the Day : \nIn the wake of Trump's surprising victory, investors have seen incredible volatility in a number of market sectors. One area that has been on the move more than others is the world of real estate. \nThat is because interest rates are soaring in anticipation of some inflationary policies from Trump (including a burst of new spending), while some think that foreign holders of Treasury bonds may be reducing their positions as well. Either way, this has pushed the 10-year yield to within striking distance of its 52 week high, hurting the appeal of housing and real estate markets in the process. \nWhile this has obviously hit companies in the high dividend area of the real estate world, those in the services side of the market could also be impacted. Lower home sales or a more difficult housing market could definitely impact companies like Realogy Holdings (NYSE: RLGY - Free Report ) and force these companies lower in the process. \nRLGY in Focus \nRLGY provides real estate and relocation services across the globe. This is done via a number of real estate brands, including pretty well-known ones such as Century 21, Coldwell Banker, and Sotheby's International Realty to name a few. \nThe company could be under pressure if the housing market faces turmoil in the near term, while the sector outlook isn't much better, including a bottom 25% industry rank. But it isn't just the jarring industry outlook that is a problem for RLGY, as the company's   report also brought up some big questions. \nRecent Earnings \nIn the latest report, RLGY missed earnings estimates for the second time in a row, posting 74 cents a share in earnings compared to expectations of 76 cents per share. Additionally, the most recent estimates for RLGY earnings have come in below previous expectations, as we have seen two estimates go lower for the current quarter in the past week, and one lower for the full year time frame too. \nIn fact, if we look at the most accurate estimate and compare it to the consensus from 30 days ago, the current quarter expectations have fallen by over 25%, while the full year and next year periods have also trended lower. Clearly, analysts aren't big believers in RLGY's near term potential, and it is hard to blame them considering the macro forces at play as well. \nAdditional content: \nAlibaba's 'Singles Day' Posts Record Sales of $178 Billion \nOn Friday, China's e-commerce king Alibaba (NYSE: BABA - Free Report ) held its annual Singles' Day shopping event, posting record sales of $17.8 billion worth of gross merchandise volume (GMV) and soaring past last year's results of $14.3 billion. This figure was easily beaten in Chinese Yuan before 3:30pm. \nBack in the 1990s, Singles' Day was first celebrated by young, single Chinese people as a pushback against Valentine's Day. Now, it's become one of the country's biggest shopping events. Alibaba began to capitalize on the \"holiday\" in 2009, promoting discounts at certain retailers on its various digital platforms; the company uses Singles' Day as a way to boost its revenues in the typically slow sales period before the Lunar New Year season. \nThis year, Alibaba said that deals offered by athletic giants Nike Inc. (NYSE: NKE - Free Report ), iPhone maker Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL - Free Report ), industrial automation company Siemens AG and fast fashion retailer Uniqlo. Many international brands have jumped on the holiday over recent years. According to CNBC , 14,000 brands took part of 2016 Singles' Say, making up roughly 30% of total GMV just half-way into the shopping event. Big Chinese brands like appliance manufacturers Haier and Midea and smartphone maker Meizu also reported strong profits in the event. \nPopular celebrities made appearances at the four-hour \"countdown event\" in Shenzhen this year, including actress Scarlett Johansson, David Beckham and his wife, fashion designer Victoria Beckham, Kobe Bryant, and live music from OneRepublic. Even Alibaba CEO Jack Ma showed up and performed a magic trick on stage, along with promotional spots for the new Alibaba Pictures' latest film production. \nFor some perspective on how big of a sale Singles' Day is, 2015's Black Friday, the annual day-after-Thanksgiving sale here in the U.S., only reached $4.5 billion in GMV; Cyber Monday, the annual Monday-after-Thanksgiving e-commerce sale event, only saw a record $3 billion last year, or pocket change compared to what Singles' Day brings in. \n\"Jack Ma likes to say that they're no longer an e-commerce company. They're sort of transcending that,\" said Duncan Clark, chairman and MD of the business advisory BDA China, to CNBC 's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday. \"It's about data, it's about finance, it's about media.\" This is very similar to how Amazon has evolved over the years, turning into not just the biggest e-commerce platform in the U.S., but also a top video streaming choice for many consumers through its Prime membership. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

      "text": "sister Share this article \nAs if being a soon-to-be Victoria’s Secret model and walking in every major fashion show ever wasn’t enough to make Bella Hadid one of the top models of our generation, she has just landed another MAJOR campaign to add to her resume: Nike. \nOn Monday, the supermode broke the news by writing on Instagram, \"So excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE NIKE FAMILY!\" accompanied by Hadid posing next to a giant billboard of herself, as one does. A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST \nAlthough Nike has yet to confirm the news themselves, according to Harpers Bazaar , we think that the billboard in New York City might give it away. Just a tad, ya know? \nEither way, congrats Bella! We are looking forward to all the #fitspo you are going to post for us so we can live vicariously through you! (All from the comfort of our couches, of course). You Might Also Enjoy",

      "text": "We in 2016 still don’t have flying cars yet, but Back to the Future has successfully predicted something other than Donald Trump.\nAfter giving away special edition MAG sneakers -- modeled after the pair of self-lacing shoes worn by Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future Part II -- in a raffle for Fox’s foundation fighting Parkinson’s disease, Nike nke will be releasing mass-produced sneakers that tie themselves up in select stores in December, Mashable reports .\nThe Nike HyperAdapt comes with cables and pressure sensors that would adjust its laces to fit the wearer’s feet, with the option to adjust tightness by pressing buttons near the tongue. Apart from being able to lace themselves, these sneakers also come with LED lights on the soles that are not only cool, but also act as battery level indicators. The built-in lithium-ion batteries should last two weeks after a full, three-hour charge via a wireless charging dock, the report says.\nNike announces official release info for the HyperAdapt: https://t.co/nd5tWMOioV pic.twitter.com/LiiFLTMCdZ \n— Sneaker News (@SneakerNews) November 15, 2016 \n\nNike confirmed to Mashable that the HyperAdapt will be on sale Dec. 1, just in time for the holiday shopping season. (Previous reporting had suggested a Nov. 28 release date.) And they won’t cost any potential buyer $1,000 a pair, as might be suggested in some rumors.\nThese self-lacing sneakers will instead come with a $720 price tag, a Nike spokesperson told Mashable .\nFor more on the Nike HyperAdapt, watch Fortune’s video: \n\nThe sneakers were first announced by Nike in March, when Fortune had a chance to try them on .",

      "text": "By Amey Stone With rates rising, investors are rotating out of stocks that have high dividend payouts and into ones with potential for strong dividend growth, says Eric Ervin, CEO of Reality Shares .\n“We are just now at the beginning of this rotation and expect it will continue for some time,” he told Barron’s .\nBelow is Ervin’s current list of five favorite dividend growers and his rationale for why he likes each one. He includes his firm’s “Divcon” score, which estimates its probability of growing its dividend.\nErvin’s picks:\nNike ( NKE )\n· Nike has increased its dividend every year since 2002. We expect Nike to increase dividends in this month.\n· 1YR Dividend Growth is 14.29%. The market expects 11.40% increase for next twelve months. Indicated yield of Nike is 1.26%.\n· Nike’s DIVCON Score is 67, with a rating 5, compared to the average DIVCON Score 54.5 of the S&P 500.

Ever since its debut back in March at Nike's Global Innovation Summit, sneakerheads were drooling at the chance to don what is essentially a training shoe that adapts to your foot and ties itself to your liking. That is, until they found out how much it's going to cost. \nRELATED : Nike Officially Introduces the First Self-Lacing Shoe, the HyperAdapt 1.0 \nSelf-lacing technology apparently doesn't come cheap. According to Sole Collector , the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 will be released in super limited quantities— and it's going to cost a cool $720 to purchase. So while the shoe, which officially drops on Dec. 1, might be on your Christmas list, don't expect your parents to cop it for you—or for the shoe to last at retail that long. Despite it's high price tag, it will doubtlessly sell out within minutes. \nSelf-lacing technology is certainly cool. Hopefully future releases will allow normal folks to have a shot at buying it.",

      "text": "\nAfter bringing back the Tinker Hatfield-designed Zoom Talaria with a Mid Flyknit redesign, Nike is set to release a stealth colorway of the reworked ACG design. Featuring the same Mid Flyknit construction unveiled a few months back, the tonal \"Triple Black\" colorway accents the Flyknit underlay and Talaria prototypical overlays creating a modern seamless silhouette. Rugged D-ring lacing grommets and a retooled outsole for better traction rounds up the design of the shoe. No word on an official release date just yet, but stayed tuned for more details as they become available.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "Tweet This 0 (Photo: Jon Lopez // Nike) \nAfter going nearly a year without a commitment, Kentucky now has three in a span of five days with the addition of Chattanooga (Tenn.) Hamilton Heights 4-star combo guard Shai Alexander , who committed to the Wildcats Monday morning. \nAlexander announced the news via Twitter. — Shai Alexander (@shaiglalex) November 14, 2016 \nRanked 43rd overall and a the No. 2 combo guard in the 2017 class by the industry-average 247Sports Composite , Alexander is a former Florida commit who reopened his recruitment Oct. 17. \nUK assistant Joel Justus met with him a week later, head coach John Calipari did the same and extended an offer Oct. 31 and that next weekend, Alexander was in Lexington for an official visit. \nKentucky had recruited commitments Nick Richards and P.J. Washington for the better part of two years. Alexander's recruitment, meanwhile, lasted a little more than two weeks. \nHamilton Heights coach Zach Ferrell said Alexander is a good fit for the Wildcats. \n\"They play spread and pitch the ball ahead. [Calipari] loves his ability to break down the defender with the dribble,\" Ferrell said. \"He's a very unselfish player so guys are going to love playing with him. He talked about how that would translate to good stuff when you put other good players around him.\" \nFerrell called Alexander \"a natural team leader,\" and although he can play either guard spot, he views him as a point guard all the way. \n\"As a point guard, he's everything you want,\" Ferrell said. \n\"He understands the game, he plays with a level-headedness. His vision is fantastic. He loves to get his teammates involved and on top of all that, he has tremendous size for a point guard. He has a 6-10 wingspan. He can score it really well, he can control the game, he can find people where they need to be. He handles the ball great, shoots it well and he's fantastic off the ball screen.\" \nWith the addition of Alexander, Kentucky's 2017 class moves into the top-five of the 247Sports Composite Team Rankings.

      "text": "Nike’s Self-Lacing HyperAdapt Shoes Will Cost $720  57 PST \nIn case you missed out on the opportunity to own the Nike Mag shoes , not to worry as Nike still has the HyperAdapt shoes that will be going on sale later this month . Now we’re sure that some of you guys are wondering how much would these shoes cost you, and if you were worried it might break the bank, we have some semi-good news for you. \nAccording to an announcement by Nike (via Engadget ), the shoes will cost $720. This was also earlier confirmed by YouTuber Jacques Slade who had posted a video saying that the shoes would not cost $1,000, a price that some have speculated and were worried about it coming true. \nNow $720 is of course a crazy price to pay for shoes when the majority of sneakers out there will set you back $100-$200, but then again these are pretty special and most likely they are being aimed at collectors and sneakerheads. Nike has also announced that a small group of Nike+ Members will be getting first dibs come 28th of November. \nAs for everyone else, the shoes will be made available to the general public in December, so if you have a Christmas wishlist, perhaps you might want to add these shoes to that list. \nFiled in Gadgets >   fashion , nike and Wearable Tech .

      "text": "  4 seconds ago with 0 comments \nAfter teasing the world in March , Nike will finally make its first retail version of a self-lacing shoe, the HyperAdapt 1.0 , available for purchase on December 1st. \nUnfortunately, you won't be able to walk into your local shoe store and pick up a pair. Instead, the shoe will only be available at two locations in the New York area - the Nike Soho store and the NIKE+ ClubHouse at 45 Grand. The HyperAdapt 1.0 will be priced at $720 USD, and will be available exclusively to Nike+ members. \nThose that are currently Nike+ members might be invited as part of a special group that will have early access to the shoe on November 28th. If curious, you will want to check the NIKE+ app in the “Reserved for You” section, to see whether a purchase opportunity is available. For those not located in New York and not willing to travel, the shoe will become available more widely in late December on Nike+ and at Nike stores in the United States.",

      "text": "Nike N7 celebrates Native American Heritage Month HV By Haley Velasco - 15 November 2016 02:46am Nike N7 celebrates Native American Heritage Month \nNike celebrated Native American Heritage Month by partnering with nine colleges throughout November and December to wear the N7 uniforms. During select men’s and women’s games, Florida State, Gonzaga, Haskell Indian Nations University, Nevada, New Mexico, Marquette, Oklahoma State, San Diego State and Stanford will each wear N7-inspired turquoise uniforms. \nN7 is Nike’s commitment 'to inspire and enable two million Native American and Aboriginal youth in North America to participate in sport and physical activity'. The company works to embrace the Native philosophy, “In every deliberation we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations.” \nIn 2009, Nike debuted the N7 Collection to celebrate Native American culture to raise awareness for the N7 Fund. Nike has contributed more than $4 million to Native American youth sport programs. Since 2010 when the N7 turquoise uniform was first worn, participation in the program has grown from one school to nine. \nIn addition to playing in the turquoise — which means harmony, friendship and fellowship in Native American culture — these schools will also do local outreach to Native communities. Gonzaga, Marquette and Nevada will run basketball camps; Oklahoma State will hold a Native youth spring field day; and Seminole Tribe of Florida youth programs with Florida State. San Diego State works with N7 Fund grantee Inter Tribal Sports by hosting a basketball camp and the New Mexico men’s and women’s teams auction their uniforms and donations go to local Native American youth organizations. \nThe schedule for the uniforms are the following: \nMen's Games:",

      "title": "Nike's new store in New York has a basketball court where you can test drive their shoes — Quartz",
      "text": "Fashion November 14, 2016 \nWhen Heidi O’Neill, president of Nike’s direct-to-consumer business, was talking to potential customers about what they would want to see in a new Nike store, one father told her he’d like it to be a place where he could drop off his kids to play on a rainy day. \nThe company’s giant new store in New York, filling up five stories in a 55,000-square-foot space in the city’s Soho shopping corridor, is basically that. It’s like one of toymaker Lego’s popular Legoland stores, where customers go to play as (or more) often than they do to purchase, but for people who love sports. Beyond being a shiny new gem in Nike’s crown, it signals how the company is thinking about its future, and the ways that brick-and-mortar retail is changing in the age of e-commerce. \nThe store , originally scheduled to open on Nov. 11 but delayed because of a permit issue (we will update this post with the new date once it is announced) contains: a mini basketball court; a treadmill in front of screens simulating different outdoor runs; a small, enclosed soccer area; a customization shoe bar where shoppers can personalize a pair of Nike Air Force 1s; and dedicated coaches on staff who can put customers through drills to test out sneakers. The indoor-outdoor running experience. (Nike) \nCameras are set up all around the basketball court to capture the action from different angles. A camera beside the treadmill records a customer’s gait during a run, allowing a Nike staff member to analyze the results and recommend the best sneaker. And that customer can later access the footage through his online Nike account and share it on social media. \nNike spent years designing the store, according to Sean Madden, Nike’s senior director of service and experience for its direct-to-consumer business. “We’ve got a lab back on campus,” he says, referring to the company’s Oregon headquarters. “We’re trying things. We’re piloting in other stores quietly in the marketplace. And we’re finally bringing this to the consumer.” Nike plans to roll out successful elements of the Soho store through the rest of its retail fleet, which includes about 1,000 locations worldwide. Of course there are plenty of sneaker to buy, too. (Nike) \nBetween those stores and Nike.com, the direct-to-consumer business is playing an ever-greater role in Nike’s sales mix. In 2015, direct sales accounted for $6.6 billion , or about 22% of Nike’s sales. But at its investor day last year, Nike said it plans to grow direct sales to $16 billion by 2020, which would be a full third of the $50 billion it’s aiming for in that year. \nThere are quite a few advantages for brands selling more of their products directly to customers. For one, margins are better, since they’re selling at the same price as retailers without having the retailers taking a share. It also means they’re less dependent on retailers that may find their businesses faltering, such as department stores or the recently shuttered Sports Authority . Not least of all, brands can control all their messaging themselves and connect directly with shoppers. \n“It is an incredibly important touchpoint,” O’Neill says of the store’s role in communicating Nike’s brand to the public. “We built this store with the idea of serving consumers one-to-one in ways that we haven’t.” Feel free to boot the ball. (Nike) \nA large brick-and-mortar store in New York is a costly investment when e-commerce sales are growing. But physical stores are still critical for brands , and the most forward-thinking companies recognize that for those stores to pay off they need to offer experiences that e-commerce can’t. \nSpeaking at a Nov. 10 conference on the future of retail, Lorna Hall, the head of market intelligence for trend-forecasting firm WGSN, said the future of retail stores will be increasingly about these interactive experiences, where “they’re treating space as a new territory, aligning [key performance indicators] more with marketing and media than selling per se.” \nJust a few blocks from Nike’s shiny new Soho shop, for instance, Pirch, which sells luxury home fixtures, has a large store where all the faucets, showers, ovens, and grills are functional . You can literally make an appointment to go shower there to test drive products before you buy them. \nRobin Lewis, who writes the retail blog The Robin Report, groups Pirch with other brands including Apple and Burberry that use experiences to detach shoppers from their phones or laptops and get them into stores, where once immersed in the experienced they will “stay longer and buy more.” \nAlways competitive, Nike thinks it can be a leader of this new push in retail.

      "text": "By Amey Stone With rates rising, investors are rotating out of stocks that have high dividend payouts and into ones with potential for strong dividend growth, says Eric Ervin, CEO of Reality Shares .\n“We are just now at the beginning of this rotation and expect it will continue for some time,” he told Barron’s .\nBelow is Ervin’s current list of five favorite dividend growers and his rationale for why he likes each one. He includes his firm’s “Divcon” score, which estimates its probability of growing its dividend.\nErvin’s picks:\nNike ( NKE )\n· Nike has increased its dividend every year since 2002. We expect Nike to increase dividends in this month.\n· 1YR Dividend Growth is 14.29%. The market expects 11.40% increase for next twelve months. Indicated yield of Nike is 1.26%.\n· Nike’s DIVCON Score is 67, with a rating 5, compared to the average DIVCON Score 54.5 of the S&P 500. Six of the Nike DIVCON seven factors outperformed the S&P 500 averages.\nMastercard ( MA )\n· Mastercard has increased its dividend every year since 2012. We expect Mastercard to increase dividends next month.\n· 1YR Dividend Growth is 18.75%. The market expects 9.40% increase for next twelve months. Indicated yield of Mastercard is 0.75%.\n· Mastercard’s DIVCON Score is 66.8, with a rating 5, compared to the average DIVCON Score 54.5 of the S&P 500. All of the Mastercard DIVCON seven factors outperformed the S&P 500 averages.\nCVS Health ( CVS )\n· CVS has increased its dividend every year since 2007. We expect CVS to increase dividends next month.\n· 1YR Dividend Growth is 21.43%. The market expects 17.20% increase for next twelve months. Indicated yield of CVS is 2.24%.\n· CVS’s DIVCON Score is 67.5, with a rating 5, compared to the average DIVCON Score 54.5 of the S&P 500. All of the CVS DIVCON seven factors outperformed the S&P 500 averages.\nHormel Foods ( HRL )\n· Hormel Foods has increased its dividend every year since 2006.

Indicated yield of Hormel Foods is 1.67%.\n· Hormel Foods’s DIVCON Score is 67.8, with a rating 5, compared to the average DIVCON Score 54.5 of the S&P 500. Six of the Hormel Foods DIVCON seven factors outperformed the S&P 500 averages.\nIngersoll-Rand ( IR )\n· Ingersoll-Rand has increased its dividend every year since 2011. Ingersoll-Rand just announced dividends increase in October. As an industrial company, Ingersoll-Rand is likely to benefit from Trump’s policies on Infrastructure.\n· 1YR Dividend Growth is 11.61%. The market expects 24.30% increase for next twelve months.

Previous reports that priced the shoe at $720USD were bang on, but the release dates are a touch more complicated. \nYou will be able to get the HyperAdapt on December 1, but it will only be the ‘Black/White/Blue Lagoon’ pair. NIKE+ members will have the opportunity to secure the pair from New York’s NIKE+ ClubHouse and Soho store. There they’ll have the chance to learn about and even try on the product. But they won’t be the first. A smaller group of members will be able to pick the self-lacing sneaker up before anyone else. They’ll be chosen using the ‘Reserved for You’ system, and then offered the opportunity to purchase. Finally, the ‘Black/White/Blue Lagoon’ and ‘Metallic Silver/Black/White’ colourways will be available to those in the NIKE+ clan later in December. \nNotably absent from this information is the white and gum pair. It’s possible that they could be a more esteemed release in the vein of an HTM – though, at that stage, prices could get a little scary. \nMore self-lacing Nikes: ",

Reports circulating recently have slated the HyperAdapt 1.0 to retail for a cool $1000USD, which has rightly caused a mix reaction from many people. No doubt a shoe with the research and development process on the scale of the HyperAdapt is going to be pricey – but word is, it will be a little easier on the pocket than once thought. \nNews from sneaker personality Jacques Slade reports that a retail price and a (new) release date have been confirmed by Nike. The self-lacing futuristic silhouette will release on December 1 in three colourways; black, white and grey. The elation of a confirmed drop date may be diluted slightly for some sneakerheads though with Nike indicating that – though still cheaper than a thousand bucks – they’ll wear a price tag of $720 USD and will only release in limited numbers. Naturally, nothing can be sure until you see the bottom line at the check out. But just in case, start stacking your cash if you’re keen to cop – these won’t last long no matter the ticket. \nMore self-lacing Nikes: ",

      "text": "Visit the original post to see all 40 images from this gallery. \nThis week Nike will be dropping off its latest Tech Craft collection. The pack finds the brand updating its signature football boots , including the Mercurial, Hypervenom, Magista and Tiempo.\nEach style in turn boasts an all-black upper and a striking silver Swoosh, all while continuing to showcase Nike’s premium Alegria leather, updated with a subtle and intricate embossing pattern for an even softer feel and responsive touch. The label’s All Conditions Control (ACC) technology has also been applied to enhance ball control in both dry and wet conditions.\nThe high-top boots then welcome Flyknit Dynamic Fit Collars, providing fit and lockdown through the foot and ankle, while the previous Flyknit layer used throughout has been stripped for the benefit of a more traditional leather structure.\nLook for Nike’s new Tech Craft football collection to become available on November 17.\n",

      "text": "Where to Shop for Workout Clothes From Nike to Net-a-Sporter, and everything in between. share \nThe activewear market has exploded in the past few years with countless new workout and athleisure brands — not to mention that just about every fashion retailer has added or expanded its activewear lineup. Needless to say, there's a lot to wade through when it comes to sports bras, running tights, and yoga tank tops. Lucky for you, we've done the legwork to precede your leg work. Below is our guide to the absolute best places to shop for workout clothes. The Classics \nNike : The big daddy of athletic gear, where everyone's a Nike athlete no matter what your sport or level of activity. The brand is obsessed with constant innovation in performance wear, and consistently churns out the most on-point colorways. It really can't be beat for shoes that are both functional and stylish, but you didn't need us to tell you that. \nAdidas : The athletic giant has been a bonafide staple for quite some time, but has really upped its game over the past few years with special collaborations, great branding and ad campaigns, quality gear, and celebrity partnerships with the likes of Pusha T and, of course, Kanye West. Shop the brand now for men's, women's, and kid's clothes and sneakers across a huge range of sports and styles. \nUnder Armour : Under Armour has all its athletic apparel bases covered, from day-to-day athleisure to high-performance gear for marathon runners and cold-weather hikers. It's also had a few big collaborations of its own, too, like this year's collection with Misty Copeland and the latest Steph Curry sneakers. \nLululemon : A huge range of pants, shorts, sports bras, and tank tops for runners and yogis is the company's bread and butter. Things like free in-store classes and a huge push for community building make it a full-on lifestyle brand, with shoppers swearing by the pricey leggings (which do at least come with complimentary hemming). \nAthleta : This Gap Inc.-owned athletic chain has been expanding at a rapid clip with a really solid selection of workout apparel. Clothes on offer range in function from studio classes to winter sports, and are available in an agreeable range of hues like black, navy, and coral, with a few seasonally-updated prints thrown in the mix. \nReebok: Like the rest of the names on this list, the activewear giant has an extremely wide variety of gear, and can accomodate your needs across every single sport. Head here for running shorts, CrossFit gloves, UFC gear, pre-school sneakers, and so, so much more. \nAsics: If you're a runner, at one point in time you've probably tried a pair of Asics sneakers. The brand carries men's, women's, and kid's training apparel with a look that's a little less logo-heavy than the likes of Nike and Adidas. \nParagon Sports : Paragon is another athletic behemoth, with a big-deal flagship store in New York City. But online, you can shop for clothing, gear, and shoes for just about every sport, from basketball to soccer to golf. The brand is especially good for its cold-weather clothing, like base layers, warm outerwear, hats, and more. Inexpensive \nOld Navy Active : You might be surprised to know that Old Navy's leggings — which are all in the $20 to $30 range — are actually fantastic. Even better is that they include a wide range of sizes and dedicated active sections for plus , petite , and tall girls, which means those leggings will actually be the right length and fit, and ankle-bunch will be one less thing to worry about while breaking a sweat or holding a pose. \nH&M Sport : Workout tanks and quick-dry leggings are all mostly under $25, and both are available in standard solids and seasonal prints. Continue to stock your gym bag with colorful accessories like combination locks, water bottles, headbands, and sport socks. \nTarget: What isn't Target a great, cheap alternative for? The bulk of the retailer's athletic gear is from the affordable C9 Champion line , which offers leggings, sports bras, tops, jackets, and more that are mostly all well under $50. \nLane Bryant : The retailer's own Livi Active line is great for both fitness apparel and athleisure, which includes leggings in four categories — compression, control, wicking, and signature stretch — as well as supported bras with molded underwire and comfy loungewear. \nForever 21 : If you're looking for workout clothes or athleisure that doesn't really need to stand up to the demands of marathon running, Forever 21 stocks a good selection of leggings, tops, and more that are trendy and affordable (think things like mesh leggings and low-impact strappy yoga bras). Most pieces clock in at under $20, which makes it a great place to pop into if you forget to pack a gym bag one morning. Indie and Athleisure \nBandier : Former music manager Jennifer Bandier sought to reinvent the high-end activewear market when she launched her Southhampton boutique, which nows has an e-comm element, two stores in Manhattan, and another in Dallas. Find a variety of stylish specialty brands from Vimmia to VPL, but check out its exclusive artist collaborations if you're looking for something a little less traditional. \nNet-a-Sporter : High-end e-tailer Net-a-Porter's sport division is called Net-a-Sporter (cute, guys) and it bills itself as \"luxury sportswear.\" Here, shop the most stylish picks from big names like Nike and Adidas by Stella McCartney and and gratuitous sport offerings from high-fashion labels like Fendi. \nAether : Aether takes that \"city-to-sport\" look to the next level with well-designed pieces that work for blustery morning commutes and hardcore hikes (there is a section simply called \"mountain,\" and the brand's tag line is \"outdoor adventure, urban exploration, and innovative design.\"). Invest in base layers, snow pants, or studiowear, which are all backed by a lifetime warranty. \nVie Active : Relatively new to the US, this Aussie label uses merino wool — yes, wool — for everything from sports bras and shorts to compression leggings and jackets. \"[Merino is] soft, breathable, quick-drying, and naturally regulates temperature,\" brand founder Noa Ries says of the material you're used to seeing in sweaters. \nOutdoor Voices : Outdoor Voices is one of the newer activewear brands taking hold of the fashion world. Launched in 2013 , it's often heralded as sportswear for millennials, with simple sweats, leggings, and crop tops in neutral colors like emerald green and charcoal. \nSweaty Betty : The British brand's vast selection of sports bras, tops, bottoms, and jackets is shoppable by sport, from Pilates to outdoors, and done in punchy colors like royal blue and buttercup yellow (as well as basic black and heathered grey). \nAlala : Super luxe materials and downtown cool collide in this New York City-based brand. The products, mostly around the $100 mark, stand out with details that are sexy without being over-the-top, like breathable tanks and slimming tights with flattering mesh panels. \nLolë : Running, yoga, and ski apparel are on offer here. Its White collection is especially elegant, with drapey tops in neutral hues and berry shades, plus performance outerwear you won't mind wearing in the city, too. \nMove by Alternative : Socially-responsible brand Alternative Apparel's answer to activewear includes lots of interesting, loose-fit tops, cool prints, and refreshing silhouettes. Prices range from $30 to $80 for bottoms that are mostly stretch jersey. \nADAY : The direct-to-consumer brand is dedicated to making quality workout clothes and athleisure in simple, efficient designs and sophisticated performance fabrics, like the adored \"Throw and Roll\" leggings that have Olympic bonded seams (and a waitlist to purchase). \nNola Activewear : The fitness branch of Addition Elle makes workout clothes and athleisure for sizes 12 through 26, with most prices coming in under $100. Head here for basics — like supportive sports bras, tees, and puffer jackets — and check out the reversible leggings to get the most bang for your buck. \nTracksmith : Tracksmith is a really simple brand that was built — like it'll tell you on the website — out of love for running. The draw here is quality apparel that's not flashy or overly \"sport\" feeling; just good-looking, functional clothes for both casual weekend runners and marathoners alike. \nBeyond Yoga : Yoga clothes are arguably what Beyond Yoga is best known for, but like the name implies, there's a lot more to shop here, including a dedicated maternity section, on-trend athleisure, and cozy loungewear. \nKoral : The best-sellers page on Koral's website includes a surprisingly vast selection of \"liquid-like\" leggings that have a lamé appearance in higher-performing fabrics. That pretty much sets the aesthetic tone for the brand, which leans heavily into sexy, strappy, and trendy athleisure that you can also wear to the gym (or out to the club).",

      "text": "\nNike has unveiled its first pair of commercialised self-lacing shoes, the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0. They will go on sale this winter in the US at select retail locations. Starting November 28, you will be able to book an appointment to try them out (and presumably to buy them), through the \"Reserved for You\" section of the Nike+ app. The HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes will cost $720 (~£580).\n\"When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten,” explained Tiffany Beers, the project’s technical lead. Nike actually refers to the technology as \"adaptive lacing\" rather than \"self lacing\" because there are two buttons on the side of the shoe that allow you to tweak how loose or tight the laces are. In the theory, the laces will then be held in that position, preventing your laces from coming undone while running, slam dunking, or otherwise exerting yourself.\nRead 7 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "Reddit \nThe holidays are fast approaching and if you’re still thinking of the perfect gift to give a geeky, or at least pop culture savvy, friend, then Nike might have just the thing. Although we are still sadly still years away from the self-lacing shoes inspired by Back to the Future, the sports brand is offering the next best thing: shoes that can at least tighten themselves. And you won’t have to wait years to get them either, as the Nike Hyperadept 1.0 pair will reportedly be out in the market in just a few weeks. \nThe Hyperadept 1.0, which was announced just back in March, is actually a more affordable consumer version of the Nike MAG, a limited, and expensive, edition of McFly’s shoes from the film. The MAG idea has been around for quite a few years now, forever teasing fans, before finally becoming available late last year. With the Hyperadept, that dream will also become reality for more people. Somewhat. \nThe shoes have laces but they don’t time themselves. They’re already set in place, in fact. The magic, or science rather, is how these laces tighten themselves whenever you put the shoes on. When you put them on for the first time, though, you’ll have to let it learn your comfy setting by simply pressing two buttons. Afterwards, you can let it do all the work for you. \nHi-tech shoes like these will undoubtedly have a high price, right? In fact, it was believed that the pair would cost $1,000. While some might actually be willing to pay that for a piece of history, it just won’t sell, literally even, for consumers. Fortunately, that price might actually just be a huge misunderstanding. \nInstead, according to rapper and actor Jacques Slade , the Nike Hyperadept 1.0 will actually cost only $720. Still pricey, but a huge price cut nonetheless. And best of all, it’s already coming 1st December, just two weeks more of waiting. Story Timeline",

      "text": "$720 - Self-Lacing Nike HyperAdapt Trainer to Be Available From December 1 Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Update: The self-lacing Nike HyperAdapt shoes will be available from December 1, 2016. They will retail at a whopping $720. Learn more about the cutting-edge sneaker in our original post from March below. At this week's Nike Innovation Summit, all eyes initially were on the big Mercurial Superfly V reveal and the all-new anti-clog tech the brand showcased there . But the event also oversaw the world premiere of Nike's first-ever mass-market 'self-lacing' shoe, and it turned to none other than Cristiano Ronaldo to show off the new Nike HyperAdapt 1.0. Ein von Cristiano Ronaldo (@cristiano) gepostetes Video am 16. Mär 2016 um 11:59 Uhr “Innovation at Nike is not about dreaming of tomorrow. It’s about accelerating toward it,” says Tinker Hatfield. “We’re able to anticipate the needs of athletes because we know them better than anybody. Sometimes, we deliver a reality before others have even begun to imagine it.” Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 The new self-lacing Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes were unveiled in three initial colorways. The new Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 trainers introduce what Nike calls \"adaptive lacing.\" “When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten,” explains Tiffany Beers, Senior Innovator, NIKE, Inc., and the project’s technical lead. “Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it’s perfect.” The potential of adaptive lacing for the athlete is huge, Hatfield adds, as it would provide tailored-to-the-moment custom fit. “It is amazing to consider a shoe that senses what the body needs in real-time. That eliminates a multitude of distractions, including mental attrition, and thus truly benefits performance.” Read more about how Nike's designers came up with the HyperAdapt adaptive lacing technology in detailed news release . Set to be available in three initial paint jobs from December 1, 2016, the Nike HyperAdapt will cost approximately $720. What do you think of the Nike HyperAdapt? Could we see similar tech in football footwear in the future? Share your thoughts below.",

      "text": "Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 Self-Lacing Sneakers Price and Release Date Revealed Will later be available from Nike+ app and select Nike outlets Company unveiled shoes in March this year Nike earlier claimed future shoes will allow automatic adjusting \nLast year, Nike gave us a glimpse of its limited edition self-lacing shoes Nike Air Mag 2015 (aka 2015 Nike Mag) and it was everything that a fan of Sci-Fi movie 'Back to the Future Part II' ever wanted. The company then went on to develop Nike Air Mag 2016 (aka 2016 Nike Mag) but once again due to its limited production, most people could not get access to the self-lacing shoes. Both the 2015 and 2016 Nike Mag models had a limited production run of 89 pairs each, and were made available as part of contests. Now, it seems that many fans will be able to finally realise their dream at a price that's not too exorbitant, as Nike has confirmed that its upcoming self-lacing shoes HyperAdapt 1.0 will cost $720 (roughly Rs. 48,700) - earlier speculation had pegged prices at $1,000. \nNike unveiled HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes in March earlier this year. The power-lacing shoes essentially allow users to adjust the fitting of the shoe by just pressing buttons, located on the side. Now, the company has said that the shoes will be released in the US on December 1. The shoes will be available through Nike Soho store and the Nike+ ClubHouse. \"Additionally, a small group of Nike+ app users will have limited early access on November 28. These users will be notified through the Nike+ app \"Reserved for You\" system, and offered the opportunity to purchase the shoe,\" the company said in its news post .\nIn terms of colour options, the shoes will be available in Black/ White-Blue Lagoon and Metallic Silver/ Black-White variants. Later in December, the shoes will be available by the Nike+ app as well as \"select Nike doors in the US,\" the company said. \nIn present state of the shoes, users have to manually adjust the grip by using the buttons. The company earlier claimed that in future versions of its self-lacing shoes, manual adjusting will be replaced by automatic adjusting by the shoe.",

Here, the kicks come with a bevy of material upgrades and boast premium leather construction along with the likes of a ripstop nylon tongue and texturized overlays that aren't only scuff-resistant, but are water-repellant, too. Best of all, the design comes draped in a clean \"Triple Black\" motif.\nCapped off with reflective boot lacing, this rugged rendition of the tennis classic is available now via NSW stockists like END. in the UK.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "The highly anticipated Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 release is nearing, and those who hope to get their hands on a pair will have to be comfortable putting down some pretty serious cash.\nThe black/white/blue lagoon colorway will be available Dec. 1 at the Nike Soho store and the Nike+ ClubHouse in New York where customers can test the sneakers out and purchase a pair for $720. The price tag is hefty, but it’s no surprise given that years of testing went in to creating the innovative self-lacing sneakers. Related 11 Stocking Stuffers for the Sneakerhead in Your Life \nCustomers won’t be able to simply walk into the store to get a pair — information on booking appointments will become available on Nike.com and the Nike+ App. A small group of Nike+ users will gain early access on Nov. 28 and will be notified via the app’s reservation system.\nFollowing the initial release on Dec. 1, both the black/white/blue lagoon and metallic silver/black/white colorways will release through the Nike+ App and in select retailers later in December.\nThe Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 in metallic silver/black/white. Courtesy of Nike. In September, more details were revealed on how the shoe functions.  Wired magazine was given in-depth access to the design process led by Nike designers Tinker Hatfield and Tiffany Beer. The sneakers have a motorized lacing system made from nylon bands on the sides of the shoe that tighten or expand with the push of a button.\nThe battery can last for about two weeks, at which point it needs to be charged for three hours. The company says that it is already working on versions that can adapt to the foot automatically, eliminating the need for the buttons on the current version.\nWant More? \nBella Hadid Is the Newest Member of the Nike Family \nRonnie Fieg Addresses Rumored Nike Collaboration on Social Media \n5 Things to Know About the Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ ",

      "text": "Nike's Self-Lacing Shoes Price & Release Date; HyperAdapt 1.0 Will Be On Sale At $720 By Charity Marces   09:23 am If there's a pair of footwear that deserves the title of power shoes, then, Nike's self-lacing sneakers may be just it.(Photo : WIRED/YouTube) \nBack in our childhood days, we wish our shoes can tighten themselves, and now, with Nike's self-lacing shoes, that just turned from fiction to fact. The future-styled Nike Mag was certainly a dream footwear, but it cost an absurd amount of money. Luckily, Nike had once again blown our minds when they unveiled its first \"self-lacing\" shoe in another silhouette, and with a lower price.Nike's self-lacing shoes have a signature adaptive fit. The concept basically forms a symbiotic relationship between the feet and the shoes. The design of Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 is based on an algorithmic pressure equation, equipped with a pressure sensor that automatically tightens the straps until it senses resistance as noted by Wired . Advertisement \nThe Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 is more than just a luxury it is engineered to solve the most common problems of many athletes, the undue pressure of the foot caused by tight tying. This futuristic project was led by Senior Innovator Tiffany Beers. She explains that Nike's self-lacing shoes feature two buttons on the side allowing the wearer to adjust the perfect fit. \nAccording to Nice Kicks , the person behind Nike's self-lacing shoes Tinker Hatfield announces that the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 will be available in three colorways: Black/White-Blue Lagoon and Metallic Silver/Black-White and the White/White-White. On Monday, Nike's official website posted an update on when and where it will be available. Nike's self-lacing shoes NIke HyperAdapt 1.0 in Black/White-Blue Lagoon will be in the NIKE+ ClubHouse and Nike Soho store at 45 Grand in New York. Customers can get their hands on the pioneered product from December 1 at a retail price of $720.00. \nAdditionally, customers who are using the NIKE+APP can avail of a limited early access on November 28 by appointment. They will be notified through the app's \"reserved for you\" system and claim their purchase at selected retail locations. © 2016 ParentHerald.com All rights reserved.

      "text": "Nike HyperAdapt autolacing shoes finally priced https://www.engadget.com/ .. 834367&index=0 Nike's self-lacing HyperAdapt shoes cost $720 Even if you couldn't get your hands on an ultra-exclusive pair of Power Mags, there is a way to get self-lacing Nikes in 2016. The company's HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes are about to go on sale, and they automatically adjust when the wearer puts them on. Despite internet rumors suggesting they would retail for more than $1,000 YouTuber Jacques Slade confirmed the correct price of $720. Nike confirmed the shoes will be available to a \"small\" group of Nike+ members on November 28th via the \"Reserved for You\" feature on its app. Otherwise, they will go on sale at two of its NYC locations December 1st. Later in the month, two colorways will go on sale via Nike+ and select locations, although the exact details have not been revealed. Damn.... Guess these won't be part of my collection anytime soon Tha754kid",

      "text": "Nike\n\nAttention all lazy fucks (That goes for yours truly as well): The future arrives sooner than you could imagine because humanity will have shoes that tie themselves in only a couple of weeks. \nThat’s right, actually spending the seemingly eternal 43 seconds tying your sneakers will soon be a thing of the past. However, right now this lackadaisical technological advancement will cost a pretty penny. \nNike’s HyperAdapt 1.0 self-lacing sneakers inspired from Back To The Future will go on sale on December 1. The shoes featuring adaptive lacing have a rather exorbitant retail price of $720.00. I gotta admit, the inner sloth in me would pay $1,500 for shoes that tie themselves because I’m just that lethargic. \nFrom Nike:\nWelcome the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0, the first performance vehicle for Nike’s latest platform breakthrough, adaptive lacing. The shoe translates deep research in digital, electrical and mechanical engineering into a product designed for movement. It challenges traditional understanding of fit, proposing an ultimate solution to individual idiosyncrasies in lacing and tension preference.\nFunctional simplicity reduces a typical athlete concern, distraction. “When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten,” explains Tiffany Beers, Senior Innovator, NIKE, Inc., and the project’s technical lead. “Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it’s perfect.”\n\nVia Engadget \n\nVia Engadget \n\nVia Engadget \n\nShare This\n",

      "text": "Nike's self-lacing HyperAdapt sneaker will cost you $720 by Ahiza Garcia @ahiza_garcia  14 AM ET Nike just brought 'Back to the Future' into reality Fans have been eagerly awaiting the debut of Nike's self-lacing sneakers. But they're not going to be cheap. \nNike revealed the price of its first self-lacing athletic shoe, the HyperAdapt 1.0 -- a whopping $720. \nThe sneaker will be available in two NYC stores on Dec. 1: Nike's Soho location and at the Nike+ ClubHouse. \nCustomers can book appointments there to try them on, or wait until later in December, when the sneakers are available at other stores and via the Nike+ app. \nSelect Nike+ app users will get early access to purchase the shoe on Nov. 28 for a limited time. \nThe black/white-blue lagoon color scheme will be available on Dec. 1 and a metallic silver/black-white sneaker will roll out later in the month. The Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 in black/white-blue lagoon. The Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 in metallic silver/black-white. \nRelated: Michael J. Fox sports 'Back to the Future' shoes on Kimmel show \nThe Nike HyperAdapt is the first self-lacing athletic shoe that Nike has released to the general public. \nIt's different from the Nike Mag, which is a replica of the self-lacing shoes worn by Marty McFly in \"Back to the Future.\" Only 89 pairs of the Nike Mag were made available to fans via lottery. \nThe HyperAdapt sneakers will be lightweight and rechargeable. The self-lacing mechanism of the shoe works more like automatic buckling -- the way snow boots or roller blades tighten. \n\"When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten. Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it's perfect,\" said Nike senior innovator Tiffany Beers. \nLED lights in the sole of the shoe display the shoe's battery life, which lasts about two weeks.   11:14 AM ET",

      "text": "Official imagery of the Nike LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 Midnight Navy have released, as it’s currently arriving at retailers nationwide. \nFlaunting a tonal look overall, the defining hue essentially covers the sneaker’s entire upper, straps and midsole unit. Premium elements are focalized on the toe which bear a suede finish, while light blue accents are seen on the insoles. An icy translucent outsole finishes off the bold, yet subdued profile. \nRetailing for $140, you can start purchasing this pair at select Nike retailers now. \nImages: Nike \nAuthor’s Take I really like this model in tonal iterations. The blacked-out pair is one of my favorites but this one is another solid option. If I played bball often, this would be my go-to sneaker for now. \n\nThe post Look Out For The Nike LeBron Zoom Soldier 10 Midnight Navy appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",
