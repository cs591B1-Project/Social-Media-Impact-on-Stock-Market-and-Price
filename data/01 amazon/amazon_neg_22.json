      "text": "Reddit \nAfter waiting nearly a year and a half, The Grand Tour is set to premiere on Amazon Prime video tonight. That means fans of former TopGear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond will once again be able to see them in front of the camera and behind the wheel. The show was first announced back in July of last year , and since then, Clarkson, May, and Hammond have been travelling the world filming episodes for their new series. \nThe Grand Tour will premiere first for viewers in the US, UK, Germany, and Japan. Amazon doesn’t give a specific time for the launch of The Grand Tour, but a tweet by CEO Jeff Bezos in which he says the show is premiering “tonight” seems to suggest that it’ll go live around midnight. The first episode of The Grand Tour will then go live for viewers in 200 other regions around the world next month. \nWith The Grand Tour, Amazon won’t be taking Netflix’s approach of dropping the entire first season in our laps all at once. Instead, a new episode of The Grand Tour will be released each Friday for twelve weeks. We have quite a bit of this show incoming as well, with Amazon previously announcing that Clarkson, May, and Hammond have signed on for three seasons of The Grand Tour. \nIt would seem that Amazon thinks The Grand Tour will convince some hold outs to sign up for Prime . That’s evidenced by the fact that Amazon is cutting the price of Prime to $79 in the US on November 18. The deal begins at midnight ET and goes until 11:59 PM ET the same day, and it should be noted that a promotion which sees Prime dropping to £59 in the UK is going on now . \nIt’ll be interesting to see if The Grand Tour can achieve the same sort of longevity as TopGear did with Clarkson, May, and Hammond hosting. The Grand Tour could end up being a a big win for Amazon Prime Video as it competes with other streaming sites like Hulu and Netflix. Even if you’re not planning on watching, though, it’s nice to have access to a discounted year of Prime.",

      "text": "Amazon Gearing Up for Global Launch of Streaming Video Service November 17, 2016, 03:41:  By Shalini Ramachandran \nAmazon.com Inc. is on the verge of a massive global rollout of its streaming video service, people familiar with the matter said, taking direct aim at rival Netflix Inc. \nThe e-commerce giant will likely expand its video service into about 200 countries, the people said. Amazon Prime Video is only available now in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, with a planned launch in India. \n\"Amazon has gone global,\" tweeted Mr. Clarkson. \"It's going to be available in 200 territories. That's pretty much everywhere.\" \nIn a YouTube video released Wednesday featuring Mr. Clarkson and co-stars Richard Hammond and James May, the stars read a distraught customer's letter complaining that he won't be able to watch \"The Grand Tour\" because \"Amazon Prime isn't available in my country...Screw you, 'Grand Tour,' screw you.\" The stars open a package from Amazon to find a letter saying that \"in December, we will be launching the show globally -- in over 200 countries around the world.\" \nAn Amazon website for the show noted that it will appear exclusively on Amazon. \nThat could mean Amazon would expand its video service into countries where its Prime shipping membership isn't available. Amazon video is currently only in a subset of the 12 countries where the shipping membership is available. \nA global expansion of Amazon's video service would introduce a formidable competitor to Netflix around the world. Netflix is already available world-wide except for a few countries with stringent regulations or authoritarian regimes like China and North Korea. The streaming juggernaut expanded into 130 countries in January, reaching a near-global footprint of more than 190 countries. \nWhile Netflix competes with many local players, Amazon's presence means another deep-pocketed tech company with strong Hollywood connections will be vying for a piece of the streaming market -- courting Western-oriented audiences who can typically afford to pay more for entertainment. \nLaura Stevens contributed to this article. \nWrite to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 11-17-161541ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

      "text": "Huawei MediaPad tablets available on Amazon before 2016 ends By 0 \nIf you live Stateside and have only been waiting for the latest MediaPad tablets, good news because the MediaPad M3, T1 7.0, and T1 10.0 models are readily available from Amazon. The top e-commerce website is bringing Huawei’s newest Android tablets with great specs and affordable price tags. \nPerhaps that most anticipated among the products ready is the MediaPad M3 that boasts of an 8.4-inch display screen, 2500 x 1600 pixel resolution, octa-core processor, 4GB RAM, 32GB onboard storage, and a 5100mAh battery. For only $299, you will receive this device with a metal body build, four speakers, and a fingerprint scanner. Tablet runs Emotion UI 4.1 and Android 6.0 Marshmallow. \nApart from the M3, there’s also the Huawei M2 and the MediaPad T1 models both schedule to be released before 2016 ends. The $349 M2 comes equipped with a 10.1-inch screen, 1920 x 1200 pixel resolution, HiSilicon Kirin 930 processor, 2GB RAM, 16GB onboard storage, 13MP primary camera, 5MP selfie shooter, and a 6600mAh battery.Unfortunately, this one only runs based on Emotion UI 3.1 Android 5.1 Lollipop. \nThe Huawei MediaPad T1 has two variants: a 7-inch and 9-6 inch models. The two are priced at $99 and $159, respectively. They’re low-powered and only runs Android 4.4 KitKat so we can’t say either one is recommended.",

      "title": "Best Family Games – Perfect for Christmas!",
      "text": "November 17, 2016 Filed Under: Amazon , Roundups by Lil' Luna 0 This post may contain affiliate links. Please read our disclosure policy here . Who here loves to play games? I’ve loved playing games for as long as I can remember and that’s probably because I’m a competitive person. When I had kids it was a little harder to play games (because I usually had at least two kids pawing at me the entire time), but now that my kids are a little older, we’ve started playing more games as a family. Sunday is one of these days we have more time to do this, but lately we’ve been finding so many fun games, that we try to squeeze them in any way we can (before dinner, after bath time, etc.) I often post videos of us playing games on Instagram Stories and I’m always asked the games we are playing. One of them is Tenzi (which is below), but it’s a new favorite that even our 5 year old can play with us. Other family favorites include Spot It , Cover Your Assets , Apples 2 Apples . I’ve compiled a collection of all our favorite games and hope this helps as you look for games for your own family to play. We also like to buy at least 1 or 2 games each year to give at Christmas, and in case you like to do the same thing, these are all available on Amazon. Although all these games had great reviews, I like to check them to make sure it’s a good fit for those in my family. 😉 Be sure to let us know some of your favorite games so we can check them out and add them to the list!!",

      "text": "  \nIf you’ve been in withdrawal from “proper” Top Gear, the new Amazon series The Grand Tour premiers on Friday, November 18th ( press release ). The three original stars Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May have gotten back together and there are 12 new episodes that will stream weekly. \nTo try and attract these new gearheads, Amazon is running a one-day Grand Tour Prime promotion on Friday 11/18 from 12:00am ET to 11:59pm PT. \nFor one-day only, eligible new Prime members can join Amazon Prime for $79 (normally $99) and save $20 on your first year’s membership in celebration of The Grand Tour launch. \nThe promotion does not apply to existing or gift memberships. I’m not 100% positive on this, but I believe that a “new” membership simply means that your account must not currently have an active Amazon Prime membership, not that you’ve never had one in the past. \nHere’s the official trailer on YouTube . If you already have Amazon Prime, here is the Grand Tour streaming link . I’ll definitely be watching. Share this:",

      "text": "Madeline Buxton A week from now, you'll be home for Thanksgiving, having your turkey and stuffing with a side of inevitable family angst. Your parents want help in the kitchen, your aunt could use a hand raking leaves, and your siblings are arguing over what to watch. Meanwhile, all you want to do is curl up with your dog and catch up on Gilmore Girls before the new episodes hit Netflix.With that goal in mind, we've pulled 15 Amazon buys that will help get you there or, at the very least, relieve some stress along the way. From a coffee cup that sends the perfect message (no words necessary) to escapist games and reads, these products will make Thanksgiving and the Black Friday aftermath much more bearable. Plus, Amazon has already kicked off its Black Friday deals , so there's nothing stopping you from scoring a deal or two right now. Begin Slideshow",

      "text": "Amazon Readying Launch of Global Streaming Video Service November 17, 2016, 03:55:  Amazon Sets Out for a Global Expansion of Video Streaming \nAmazon.com Inc. is on the verge of a massive global rollout of its streaming video service, people familiar with the matter said, taking direct aim at rival Netflix Inc. \nThe e-commerce giant will likely expand its video service into about 200 countries, the people said. Amazon Prime Video is only available now in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, with a planned launch in India. \nHints about the impending rollout leaked on Wednesday, when Jeremy Clarkson, the high-profile star of the forthcoming Amazon show \"The Grand Tour,\" said in tweets that viewers in 200 countries will be able to watch the automotive comedy show starting in December. The show debuts on Friday. \nIn a YouTube video released Wednesday featuring Mr. Clarkson and co-stars Richard Hammond and James May, the stars read a distraught customer's letter complaining that he won't be able to watch \"The Grand Tour\" because \"Amazon Prime isn't available in my country...Screw you, 'Grand Tour,' screw you.\" The stars open a package from Amazon to find a letter saying that \"in December, we will be launching the show globally—in over 200 countries around the world.\" \nAn Amazon website for the show noted that it will appear exclusively on Amazon. \nThat could mean Amazon would expand its video service into countries where its Prime shipping membership isn't available. Amazon video is currently only in a subset of the 12 countries where the shipping membership is available. \nA global expansion of Amazon's video service would introduce a formidable competitor to Netflix around the world. Netflix is already available world-wide except for a few countries with stringent regulations or authoritarian regimes like China and North Korea. The streaming juggernaut expanded into 130 countries in January, reaching a near-global footprint of more than 190 countries. \nWhile Netflix competes with many local players, Amazon's presence means another deep-pocketed tech company with strong Hollywood connections will be vying for a piece of the streaming market -- courting Western-oriented audiences who can typically afford to pay more for entertainment. \nLaura Stevens contributed to this article. \nWrite to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com  161555ET  ",

      "text": "Amazon Sets Out for a Global Expansion of Video Streaming November 17, 2016, 03:55:  \nAmazon.com Inc. is on the verge of a massive global rollout of its streaming video service, people familiar with the matter said, taking direct aim at rival Netflix Inc. \nThe e-commerce giant will likely expand its video service into about 200 countries, the people said. Amazon Prime Video is only available now in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, with a planned launch in India. \nHints about the impending rollout leaked on Wednesday, when Jeremy Clarkson, the high-profile star of the forthcoming Amazon show \"The Grand Tour,\" said in tweets that viewers in 200 countries will be able to watch the automotive comedy show starting in December. The show debuts on Friday. \nIn a YouTube video released Wednesday featuring Mr. Clarkson and co-stars Richard Hammond and James May, the stars read a distraught customer's letter complaining that he won't be able to watch \"The Grand Tour\" because \"Amazon Prime isn't available in my country...Screw you, 'Grand Tour,' screw you.\" The stars open a package from Amazon to find a letter saying that \"in December, we will be launching the show globally—in over 200 countries around the world.\" \nAn Amazon website for the show noted that it will appear exclusively on Amazon. \nThat could mean Amazon would expand its video service into countries where its Prime shipping membership isn't available. Amazon video is currently only in a subset of the 12 countries where the shipping membership is available. \nA global expansion of Amazon's video service would introduce a formidable competitor to Netflix around the world. Netflix is already available world-wide except for a few countries with stringent regulations or authoritarian regimes like China and North Korea. The streaming juggernaut expanded into 130 countries in January, reaching a near-global footprint of more than 190 countries. \nWhile Netflix competes with many local players, Amazon's presence means another deep-pocketed tech company with strong Hollywood connections will be vying for a piece of the streaming market -- courting Western-oriented audiences who can typically afford to pay more for entertainment. \nLaura Stevens contributed to this article. \nWrite to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com  161555ET  ",

Share story Mike Rosenberg Seattle Times business reporter \nVulcan Real Estate has sold another one of Amazon’s South Lake Union headquarters offices, this time to two New York-based investment firms in a $244 million deal. \nPaul Allen’s company, which built the Amazon Phase VII office at 400 Ninth Ave N, announced Thursday that it has sold the property to Tristar Capital and RFR Holding. \nThe 12-story building features Sam’s Tavern on the ground floor, 313,000 square feet of office fully leased by Amazon above and an art installation outside of suspended blue and white spheres with suction cup-like features. \nIt opened last year as part of a broader Amazon expansion built by Vulcan. Like many new offices in the neighborhood, the site used to be a parking lot and a small building. Most Read Stories",

      "text": "34.75 USD \nAmazon.com Inc.'s cloud-computing business made a quiet strategy shift that could emerge as another one of the company's classic sneak attacks to gobble more power. \nAmazon Web Services announced late Wednesday a change in what is effectively an app store for business software. Just as iPhone users can download Candy Crush Saga from their iTunes accounts, a company that pays for AWS's computing network to run its website can also buy other companies' technology to use in tandem, such as New Relic Inc.'s cloud software to pinpoint technical hiccups on websites. AWS tracks the amount of software the customer uses and charges for all of it on a single bill. Happy Clouds Revenue at Amazon Web Services has soared and is set to top $12 billion this year -- nearly 10% of Amazon's total sales Source: Amazon filings and R.W. Baird estimate (for Q4 2016) \nAWS has operated this type of software store for several years, although the new changes make it much more appealing both for Amazon's partners and potential customers. Finding and buying software through AWS streamlines the process for potential business customers. New Relic and other companies that use AWS as a middleman can land more customers than they might on their own. Amazon makes more money through fees it collects on the software sales. It's a win all around. \nThis type of marketplace -- a consolidated bazaar for independent companies' products ---is not novel. In consumer technology, the app stores for iPhone and Android are marketplaces. EBay Inc. is a marketplace. AWS's main competitors, Microsoft Corp.'s Azure and Google Cloud at Alphabet Inc., also have marketplaces for other companies' business software. \nThe biggest difference is all those other companies are not Amazon. Raking It In The Amazon Web Services cloud operation generates roughly 30% segment operating margins, in contrast to the retail business's dinky margins Source: Bloomberg Note: Segment operating margin excludes stock compensation and some other costs. \nAWS is the 800-pound gorilla in corporate cloud computing, so any moves it makes have a magnified impact. And the e-commerce part of Amazon already operates one of the most successful marketplace businesses in the world. \nYou may not notice when you put those bed sheets and running shoes into your Amazon shopping cart, but the goods might not be sold by Amazon but rather by one of the millions of merchants who use Amazon as a conduit. Amazon executives say this e-commerce marketplace business is one of the three pillars of the company, along with AWS and the Prime shopping club. The outside sellers account for nearly half of the total number of items sold on Amazon. And those marketplace sales will generate close to $15 billion in revenue, or 19 percent of Amazon's total North America revenue this year, R.W. Baird has estimated. Marketplace Moolah Sales by independent merchants that sell products on Amazon are estimated to generate nearly one-fifth of the company's total North America revenue this year Source: R.W. Baird estimates \nThat's not to say AWS will ever become as big a middleman for independent software as Amazon's retail business has become for products. AWS introduces many new offerings, and some of them never seem to go anywhere. But AWS appears to be taking its software store seriously, and the size of Amazon's marketplace in retail shows the potential opportunity for AWS. Already, AWS generates more than half of Amazon's total operating income, and its fat margins are a salve for the e-commerce business's dinky profits. \nYou can imagine AWS improving its software marketplace by adapting tricks from Amazon's e-commerce business. If Amazon recommends cheese graters to people who are buying paring knives, then AWS in theory can recommend outside companies' data-analysis software to shoppers who are purchasing AWS's corporate databases. \nAWS has shaken up the entire business technology sector, even though it captures just a fraction of the $450 billion companies spend on software each year. When Amazon's e-commerce operation started more than 20 years ago, it sold only books and then spread its tentacles into nearly every consumer product and service imaginable. In 20 years, we could look back at AWS's marketplace as the seeds of another world-spanning expansion, this time for corporate technology.

      "text": "Blog This \nAmazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ:AMZN), today announced five new solar farms across the Commonwealth of Virginia that will bring a total of 180 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy capacity onto the grid before the end of 2017. Amazon Solar Farm US East 2, Amazon Solar Farm US East 3, Amazon Solar Farm US East 4, and Amazon Solar Farm US East 5 are four individual facilities, each with a capacity of 20MW, located in New Kent, Buckingham, Sussex, and Powhatan counties respectively. Amazon Solar Farm US East 6 is a 100MW facility in Southampton County, Virginia. These five new solar farms join the company’s existing project, Amazon Solar Farm US East, an 80MW facility in Accomack County, Virginia which is already in production. Amazon worked with developers Virginia Solar LLC and Community Energy Solar on the projects, and will further collaborate with an affiliate of Richmond, Va.-based Dominion Resources, Inc. (NYSE:D) to own and operate the solar farms long term. Combined, the six solar farms are expected to generate more than 580,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy annually, making Amazon in its support of the AWS Cloud the largest corporate backer of solar projects east of the Mississippi River. For more information, go to https://aws.amazon.com/sustainability . \nTo date, AWS has enabled 10 renewable energy projects in the United States that will deliver a grand total of 2.6 million MWh of energy annually onto the electric grid powering AWS data centers located in the AWS US East (Ohio) and AWS US East (N. Virginia) Regions – enough to power almost 240,000 homes. The projects that are currently producing energy include the 150MW Amazon Wind Farm Fowler Ridge in Indiana and the 80MW Amazon Solar Farm US East in Virginia. The 208MW Amazon Wind Farm US East in North Carolina is on track to begin generating electricity by the end of 2016. In addition to Amazon Solar Farms US East 2 - 6, other projects that will be in production prior to the end of 2017 include the 100MW Amazon Wind Farm US Central and the 189MW Amazon Wind Farm US Central 2 in Ohio. \nAWS continues to make progress toward its long-term goal of powering the AWS Cloud with 100 percent renewable energy. Last month, AWS announced it expects to exceed its 2016 goal of 40 percent renewable energy by the end of this year and set a new, near-term goal to be powered by 50 percent renewable energy by the end of 2017. AWS is pursuing a number of initiatives to achieve these goals including enabling renewable energy projects, ongoing innovation in its facilities and equipment to increase energy efficiency, and advocating at the federal and state levels for policies aimed at creating a favorable renewable energy environment, such as the bipartisan HB 1305 in Virginia that incentivizes investment in utility-scale solar energy projects. \n“We continue to ramp our sustainability efforts in areas where availability of renewable energy sources is low or proposed projects are stalled, and where the energy contribution goes onto the same electric grid that powers AWS data centers,” said Peter DeSantis, Vice President, Infrastructure, AWS. “By enabling 10 utility scale renewable projects in the US to date, we are well positioned to meet our latest goal of 50 percent renewable energy powering the AWS global infrastructure by the end of 2017. That said, we are nowhere near done. We will continue to make progress toward our 100 percent goal and have many exciting initiatives planned.” \n“Solar energy is a central part of the comprehensive renewable energy approach Virginia needs to keep costs low for businesses, families, and taxpayers as we build a new Virginia economy,” said Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe. “I applaud Dominion and Amazon for collaborating in a way that will benefit our economy, our energy mix and our environment. We will continue to support collaborations and innovative approaches to bring low-cost, renewable energy to all corners of the Commonwealth.” \n“The expansion of Dominion’s alliance with Amazon is great for Dominion, AWS, and the Commonwealth of Virginia,” said Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Dominion. “It helps meet AWS’s renewable needs, it expands Virginia’s clean electric generation fleet, and it creates economic development opportunities in largely rural communities.” \nBeyond the sustainability initiatives focused on powering the AWS global infrastructure, Amazon is pursuing several other clean energy and energy efficiency activities across the company. Examples of other projects include Amazon Wind Farm Texas – a 253MW wind farm in Scurry County, Texas – green rooftops, and the District Energy Project that uses recycled energy for heating Amazon offices in Seattle.

      "text": "Voice-control: is it possible to compete against the GAFA? With the launch of Echo, Amazon has taken the smart home market by storm with more than 1.6 millions of units sold in less than 2 years. Nobody, not even Apple or Google, had anticipated Amazon’s Echo tremendous success.\nApple pioneered with Siri in 2011, its take on voice-assistant.\nBut as often with pioneers, Siri was far from perfect failing to understand even simple messages, unable to deal with accents and promising more than what the level of maturity of its technology could really perform.\nMore importantly Siri suffered from two major flaws.\nFirst, Apple underestimated the need of having a few, clearly identified, use-cases so people start using Siri on a daily basis. Willing to showcase how advanced was its technology, Apple promoted Siri has a voice-assistant able to perform almost any task: get movie information and reviews, find local restaurants, book concerts and events, get directions, answer factual question or perform web search.\nUnclear benefits + a nascent technology: Siri has been mainly used to send text messages.\nSecondly Siri was not hands-free. And embedded in an individual device you carry with you to use in public spaces. Siri was seen as an additional service of the smartphone, seen by Apple and all other tech giants as the keystone of our digital life. No smartphone. No digital life.\nYet Smartphone is both a keystone and a dead end. Amazon imagined something completely different with Echo. Instead of adding a new service to its existing line up of products or developing an app of Android or iOS, Amazon took the bet of creating a specific hardware for its voice-assistant.\nSmartphone are individual devices you use in public. Amazon Echo is a collective (family) device you use in private. No need to keep your phone in your pocket. No need to press a key to activate its voice-service. Accessible pricing. A great mix.\nAlso Amazon benefits from voice-recognition progresses made during the last 5 years. When Siri was launched, its accuracy was lower than 70%. It can now reach 95%.\nYet, is Amazon Echo perfect? Will Amazon Echo and Google Home take them all? Before we try answering this question, let’s go back to 2014 and remember Jibo. Jibo was then one of the most exciting project on Indiegogo (more than $2 million campaign). And was able to attract important VCs rounds ($52 millions). Jibo has all: style, a very attractive interface and most of all, it conveys emotions.\nYet where is Jibo now? Not yet on the market. Too much features, some very complex to integrate, willingness to always add more and most of all nor a precise audience (For kids? For seniors? For developers?) nor matching obvious use-cases (Telling stories to kids? Monitoring elderlies? Personal assistant for adults?).\nNow that many other products are launching on the market, how will Jibo react? Well if they manage to clearly define what they stand for and select one primary usage and target, they can be extremely successful.\nGoogle’s response to Amazon Echo with Google Home hits one of Echo’s major weakness: it’s total lack of style. Compared to Amazon’s black-emotionless cylinder, Google Home fits better into any home décor. Google Home also marks a kind of “philosophical change” for Google. Google philosophy has been just about accessing to the information fast, not about personalities or conversations.\nNevertheless, both Google Home and Amazon Echo suffer from the exact same limitations:\n1. They both promise access to thousands of services. Yet very few of them are useful. The first thing people do with Amazon Echo is to use a timer to cook their egg (85%). Then the listen to music, they set an alarm or check time. Indeed, who’s willing to play Jeopardy every day?\n2. Both are one-way-speaking assistants. If you don’t ask, they don’t do anything. They are passive. Not pro-active. They thus shouldn’t even be called assistant but actuators.\n3. They only rely on voice. Yet voice sometimes is not enough. You many need additional content (images, view) both for information purposes or to convey emotion.\n4. They are home devices. Intended to be used by anyone in the family. A collective product, not individual. Yet they are associated with a single account, a single calendar, a single set of preferences, a single music account. Not family friendly.\nThe choice of doing less to do it better. There is zero doubt, a startup, whatever its funding or the quality of its team, or even a larger consumer electronics manufacturer has zero chance in a head-to-head competition against Apple, Amazon, Google or Microsoft (Cortona is the little name of their own offer).\nBut actually would it even make sense to offer a similar product?\nCreating a new product brings 3 questions in mind: Why people would pay for this product? How does it ease people’s life? What shall be done so people keep using it (so it doesn’t end up on one of the garage shelves!)?\nKeep it simple : Promoting a new product is always energy-consuming. Engineering and promoting a product addressing several needs, targeting several categories of potential users is nothing but a nightmare. You ended up more features to more features while blurring what you’re offering and missing what’s essential to you core consumers. Your unique selling proposition must be obvious to understand. Not more. For example, Bonjour is a digital alarm clock designed to smooth your morning routine. Period. In product design, less is always better: it allows you to stay focus on your objectives, to refine all user scenarios, preserve development efforts to polish your user experience. This is why Bonjour offers an unmatched voice-interaction: you can’t order a Pizza from Bonjour but it will be able to handle human-like conversation with you on everything related to your morning and bedtime routine. Observe and identify problems: As reported in a recent Harvard study, your morning mood affect your whole day. Those 60 minutes after wake-up are crucial. Before starting designing Bonjour, we’ve spent more than a year studying people’s morning habits. We found common routines and common needs. Like the fact we’re all checking a number of apps on our phone during the first half hour of our day. That’s why Bonjour brings content effortlessly: weather, traffic, news, agenda, commute time, fitness plan… all when they do matter. Make it personal: We are entering an era where electronic devices start to be able to match their behavior according to their user habits thanks to data analysis, machine learning and AI. Passive devices such as Echo or Google Home fundamentally lack this ability. Bonjour makes suggestions before you even ask. It anticipates: it can wake you up earlier if congestion is detected on the way to your office. It can check your fitness goal, your calendar and the weather to suggest to wake up earlier for a great morning run. It can connect to other smart home devices to check your home safety, even displaying the live-feed of your security camera if someone’s entering your garden. Rely on visual archetype : People are eager to adopt a product if they instantly recognize what this product is made for. Form follows function. That’s why Bonjour looks like a familiar alarm clock. Never forget: devil is the details : Bonjour is not an inert device. It not a robot either. It is a presence. It’s always here, always alive. A popular saying in French is “Simple comme Bonjour” Think global user experience, not trends : Voice is a trending subject. It will clearly deeply impact the way we interact with technology tomorrow. But voice isn’t enough. That’s why Bonjour combines sound and visual feedbacks. Not only its screen allows Bonjour to express its personality, it displays useful information too (traffic map, safety cam). But even more important: know what you stand for! The name “assistant” implies personalization. Personalization occurs by collecting a large amount of data about each individual user — from his voice (the way he says things), to what music he listens to, or what he controls in his house. His hobbies. Or his calendar.\nBonjour collects and analyzes personal data. They are solely used for the purposes of providing custom services. They will never ever be shared or sold.\nThis is fundamentally different!\nThe point of Amazon or Google assistants isn’t about making our lives better. It’s not even about making money selling their devices. It’s about controlling data.\nGoogle has excelled at getting advertising dollars through search. But Facebook is challenging its model with a better set of advertising tools (we share so much data on Social Media!). So Google needs more personal data to compete against Facebook. Google Home or Google Assistant exist for that single purpose.\nGoogle is also directly challenged by one of his main customer, Amazon.\nAmazon is great at getting shoppers. If Amazon starts to precisely know our buying preferences, then ads become useless: just ship me what I need. If wrong, let me return it. Hassle free. Huge savings for Amazon plus increased turnover. Welcome Alexa. Welcome Dot. Dash. Tap, etc.\nBonjour is live on Kickstarter . Its initial funding goal was reached in less than 8 hours. Since then several thousands of backers have joined Bonjour’s journey and shared this vision. Join now.\nBonjour. Friendly. Helpful. Smart.\nJerome Schonfeld & Greg Gerard —  Holi founders",

      "title": "The Sun Shines on Amazon’s Cloud in Virginia",
      "text": "November 17, 2016 at 16:23 PM EST The Sun Shines on Amazon’s Cloud in Virginia AWS today announced five new solar farms across the Commonwealth of Virginia. \nAmazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company ( NASDAQ:AMZN ), today announced five new solar farms across the Commonwealth of Virginia that will bring a total of 180 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy capacity onto the grid before the end of 2017. Amazon Solar Farm US East 2, Amazon Solar Farm US East 3, Amazon Solar Farm US East 4, and Amazon Solar Farm US East 5 are four individual facilities, each with a capacity of 20MW, located in New Kent, Buckingham, Sussex, and Powhatan counties respectively. Amazon Solar Farm US East 6 is a 100MW facility in Southampton County, Virginia. These five new solar farms join the company’s existing project, Amazon Solar Farm US East, an 80MW facility in Accomack County, Virginia which is already in production. Amazon worked with developers Virginia Solar LLC and Community Energy Solar on the projects, and will further collaborate with an affiliate of Richmond, Va.-based Dominion Resources, Inc. ( NYSE:D ) to own and operate the solar farms long term. Combined, the six solar farms are expected to generate more than 580,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy annually, making Amazon in its support of the AWS Cloud the largest corporate backer of solar projects east of the Mississippi River. For more information, go to https://aws.amazon.com/sustainability . \nTo date, AWS has enabled 10 renewable energy projects in the United States that will deliver a grand total of 2.6 million MWh of energy annually onto the electric grid powering AWS data centers located in the AWS US East (Ohio) and AWS US East (N. Virginia) Regions – enough to power almost 240,000 homes. The projects that are currently producing energy include the 150MW Amazon Wind Farm Fowler Ridge in Indiana and the 80MW Amazon Solar Farm US East in Virginia. The 208MW Amazon Wind Farm US East in North Carolina is on track to begin generating electricity by the end of 2016. In addition to Amazon Solar Farms US East 2 - 6, other projects that will be in production prior to the end of 2017 include the 100MW Amazon Wind Farm US Central and the 189MW Amazon Wind Farm US Central 2 in Ohio. \nAWS continues to make progress toward its long-term goal of powering the AWS Cloud with 100 percent renewable energy. Last month, AWS announced it expects to exceed its 2016 goal of 40 percent renewable energy by the end of this year and set a new, near-term goal to be powered by 50 percent renewable energy by the end of 2017. AWS is pursuing a number of initiatives to achieve these goals including enabling renewable energy projects, ongoing innovation in its facilities and equipment to increase energy efficiency, and advocating at the federal and state levels for policies aimed at creating a favorable renewable energy environment, such as the bipartisan HB 1305 in Virginia that incentivizes investment in utility-scale solar energy projects. \n“We continue to ramp our sustainability efforts in areas where availability of renewable energy sources is low or proposed projects are stalled, and where the energy contribution goes onto the same electric grid that powers AWS data centers,” said Peter DeSantis, Vice President, Infrastructure, AWS. “By enabling 10 utility scale renewable projects in the US to date, we are well positioned to meet our latest goal of 50 percent renewable energy powering the AWS global infrastructure by the end of 2017. That said, we are nowhere near done. We will continue to make progress toward our 100 percent goal and have many exciting initiatives planned.” \n“Solar energy is a central part of the comprehensive renewable energy approach Virginia needs to keep costs low for businesses, families, and taxpayers as we build a new Virginia economy,” said Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe. “I applaud Dominion and Amazon for collaborating in a way that will benefit our economy, our energy mix and our environment. We will continue to support collaborations and innovative approaches to bring low-cost, renewable energy to all corners of the Commonwealth.” \n“The expansion of Dominion’s alliance with Amazon is great for Dominion, AWS, and the Commonwealth of Virginia,” said Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Dominion. “It helps meet AWS’s renewable needs, it expands Virginia’s clean electric generation fleet, and it creates economic development opportunities in largely rural communities.” \nBeyond the sustainability initiatives focused on powering the AWS global infrastructure, Amazon is pursuing several other clean energy and energy efficiency activities across the company. Examples of other projects include Amazon Wind Farm Texas – a 253MW wind farm in Scurry County, Texas – green rooftops, and the District Energy Project that uses recycled energy for heating Amazon offices in Seattle.

      "text": "2016 State of The Cloud \nYou might think Amazon Web Services would have chilled out in the month before its big Re:Invent conference. After all, that show, which takes place at the end of November, is when the cloud provider typically shows off a bonanza of new products and features. \nBut Christmas has come early in October, at least for people who are looking to run hybrid cloud deployments with AWS. Here's the rundown of important news you may have missed. VMware and Amazon team up \nThe big bombshell for the month was a partnership between AWS and VMware . The latter company is going to launch a managed service that will make it easy for people to migrate workloads from on-premises hardware to the public cloud and back again, using VMware's vSphere management software. INSIDER Review: Container Wars: Rocket v. Odin v. Docker \nIt's a move that will make it easier for businesses to try out hybrid cloud configurations with a single control plane that administrators are already familiar with from managing their current infrastructure. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy looked like a cat who had just swallowed a canary sitting on stage next to Vmware CEO Pat Gelsinger during a San Francisco press event to announce the partnership. But both men seemed like they got something important out of the deal. Amazon gets a hybrid cloud strategy, while VMware gets a way to easily integrate its products with a leading cloud provider — and probably make a whole bunch of money in the process. \nRight now, it's in closed beta, expected to launch next year. A new service helps move workloads to the cloud \nBut what if you don't want to use VMware's managed service? Well, AWS has a Server Migration Service that's supposed to help lift and shift workloads. To use it, administrators install a connector that will analyze their virtualized server environment and collect information about the instances they’re using. \nAfter that, they can use the AWS Management Console to replicate those instances up to the cloud as Amazon Machine Images stored in the AWS Elastic Block Store service. After that, admins can spin up what should be a replica of the same instance running on-premises in AWS. The x1.16xlarge arrives for big, but not huge workloads \nSometimes, you just need a stupendously massive hunk of compute power. That's what the x1.32xlarge instance offers -- 128 virtual CPU cores, 1952GiB of RAM and 2 1920GB SSDs. (1 GiB is roughly equivalent to 1.074GB.) \nIt's among the most expensive compute instances Amazon offers and has been useful for customers looking to run applications like SAP HANA. \nBut what about customers who want half the power? Amazon's swooping in with the appropriately named x1.16xlarge , which sports (you guessed it) 64 vCPU cores, 976GiB of RAM, and one 1920GB SSD. It's priced at half the cost of its larger sibling. \nBoth of those instance types are also now available in Amazon's Mumbai, Seoul and US GovCloud regions, in addition to the seven other regions worldwide that also run x1 instances. AWS opens for business in Ohio \nGeographic expansion is the name of the game for cloud providers, and AWS pushed its datacenter footprint forward with the launch of a new US-East region based in Ohio . It's part of a one-two punch of cloud regions available in the eastern part of America, alongside Amazon's longstanding US-East region based in Virginia. \nAt launch, the region supports a wide variety of AWS services, including EC2, Elastic Block Store, Aurora, DynamoDB, Snowball, Kinesis and Lambda. Netflix's former architect goes to work at its preferred cloud provider \nAdrian Cockroft made a name for himself as a Cloud Architect at Netflix and then as a Technical Fellow at Battery Ventures. The soft-spoken Brit was a fixture at cloud conferences, and he's now been pulled into Amazon's orbit as its VP of Cloud Infrastructure. \nAWS CTO Werner Vogels said in a blog post that Cockroft will be working with product teams, consulting with customers about their cloud architecture, and helping out open-source communities.

      "text": "The Sun Shines on Amazon’s Cloud in Virginia\nAmazon Web Services kicks off five new solar projects across the Commonwealth of Virginia for a grand total of six solar farms in the state and 10 renewable energy projects globally\nBy supporting 260MW of solar generation capacity in Virginia, Amazon becomes the largest corporate backer of solar projects east of the Mississippi River\nAmazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ:AMZN), today announced five new solar farms across the Commonwealth of Virginia that will bring a total of 180 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy capacity onto the grid before the end of 2017. Amazon Solar Farm US East 2, Amazon Solar Farm US East 3, Amazon Solar Farm US East 4, and Amazon Solar Farm US East 5 are four individual facilities, each with a capacity of 20MW, located in New Kent, Buckingham, Sussex, and Powhatan counties respectively. Amazon Solar Farm US East 6 is a 100MW facility in Southampton County, Virginia. These five new solar farms join the company’s existing project, Amazon Solar Farm US East, an 80MW facility in Accomack County, Virginia which is already in production. Amazon worked with developers Virginia Solar LLC and Community Energy Solar on the projects, and will further collaborate with an affiliate of Richmond, Va.-based Dominion Resources, Inc. (NYSE:D) to own and operate the solar farms long term. Combined, the six solar farms are expected to generate more than 580,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy annually, making Amazon in its support of the AWS Cloud the largest corporate backer of solar projects east of the Mississippi River. For more information, go to https://aws.amazon.com/sustainability .\nTo date, AWS has enabled 10 renewable energy projects in the United States that will deliver a grand total of 2.6 million MWh of energy annually onto the electric grid powering AWS data centers located in the AWS US East (Ohio) and AWS US East (N. Virginia) Regions – enough to power almost 240,000 homes. The projects that are currently producing energy include the 150MW Amazon Wind Farm Fowler Ridge in Indiana and the 80MW Amazon Solar Farm US East in Virginia. The 208MW Amazon Wind Farm US East in North Carolina is on track to begin generating electricity by the end of 2016. In addition to Amazon Solar Farms US East 2 - 6, other projects that will be in production prior to the end of 2017 include the 100MW Amazon Wind Farm US Central and the 189MW Amazon Wind Farm US Central 2 in Ohio.\nAWS continues to make progress toward its long-term goal of powering the AWS Cloud with 100 percent renewable energy. Last month, AWS announced it expects to exceed its 2016 goal of 40 percent renewable energy by the end of this year and set a new, near-term goal to be powered by 50 percent renewable energy by the end of 2017. AWS is pursuing a number of initiatives to achieve these goals including enabling renewable energy projects, ongoing innovation in its facilities and equipment to increase energy efficiency, and advocating at the federal and state levels for policies aimed at creating a favorable renewable energy environment, such as the bipartisan HB 1305 in Virginia that incentivizes investment in utility-scale solar energy projects.\n“We continue to ramp our sustainability efforts in areas where availability of renewable energy sources is low or proposed projects are stalled, and where the energy contribution goes onto the same electric grid that powers AWS data centers,” said Peter DeSantis, Vice President, Infrastructure, AWS. “By enabling 10 utility scale renewable projects in the US to date, we are well positioned to meet our latest goal of 50 percent renewable energy powering the AWS global infrastructure by the end of 2017. That said, we are nowhere near done. We will continue to make progress toward our 100 percent goal and have many exciting initiatives planned.”\n“Solar energy is a central part of the comprehensive renewable energy approach Virginia needs to keep costs low for businesses, families, and taxpayers as we build a new Virginia economy,” said Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe. “I applaud Dominion and Amazon for collaborating in a way that will benefit our economy, our energy mix and our environment. We will continue to support collaborations and innovative approaches to bring low-cost, renewable energy to all corners of the Commonwealth.”\n“The expansion of Dominion’s alliance with Amazon is great for Dominion, AWS, and the Commonwealth of Virginia,” said Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Dominion. “It helps meet AWS’s renewable needs, it expands Virginia’s clean electric generation fleet, and it creates economic development opportunities in largely rural communities.”\nBeyond the sustainability initiatives focused on powering the AWS global infrastructure, Amazon is pursuing several other clean energy and energy efficiency activities across the company. Examples of other projects include Amazon Wind Farm Texas – a 253MW wind farm in Scurry County, Texas – green rooftops, and the District Energy Project that uses recycled energy for heating Amazon offices in Seattle.

      "text": "Does the Cloud Free up the Enterprise? \nYou might think Amazon Web Services would have chilled out in the month before its big Re:Invent conference. After all, that show, which takes place at the end of November, is when the cloud provider typically shows off a bonanza of new products and features. \nBut Christmas has come early in October, at least for people who are looking to run hybrid cloud deployments with AWS. Here's the rundown of important news you may have missed. VMware and Amazon team up \nThe big bombshell for the month was a partnership between AWS and VMware . The latter company is going to launch a managed service that will make it easy for people to migrate workloads from on-premises hardware to the public cloud and back again, using VMware's vSphere management software. \n[ Also on CIO.com: The dirty dozen: 12 cloud security threats ] \nIt's a move that will make it easier for businesses to try out hybrid cloud configurations with a single control plane that administrators are already familiar with from managing their current infrastructure. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy looked like a cat who had just swallowed a canary sitting on stage next to Vmware CEO Pat Gelsinger during a San Francisco press event to announce the partnership. But both men seemed like they got something important out of the deal. Amazon gets a hybrid cloud strategy, while VMware gets a way to easily integrate its products with a leading cloud provider — and probably make a whole bunch of money in the process. \nRight now, it's in closed beta, expected to launch next year. A new service helps move workloads to the cloud \nBut what if you don't want to use VMware's managed service? Well, AWS has a Server Migration Service that's supposed to help lift and shift workloads. To use it, administrators install a connector that will analyze their virtualized server environment and collect information about the instances they’re using. \nAfter that, they can use the AWS Management Console to replicate those instances up to the cloud as Amazon Machine Images stored in the AWS Elastic Block Store service. After that, admins can spin up what should be a replica of the same instance running on-premises in AWS. The x1.16xlarge arrives for big, but not huge workloads \nSometimes, you just need a stupendously massive hunk of compute power. That's what the x1.32xlarge instance offers -- 128 virtual CPU cores, 1952GiB of RAM and 2 1920GB SSDs. (1 GiB is roughly equivalent to 1.074GB.) \nIt's among the most expensive compute instances Amazon offers and has been useful for customers looking to run applications like SAP HANA. \nBut what about customers who want half the power? Amazon's swooping in with the appropriately named x1.16xlarge , which sports (you guessed it) 64 vCPU cores, 976GiB of RAM, and one 1920GB SSD. It's priced at half the cost of its larger sibling. \nBoth of those instance types are also now available in Amazon's Mumbai, Seoul and US GovCloud regions, in addition to the seven other regions worldwide that also run x1 instances. AWS opens for business in Ohio \nGeographic expansion is the name of the game for cloud providers, and AWS pushed its datacenter footprint forward with the launch of a new US-East region based in Ohio . It's part of a one-two punch of cloud regions available in the eastern part of America, alongside Amazon's longstanding US-East region based in Virginia. \nAt launch, the region supports a wide variety of AWS services, including EC2, Elastic Block Store, Aurora, DynamoDB, Snowball, Kinesis and Lambda. Netflix's former architect goes to work at its preferred cloud provider \nAdrian Cockroft made a name for himself as a Cloud Architect at Netflix and then as a Technical Fellow at Battery Ventures. The soft-spoken Brit was a fixture at cloud conferences, and he's now been pulled into Amazon's orbit as its VP of Cloud Infrastructure. \nAWS CTO Werner Vogels said in a blog post that Cockroft will be working with product teams, consulting with customers about their cloud architecture, and helping out open-source communities.

      "text": "Amazon is doubling down on streaming video.\nThe Seattle tech giant is “on the verge of a massive global rollout” of its Prime streaming video service, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.\nThat aligns with what Jeremy Clarkson of Top Gear, which inked a massive deal with Amazon last year , tweeted on Wednesday in regard to his new show Grand Tour. Clarkson said the show, which streams exclusively on Amazon for Prime members, will be available in 200 territories. The streaming service is only available in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria, and Japan, with India — where Amazon plans to spend $300 million on original content — coming soon.\nSo. People of Ireland, Canada, Australia and pretty well everywhere else. You WILL be able to watch the Grand Tour. Amazon has gone global.\n— Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 16, 2016 \nIt's going to be available in 200 territories. That's pretty much everywhere.\n— Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 16, 2016 \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who doesn’t tweet much, sent out his own message on Twitter about the Grand Tour on Thursday. Bezos also noted that the show will be available “globally” in December.\nLong wait is over… Clarkson, Hammond, May are back… #TheGrandTour premieres tonight in UK, US, DE, JP. And globally in Dec. pic.twitter.com/dfQjGGuDFW \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \nIt’s not yet clear if other Amazon video content will also be available beyond the existing countries.\nStill, Amazon seems poised to further challenge industry leader Netflix, which is now available in more than 190 countries after a big expansion this past January .\nIn July, Amazon said it planned to double down on its spending for video content during the second half of 2016 compared to the same period last year. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky added that the company will “nearly triple our offering to customers of new Amazon original TV shows and movies” compared to last year. \nOlsavsky talked about the video spend and increased costs again during last month’s earnings call after Amazon missed Wall Street’s expectations.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon and Netflix have used different strategies for their original content, with Amazon focusing on regional original series’, and Netflix making shows for global audiences.\nAward-winning shows like “Transparent,” “Man in the High Castle,” and “Mozart in the Jungle” have helped Amazon Video quickly become a competitor in the video streaming space. The model was pioneered by Netflix, with original series like “House of Cards” and “Orange is the New Black.”\nThis year, Amazon was nominated for 16 Emmy Awards, up from 12 last year ; Netflix had 54 nominations, up 20 from last year, and good enough for third overall (HBO had 94 and FX had 58). Amazon ended up winning six awards on Sunday, while Netflix won nine.\nOriginally, Amazon’s original content was only available to annual Prime subscribers who pay $99 per year. In April, Amazon began offering a monthly $8.99 Prime subscription so members could access its video streaming service. The move was a direct swing at Netflix and its popular monthly subscription plan.\nIn his annual letter to shareholders , Bezos noted Amazon’s original shows, noting how they “feed the Prime flywheel.”\n“These shows are great for customers, and they feed the Prime flywheel – Prime members who watch Prime Video are more likely to convert from a free trial to a paid membership, and more likely to renew their annual subscriptions,” Bezos wrote.\nIn the shareholders letter, Bezos also noted that Prime is one of three pillars of success at Amazon, in addition to its e-commerce marketplace business and cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services. Some say that Amazon’s video arm could ultimately become the company’s fourth pillar.\nThis past May, Amazon also announced a new service that competes with YouTube called Amazon Video Direct , a self-service option that lets content creators upload video for distribution through Amazon Prime Video or other methods, including ad-supported video, rental, purchase or subscription.",

      "text": "By Tonya Garcia, MarketWatch\nWal-Mart is starting to see results from its investments in e-commerce\nWal-Mart Stores Inc. is reaping the rewards of its digital investments, which could position it as a force to be reckoned with in the online battle against the rest of the retail competition.\n\"For holiday and fourth quarter, we expect Walmart to continue to excel on multiple fronts, particularly online where we expect sales to continue to accelerate on a percentage basis, with a growth rate approaching 30% likely as it leverages its store network to handle online orders, especially via its buy online/pick-up in-store capability, as well as increasing benefits from Jet.com,\" said Charlie O'Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody's.\nWal-Mart (WMT) reported a 20.6% increase in global e-commerce sales on a constant-currency basis for the third quarter. Moody's puts Wal-Mart's online sales growth on a base of $14 billion to $15 billion, without a full quarter of Jet.com results.\nTotal revenue for the third quarter was $118.2 billion, up from $117.4 billion last year, but falling short of the FactSet consensus of $118.6 billion. Earnings per share were 98 cents, down from $1.03 last year, but ahead of the 96-cent FactSet estimate.\nWal-Mart shares are down 4.4% in Thursday trading.\nSee also: Wal-Mart sales fall short as profit declines 8.2% (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wal-mart-sales-fall-short-as-profit-declines-82-2016-11-17)\n(https://w.graphiq.com/w/6tVZ4ZZEodL)\nWal-Mart added eight million SKUs (stock keeping units) to the website over the past three months, Chief Executive Doug McMillion said Thursday in his prepared remarks. And e-commerce added 50 basis points to the retailer's third-quarter U.S. same-store sales figure, \"which is our largest contribution yet,\" he added.\nWalmart U.S. same-store sales increased 1.2% in the third quarter, driven by a 0.7% traffic increase, Wal-Mart said.\nWal-Mart announced a strategic alliance with Chinese e-commerce company JD.com this summer, (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wal-mart-jdcom-deal-includes-incentives-for-deeper-partnership-2016-06-29) that included the sale of its Yihaodian website to JD.com.\nSee also: Wal-Mart's deal with China's JD.com may be copied by others (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wal-marts-deal-with-chinas-jdcom-may-be-copied-by-others-2016-06-21)\nThe partners announced that they were launching three new initiatives in late October (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wal-mart-and-jdcom-launch-new-initiatives-in-china-2016-10-20).\nWal-Mart has also invested in New Dada, a Chinese on-demand logistics and grocery e-commerce platform, McMillon said in his remarks. New Dada is making two-hour delivery service from 45 Walmart locations possible.\nSee also: Amazon's big rival in e-commerce is Wal-Mart (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-is-battling-wal-mart-on-one-side-and-microsoft-on-the-other-2016-11-07)\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/kWR7vfuteHH)\nWal-Mart announced that it was acquiring Jet.com (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wal-mart-announces-3-billion-jetcom-acquisition-2016-08-08) for $3 billion in August. Jet.com founder Marc Lore took over Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations earlier this month (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wal-mart-shakes-up-e-commerce-executive-ranks-2016-11-01).\nNeil Saunders, chief executive of retail research agency and consulting firm Conlumino, believes Wal-Mart's U.S. online growth \"is now well above the overall market,\" which indicates they're adding share. But there are other factors playing a role in the result.\n\"[T]he figures include half a quarter of sales from recently acquired Jet.com, which flatters the results somewhat,\" said Saunders in a note published Thursday. \"Nonetheless, we believe that Walmart is now on much more positive trajectory in terms of both its e-commerce strategy and results.\"\nSee also:Wal-Mart to take on Amazon with upgrades to its brick-and-mortar stores (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wal-mart-to-take-on-amazon-with-upgrades-to-its-bricks-and-mortar-stores-2016-10-10)\n\"We view the same-store sales growth as evidence that Wal-Mart's investment in labor, e-commerce and marketing its value message are working,\" said The Buckingham Research Group in a note published Thursday. \"However, some investors may be disappointed that traffic and comps decelerated slightly from fiscal second-quarter 2016.\"\nWal-Mart highlighted food deflation, weather and currency impacts among the headwinds.\nWal-Mart shares are up 11.8% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index is up 6.7% for the same period. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 8.3% for 2016 so far.\n-Tonya Garcia;\n 1530ET\n ",

      "text": "By Shalini Ramachandran\nAmazon.com Inc. is on the verge of a massive global rollout of its streaming video service, people familiar with the matter said, taking direct aim at rival Netflix Inc.\nThe e-commerce giant will likely expand its video service into about 200 countries, the people said. Amazon Prime Video is only available now in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, with a planned launch in India.\nHints about the impending rollout leaked on Wednesday, when Jeremy Clarkson, the high-profile star of the forthcoming Amazon show \"The Grand Tour,\" said in tweets that viewers in 200 countries will be able to watch the automotive comedy show starting in December. The show debuts on Friday.\n\"Amazon has gone global,\" tweeted Mr. Clarkson. \"It's going to be available in 200 territories. That's pretty much everywhere.\"\nIn a YouTube video released Wednesday featuring Mr. Clarkson and co-stars Richard Hammond and James May, the stars read a distraught customer's letter complaining that he won't be able to watch \"The Grand Tour\" because \"Amazon Prime isn't available in my country...Screw you, 'Grand Tour,' screw you.\" The stars open a package from Amazon to find a letter saying that \"in December, we will be launching the show globally -- in over 200 countries around the world.\"\nAn Amazon website for the show noted that it will appear exclusively on Amazon.\nThat could mean Amazon would expand its video service into countries where its Prime shipping membership isn't available. Amazon video is currently only in a subset of the 12 countries where the shipping membership is available.\nA global expansion of Amazon's video service would introduce a formidable competitor to Netflix around the world. Netflix is already available world-wide except for a few countries with stringent regulations or authoritarian regimes like China and North Korea. The streaming juggernaut expanded into 130 countries in January, reaching a near-global footprint of more than 190 countries.\nWhile Netflix competes with many local players, Amazon's presence means another deep-pocketed tech company with strong Hollywood connections will be vying for a piece of the streaming market -- courting Western-oriented audiences who can typically afford to pay more for entertainment.\nLaura Stevens contributed to this article.\nWrite to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com\n 17, 2016 15:41 ET (20:41 ",

Amazon Prime Video is only available now in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan, with a planned launch in India.\nHints about the impending rollout leaked on Wednesday, when Jeremy Clarkson, the high-profile star of the forthcoming Amazon show \"The Grand Tour,\" said in tweets that viewers in 200 countries will be able to watch the automotive comedy show starting in December. The show debuts on Friday.\n\"Amazon has gone global,\" tweeted Mr. Clarkson. \"It's going to be available in 200 territories. That's pretty much everywhere.\"\nIn a YouTube video released Wednesday featuring Mr. Clarkson and co-stars Richard Hammond and James May, the stars read a distraught customer's letter complaining that he won't be able to watch \"The Grand Tour\" because \"Amazon Prime isn't available in my country...Screw you, 'Grand Tour,' screw you.\" The stars open a package from Amazon to find a letter saying that \"in December, we will be launching the show globally—in over 200 countries around the world.\"\nAn Amazon website for the show noted that it will appear exclusively on Amazon.\nThat could mean Amazon would expand its video service into countries where its Prime shipping membership isn't available. Amazon video is currently only in a subset of the 12 countries where the shipping membership is available.\nA global expansion of Amazon's video service would introduce a formidable competitor to Netflix around the world. Netflix is already available world-wide except for a few countries with stringent regulations or authoritarian regimes like China and North Korea. The streaming juggernaut expanded into 130 countries in January, reaching a near-global footprint of more than 190 countries.\nWhile Netflix competes with many local players, Amazon's presence means another deep-pocketed tech company with strong Hollywood connections will be vying for a piece of the streaming market -- courting Western-oriented audiences who can typically afford to pay more for entertainment.\nLaura Stevens contributed to this article.\nWrite to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com\n 15:55 ET (20:55 ",

      "text": "Posted November 17 2016 — 11:35 AM EST See also 10 stunning moments from Megyn Kelly's memoir \nFox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new book, Settle for More , was just released this week, but it’s already attracting a flurry of negative reviews on Amazon . Most of these short, one-star reviews appear to come from supporters of Donald Trump, spurred on by posts on pro-Trump Reddit forums and writing things like, “Megyn Kelly has a disastrous agenda between the covers of her new book…her main agenda is to trash President-elect Trump” and “I bet she is just angry because Trump rejected her.” \nMany also come with the kind of one-word declarations favored by the president-elect’s Twitter account, i.e. “Boring!” and “Terrible!” Most of the reviews are not “verified purchases,” meaning they’re from people who didn’t actually buy the book on Amazon. At the time of this writing, the book has 134 one-star reviews (56 percent of the total reviews submitted). Only two of them are from verified purchases. \nTrump and Kelly have clashed in the past , most notably when the then-candidate responded to Kelly’s critical debate questions by declaring “she had blood coming out of her wherever.” Since then, though, the two seem to have patched things up: Trump appeared on Kelly’s prime-time special Megyn Kelly Presents , and Kelly appeared on Live! With Kelly the morning after Election Night telling Americans to “keep an open mind” about Trump. ",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIf you've ever found that picking up your phone and typing was just too much of a hassle to send a text, you're in luck. AT&T has announced that beginning tomorrow, its customers will be able to send SMS messages from any Alexa-powered device. \nYou'll need to activate the skill through the Alexa app, of which there are well over a thousand available now, such as Jeopardy and Capital One bill payments . In fact, you can even voice-activate skills now, so beginning tomorrow, you can simply say, \"Alexa, activate the AT&T Send Message skill.\" You don't even have to say \"please\", because Alexa has no feelings. \nAlexa-powered devices most famously include the Echo, Echo Dot, and Tap, but the digital assistant is also available on all Fire TV and Fire TV Stick devices, and most recently, on the new Fire HD 8 tablets . If you're looking for one on the cheap, Amazon is bound to have some deals on its in-house hardware this holiday season, especially with Black Friday coming up. Tags",

      "text": "When Amazon reported net sales of $107 billion for 2015, it had fantastic growth in North America to thank. Over the past three years, the Seattle-based company, already the dominant force in the region, has added $22 billion in sales in North America. Last year the market contributed 60 percent of all of its sales.\nOverseas, the company (which we ranked no. 1 on our 2016 list of the 50 Smartest Companies ) has been selling more too, but making less money doing so. In part, profits have been reduced by currency differences, but Amazon has also been carrying out an expensive plan to expand its fulfillment capacity around the world.\nThat global investing is starting to pay off in India, according to a report in the  Wall Street Journal . Amazon has said it would invest $5 billion in the market, which today has only 40 million online shoppers out of a population of 1.2 billion. As a result, it’s now gaining on local rival Flipkart Internet, long the largest online retailer in India.\n\nAmazon appears to have learned some valuable lessons in its struggle in the otherwise booming Chinese online shopping market, and it is now determined not to repeat them. The company never managed to establish a strong presence against local giants Alibaba and JD.com, which CEO Jeff Bezos has blamed on not doing enough to customize its offerings to the local market.\nIn India, the company still prides itself on its fulfillment prowess and recommendation engine, two features it’s known for around the world. But it has also been trying out local adaptations, such as motorcycle delivery men who will accept cash on delivery—useful for the many people in India who do not use credit cards.  \n(Read more: Wall Street Journal , Recode , “ 50 Smartest Companies, 2016 ”)",

      "text": "The coordinated marketing blitz dubbed Azon Blitz drew people from all over the world to Amazon to get “Everyday Heroes\" which caused it to hit #1 on the Amazon bestseller list in less than nine hours. Thanks to so many sales, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta will be receiving thousands of dollars in charitable donations.\nPeachtree City, GA (PRWEB) November 17, 2016\nThe November 11, 2016 Azon Blitz marketing campaign performed exactly according to plan, catapulting “Everyday Heroes: A Collection of Motivational & Inspirational Stories from around the World” to the top of Amazon’s bestseller list. But the impact of that concentrated effort is still rippling, with the book – penned by a collective of heroic co-authors – remaining sky-high in the rankings for 7 days so far. As a result, charitable dollars continue to rack up for Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, which the blitz organizer chose as the recipient of all proceeds generated.\nAs of press time, “Everyday Heroes” was still sitting strongly in the number one position for Philosophers Biography—7 days after it launched on Amazon. Conservatively estimating then, the book has no signs of slowing down yet. And all the proceeds from those sales are all going to Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.\nWhy is this a conservative estimate? “Everyday Heroes\" hit #1 on the Amazon bestseller list in less than nine hours and it has been sitting pretty at #1 New Releases in Philosophers Biographies ever since. Above and beyond that, on blitz day it also reached #4 in Amazon’s Movers and Shakers category, #6 in New Release Motivation, #8 in New Release Self-Help and #23 in Overall Motivational.\nThis inspirational, motivational and instructional collection contains the brilliance of these Everyday Heroes: Matt Bacak, Brian Evans, Alex Arnold, Ani Catino, Anthony McCarthy, Ben Bressington, Chris Hickman, Daryl Hill, David Asarnow, David Perdew, David Wright, Deanna Grayly,Diane Conklin, Donna Kennedy, Dushka Zapata, Eileen Forrestal, Gary Kissel, Helga Zelinski, Henry Gold, Jill Nieman Picerno, Jocelyn Jones, Kathleen Gage, Lee Nazal, Lou Brown, Milton Brown, Nick James, Pat Slattery, Paul Kelly, Paul Wakefield, Philip Perrin, Rosanne D'ausilio, Ph.D., Sharvin Exubrio, Sherman Ragland, Suzanne Edwards and Tom Cone.\n“First off, none of this would have been possible without my fantastic team of co-authors,” explains the campaign’s organizer. “But all our blitz participants played a major role in making this happen as well. They came together, spreading the word among their friends, family, and new fans. They are my heroes on this campaign.”\nBrian T. Evans, one of the motivators behind the blitz’s success, points out, “It’s not too late if you still want to get your copy and spread the word. More book sales equal more money for our charity, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.” Another success driver, Henry Gold, emphasizes, “We know that the reason we reach the impossible is really because we stay strong together.” “Everyday Heroes” and the people behind it drive this point home.\nFor more information on the co-authors and promoters behind the chart-topping success of “Everyday Heroes, contact the organizer, Matt Bacak, at 404-537-1425.

      "text": "Amazon’s biggest new show, The Grand Tour, premieres today, with the team formerly of the BBC’s Top Gear traveling in expensive cars around the world. It is rumored to cost a whopping £4.5 million ($5.6 million) a show—and Jeremy Clarkson is reportedly making $12.4 million a year to host.\nHe’s not the only streaming-video star taking home a hefty paycheck. The Hollywood Reporter notes that Amazon is paying Robert De Niro $750,000 for each of the 20 episodes of an upcoming series. Jonah Hill and Emma Stone will get $350,000 per episode to star in an upcoming Netflix show called Maniac. Back on premium cable, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson makes $450,000 per episode on the HBO comedy Ballers. (HBO, it should be noted, is trying to be more like Netflix .)\nThese figures are insane, sure. Netflix, Amazon, and HBO are digging deep into their pockets to secure the best talent. HBO is expected to spend about $1.8 billion this year, 20% more than in 2015, while Netflix plans to spend a staggering $6 billion on content next year and Amazon has boosted its content budget too.\nBut these platforms also pay more for talent upfront, because actors and creators miss out on the ancillary income they would typically get from syndication—when a show is sold on to other networks. That has all changed with streaming. Netflix, in particular, has kept an iron grip on the global rights to most of its programming, rarely releasing it outside of the platform , which means actors don’t get their usual cut of other revenue streams that would have come down the road.\nAn example: the US sitcom Friends still makes about $1 billion a year in syndication revenue for Warner Bros. Each of the show’s core cast members—Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer—takes home about 2% of that, which translates to roughly $20 million per year in syndication income. Each. And that’s for a show that ended 12 years ago.\nDe Niro’s flat fee of $15 million for 20 episodes at Amazon seems like a bargain in comparison.\nStreaming services like Netflix and Amazon account for that when they negotiate deals. Most of Netflix’s deals now have a flat “buy out,” according the Hollywood Reporter. “That’s why the checks are so big,” Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos reportedly said. “We are negotiating for what the backend would be.”\nThe same is true with films, an earlier Hollywood Reporter story showed. Few Netflix movies go to theaters and those that do are released online the same day, which limits the audience who will pay to see them in theaters. When Netflix is negotiating for the rights to films, it often buys out the cut that actors and creators would get from box-office profits, which is known as profit participation. Amazon offers a small, exclusive window for its theatrical releases, so it likely doesn’t have to buy out the profit participants.\nThis means that Netflix and Amazon’s deep pockets are driving up costs for everyone. Why would someone like De Niro wait for his $15 million when he can get it upfront and work with other A-list talent?",

      "text": "I’ve recently touted Amazon’s Echo and Dot over the Google Home smart speaker . The main reason the Amazon Echo family is better is due to its release almost two years ago while Google’s smart speaker just came out. It’s integrated with much more products. \n“Amazon Echo is ahead of the curve in terms of voice recognition technology and functionality,” said Jeff Bradley, senior vice president, Device and Network Services Marketing of AT&T . \nFor those of you who have AT&T wireless service and an Amazon Echo or Echo Dot , you will be able to send text messages through the Alexa assistant starting November 19th. \n“Alexa, send mom a text message saying, ‘I love you. Happy Birthday'” It’s as simple as that. The messages will show up on your existing phone number and smartphone. For those of you who don’t have a Echo or Echo Dot, you can grab one at Amazon.com where they are priced at $179 and $49 respectively. Starting tomorrow, www.att.com and AT&T retail stores will also be selling the Amazon smart speakers so you can check out just how awesome they are for yourself. \nAT&T is the first carrier to integrate its services through the Alexa assistant and is further proof the battle for your home is a big one. \nKeep in mind the Amazon Alexa assistant can do a whole lot more too. Not only can it play music and read audiobooks, but it can also control smart home devices like the Nest thermostat, Philips Hue Lights, and your entertainment center too. With the Echo or Echo Dot, you have the power to send texts and control you home simply by using your voice.",

      "text": "  \nAmazon’s Alexa assistant can do a lot. It can play music, answer questions, call a cab, and help manage your calendar. Starting Friday, it can also send out text messages for AT&T mobile customers . \nAlexa uses skills to help users do a number of things. Companies can access the Alexa Skills Kit to create their very own skill to allow consumers to interact with paired devices using only the power of speech. \nMore: Can we talk? Mobile users enjoy voice assistance but want more accuracy \nAT&T is the first to create a skill to utilize Alexa for texting. Customers can use the Alexa app to save up to 10 contacts at a time and then use their voice to dictate and send SMS messages to those people. Users must input their contacts before using the skill as Alexa connects with their app, not the user’s contact list. In addition, Alexa-enabled devices like the Amazon Echo ($149) and the Dot Echo ($49) will be available from AT&T both online and in retail stores. \nWhile it is not clear exactly how the texting will work and whether Alexa will repeat your message back to you before sending it, AT&T has already including a stipulation in its fine print that any miscommunications are the fault of Alexa and Amazon. So if your text message comes out garbled, you cannot blame AT&T. For this reason, it is perhaps best to save Alexa messaging for short and simple texts and use your thumbs to type out the important ones. \nThis skill can be used on any Alexa-enabled device such as the Echo or the Echo Dot. The skill is only available for AT&T users, but it is a preview of what Alexa could be capable in the future as a virtual assistant. Hopefully, other mobile carriers will step up and create their own skills soon. Also watch: Control4 Announces Integration With Amazon Alexa Devices",

      "text": "Amazon Prime Membership Discount Deal Go \nOK, get ready! Not only do we have the big list of Amazon Black Friday Deals , but I found the OFFICIAL Press Release from Amazon saying that there will be a Amazon Prime Membership Discount Deal for new members to Amazon Prime on Friday, 11/18! This is just the perfect timing so that you can get Prime before Black Friday and get Free 2-Day Shipping and exclusive Lightning Deals for Prime Members! \nThey are giving us this great opportunity to get a Prime 1 Year Membership for $79 which is 20% off the regular price starting Friday at 12:00am ET and ending at 11:59pm PT. Last year, you could even “gift” a membership to yourself if you already had one which means you MAY be able to get this price even if you already have prime! \nWith Amazon Prime, you will have access to thousands of online videos and shows that you can stream directly to your TV, Tablet or Phone and we usually see the BEST deals for Christmas on Amazon. I do a LOT of my shopping because it is just so easy :) Be ready to grab your Amazon Prime Membership Discount Deal and tell anyone you know who is looking to get Prime! \nAnd see my list of Amazon Black Friday Deals !",

(Jeff Scheid/Las Vegas Review-Journal) Follow @jeffscheid LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL \nAmazon is slated to expand its presence in Southern Nevada. \nThe company expects to begin operations by the summer of 2017 out of an 813,120 square-foot fulfillment center that is currently under construction off of North Lamb Boulevard just north of Interstate 15 in North Las Vegas. \n“This would be proposed for our non-sort facilities,” said Holly Sullivan, senior economic development manager at Amazon. “The best way I can describe it is for our medium-sized items: your DVD players, your computers.” \nThe fulfillment center would be operated by Amazon.com.kycd LLC, a subsidiary of Amazon.com. \nAmazon already operates a return center in Las Vegas that employs 900 full-time employees, a fulfillment center in Reno that employs about 600 full-time employees, as well as other “Amazon-affiliated companies that, combined, employ 4,900 full-time Nevadans. \nThe fulfillment center in North Las Vegas is slated to hire another 1,000 employees “within a few months of opening” in the summer. \nSullivan said Amazon considered Nevada based on, among other reasons, the availability and quality of talent, and the pro-business climate, among other factors. The decision to expand operations was largely influenced, she said, by the successful operation in Reno. \nGov. Brian Sandoval questioned Amazon’s average hourly wage of $14.64, which is below Nevada’a statutory requirement of a $21.35 average wage. \nSullivan said there are pathways for career advancement and upward mobility and also emphasized the company’s “commitment to hiring military veterans” at all Amazon.com facilities. \nThe Governor’s Office of Economic Development board approved about $1.8 million in tax abatements for Amazon..com.kycd LLC Thursday. The company is estimated to generate about $44.7 million in new tax revenue over ten years. Amazon is slated to make a capital investment of about $34 million that will largely go toward “high-end conveyor systems.” That figure does not include the construction of the building. \nIn other action Thursday, the board approved spending a total over $2.2 million in tax abatements in return for over $8.5 million in new tax revenue, including the following: \n• Sutherland Global Services Inc will receive approximately $475,794 in tax abatements for expanded operations in Las Vegas and is estimated to generate $24,375,304 in new tax revenue over 10 years. Sutherland Global Services offers an integrated set of back-office and customer front-office services. \n• The Honest Co. will receive approximately $816,190 in tax abatements and is estimated to generate $20,380,096 in new tax revenue over 10 years. The Honest Co. is a consumer goods company emphasizing non-toxic and eco-friendly household products. The company was founded by actress Jessica Alba. \n• TH Foods Inc. will receive approximately $2,245,531 in tax abatements and is estimated to generate $5,692,924 in new tax revenue over ten years. TH Foods Inc produces snack food products for customers worldwide, and the tax abatement application states that is it the only manufacturer in North America with the technology to make authentic Usuyaki (Japanese for thin and flat) style rice crackers. \n• CML Media Corp. (dba Mopro) will receive approximately $422,690 in tax abatements and is estimated to generate $29,002,624 in new tax revenue over 10 years. Mopro is a technology company that specializes in creating artificial intelligence driven websites for small businesses. \n• Zazzle Inc will receive approximately $407,385 in tax abatements and is estimated to generate an estimated $5,635,350 in new tax revenue over 10 years.

      "text": "November 17, 2016, 1:34 PM More Amazon merchants are fulfilling Prime orders themselves By Bloomberg News Prime-flagged product inventory increases with Amazon’s Seller Fulfilled Prime program. \n(Bloomberg)—Amazon.com Inc. is turning to merchants who sell on its marketplace and can ship quickly to expand Prime-eligible inventory. \nInventory available for delivery within two business days expanded by 6 million items under the Seller Fulfilled Prime program , the company announced Thursday. Amazon began testing the program in 2015 and formally rolled it out earlier this year. At the end of 2015, 500,000 SKUs flagged as \"Prime Eligible\" were shipped by their sellers, not Amazon. \nIt’s the latest sign the world’s biggest online retailer can’t build facilities quickly enough to meet demand for an ever-expanding assortment of goods that customers want delivered fast and free. Warehouse capacity issues and the cost of new facilities helped increase Amazon’s spending on order fulfillment 34% in the third quarter. The big expenses caused the Seattle-based company to miss analysts’ profit projections, driving down shares 8.8% since the results were reported Oct. 27 . \nAmazon’s revenue is projected to increase 28% to $137 billion this year, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The fast growth prompted the company to accelerate its warehouse building spree, with more than 15 fulfillment centers opening in California, Texas, Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey, Georgia and Florida that will collectively employ more than 12,000 workers. \nIn addition to adding capacity, Amazon introduced Seller Fulfilled Prime to take advantage of the warehouse space of its merchant partners. Amazon sells its own inventory as well as products owned by merchants who give the company a cut of each sale, similar to a consignment shop. Many of those merchants send their products to Amazon warehouses and pay the company extra to handle packing and shipping, called Fulfillment By Amazon, which lets their products be listed as Prime eligible. Seller Fulfilled Prime is a way to let select merchants get the Prime label on products without using Amazon’s facilities. Prime subscribers pay $99 a year for faster, free delivery in addition to other benefits such as access to the company’s video service. \nJeff McDonald, owner of Raw Paws Pet Food in Indianapolis, joined the program in August about a year after he began selling products on Amazon. His company had to pass a test by fulfilling 300 orders with little wiggle room for returns, defective products or late shipments, he said. \n\"It was a really hard approval process,\" he said. \nThe advantage is that he can now list all of the pet food and chew toys in his inventory as Prime eligible to see which ones are the most popular. \nEarlier this year, Amazon began restricting access to its warehouses due to capacity concerns and it changed its fee structure to penalize merchants who store slow-moving and off-season products during the busy holiday shopping period.

      "text": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff further distanced himself from Microsoft on Thursday, after cozying up to the company during the past two years.\nBenioff has a new friend now: Amazon.\nDuring Salesforce quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Benioff downplayed a question about Microsoft's growing presence in the CRM software market by simply turning up the rhetoric about sales.\n\"We look at Microsoft, we sold more CRM software this quarter than Microsoft sold in the last decade. It’s just empirical,\" Benioff said during the call with investors. \nOf course, we won't know for sure if that's a true statement. Salesforce had another strong quarter, recording $2.14 billion in revenue, mostly from the CRM space. Microsoft doesn't break out sales from its Dynamics CRM business, but it is believed to be much smaller and a distant fourth in the market.\nSalesforce \nBut what's most striking is Benioff's changed tone in his comments about Microsoft. Just last year, in Salesforce's 2015 third quarter earnings call, Benioff said he's \"excited\" about Microsoft, saying he had a \"great relationship\" with the company. Even during this year's July quarter, he said he's done \"great work\" with Microsoft.\nBut that's all over now.\nBenioff made it clear earlier this week that he's no longer a fan of the \"new\" Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella. Salesforce has historically had a contentious relationship with Microsoft, but the two companies suddenly became good friends after Nadella was named CEO in 2014, although the bromance seems all but over now.\nInstead, Benioff has turned to Amazon this year, striking a number of major deals. In May, Salesforce announced a $400 million deal to use AWS, while Amazon rolled out Salesforce's software company-wide. Salesforce said Amazon added even more Salesforce services this quarter, during the call with investors.\n“Amazon is a great win of the quarter as well. We formed a strategic relationship in Q1 as you all know, and in Q3 our relationship has expanded, and they added even more services throughout the company,\" Salesforce President and COO Keith Block said.\nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n",

Sahara Ave., the site of the former Citibank building, is seen on Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016, the same day the Governor’s Office of Economic Developmentl approved tax abatements for a handful of companies, including Sutherland Global Services. Jeff Scheid/Las Vegas Review-Journal Follow @jeffscheid By NICOLE RAZLAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL \nAmazon is slated to expand its presence in Southern Nevada. \nThe company expects to begin operations by the summer of 2017 out of an 813,120 square-foot fulfillment center that is currently under construction off of North Lamb Boulevard just north of Interstate 15 in North Las Vegas. \n“This would be proposed for our non-sort facilities,” said Holly Sullivan, senior economic development manager at Amazon. “The best way I can describe it is for our medium-sized items: your DVD players, your computers.” \nThe fulfillment center would be operated by Amazon.com.kycd LLC, a subsidiary of Amazon.com. \nAmazon already operates a return center in Las Vegas that employs 900 full-time employees, a fulfillment center in Reno that employs about 600 full-time employees, as well as other “Amazon-affiliated companies that, combined, employ 4,900 full-time Nevadans. \nThe fulfillment center in North Las Vegas is slated to hire another 1,000 employees “within a few months of opening” in the summer. \nSullivan said Amazon considered Nevada based on, among other reasons, the availability and quality of talent, and the pro-business climate, among other factors. The decision to expand operations was largely influenced, she said, by the successful operation in Reno. \nGov. Brian Sandoval questioned Amazon’s average hourly wage of $14.64, which is below Nevada’a statutory requirement of a $21.35 average wage. \nSullivan said there are pathways for career advancement and upward mobility and also emphasized the company’s “commitment to hiring military veterans” at all Amazon.com facilities. \nThe Governor’s Office of Economic Development board approved about $1.8 million in tax abatements for Amazon..com.kycd LLC Thursday. The company is estimated to generate about $44.7 million in new tax revenue over ten years. Amazon is slated to make a capital investment of about $34 million that will largely go toward “high-end conveyor systems.” That figure does not include the construction of the building. \nIn other action Thursday, the board approved spending a total over $2.2 million in tax abatements in return for over $8.5 million in new tax revenue, including the following: \n• Sutherland Global Services Inc will receive approximately $475,794 in tax abatements for expanded operations in Las Vegas and is estimated to generate $24,375,304 in new tax revenue over 10 years. Sutherland Global Services offers an integrated set of back-office and customer front-office services. \n• The Honest Co. will receive approximately $816,190 in tax abatements and is estimated to generate $20,380,096 in new tax revenue over 10 years.

      "text": "print Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff Salesforce \nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff further distanced himself from Microsoft on Thursday, after cozying up to the company during the past two years. \nBenioff has a new friend now: Amazon. \nDuring Salesforce quarterly earnings call on Thursday, Benioff downplayed a question about Microsoft's growing presence in the CRM software market by simply turning up the rhetoric about sales. \n\"We look at Microsoft, we sold more CRM software this quarter than Microsoft sold in the last decade. It’s just empirical,\" Benioff said during the call with investors. \nOf course, we won't know for sure if that's a true statement. Salesforce had another strong quarter, recording $2.14 billion in revenue, mostly from the CRM space. Microsoft doesn't break out sales from its Dynamics CRM business, but it is believed to be much smaller and a distant fourth in the market. \nSalesforce \nBut what's most striking is Benioff's changed tone in his comments about Microsoft. Just last year, in Salesforce's 2015 third quarter earnings call, Benioff said he's \"excited\" about Microsoft, saying he had a \"great relationship\" with the company. Even during this year's July quarter, he said he's done \"great work\" with Microsoft. \nBut that's all over now. \nBenioff made it clear earlier this week that he's no longer a fan of the \"new\" Microsoft under CEO Satya Nadella. Salesforce has historically had a contentious relationship with Microsoft, but the two companies suddenly became good friends after Nadella was named CEO in 2014, although the bromance seems all but over now. \nInstead, Benioff has turned to Amazon this year, striking a number of major deals. In May, Salesforce announced a $400 million deal to use AWS, while Amazon rolled out Salesforce's software company-wide. Salesforce said Amazon added even more Salesforce services this quarter, during the call with investors. \n“Amazon is a great win of the quarter as well. We formed a strategic relationship in Q1 as you all know, and in Q3 our relationship has expanded, and they added even more services throughout the company,\" Salesforce President and COO Keith Block said. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

      "text": "  08:26PM NEW YORK -- Amazon's has big Black Friday news, a Package X-Ray feature for its iPhone shopping app. The app can now leverage a customer's iPhone's camera to reveal the contents of an Amazon delivery without having to actually open up the package or hunt down tracking numbers.Amazon anticipates that during the holiday season a customer may receive many Amazon packages fairly regularly. The new feature will allow the customer to quickly sift through boxes to decide which ones they need to be opened right away and which can wait.The app will allow the customers to keep presents concealed before they are ready to start wrapping. They hope it will add convenience to Black Friday shopping this yearThe x-ray app will only work on packages tied to an Amazon account. Kids and spouses will no longer be able to take a sneak peek and ruin the surprise before holidays.Amazon Black Friday officially kicked off November 17th and is set to last longer than a month.Amazon released a short promo video showing how Package X-Ray works Related Topics:",

      "text": "Join Amazon Prime For Free – Thousands of Movies & Shows Anytime \nJust in case you missed the premiere on Jan. 4, Farrah called her mom a “bitch ” while laying down the rules of her house. \n“So you know, here are rules to my house, you know, cause sometimes you like to put the laundry in there with two things and waste soap,” Farrah told her mom in the premiere. “Sometimes you don’t understand how we wash, we clean.” Her mom then told her not to worry and added, “If I need to wash something, I’ll buy the soap. It doesn’t matter to me.” But that didn’t sit well with Farrah. “Oh, I’m not worried about the soap, and if that’s a bitchy comment you should probably hold it back. That’s why nannies get fired,” she said. Then, Farrah went off on her mom even harder. “You know what I want? I want my mom to listen to me, and I want her to understand and not be a bitch to me when I say how I like things done. It’s very serious. It bothers me that I’m away from my daughter. You know how serious it is to me that I let you stay at my house and watch my daughter when I’m gone for a month? It’s so serious that I think of it as if I pass away and I need somebody to watch my daughter for 18 years to get her through life and make her successful that you would do that, and you’d better listen.” \nWhat do YOU think, HollywoodLifers ? Is Nicki right? Whose side are you on? Tell us how you feel! More Farrah Abraham News:",

      "title": "Amazon plans new North Las Vegas fulfillment center with estimated 1K jobs",
      "text": "Amazon is slated to expand its presence in Southern Nevada.\nThe company expects to begin operations by the summer of 2017 out of an 813,120 square-foot fulfillment center that is currently under construction off of North Lamb Boulevard just north of Interstate 15 in North Las Vegas.\n“This would be proposed for our non-sort facilities,” said Holly Sullivan, senior economic development manager at Amazon. “The best way I can describe it is for our medium-sized items: your DVD players, your computers.”\nThe fulfillment center would be operated by Amazon.com.kycd LLC, a subsidiary of Amazon.com.\nAmazon already operates a return center in Las Vegas that employs 900 full-time employees, a fulfillment center in Reno that employs about 600 full-time employees, as well as other “Amazon-affiliated companies that, combined, employ 4,900 full-time Nevadans.\nThe fulfillment center in North Las Vegas is slated to hire another 1,000 employees “within a few months of opening” in the summer.\nSullivan said Amazon considered Nevada based on, among other reasons, the availability and quality of talent, and the pro-business climate, among other factors. The decision to expand operations was largely influenced, she said, by the successful operation in Reno.\nGov. Brian Sandoval on Thursday questioned Amazon’s average hourly wage of $14.64, which is below Nevada’a statutory requirement of a $21.35 average wage.\nSullivan said there are pathways for career advancement and upward mobility and also emphasized the company’s “commitment to hiring military veterans” at all Amazon.com facilities.\nThe Governor’s Office of Economic Development board on Thursday approved about $1.8 million in tax abatements for Amazon..com.kycd LLC. The company is estimated to generate about $44.7 million in new tax revenue over ten years. Amazon is slated to make a capital investment of about $34 million that will largely go toward “high-end conveyor systems.” That figure does not include the construction of the building.\nIn other action Thursday, the board approved spending a total over $2.2 million in tax abatements in return for over $8.5 million in new tax revenue, including the following:\n• Sutherland Global Services Inc will receive approximately $475,794 in tax abatements for expanded operations in Las Vegas and is estimated to generate $24,375,304 in new tax revenue over 10 years. Sutherland Global Services offers an integrated set of back-office and customer front-office services.\n• The Honest Co. will receive approximately $816,190 in tax abatements and is estimated to generate $20,380,096 in new tax revenue over 10 years. The Honest Co. is a consumer goods company emphasizing non-toxic and eco-friendly household products. The company was founded by actress Jessica Alba.\n• TH Foods Inc. will receive approximately $2,245,531 in tax abatements and is estimated to generate $5,692,924 in new tax revenue over ten years. TH Foods Inc produces snack food products for customers worldwide, and the tax abatement application states that is it the only manufacturer in North America with the technology to make authentic Usuyaki (Japanese for thin and flat) style rice crackers.\n• CML Media Corp. (dba Mopro) will receive approximately $422,690 in tax abatements and is estimated to generate $29,002,624 in new tax revenue over 10 years. Mopro is a technology company that specializes in creating artificial intelligence driven websites for small businesses.\n• Zazzle Inc will receive approximately $407,385 in tax abatements and is estimated to generate an estimated $5,635,350 in new tax revenue over 10 years. Zazzle Inc. is an online marketplace operating a platform for custom products.\nContact Nicole Raz at nraz@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4512.

      "text": "NEW YORK — For Amazon, Black Friday deals are starting early and ending just days before Christmas. Amazon will hold its second annual Prime Day after its blazing success in 2015. (David McNew/Getty Images) \nStarting Wednesday, the e-commerce giant is offering deals on a variety of products, including toys, electronics, kitchen and home goods and video games. \nHowever, the company said many of its top deals will be offered during the “Turkey 5,” which starts on Thanksgiving Day and runs through the Monday following the holiday — known as Cyber Monday. \nAmazon claims it will have the lowest prices on certain Samsung, LG and Sony TVs and is reducing some prices of Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price toys by as much as 50%. \nThe company is also discounting its own products: The Amazon Echo will be on sale for $139.99 and the Tap will be $89.99, a price cut of $40. \nShoppers can track deals on Amazon’s app and customers who have Prime memberships, which costs $99 a year, will get early access to “Lightning Deals.” \nHere are a few of the deals Amazon will offer at various times between Nov. 18 and Nov. 25: \n32″ 720p LED TV for $69.99 55″ LG 4K Smart TV for $398 $150 off a Delonghi Super Automatic Coffee Machine Sennheiser HD 598 Cs Closed Back Headphone for $99.95 Sphero Star Wars BB-8 Droid for $99.99 Amazon Fire HD 8 for $59.99 Amazon Kindle for Kids Bundle for $69.99 Up to 60% off select Disney toys and apparel Intex Explorer K2 Kayak for $70.99 Nest Thermostat (3rd Generation) for $199 40.712784 -74.005941",

      "text": "When Amazon reported net sales of $107 billion for 2015, it had fantastic growth in North America to thank. Over the past three years, the Seattle-based company, already the dominant force in the region, has added $22 billion in sales in North America. Last year the market contributed 60 percent of all of its sales.\nOverseas, the company (which we ranked no. 1 on our 2016 list of the 50 Smartest Companies ) has been selling more too, but making less money doing so. In part, profits have been reduced by currency differences, but Amazon has also been carrying out an expensive plan to expand its fulfillment capacity around the world.\nThat global investing is starting to pay off in India, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal . Amazon has said it would invest $5 billion in the market, which today has only 40 million online shoppers out of a population of 1.2 billion. As a result, it’s now gaining on local rival Flipkart Internet, long the largest online retailer in India.\nAmazon appears to have learned some valuable lessons in its struggle in the otherwise booming Chinese online shopping market, and it is now determined not to repeat them. The company never managed to establish a strong presence against local giants Alibaba and JD.com, which CEO Jeff Bezos has blamed on not doing enough to customize its offerings to the local market.\nIn India, the company still prides itself on its fulfillment prowess and recommendation engine, two features it’s known for around the world. But it has also been trying out local adaptations, such as motorcycle delivery men who will accept cash on delivery—useful for the many people in India who do not use credit cards.\n(Read more: Wall Street Journal , Recode , “ 50 Smartest Companies, 2016 ”)",
