      "text": "The local news industry has suffered as the internet has grown.\nIt's not that people no longer want to know about their community. The problem comes from the fact that social media and digital news have made print newspapers much less necessary. In many ways, what's happening to local news is similar to what happened to the music business. People still want music and news, but they no longer need to buy records or newspapers.\nThat change has put a major squeeze on local newspaper publishers. Print revenues have steadily fallen, which leads to lower budgets, fewer reporters writing stories, and fewer reasons to buy the paper. It's a cycle that, if it's not broken, leads to local news companies either dying or existing as shells of what they once were.\nIt's a problem that newspaper companies have struggled to solve and one that pure-digital companies have not been able to figure out either. People want local news, but many of them want it digitally, in a social-media-driven, interactive style.\nNow, one small media company in the Pacific Northwest has teamed with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to try something new. The two companies are working together to deliver news via Windows 10 tablets while giving subscribers the tools to be part of the news process.\nMicrosoft is partnering with a local news company to perhaps change the newspaper industry. Image source: Microsoft.\nWhat is Microsoft doing? The technology company has partnered with Pioneer News Group, a media company based in Seattle that owns 23 daily and weekly newspapers in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Utah. Pioneer has begun offering 8-inch Windows tablets that its readers get by signing up for a $15-a-month, one-year-subscription.\nThe subscriber not only gets the tablet with a digital version of their local newspaper, they also get a print version of the Sunday paper as part of their subscription, Microsoft reported on its Transform blog . Subscribers can also access their local news on any Windows, Android, or iOS devices they already own.\nSubscribers also get an app called uReporter, which gives them the tools to help report the news as well. Overall, it's an effort Microsoft described as having a goal of \"creating a new ecosystem to challenge global social-media sites through a hyper-local online community of residents and businesses, with the newspaper at its center.\"\nThat's a bold goal, but one that makes sense. It's an effort that acknowledges that newspapers may no longer be how people get news, but that people still value reporters and news stories, while also wanting a more interactive experience.\n\"People still look to the newspaper for information, and it's still valued,\" Pioneer Chief Operating Officer Eric Johnston told Microsoft. \"If we can keep readers engaged, that's part of the battle of keeping the newspaper a vibrant piece of the community, whether it's in print or not.\"\nWill this work? The joint Microsoft/Pioneer effort acknowledges both a change in how people consume news and the changing definition of what news actually is. It's a pivot by the newspaper company to accept that anything readers care about -- be it a traditional front-page story or the fact that the local deli has a well-liked soup as a special -- can be considered news.\n\"This is an exciting evolution for our industry,\" said Pioneer CEO Mike Gugliotto in a press release . \"It further advances the ability for our community to interact and engage with us as they prefer. For those who have been waiting for a reason to get a tablet for their home, we can now provide a device as part of an affordable, familiar subscription format.\"\nOffering a tablet as well as reporting tools may not immediately solve the woes of the newspaper industry, but it's a big start. Getting people to adopt the technology may be a struggle as older readers may be hesitant to give up their print newspapers and younger readers will have to be convinced of the value of paying for local news.\nIt's not going to be a short road, but Microsoft and Pioneer have addressed the problems facing the news industry and offered a viable solution. Ultimately this effort could -- likely after lots of experimentation -- provide a blueprint to transform a business that despite its struggles still meets a need in most communities.\n10 stocks we like better than Microsoft\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.*\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them!

      "title": "Can Microsoft Revitalize the Newspaper Business?",
      "text": "The local news industry has suffered as the internet has grown.\nContinue Reading Below\nIt's not that people no longer want to know about their community. The problem comes from the fact that social media and digital news have made print newspapers much less necessary. In many ways, what's happening to local news is similar to what happened to the music business. People still want music and news, but they no longer need to buy records or newspapers.\nThat change has put a major squeeze on local newspaper publishers. Print revenues have steadily fallen, which leads to lower budgets, fewer reporters writing stories, and fewer reasons to buy the paper. It's a cycle that, if it's not broken, leads to local news companies either dying or existing as shells of what they once were.\nIt's a problem that newspaper companies have struggled to solve and one that pure-digital companies have not been able to figure out either. People want local news, but many of them want it digitally, in a social-media-driven, interactive style.\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE!

      "title": "Microsoft says it’s time to dispel the cloud myths. Do they apply to Office 365?",
      "text": "\nOffice 365, Cloud Myths, Hot Air, and Bunkum Julia White is the Corporate Vice President for Azure and Security at Microsoft. She’s been around different parts of Microsoft for more years than I care to remember and I respect her opinion. Which then led me to consider her “ Top Cloud Myths of 2016” post of yesterday.\nThe core point made is that cloud services are now very much mainstream. I agree. Cloud is way past the fabled tipping point so beloved of consultants, where a previously rare phenomenon is becoming more common. Cloud services are everywhere; are robust, reliable, and secure; and will take an increasing amount of work from on-premises systems as time goes now.\nNow that I have nailed my colors to the mast, let’s consider the six myths that worry Julia, using Office 365 as a test case.\nMyth #1: Enterprises need only one cloud vendor. Agreed. Diversity is good, even in the cloud. You don’t have to run Office 365 alongside Azure, but you’ll consume Azure as you use Office 365 simply because Azure is part of the framework upon which Office 365 is built. However, goodness can be gained by using Amazon Web Services as well. Or any other cloud service you care to deploy, assuming that the selected service delivers.\nMyth #2: Cloud Security is riskier than on-premises Agreed. There’s no doubt that cloud vendors devote more engineering resources and technology to keeping their systems more secure and more compliant with standards than almost any on-premises infrastructure. They have more security professionals working on keeping the bad guys out than any on-premises deployment could afford to employ. Their attention to detail and their ability to detect and resist new attacks is second to none.\nThe reason why is that companies like Microsoft and Amazon have no choice in the matter. If a service like Office 365 was to be compromised in any serious way, the damage caused to Microsoft would be immense and their goal of reaching an annualized revenue run rate of $20 billion for commercial cloud products by the middle of 2018 would be put in doubt. That’s enough to concentrate the mind of everyone on the need for security from the CEO on down.\nMyth #3: The main benefit of public cloud is efficiency more than innovation Agreed. It’s another myth. But in this case I think the reason is that the cloud providers are locked in a titanic struggle for supremacy and therefore need to keep innovation up and prices down. New features appear in Office 365 all the time ( Microsoft Teams is an example). In this case, Teams is a direct response to a Slack, a cloud competitor.\nEfficiency is clearly important too because cloud services can’t run if they are inefficient. But there’s innovation there too as proven by features like Managed Availability or the IP-less DAG that have evolved within Exchange Online to make its operation more efficient and have since been transferred to on-premises customers.\nMyth #4: Hybrid cloud is the connection of public and private clouds Agreed. Hybrid cloud is a reality and it is here to stay. Microsoft has done well in some places within Office 365 to make hybrid cloud a real success. The Exchange Hybrid Connection Wizard (HCW) is one example. SharePoint hybrid search is another.\nThere are other places where a lot more work is required, like the hybrid experience when Office 365 Groups are synchronized back on-premises as distribution groups. That’s not as good as it should be and needs to be better. But my friends in Microsoft engineering know this because I’ve said it many times.\nMyth #5: Public cloud leads to vendor lock-in. Disagree. This is not a myth. The longer a company stays using a certain cloud platform, the harder it is to extract themselves from that platform and move elsewhere. If you want to leave Office 365 and move to Google G Suite, you can probably extract your mailboxes and SharePoint documents, but good luck in extracting plans, team chats, or any of the metadata that is wrapped around objects and interpreted to bring intelligence to users through applications like Delve and MyAnalytics .\nMicrosoft says that the data held inside Office 365 belongs to a tenant. So it does, but it’s bloody hard to extract the data in a useful and meaningful way. Lots more needs to be done here before we can say that vendor lock-in is a myth.\nMyth #6: Open cloud development is a risk to innovation and intellectual property Agreed. Everyone gains by sharing components. All of the software development companies that I am involved in use open source technology and none seems to be affected by the experience. Development is faster, less risky and more productive when you build on tried and tested components. It’s just logical.\nI agree that five of the six myths advanced by Julia are so much hot air (like much surrounding the cloud?). But that doesn’t mean that people should consider these to be done deals that no one has to care about in the future. Microsoft and other cloud vendors absolutely need to concentrate on security, on avoiding vendor lock-in, on openness and transparency, and on improving hybrid infrastructures to achieve seamless interoperability in as many use cases as possible. If not, those who hold to the myths will continue to believe them. And that can’t be a good thing.\nFollow Tony on Twitter @12Knocksinna .\nWant to know more about how to manage Office 365?

      "text": "Microsoft is making it easier to work with others on your next PowerPoint presentation. The PowerPoint app on Windows  now supports collaborative editing, allowing two or more people to jump into a document at once and make edits and comments that are seen by the entire group. This is something people have been able to do with PowerPoint Online for years, but Microsoft opens it up to a much larger group of users by enabling it in the desktop app, too.\nCollaborative editing has been in the works for the entire Office suite  for a while now , with Word first getting support just over a year ago. Microsoft said at the time that collaborative editing would come to PowerPoint and Excel in \" the near future ;\" obviously the timing wasn't quite right, but the first of those two has now arrived. Given that one of the the biggest strengths of Google Docs — Microsoft's strongest productivity competitor — has been its longtime support for collaborative editing features, rolling this out everywhere it can is a key part of helping the Office suite match up.",

      "title": "Alternatives to Apple's MacBook Pro: Microsoft Surface Book, HP Spectre x360 and Razer Blade | Gospelherald.com",
      "text": "Comment The Razer Blade is perfect for those who prioritise gaming over other factors. Twitter \nApple's MacBook Pro is said to be the best-selling laptop as of late, but there are those who are not fans of the laptop. If you are one of those looking for an alternative to the Macbook Pro, then good news because there are plenty of other choices for you to choose from. It all depends on what you require from the laptop that you intend to buy. Forbes has given some other laptops for consumers to consider as their option over the Macbook Pro. \nRazer Blade This is perfect for those who consider gaming as their primary reason for buying a laptop. Gaming products have been a specialty of Razer for almost twenty years. They have three kinds of laptops, and the 14-inch Razer Blade is the one recommended in the article. If you are interested in screen quality, the Razer offers either a touch enabled resolution of 3200x1800 or a 1920x1010 IPS screen. It is slightly larger when compared to the Macbook, but its standout quality is that of its keyboard which uses Chroma backlighting, which will be helpful for gamers who want to utilize keys for different actions. It comes with a 2.6 GHz Inter Core i7 and 16 GB of RAM. Battery life can last for six hours. Microsoft Surface Book This laptop has a fulcrum hinge which lets the screen be detached as a tablet. There is Surface Pen included which is helpful when you just want to use it as a tablet. There are several choices for the consumers starting with the entry-level Surface Book which costs about $1499 and can have either an 8BG or 126 GB RAM, SSD from 128 GB up to 1TB and i5 or i7 Skylake processor. This product is good for productivity, and perfect for professionals wanting an alternative to MacBook Pro. HP Spectre x360 Like the Surface Book, the Spectre can also function both as a laptop and a tablet. It comes with a 1920x1080 touchscreen display which is good for Windows 10. It's one of the first to use Intel's Kabylake as its processor and it is backed by 8 GB of RAM. The Spectre is thin compared to its predecessors and has a battery of a little over nine hours when used for video streaming. ",

      "text": "Advertisement \nMicrosoft introduced Groove Music just prior to the release of Windows 10 in July of 2015. \nGroove, Microsoft's online music streaming service, has its roots in what was known as Zune Music and Xbox Music prior to being rebranded as Groove. \nIn keeping with Microsoft's mantra of Windows 10 across all your devices and brining those same services to users on any mobile platform, you will find Groove Music on Windows 10 devices including PCs, tablets, Xbox One consoles, and Windows 10 Mobile devices. In addition, the Groove Music app is available on Android and iOS for customers on those platforms. \nGroove Music is even available to Sonos users. \nBeyond the extensive music catalog you can sync your playlists and other settings across all of these devices including your own music stored in Microsoft's OneDrive cloud storage service and play your Groove Music on the background on Xbox One as you engage in other activities. The music you have stored on OneDrive can also be played with the Groove Music app and organized into various playlists even if you do not subscribe to the Groove Music Pass service. \nI have been a Groove Music Pass subscriber since it was released and over that time the service and its associated apps have gained more features and reliability as it is updated on a monthly basis by the Groove team at Microsoft. \nMicrosoft normally offers a 30 day free trial to the Groove Music Pass but since it is the holidays they are offering a special deal for new subscribers. \nUntil 31 December 2016 you can sign up for the free 30 day trial (credit card required) and then before the free period is over you will receive a promotion code that will add three additional months to your free Groove Music service . \nIf you reach the end of the free four months of music and decide you do not want to continue with it as a paid option just head into your Microsoft Account Subscriptions page and cancel your membership. No phone calls, no emails, no fuss to leave the trial. \nThe great thing about this offer is that you do not need to be on a Windows 10 device to enjoy it since it is available to Android and iOS users - plus you can try it via the web at https://music.microsoft.com/ . \nBut, wait...there's probably more so be sure to follow me on Twitter and Google+ .",

      "text": "  \n(Xbox One) \"Dead Rising 4\" will release on Dec. 6. \n\"Dead Rising 4\" will be releasing just in time for the holiday season and a \"Yule Log\" video was recently uploaded online to keep the holiday spirits up. Also, a batch of new screenshots was also released from the upcoming game and it shows the main character capturing selfies. \nAccording to a report from GameSpot , Microsoft has uploaded a video recently in order to promote \"Dead Rising 4.\" The clip actually does not contain any new information about the upcoming title, but it is 21 minutes long and full of Christmas tunes to maintain the holiday mood. \nFurthermore, the video just shows a fireplace, and in order to keep the fire burning, human body parts are being used instead of wood. There are also moments within the clip where a person puts more body parts into the fire so it would not die out. These are also being stoked using a baseball bat that has barbed wire and Christmas lights wrapped around it. \nMoreover, new images were also released for the upcoming game and it shows the main character, Frank West, taking selfies with different zombies and scenery in the background. It was mentioned in a report from IGN that the protagonist of the game is actually an expert when it comes to photojournalism. However, his knowledge regarding selfies tells a different kind of story. Advertisement \nBased on reports, Frank is amused with using the selfie as if he discovers the concept for the first time. He knows the purpose of it as a style to capture photos, but he utilizes it in a very different way. The main character actually has a new takedown that also incorporates the selfie and it is called \"Stealhfies.\" In order to execute this type of takedown, Frank will sneak up behind his enemies, grabs them and then takes a Stealhfie with them. After that, he will instantly kill his opponents. In addition, the results of the photos are actually funny. \n\"Dead Rising 4\" is slated to be released for Xbox One and PC on Dec. 6.  ",

      "title": "Death Of Microsoft Advisor Program Unleashes Windfall For Ingram Micro Cloud Referral Initiative",
      "text": "last » \nIngram Micro's recently launched cloud referral program received a massive shot in the arm when Microsoft opted to sunset a very similar program of its own. \nNearly 90 percent of the couple hundred U.S.-based Ingram Micro partners taking advantage of the Irvine, Calif.-based distributor's commission-based cloud referral program came over from the discontinued Microsoft Advisor effort, according to Jason Bystrak, executive director of Ingram Micro Cloud for the Americas. \nIngram Micro launched its referral program at the 2016 Cloud Summit in April, offering 14 percent commissions on revenue brought in until June 2017 and 7 percent commissions thereafter, Bystrak told CRN at the distributor's ONE conference. Three months later, Microsoft announced that payments for its Advisor program – which had offered commissions of 3 percent – would be terminated Oct. 1. \n[RELATED: Former CIA Director Says The Private Sector, Not the Government, Will Protect Us From Cyberthreats ] \nAs a result, a massive number of partners with large Office 365 referral practices brought those seats over from Microsoft direct to Ingram Micro during August and September, Bystrak said. The distributor is now seeing a second wave of partners with smaller Office 365 referral practices adopting Ingram Micro's cloud referral program thanks to extensive sales and marketing efforts, according to Bystrak. \nBystrak said Tuesday that Ingram Micro's flexible platform has expedited this process since it allows partners to reassign seats to the distributor with only a couple of mouse clicks. Bystrak said Microsoft is pleased that Ingram Micro has taken over some of its referral business since the vendor had been looking to transition out of directly supporting end users due to support and attrition challenges. \nThe distributor's referral program enabled partners to take advantage of cloud opportunities within their existing customer base without having to build out a dedicated practice, said Vice President of Global Cloud Renee Bergeron. \nUnder Ingram Micro's cloud referral program, resellers can market and sell cloud services through customized banners and links on their own websites. But the distributor will leverage its own employees to close the deal, migrate the end user to cloud, and invoice the client on a regular basis. \nBystrak acknowledged that providing cloud support and services of their own is a more sustainable business model for solution providers in the long term. Some partners, though, lack the resources to support existing opportunities in the cloud, and Bystrak said Ingram Micro's referral program will enable them to fulfill the client's request while receiving some compensation. \nIn the long term, Bystrak expects Ingram Micro's cloud referral program to support different types of channel partners such as consultants, systems integrators and telecom agents that aren't in the business of providing managed services. Bystrak acknowledged that Ingram Micro is still in the early stages of reaching new types of channel partners by spending time at events that support these communities. \n\"They don't know who we are,\" Bystrak said. \"They're not a typical Ingram customer.\" Pages",

      "text": "Above: Halo 5: Guardians will serve at the center of a new reality show. Image Credit: Microsoft \nOne of Microsoft’s biggest gaming properties is getting its own reality show. \nHalo studio 343 Industries is partnering with Pilgrim Media on a reality-competition esports series for Halo 5: Guardians. This is the first production to come out of Pilgrim’s previously announced collaboration with Hollywood studio Lionsgate and esports organization ESL to create content related to professional gaming — although the industry has seen reality-competition shows before with PlayStation’s The Tester . Pilgrim is responsible for the Ulitimate Fighting Championships reality-competition show The Ultimate Fighter , and it’s likely that the Halo program will have a similar vibe to that mixed-martial-arts show. With the Halo production, Microsft, Pilgrim, and Lionsgate are taking a major step into a growing esports business that some analysts predict could generate as much as $1 billion in revenue by 2018 . \n“We continue to be blown away by the sheer excitement surrounding esports; the scope and buzz are growing every day,” Pilgrim chief executive Craig Piligian said in a statement. “Esports and Halo fans are exceedingly passionate about gaming and devoted to their favorite titles and franchises — they are exactly the kind of audience we want to produce for.” \nWhile the show is going into production, Pilgrim did not specify when or where it will air, but the company is making it with television in mind. \n“We’re thrilled to be partnering with Pilgrim on developing a reality series that will bring the intensity and extreme competition of Halo 5: Guardians esports to a television audience,” 343 Industries transmedia boss Kiki Wolfkill said. “There is no better partner than Pilgrim to give our fans insight into the world of Halo esports.” \nHalo’s more traditional esports tournaments will continue on, and fans can catch the Halo Championship Series Pro League Finals starting December 10 and livestreaming on Twitch .

      "text": "By Aunindita Bhatia - November 30,   \nDo you know how to rename worksheet tabs in Excel ? Microsoft Excel has been in use for years now and is one of the most important components of the Microsoft Office suite. It is used by everyone, be it in schools, colleges or in offices. If you have noticed, when you open Excel, the tabs are named Sheet 1, Sheet 2, and so on. It’s actually very easy. You can also change the color of the tabs if you like! \nRenaming Worksheet Tabs in Excel \nWhen you have many worksheets in Excel, it becomes a little difficult and confusing to identify what each worksheet tab contains with names like Sheet 1 and Sheet 2, etc. So, the best option is to rename the worksheet tabs in Excel so you actually know what each sheet represents. \nTo rename the worksheet tab in Excel, go to the specific tab you want to rename. Now, keeping your mouse pointer within that tab, right click. You can see many options coming up when you right click. From there, choose the option “Rename.” \nType a name that you want to give to the worksheet tab and press enter. You can enter up to 30 characters . Now, repeat the steps on all the worksheet tabs in Excel to rename them. \nShortcut Method to Rename Worksheet Tabs in Excel \nAnother way to rename a worksheet tab in Excel is by double clicking on the sheet tabs. For example, you can double click on Sheet 1, Sheet 2 or any other sheet that you want to rename. When you double click on the worksheet tab, the tab name (e.g. Sheet 1) is highlighted. After that, you just have to type the new name. As mentioned earlier, the name can have a maximum of 30 characters only. \nChanging the Color of Tabs \nAnother way to customize worksheet tabs in Excel is to change the color. By default, the color of tabs will be in gray. Active and selected worksheet tabs are shown in white. Like the difficulty with default names, here also can be difficult for the user to distinguish each tab when they all look the same. \nYou can change the color of one tab at a time or multiple tabs at a time depending upon your choice. To change the color of one of the worksheet tabs in Excel , you have to click on the tab and then right click on it. \nNow, select the option “Tab Color.” From there, you can select any color of your choice from the palette of colors displayed. Once you are done with selecting the color, press OK or simply hit ‘enter’ to apply the color. You can apply the same color to multiple tabs in Excel by selecting them while also holding down the CTRL key, then clicking on the last tab for the drop down menu and make your selection for the worksheet tabs in Excel . \nConclusion \nThe above steps provide options that are the easiest ways to customize your worksheet tabs in Excel and make them unique so that you don’t find it difficult to manage your work. Grouping worksheets by color can give you a quick reference point when working on multiple worksheets and offer more ways to organize your work when there are a large number of worksheets.

      "text": "Microsoft R Open 3.3.2 , Microsoft's enhanced distribution of open source R, is now available for download for Windows, Mac, and Linux. This update upgrades the R language engine to version 3.3.2, adds new bundled packages and updates others, and upgrades the Intel Math Kernel Libraries.\nThe updated R 3.3.2 engine includes some performance improvements (particularly in calculation of eigenvalues ), better handling of date axes in graphics, and improved documentation for the methods package. ( See here for a complete list of fixes .) There are no user-visible changes in the language itself, which means that scripts and packages should work without changes from MRO 3.3.1.\nThis update to MRO comes bundled with some additional packages , notably jsonlite (for fast processing of JSON-formatted data), png (to support reading and writing of PNG images), R6 (allowing the creation of classes with reference semantice), and curl (for connecting to web-based data sources). The checkpoint and deployrRserve packages have also been updated.\nThe MKL libraries, which provide high-performance matrix and vector calculations to MRO, have also been updated. (This fixes some issues with matrix multiplication and arima that were reported.) \nFor reproducibility , installing packages with MRO 3.3.2 will by default get you package versions as of November 1, 2016. Many packages have been updated or released since MRO 3.3.1. (See here for some highlights of new packages .) As always, if you want to use newer versions of CRAN packages (or access older versions, for reproducibility), just use the checkpoint function to access the CRAN Time Machine . \nMRO is supported on Windows, Mac and Linux. This release adds support for two new platforms: MacOS Sierra (10.12) and Ubuntu 16.04. \nWe hope you find Microsoft R Open useful, and if you have any comments or questions please visit the Microsoft R Open forum . To download Microsoft R Open (it's free!), simply follow the link below.\nMRAN: Download Microsoft R Open \n",

The meeting, which apparently started off with the announcement “Please silence all Windows Phones and other devices,” had quite a lot of Windows Phone fans.\nAccording to GeekWire , a Windows Phone fan who uses his device for “18 hours a day” asked Nadella “Can you calm me down … and tell me what your vision is for mobile?” after hearing that the company is possibly “stepping away from mobile.”\nIn response to this, Nadella simply stated that the company wants to focus on bringing something new to the market:\n“We think about mobility broadly. In other words, we think about the mobility of the human being across all of the devices, not just the mobility of a single device. That said, we’re not stepping away or back from our focus on our mobile devices. What we are going to do is focus that effort on places where we have differentiation. If you take Windows Phone, where we are differentiated on Windows Phone is on manageability. It’s security, it’s Continuum capability — that is, the ability to have a phone that can act like a PC. So we’re going to double-down on those points of differentiation.”\nSatya Nadella’s response is very similar to what he had said recently in another interview. The software giant is going to focus on bringing products that are different than what we already have. As we previously reported, it isn’t yet known what exactly Microsoft is working on internally — but if the rumors are true, the company’s “ultimate mobile device” could potentially support x86 apps in Continuum which is a major feature. \nIn the meeting, Satya Nadella was also questioned by one of its longtime shareholder and Windows Phone fan, Dana Vance — who was not happy after learning that the Microsoft Pix app is available on Android and iOS, but not on Windows Phone. He asked Nadella regarding the company’s vision for consumer devices. In response to Vance’s question, Satya Nadella stated that the company isn’t stepping away from supporting Windows Phone users — but it’ll continue to recognize other platforms in mobile with “higher share” and make sure that their services are available on the other platforms. Here’s his full response\n“We will keep looking at different forms and different functions that we can bring to mobile devices, while also supporting our software across a variety of devices. So that’s the approach you will see us take. We are not stepping away from supporting our Windows Phone users. But at the same time we are recognizing that there are other platforms in mobile that have higher share, and we want to make sure that our software is available to them.”\n",

The Windows 10 OS as well as Microsoft’s new Edge browser are getting better with each update. \nMicrosoft Edge in Windows 10 is fast, sports a clean interface, and it now supports extensions as well. Most users like the clean interface of Edge as it displays only few buttons and icons in the interface by default. \nAs you might know, two themes are built-in to Edge. One is the default light theme and other is dark theme. The dark theme is easier on eyes, and perfect while browsing the web in a poorly lit room. Microsoft Edge theme for Mozilla Firefox \nNow, if you love the default interface of Microsoft Edge but use Mozilla Firefox as your default web browser in Windows 10 for your own reasons, you will be happy to know that it’s now possible to make your Mozilla Firefox look like Microsoft Edge without losing any features of Firefox. \nFirefox Edge is a new theme for Mozilla Firefox to make your Firefox look like Edge in minutes.

The Edge theme for Firefox has been tested on Firefox 50 but should work on earlier versions as well. Make Firefox look like Edge \nInstalling the Edge theme for Firefox is also quite easy. Follow the given below directions to download and install Microsoft Edge theme for Firefox browser. \nStep 1: In order to install the theme, you need to install an add-on called Stylish for Firefox.

      "text": "Microsoft offers grants to organizations working to improve affordable internet access  00   REDMOND, Wash. , Dec.   On Thursday, Microsoft Corp. renewed its Affordable Access Initiative grant fund for a second year. The fund assists companies working to bring internet access and new technologies, services and models to underserved markets. The application process is now open for a new set of partners. \"The social enterprises we support have inspired us with practical, high-impact and scalable approaches to help close the digital divide,\" said Microsoft Affordable Access Initiatives Director Paul Garnett , writing in NextBillion . \"It's a privilege to see these solutions take shape, and to play a role in helping local entrepreneurs spur job creation and economic growth.\" In the fund's first round of investments, Microsoft awarded grants to 12 businesses offering affordable internet access or cloud-based services in fields such as power generation, health, education, finance and agriculture. AirJaldi , a 2016 grant recipient, provides high-quality Wi-Fi broadband connectivity at reasonable rates to more than 90,000 public- and private-sector clients in rural India . Vista Africa , another recipient from last year, is a cloud-based software platform that helps healthcare providers more easily screen, track and treat patients' health in areas where connectivity is limited. In addition to receiving funding and software to help power and develop their businesses, grant recipients will join a growing ecosystem of other grantees and funders to further increase their impact. This initiative is also connected to the work of Microsoft Philanthropies , which is helping to bring technology's benefits to those who need them most. Microsoft Philanthropies is making its digital literacy, online safety and computer science education programs available to grant recipients and the communities they serve. \"Too many people around the world lack internet connectivity and the educational, commercial and economic benefits of cloud-based services,\" said Mary Snapp , corporate vice president and head of Microsoft Philanthropies. \"Affordable Access Initiative grants, and the technology ecosystems they help support, empower entrepreneurs to provide connectivity, which then enables the creation of critical services for those who need it most.\" How to apply Applicants must be commercial organizations with two or more full-time employees and have a prototype of a working solution and preferably paying customers. Such products and business models might combine new cloud services and applications, low-cost forms of internet connectivity, and new payment mechanisms designed for consumers and smaller businesses in underserved markets. A list of criteria, and the application, can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/affordable-access-initiative/home . Applications will be accepted until midnight PST on Jan. 31, 2017 . Microsoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.",

The fund assists companies working to bring internet access and new technologies, services and models to underserved markets. The application process is now open for a new set of partners. \n\"The social enterprises we support have inspired us with practical, high-impact and scalable approaches to help close the digital divide,\" said Microsoft Affordable Access Initiatives Director Paul Garnett , writing in NextBillion . \"It's a privilege to see these solutions take shape, and to play a role in helping local entrepreneurs spur job creation and economic growth.\" \nIn the fund's first round of investments, Microsoft awarded grants to 12 businesses offering affordable internet access or cloud-based services in fields such as power generation, health, education, finance and agriculture. \nAirJaldi , a 2016 grant recipient, provides high-quality Wi-Fi broadband connectivity at reasonable rates to more than 90,000 public- and private-sector clients in rural India . Vista Africa , another recipient from last year, is a cloud-based software platform that helps healthcare providers more easily screen, track and treat patients' health in areas where connectivity is limited. \nIn addition to receiving funding and software to help power and develop their businesses, grant recipients will join a growing ecosystem of other grantees and funders to further increase their impact. \nThis initiative is also connected to the work of Microsoft Philanthropies , which is helping to bring technology's benefits to those who need them most. Microsoft Philanthropies is making its digital literacy, online safety and computer science education programs available to grant recipients and the communities they serve. \n\"Too many people around the world lack internet connectivity and the educational, commercial and economic benefits of cloud-based services,\" said Mary Snapp , corporate vice president and head of Microsoft Philanthropies. \"Affordable Access Initiative grants, and the technology ecosystems they help support, empower entrepreneurs to provide connectivity, which then enables the creation of critical services for those who need it most.\" \nHow to apply \nApplicants must be commercial organizations with two or more full-time employees and have a prototype of a working solution and preferably paying customers. Such products and business models might combine new cloud services and applications, low-cost forms of internet connectivity, and new payment mechanisms designed for consumers and smaller businesses in underserved markets. A list of criteria, and the application, can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/affordable-access-initiative/home . Applications will be accepted until midnight PST on Jan. 31, 2017 . \nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.",

      "text": "A few weeks back, Microsoft had an event in which they unveiled some really neat things. Now, I’m not here to talk about The Surface Book, though it is nice, nor the Surface Studio, though I admittedly want one pretty hard. Rather, I want to talk about how Microsoft likely tipped its hand for the future. It looks very highly likely that Windows 10 mobile isn’t long for this world, at least in its current form. Allow me to explain.\nMicrosoft started off by showing off its new upcoming update to Windows 10. Windows 10 Creators Update will feature a wide range of creator’s tools, including the pronounced use to 3D modeling in Paint among other programs. You remember Windows Paint right? I remember vividly coloring in pixel by pixel in Windows Paint long before I had any concept of Paint Shop Pro, or anything Adobe’s ever made. But one announcement Microsoft made seemingly telegraphed its intentions going forward.\nNot just Windows During the demo of 3D fun that we were shown, our Creator presenter showed off 3D scanning capability on an app installed on an HP Elite X3, because someone had to buy one I guess. But the next item dropped was the kicker. The app that was scanning 3D objects with the greatest of ease was going to roll out to all mobile phones in the future including Android and iPhone, presumably..\nJust think about that for a second. Microsoft has this really great tech that pairs off well with its operating system, and it’s releasing it to the masses without batting an eyelash. Of course, we don’t know the full details just yet – whether it’ll be Windows 10 Mobile first, everyone else second, etc. But the fact that Microsoft is getting out in front of everyone and sharing this tech on competing platforms tells me one of two things is happening.\nOn the bright side The more optimistic view of this is that Microsoft realizes that other platforms are already well on their way to doing this. Sometimes friend/sometimes competitor Lenovo rolled out very similar tech with Project Tango (cross) and the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. It’s possible and likely that Microsoft simply wants to get ahead of the game in this respect. 3D and augmented reality are coming very quickly over the horizon and the first companies in this industry will likely benefit the most. It’s possible Microsoft simply wants to get in everyone’s heads about this stuff before we start thinking about it in earnest.\nLet’s face it, 3D models with Buffy and Missy on the beach are cute, but there’s no real practical application for them…yet. This industry has a long way to go to establishing itself and Microsoft clearly wants to be one of the first boots on the ground. Industries aren’t always defined by who is best, but often by who is first. Microsoft can make up a lot of ground in the mobile and computing industry in general if it is one of the early pioneers of this future.\nBe everywhere, not nowhere Of course, it likely also means that Microsoft wants to be the first in this industry on all platforms because it recognizes that its own platform won’t gain the traction it needs to be a leader. If this tech were cool enough, and it looks like it might be, it could potentially help pull a platform up by a lot. If Microsoft were to stay exclusive to Windows 10 Mobile and release this 3D Centric Creator Update, it might have some chance of reviving the platform. Not much of a chance, but a chance. Rather, Microsoft is taking the safer bet by going all in on the successful platforms, which means it has little faith in its own. This is a bit sobering and sad, but I’m not sure I see another way to interpret these events.\nThat being said, if Microsoft can help shape this future of ours, there is still every reason to continue to be somewhat active in the mobile space and stay fresh in the minds of those who are paying attention to technology. Because when the time comes to ramp up Windows (whatever number they’re on) Mobile in the future, it will already have some column inches waiting for it. Windows 10 Mobile may not be dead, but it’s clearly less important to Microsoft than ever before. There is some reason to hope for the future – the far future – but for right now, Microsoft is playing things safe, as it probably should.\nThe post Microsoft’s 3D strategy suggests a lot about it’s mobile strategy appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "By James Marshall Updated November 18, 2015 . \nIf you're annoyed by Microsoft Word's animated office assistants, you're not alone. Clippit—also known by his nickname, \"Clippy\"—and the other animated office software assistants of his ilk have earned the ire of many users. \nDon't despair! Put chipper Clippy out of his—or rather your—misery by turning off the animated assistant and opt for Word's traditional help center. Right click on the fidgety little assistant. In the context menu, select Options... Under the Options tab, uncheck the box labled \"Use the Office Assistant.\" \nCongratulations, you will no longer be plagued by the well-meaning but pesky assistant! Wipe Clippy from Existence! \nPerhaps your dissatisfaction runs so deep that merely turning off Clippy will not sate your hunger for vengeance. You may go a step further and remove the office assistant files from your installation of Microsoft Word. \nThis process requires a greater knowledge of your Office installation, and it's not recommended. \ncontinue reading below our video Choosing the Best Smartphone for YOU The poor little helper is turned off, after all. Do you really need to completely erase him? \nIf so, follow these steps: Close all Office programs. Run Office Setup in Maintenance mode. In the Microsoft Office Maintenance Mode box, click Add or Remove Features , and then click Next . In the Features to Install box, click the plus sign ( + ) next to Office Shared Features. From the expanded list, click the symbol next to Office Assistant, and then click Not Available in the list that appears. Click Update . Click OK after setup confirms the feature has been removed. \nThe heartless deed is done. But Now You Miss Your Assistant! \nSo, you have disabled your plucky animated assistant, but now you're finding your word processing life diminished with his absence. Fear not! Restore the helpful little office elf to your good graces in just two clicks: Click on the Help menu. Select Show the Office Assistant. \nNote: If you removed the assistant files completely, bringing him back isn't quite so simple. You'll first need to repeat the steps that removed the assistant files, but this time reinstall his files. \nCongratulations, you have reinstated Clippy to his \"helpful\" station, and he will be once again popping up at inopportune and awkward times to offer you his occasionally insightful, but mostly banal, word processing tips .",

      "text": "Microsoft offers grants to organizations working to improve affordable internet access News provided by Dec 01, 2016, 12:18 ET Share this article REDMOND, Wash. , Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- On Thursday, Microsoft Corp. renewed its Affordable Access Initiative grant fund for a second year. The fund assists companies working to bring internet access and new technologies, services and models to underserved markets. The application process is now open for a new set of partners. \"The social enterprises we support have inspired us with practical, high-impact and scalable approaches to help close the digital divide,\" said Microsoft Affordable Access Initiatives Director Paul Garnett , writing in NextBillion . \"It's a privilege to see these solutions take shape, and to play a role in helping local entrepreneurs spur job creation and economic growth.\" In the fund's first round of investments, Microsoft awarded grants to 12 businesses offering affordable internet access or cloud-based services in fields such as power generation, health, education, finance and agriculture. AirJaldi , a 2016 grant recipient, provides high-quality Wi-Fi broadband connectivity at reasonable rates to more than 90,000 public- and private-sector clients in rural India . Vista Africa , another recipient from last year, is a cloud-based software platform that helps healthcare providers more easily screen, track and treat patients' health in areas where connectivity is limited. In addition to receiving funding and software to help power and develop their businesses, grant recipients will join a growing ecosystem of other grantees and funders to further increase their impact. This initiative is also connected to the work of Microsoft Philanthropies , which is helping to bring technology's benefits to those who need them most. Microsoft Philanthropies is making its digital literacy, online safety and computer science education programs available to grant recipients and the communities they serve. \"Too many people around the world lack internet connectivity and the educational, commercial and economic benefits of cloud-based services,\" said Mary Snapp , corporate vice president and head of Microsoft Philanthropies. \"Affordable Access Initiative grants, and the technology ecosystems they help support, empower entrepreneurs to provide connectivity, which then enables the creation of critical services for those who need it most.\" How to apply Applicants must be commercial organizations with two or more full-time employees and have a prototype of a working solution and preferably paying customers. Such products and business models might combine new cloud services and applications, low-cost forms of internet connectivity, and new payment mechanisms designed for consumers and smaller businesses in underserved markets. A list of criteria, and the application, can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/affordable-access-initiative/home . Applications will be accepted until midnight PST on Jan. 31, 2017 . Microsoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft today released Windows 10 Build 14977 to Insiders in the Fast Ring. The latest build is only available to Mobile devices, and it brings support for EPUB files on Edge, as well as the usual improvements and bug fixes.\nWHAT’S NEW \nWhat’s new Read EPUB books in Microsoft Edge on your phone: In addition to being able to read any unprotected e-book in the EPUB file format on your PC with Microsoft Edge – you can also read unprotected e-book in the EPUB file format with Microsoft Edge on your phone! When you open an unprotected e-book in Microsoft Edge, you will be taken into a customizable reading experience where you can change the font and text size and choose between 3 themes: light, sepia, and dark. As you read, you can leave bookmarks. To navigate through an e-book, you can use the table of contents or seek bar at the bottom of the browser. And you can also search for words or phrases and use Cortana to define specific words. WHAT’S FIXED \nWhat’s fixed We’ve changed the rendering technology used for many types of UWP app content, so please provide feedback through the Feedback Hub if you notice any new visual glitches in UWP apps. Alarms sent by 3rd party alarm apps will now break through Cortana’s Quiet Hours – we appreciate all the app developers who logged feedback requesting this, keep it coming! We’ve removed the top-level option in Notification Settings to disable alarms on the lock screen – alarm reliability is a top priority for us, and we’ve found this setting was frequently enabled accidentally, without awareness that it would stop alarms from waking the phone when the phone was locked. For those who still wish to enable this setting, it’s will continue to be available under the per-app notification settings. Notifications from Settings can now be customized or disabled – option is available under Settings > System > Notifications > Settings We have enabled OAuth support for Yahoo Mail accounts. This will improve sync reliability for those accounts, and provide a secure experience while browsing your email. We fixed an issue where disconnecting and reconnecting a wired headset while watching a video might result the audio no longer working. We fixed an issue Insiders may have experienced where certain music apps would unexpectedly stop playing music after a single song. We fixed an issue where closing a tab in Microsoft Edge, exiting the app, and then relaunching it would sometimes result in Edge opening to a blank page with the closed tab’s web address in the URL bar. We fixed an issue where the Start Settings page wasn’t rendering when opened on external screen while using Continuum. We’ve made a number of translation improvements, including, for French (France and Canada) speakers, fixing a grammatical error in the “Don’t Forget!” text seen when shutting down the phone so it now says “N’oubliez pas”, and for Chinese speakers, fixing an issue where the option to clear the Chinese Input Method Editor’s input history was displaying in English rather than Chinese. If you see any other translations that aren’t as you’d expect, please log feedback – we’re listening! We fixed an issue where, if the setting to show notifications above lock had been turned off, booting the device and immediately checking the Action Center while the phone was locked could result in the Action Center not displaying any notifications after the phone had been unlocked. We fixed an issue Insiders may have experienced where the Camera app might not appear after using the hardware camera button while the screen was off or while on the Glance screen. We fixed an issue where Bangla (Bangladesh) keyboard text prediction might stop working after entering character followed by a vowel mark. WHAT’S BROKEN. \nWhat’s broken Please avoid attempting to install new languages, keyboards, and speech packs on your phone. There is a chance these downloads may get stuck and not finish downloading. If you have existing languages, keyboards, and speech packs installed – they will carry over when you update to new builds. You can use Windows Device Recovery Tool to go back to Windows Phone 8.1 or Windows 10 Mobile, install any languages, keyboards, and speech packs you need and then update to the latest build in the Fast ring as a workaround. Windows 10 phones with 8GB of internal storage such as the Lumia 550 and 650 will likely receive an 0x800700b7 error when attempting to update to this build. System related notification toasts (e.g. Bluetooth, USB/Autoplay, etc.) do not work. ",

      "text": "December 01, 2016 at 12:18 PM EST Microsoft offers grants to organizations working to improve affordable internet access \nREDMOND, Wash. , Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- On Thursday, Microsoft Corp. renewed its Affordable Access Initiative grant fund for a second year. The fund assists companies working to bring internet access and new technologies, services and models to underserved markets. The application process is now open for a new set of partners. \n\"The social enterprises we support have inspired us with practical, high-impact and scalable approaches to help close the digital divide,\" said Microsoft Affordable Access Initiatives Director Paul Garnett , writing in NextBillion . \"It's a privilege to see these solutions take shape, and to play a role in helping local entrepreneurs spur job creation and economic growth.\" \nIn the fund's first round of investments, Microsoft awarded grants to 12 businesses offering affordable internet access or cloud-based services in fields such as power generation, health, education, finance and agriculture. \nAirJaldi , a 2016 grant recipient, provides high-quality Wi-Fi broadband connectivity at reasonable rates to more than 90,000 public- and private-sector clients in rural India . Vista Africa , another recipient from last year, is a cloud-based software platform that helps healthcare providers more easily screen, track and treat patients' health in areas where connectivity is limited. \nIn addition to receiving funding and software to help power and develop their businesses, grant recipients will join a growing ecosystem of other grantees and funders to further increase their impact. \nThis initiative is also connected to the work of Microsoft Philanthropies , which is helping to bring technology's benefits to those who need them most. Microsoft Philanthropies is making its digital literacy, online safety and computer science education programs available to grant recipients and the communities they serve. \n\"Too many people around the world lack internet connectivity and the educational, commercial and economic benefits of cloud-based services,\" said Mary Snapp , corporate vice president and head of Microsoft Philanthropies. \"Affordable Access Initiative grants, and the technology ecosystems they help support, empower entrepreneurs to provide connectivity, which then enables the creation of critical services for those who need it most.\" \nHow to apply \nApplicants must be commercial organizations with two or more full-time employees and have a prototype of a working solution and preferably paying customers. Such products and business models might combine new cloud services and applications, low-cost forms of internet connectivity, and new payment mechanisms designed for consumers and smaller businesses in underserved markets. A list of criteria, and the application, can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/affordable-access-initiative/home . Applications will be accepted until midnight PST on Jan. 31, 2017 . \nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.",

Microsoft has moved Windows 10 August update to the Current Branch for Business release track, putting the \"Anniversary Update\" in the queue for automatic downloads and installation on enterprise PCs . From a report on ComputerWorld: The move will also set in motion a two-month countdown clock on support for the original mid-2015 version of Windows 10. \"Windows 10 1607, also known as the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, has been declared as Current Branch for Business (CBB) and is ready for deployment,\" Michael Niehaus, a director of product marketing, said in a post to a company blog that used similar wording to the first upgrade to the CBB. In April, Microsoft moved the November 2015 upgrade to the corporate delivery track. Microsoft issued the Anniversary Update Aug. 2, even though its numerical designation of 1607 referred to July (07) of this year (16). The upgrade will be released in January through Windows Update, Windows Update for Business and Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Niehaus said. ",

      "text": "Trump’s tax holiday actually may not go to plan. How will Apple, Microsoft, and others spend their offshore money?\nA corporate share buyback and dividend binge could be on the horizon.\nChasing stocks is for chumps.\n\nThe stock market has significantly risen since President-elect Donald Trump won the Oval Office. The Dow, the Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) had another record close on Black Friday. Markets are reacting positively to pre-election promises and policies that Trump touted in almost every rally speech.\nThere's expectations that Trump will overhaul financial regulations like Dodd-Frank (clear positive for large banks), increase infrastructure spending, cut corporate taxes, and boost the nation's manufacturing sector. So what we're seeing is a number of \"Trump trades\" or bets on companies in industries projected to perform well under a Trump presidency.\nTrump wants to cut the business tax rate from 35% to 15% in an effort to keep U.S. companies from leaving for countries with lower tax rates. This should be generally positive for U.S. equity markets and capital investment. The one piece of proposed legislation that interests me is the one-off repatriation tax holiday at a 10% tax rate. This will give U.S. multinationals like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) the chance to repatriate trillions of dollars in cash stockpiled overseas.\nAccording to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, there's about $2.6 trillion in profits parked overseas in tax haven subsidiaries (source: Bloomberg ).\nApple will be a real beneficiary of any tax holiday, as would Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and many other U.S. tech companies. The top 10 largest tech companies have more than half a trillion dollars overseas. Today, Apple and Microsoft's offshore cash represents 36.3% and 23.4% of their respective market values. Pharmaceuticals like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ), and Merck (NYSE: MRK ) have plenty of cash overseas as well.\nThe chart below shows the top 5 U.S. companies with the most offshore cash (source: Bloomberg). Moody's Investor Service estimates that the top 5 will accumulate $505 billion overseas by year-end, up from $441 billion in 2015.\n(in US$ billions) \nOffshore cash as of Sept. 30 \nEst. Offshore cash by year-end \nApple\n$216\n$230\nMicrosoft\n$111\n$113\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO )\n$60\n$62\nOracle Corp (NASDAQ: ORCL )\n$51\n$52\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL )\n$48\n$49\nClick to enlarge (Source: Bloomberg and Investor's Business Daily )\nThe reason they keep money offshore in tax haven subsidiaries is because to bring that cash back you must pay a 35% tax. Apple's CEO Tim Cook in December last year said that he would \"love\" to repatriate some of Apple's cash, but not at a 40% tax rate (combining federal and state taxes). It just doesn't make sense for any business to repatriate cash when you got to pay a substantial tax on it.\nSo will U.S. companies take advantage of the one-time 10% tax rate? Maybe. Some U.S. multinationals have many reinvestment opportunities outside of the U.S., so they may not consider repatriating their cash. Instead, they rather invest in markets where they produce most of their sales and profits.\nCorporate buyback and dividend binge? \nTrump says the repatriated cash guarantees bigger tax revenues that would partly fund his $1 trillion infrastructure program over the next 10 years (clear benefit for E&C's, equipment rental firms, and material producers). This spending would lead to increased economic productivity and growth. On top of that, Trump expects U.S. companies will use the repatriated cash on \"growth capital\" investments like building new manufacturing plants and factories at home to fuel job growth.\nOn paper, this is all very promising. But I don't think it will all go accordingly to Trump's plan. I expect the repatriated cash will benefit investors rather than job creation. Instead, the cash will be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This is how U.S. companies reacted in the past, why not expect more of the same again?\nThe U.S. last introduced a one-time tax holiday under the Homeland Investment Act in 2004. About 843 U.S. corporations returned more than $300 billion at a reduced rate of 5.25% (nearly half of what Trump's proposing). The legislation didn't allow companies to use the cash to buy back shares, but they still did anyway. Over 90% of the repatriated cash was used for buybacks, dividends, and executive compensation. It didn't serve to create U.S. jobs or build new factories as planned. \nCisco's CEO Chuck Robbins was asked how he would spend the repatriated cash in an interview with Bloomberg. He said: \"We do have various scenarios in terms of what we'd do but you can assume we'll focus on the obvious ones - buybacks , dividends , and M&A activities.\"\nIt seems like wishful thinking to believe U.S. companies won't spend majority of their foreign cash on buybacks and dividends. Trump's Black Friday-like tax holiday for American corporations sounds like a good idea, but it's really a big gamble on infrastructure and job growth.\nIt's also a big gamble if you're merely buying specific stocks that could benefit from Trump's future policy changes. In this case, you're not investing, but dangerously speculating, and ignoring the underlying fundamentals of a business which drive stock performance. You don't know if his plans will come to fruition (e.g. repeal of Dodd-Frank). Chasing what's hot in the market without doing your own homework is risky investment behavior and you're setting yourself up to lose money.\nIf U.S. multinationals do repatriate cash, the U.S. will see an influx of capital flows, and that should benefit the U.S. dollar (clear negative for consumer staples like Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG )). The U.S. is seeing economic growth return, with Q3 GDP expanding to 3.2% (versus 1.4% in Q2), and this is fueling the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Growth is favoring the U.S. Fed futures market, now pricing a 100% probability of a rate hike on December 14.\nThe U.S. Fed has held the fed funds rate target range at 0.25% to 0.50% since December 2015. The financial sector, which was the worst performing sector at the start of the year, has rallied hard the past few weeks becoming the best performing sector over the last 12 months. Higher interest rates increase net interest margins and profits for banks, like JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ).\nIf you're buying these banks solely because of the expectation of the Fed bumping up interest rates or the repeal of Dodd-Frank, you're not investing, but speculating. There's substantial downside risk for many of the stocks that have moved higher because of possible Trump policies, and even the Fed's expected rate hike in two weeks. Instead, focus your energy on due diligence. Investigate your investments before making an informed investment decision.\nAvoid the herd mentality.

This will give U.S. multinationals like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) the chance to repatriate trillions of dollars in cash stockpiled overseas.\nAccording to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation, there's about $2.6 trillion in profits parked overseas in tax haven subsidiaries (source: Bloomberg ).\nApple will be a real beneficiary of any tax holiday, as would Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), and many other U.S. tech companies. The top 10 largest tech companies have more than half a trillion dollars overseas. Today, Apple and Microsoft's offshore cash represents 36.3% and 23.4% of their respective market values. Pharmaceuticals like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ), and Merck (NYSE: MRK ) have plenty of cash overseas as well.\nThe chart below shows the top 5 U.S. companies with the most offshore cash (source: Bloomberg). Moody's Investor Service estimates that the top 5 will accumulate $505 billion overseas by year-end, up from $441 billion in 2015.\n(in US$ billions) \nOffshore cash as of Sept. 30 \nEst. Offshore cash by year-end \nApple\n$216\n$230\nMicrosoft\n$111\n$113\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO )\n$60\n$62\nOracle Corp (NASDAQ: ORCL )\n$51\n$52\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL )\n$48\n$49\nClick to enlarge (Source: Bloomberg and Investor's Business Daily )\nThe reason they keep money offshore in tax haven subsidiaries is because to bring that cash back you must pay a 35% tax. Apple's CEO Tim Cook in December last year said that he would \"love\" to repatriate some of Apple's cash, but not at a 40% tax rate (combining federal and state taxes). It just doesn't make sense for any business to repatriate cash when you got to pay a substantial tax on it.\nSo will U.S. companies take advantage of the one-time 10% tax rate? Maybe. Some U.S. multinationals have many reinvestment opportunities outside of the U.S., so they may not consider repatriating their cash. Instead, they rather invest in markets where they produce most of their sales and profits.\nCorporate buyback and dividend binge? \nTrump says the repatriated cash guarantees bigger tax revenues that would partly fund his $1 trillion infrastructure program over the next 10 years (clear benefit for E&C's, equipment rental firms, and material producers). This spending would lead to increased economic productivity and growth. On top of that, Trump expects U.S. companies will use the repatriated cash on \"growth capital\" investments like building new manufacturing plants and factories at home to fuel job growth.\nOn paper, this is all very promising. But I don't think it will all go accordingly to Trump's plan. I expect the repatriated cash will benefit investors rather than job creation. Instead, the cash will be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This is how U.S. companies reacted in the past, why not expect more of the same again?\nThe U.S. last introduced a one-time tax holiday under the Homeland Investment Act in 2004. About 843 U.S. corporations returned more than $300 billion at a reduced rate of 5.25% (nearly half of what Trump's proposing). The legislation didn't allow companies to use the cash to buy back shares, but they still did anyway. Over 90% of the repatriated cash was used for buybacks, dividends, and executive compensation. It didn't serve to create U.S. jobs or build new factories as planned. \nCisco's CEO Chuck Robbins was asked how he would spend the repatriated cash in an interview with Bloomberg. He said: \"We do have various scenarios in terms of what we'd do but you can assume we'll focus on the obvious ones - buybacks , dividends , and M&A activities.\"\nIt seems like wishful thinking to believe U.S. companies won't spend majority of their foreign cash on buybacks and dividends. Trump's Black Friday-like tax holiday for American corporations sounds like a good idea, but it's really a big gamble on infrastructure and job growth.\nIt's also a big gamble if you're merely buying specific stocks that could benefit from Trump's future policy changes. In this case, you're not investing, but dangerously speculating, and ignoring the underlying fundamentals of a business which drive stock performance. You don't know if his plans will come to fruition (e.g. repeal of Dodd-Frank). Chasing what's hot in the market without doing your own homework is risky investment behavior and you're setting yourself up to lose money.\nIf U.S. multinationals do repatriate cash, the U.S. will see an influx of capital flows, and that should benefit the U.S. dollar (clear negative for consumer staples like Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG )). The U.S. is seeing economic growth return, with Q3 GDP expanding to 3.2% (versus 1.4% in Q2), and this is fueling the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Growth is favoring the U.S. Fed futures market, now pricing a 100% probability of a rate hike on December 14.\nThe U.S. Fed has held the fed funds rate target range at 0.25% to 0.50% since December 2015. The financial sector, which was the worst performing sector at the start of the year, has rallied hard the past few weeks becoming the best performing sector over the last 12 months. Higher interest rates increase net interest margins and profits for banks, like JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ).\nIf you're buying these banks solely because of the expectation of the Fed bumping up interest rates or the repeal of Dodd-Frank, you're not investing, but speculating. There's substantial downside risk for many of the stocks that have moved higher because of possible Trump policies, and even the Fed's expected rate hike in two weeks. Instead, focus your energy on due diligence. Investigate your investments before making an informed investment decision.\nAvoid the herd mentality. Chasing stocks is for chumps.\nReading recommendations: \nSell Everything Now?

      "text": "Microsoft offers grants to organizations working to improve affordable internet access [December 01, 2016] Tweet \nREDMOND, Wash. , Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- On Thursday, Microsoft Corp. renewed its Affordable Access Initiative grant fund for a second year. The fund assists companies working to bring internet access and new technologies, services and models to underserved markets. The application process is now open for a new set of partners. \n\"The social enterprises we support have inspired us with practical, high-impact and scalable approaches to help close the digital divide,\" said Microsoft Affordable Access Initiatives Director Paul Garnett , writing in NextBillion . \"It's a privilege to see these solutions take shape, and to play a role in helping local entrepreneurs spur job creation and economic growth.\" \nIn the fund's first round of investments, Microsoft awarded grants to 12 businesses offering affordable internet access or cloud-based services in fields such as power generation, health, education, finance and agriculture. \nAirJaldi , a 2016 grant recipient, provides high-quality Wi-Fi broadband connectivity at reasonable rates to more than 90,000 public- and private-sector clients in rural India . Vista Africa , another recipient from last year, is a cloud-based software platform that helps healthcare providers more easily screen, track and treat patients' health in areas where connectivity is limited. \nIn addition to receiving funding and software to help power and develop their businesses, grant recipients will join a growing ecosystem of other grantees and funders to further increase their impact. \nThis initiative is also connected to the work of Microsoft Philanthropies , which is helping to bring technology's benefits to those who need them most. Microsoft Philanthropies is making its digital literacy, online safety and computer science education programs available to grant recipients and the communities they serve. \n\"Too many people around the world lack internet connectivity and the educational, commercial and economic benefits of cloud-based services,\" said Mary Snapp , corporate vice president and head of Microsoft Philanthropies. \"Affordable Access Initiative grants, and the technology ecosystems they help support, empower entrepreneurs to provide connectivity, which then enables the creation of critical services for those who need it most.\" \nHow to apply \nApplicants must be commercial organizations with two or more full-time employees and have a prototype of a working solution and preferably paying customers. Such products and business models might combine new cloud services and applications, low-cost forms of internet connectivity, and new payment mechanisms designed for consumers and smaller businesses in underserved markets. A list of criteria, and the application, can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/affordable-access-initiative/home . Applications will be accepted until midnight PST on Jan. 31, 2017 . \nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.",

Moody's Investor Service estimates that the top 5 will accumulate $505 billion overseas by year-end, up from $441 billion in 2015.\n(in US$ billions) \nOffshore cash as of Sept. 30 \nEst. Offshore cash by year-end \nApple\n$216\n$230\nMicrosoft\n$111\n$113\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO )\n$60\n$62\nOracle Corp (NASDAQ: ORCL )\n$51\n$52\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL )\n$48\n$49\nClick to enlarge (Source: Bloomberg and Investor's Business Daily )\nThe reason they keep money offshore in tax haven subsidiaries is because to bring that cash back you must pay a 35% tax. Apple's CEO Tim Cook in December last year said that he would \"love\" to repatriate some of Apple's cash, but not at a 40% tax rate (combining federal and state taxes). It just doesn't make sense for any business to repatriate cash when you got to pay a substantial tax on it.\nSo will U.S. companies take advantage of the one-time 10% tax rate? Maybe. Some U.S. multinationals have many reinvestment opportunities outside of the U.S., so they may not consider repatriating their cash. Instead, they rather invest in markets where they produce most of their sales and profits.\nCorporate buyback and dividend binge? \nTrump says the repatriated cash guarantees bigger tax revenues that would partly fund his $1 trillion infrastructure program over the next 10 years (clear benefit for E&C's, equipment rental firms, and material producers). This spending would lead to increased economic productivity and growth. On top of that, Trump expects U.S. companies will use the repatriated cash on \"growth capital\" investments like building new manufacturing plants and factories at home to fuel job growth.\nOn paper, this is all very promising. But I don't think it will all go accordingly to Trump's plan. I expect the repatriated cash will benefit investors rather than job creation. Instead, the cash will be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. This is how U.S. companies reacted in the past, why not expect more of the same again?\nThe U.S. last introduced a one-time tax holiday under the Homeland Investment Act in 2004. About 843 U.S. corporations returned more than $300 billion at a reduced rate of 5.25% (nearly half of what Trump's proposing). The legislation didn't allow companies to use the cash to buy back shares, but they still did anyway. Over 90% of the repatriated cash was used for buybacks, dividends, and executive compensation. It didn't serve to create U.S. jobs or build new factories as planned. \nCisco's CEO Chuck Robbins was asked how he would spend the repatriated cash in an interview with Bloomberg. He said: \"We do have various scenarios in terms of what we'd do but you can assume we'll focus on the obvious ones - buybacks , dividends , and M&A activities.\"\nIt seems like wishful thinking to believe U.S. companies won't spend majority of their foreign cash on buybacks and dividends. Trump's Black Friday-like tax holiday for American corporations sounds like a good idea, but it's really a big gamble on infrastructure and job growth.\nIt's also a big gamble if you're merely buying specific stocks that could benefit from Trump's future policy changes. In this case, you're not investing, but dangerously speculating, and ignoring the underlying fundamentals of a business which drive stock performance. You don't know if his plans will come to fruition (e.g. repeal of Dodd-Frank). Chasing what's hot in the market without doing your own homework is risky investment behavior and you're setting yourself up to lose money.\nIf U.S. multinationals do repatriate cash, the U.S. will see an influx of capital flows, and that should benefit the U.S. dollar (clear negative for consumer staples like Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG )). The U.S. is seeing economic growth return, with Q3 GDP expanding to 3.2% (versus 1.4% in Q2), and this is fueling the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Growth is favoring the U.S. Fed futures market, now pricing a 100% probability of a rate hike on December 14.\nThe U.S. Fed has held the fed funds rate target range at 0.25% to 0.50% since December 2015. The financial sector, which was the worst performing sector at the start of the year, has rallied hard the past few weeks becoming the best performing sector over the last 12 months. Higher   net interest margins and profits for banks, like JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ).\nIf you're buying these banks solely because of the expectation of the Fed bumping up interest rates or the repeal of Dodd-Frank, you're not investing, but speculating. There's substantial downside risk for many of the stocks that have moved higher because of possible Trump policies, and even the Fed's expected rate hike in two weeks. Instead, focus your energy on due diligence. Investigate your investments before making an informed investment decision.\nAvoid the herd mentality. Chasing stocks is for chumps.\nReading recommendations: \nSell Everything Now?

      "text": " Microsoft Corp.\nREDMOND, Wash. On Thursday, Microsoft Corp. renewed its Affordable Access Initiative grant fund for a second year. The fund assists companies working to bring internet access and new technologies, services and models to underserved markets. The application process is now open for a new set of partners.\n\"The social enterprises we support have inspired us with practical, high-impact and scalable approaches to help close the digital divide,\" said Microsoft Affordable Access Initiatives Director Paul Garnett , writing in NextBillion . \"It's a privilege to see these solutions take shape, and to play a role in helping local entrepreneurs spur job creation and economic growth.\"\nIn the fund's first round of investments, Microsoft awarded grants to 12 businesses offering affordable internet access or cloud-based services in fields such as power generation, health, education, finance and agriculture.\nAirJaldi , a 2016 grant recipient, provides high-quality Wi-Fi broadband connectivity at reasonable rates to more than 90,000 public- and private-sector clients in rural India . Vista Africa , another recipient from last year, is a cloud-based software platform that helps healthcare providers more easily screen, track and treat patients' health in areas where connectivity is limited.\nIn addition to receiving funding and software to help power and develop their businesses, grant recipients will join a growing ecosystem of other grantees and funders to further increase their impact.\nThis initiative is also connected to the work of Microsoft Philanthropies , which is helping to bring technology's benefits to those who need them most. Microsoft Philanthropies is making its digital literacy, online safety and computer science education programs available to grant recipients and the communities they serve.\n\"Too many people around the world lack internet connectivity and the educational, commercial and economic benefits of cloud-based services,\" said Mary Snapp , corporate vice president and head of Microsoft Philanthropies. \"Affordable Access Initiative grants, and the technology ecosystems they help support, empower entrepreneurs to provide connectivity, which then enables the creation of critical services for those who need it most.\"\nHow to apply\nApplicants must be commercial organizations with two or more full-time employees and have a prototype of a working solution and preferably paying customers. Such products and business models might combine new cloud services and applications, low-cost forms of internet connectivity, and new payment mechanisms designed for consumers and smaller businesses in underserved markets. A list of criteria, and the application, can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/affordable-access-initiative/home . Applications will be accepted until midnight PST on Jan. 31, 2017 .\nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20000822/MSFTLOGO\n releases/microsoft-offers-grants-to-organizations-working-to-improve-affordable-internet-access-300371075.html\n ",

His rebellion inspired the birth of The Banished, a savage army of mercenaries and killers now on the brink of acquiring the most powerful weapons platform the galaxy has ever seen. The only things between Atriox and his prize are Captain James Cutter and the crew of the USNC Spirit of Fire. Outgunned and long past any hope for reinforcements, Cutter’s survival depends on how quickly he can master the first law of the battlefield: Know your enemy. \nHalo Wars 2 is due out for Xbox One and PC on February 21. \nWatch the trailer below.",

Let\\'s take a closer look at the new features in this hardware review. Most people know about Xbox one controllers by now so we\\'re talking exclusively about the new features. First off it has wireless over the air updates which is an improvement over the last controller which required a micro usb connection for updates. It\\'s a good feature, but that\\'s more of a technical fix. Comparing the two controllers, they look identical with the exception of the new port. The most obvious advancement is the addition of the 3.5mm audio port which will let you connect any standard headphones no matter how crazy they look. And there\\'s menu settings for adjusting the sound and chat volume from the controller. So if your headphones don\\'t have a built in volume adjustment, you still have control. The other feature is improved bumpers. Many gamers complained that the Xbox One bumpers felt good for clicking, but actually holding them down felt difficult due to the pushback. Although they look identical, the pushback has been reduced on these new controllers and you can definitely hear an audible difference. Testing it out with Sunset Overdrive, it\\'s a great option to be able to have headphones plugged in to my control and it sounds fine. You\\'ll most likely get the best audio over HDMI or optical, but that\\'s not an option f...

      "text": "How sales organizations use technology to drive revenue By David_Held on 11/29/2016 10:00:00 AM \nThe sales profession is going through a transformation. Social, mobile and digital media (omnichannel experiences) are enabling buyers to be significantly informed at each step of the buying journey. Sellers are transitioning from selling individual products to a singular point-of-contact to increasingly complex solutions to buyers who are often only a small part of the stakeholders involved in the final decision. And finally, the core sales process is rapidly changing due to the addition of new technology and greater contact touchpoints. \nSince we understand how the sales process has dramatically changed, we must now look to understand how this transformation affects sales organizations – particularly in top performing teams. How can organizations decrease seller burden and build engagement while navigating an increasingly complex sales process? \nMicrosoft recently talked to 48 sales leaders about this very question to learn how they use sales technology in their organization and how they think about the future of sales transformation 1 . \nWe discovered many organizations focus on sales technology to drive productivity to gain a better view into their sales pipeline, yet these efforts face challenges surrounding unmet expectations and poor user adoption. \nHowever, there our study discovered an outlier of organizations that grew at a significantly faster rate than their peers. The common thread we saw was these organizations used technology to move beyond productivity: they achieved increased results by gaining customer insights to drive personal engagement. \nIt turns out that there may be a direct correlation between digital transformation and revenue growth. Those identifying as technology “Drivers” enjoyed a 50% increase in revenue growth. \nJoin me in an on-demand webinar to go deeper into this sales transformation curve and walk through the four sales profiles that we discovered. Discover the sales transformation curve \n\n\n1 Study of business-to-business sales executives in the U.S., conducted by phone in a detailed 1 hour live interview. The survey was commissioned by Microsoft in 2Q16, and included approximately 50 sales leaders from over 13 industries. Companies in survey ranged in size from approximately $20M in revenues to over $1B in revenues. \n",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft, though known as a software company, created a concept, idea and an aspirational hardware brand with Surface.\nAnd it wasn't an accident. On June 18, 2012, Microsoft surprised the world with the launch of the tablet/laptop hybrid known as Surface.\n\nEarly impressions were hopeful. Would this be the iPad killer that a host of Android tablets before it had failed to be? Its unique design that crammed a full PC into the frame of a tablet (Pro version), and accommodated removable keyboard/type covers and a pen, suggested, \"Maybe.\"\nBallmer hinted at a future \"Surface\" family of devices.\nThis tablet, which conveniently hid the familiar desktop behind its Modern (and controversial) Live Tile-based face was described as \"the tablet that can replace your laptop.\" Then CEO Steve Ballmer framed the \"Surface\" category this way as \"a whole new family of computing devices from Microsoft.\"\nIts' interesting that even then Ballmer referred to \"Surface\" as a family of devices. He may have envisioned the broader context the Surface brand would later incorporate beyond what was introduced that day. This was, after all, the beginning of a journey of hardware-software synergy that would change Microsoft forever?\n",

      "text": "Here's how to get a job at Google The dream for Latin America's top students: Snag a job at Google or Microsoft. A survey of business and engineering students conducted by Universum, a research and consulting firm, found Google ( GOOG ) to be the most attractive employer for both majors. Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) came in second. \nThese results aren't surprising -- Google also topped Universum's annual survey of grads in Europe and Asia . \nRelated: Here's where Europe's grads want to work \n\"Google and Microsoft are basically popular around the world,\" said Andre Valias Siqueira, the director of Latin America at Universum. \"They really communicate and they show their value.\" \nThat value is expressed by promoting innovation and flexibility at work, Siqueira said. \n\nCompanies that sell consumer goods, such as Coca-Cola ( KO ) , Unilever ( UL ) and L'Oréal ( LRLCY ) , are also very popular among business students in the region. They far outrank consulting companies such as McKinsey & Company, which is the third most coveted employer among Asian business students. \n\"I see the consumer industry invest strategically in Latin America,\" Siqueira said. \nSpain's Santander ( SAN ) is the only bank to make the top 10 list for business students. But that's not because Latin American graduates are eschewing financial institutions, Siqueira said. \nA full 40% of business graduates said their preferred industry was banking and financial services. They just prefer local banks, which don't always show up in regional survey results, Siqueira said. \nJ.P. Morgan is the only U.S. bank listed among the top 30 preferred employers for business students. \nRelated: Where students in Asia most want to work \nMore broadly, Latin American graduates said they prioritize opportunities for professional training and development when looking for work. \n\"We've seen a lot of change and a lot of volatility in different countries in Latin America, and that's reflected in the desire for future success,\" said Kat Lynn, a Universum spokeswoman. \"The students in the region are invested in building a career for their futures.\" \nCNNMoney (New York)   2, 2016: 10:00 AM ET",

In the next page you will see the option to download... I'm not getting a \"collection\" option in Groove. I can view each album in my library, select each song on an album and choose to download, but I've no idea where its downloading to. I don't have that option either for some reason but they are placed in a queue in Groove for download from the looks of it...its just a bit slow but I've no idea where they are being downloaded too??? I thought it was to One Drive but doesn't appear so and a search hasn't brought up any results...weird as I have 4 albums already showing as downloaded (disclaimer ...they are not for me personally!...well, maybe one).",

      "text": "Microsoft .NET framework: Still viable in the cloud computing age? by Joel Shore News Writer When Microsoft .NET launched in 2003, mobile and cloud computing didn't exist. Today, with dozens of development tools and languages built for the cloud, can .NET stay relevant?   8 reasons why Citrix NetScaler beats the competition –Citrix \nThe Microsoft .NET framework celebrates its 15th birthday on Feb. 13, 2017. Much has changed during that time. Launched just four months after the October 2001 debut of Windows XP, .NET and its Visual Studio application development environment could not have anticipated cloud and mobile computing, where connected internet of things and smart devices are forecast to top 50 billion by 2020. Since then, dozens of competing application development environments, programming languages, device types and operating systems -- iOS and Android -- have flooded the marketplace. Download this free guide Download: Understanding Cloud Development Trends and Issues \nIn this expert handbook, we explore the issues and trends in cloud development and provide tips on how developers can pick the right platform.

In this first of two parts, he discussed the overall .NET ecosystem and Microsoft's philosophy about how the framework fits into the modern world of cloud, mobile, iOS and Android. In part two, Khan takes a deeper dive into new features and technologies of specific products, including Xamarin, TypeScript and SQL Server. \nWe live in the cloud and mobile age, driven largely by Android, iOS and Linux. How is the Microsoft .NET framework staying relevant? Omar Khan \nOmar Khan: From the outset, .NET was about empowering developers . It was developed more than 15 years ago in the age of desktop computing, where Windows was dominant. We then saw the market move to more heterogeneous systems in both the web/cloud and mobile/devices. We knew that we needed to innovate and expand .NET to compete in the modern age of cloud computing -- at hyperscale , as well as incredibly small devices and IoT [internet of things]. \nDoesn't that suggest a complete reformulation of .NET? \nKhan: Yes, we embarked on a journey to modernize .NET. Over two years ago, Microsoft open-sourced the platform. .NET Core is a cross-platform, open, modular platform that we believe will take .NET into the next 15 years, and we're building it with a lot of help from the community. It's specifically designed with performance and small footprint in mind -- perfect for containerized microservices and scalable web and cloud applications that run on Windows, Linux and macOS. We released version 1.0 of the runtime and libraries end of June 2016. \nThere's more to the Microsoft .NET framework and ecosystem than just the new .NET Core. What about these other aspects? \nKhan: There is still a lot of innovation going on with the .NET framework, the well-known framework for building Windows applications -- the same innovation that goes into the compilers, languages and runtime components that benefit all .NET implementations. \nThe Microsoft .NET framework seems to garner little mind share these days. What is Microsoft doing to help keep the platform top of mind with developers and architects who see a steady stream of new tools and languages conceived for cloud and mobile? \nKhan: .NET has a strong and loyal base that has been growing steadily, as we've taken .NET to the open source development community . In fact, even the .NET Foundation has seen increasing interest, with Google, Red Hat, JetBrains , Samsung and Unity participating in the Technical Steering Group. \nIs that a leading indicator for .NET Core? \nKhan: We find those who try .NET Core love it. We're starting to see a big uptick in downloads of .NET Core. What's exciting, according to a survey people can take on the website, is that 40% are telling us they are totally new to .NET. Now, it's about awareness. We're seeing good traction in online and in-person code schools and universities that now are looking at .NET because it's open source and cross-platform. In our labs, .NET Core is eight times faster than Node.js and three times faster than Go. Omar Khan general manager of developer platforms, Microsoft \nHow widespread is actual use of the Microsoft .NET framework for developing applications? \nKhan: We have more than 12.7 million downloads of Visual Studio 2015, the most downloaded version of Visual Studio ever. We also have a lot of momentum in the open source community. The .NET Core repos on GitHub are seeing over 60% of the contributions coming from people outside Microsoft. More than 24,000 developers from 1,600 companies have contributed to .NET Core. \nGiven that developers and architects have numerous platform and framework options available, what kinds of applications benefit most from being built on the Microsoft .NET framework? \nKhan: .NET always keeps developer productivity in mind. With modern languages and syntax, world-class development tools and a large community, we want you to be able to build anything, build it fast, build it reliably and iterate quickly. Xamarin technology makes .NET development easy for a multitude of device OSes, like iOS, Android and Windows. .NET Core is well-suited for building high-performance, cross-platform microservices , websites, cloud applications, cross-platform libraries and console apps. We're serious about performance. In our labs, .NET Core is eight times faster than Node.js and three times faster than Go. And we're working with TechEmpower to be part of their benchmarks for Round 13 . \nJoel Shore is news writer for TechTarget's Business Applications and Architecture Media Group.

      "text": "0 0 \nMinesweeper is a popular game that was present in previous versions of Windows. Microsoft decided to change its policy on games, and now Minesweeper isn’t available by default on Windows 10 . This is why users tend to download Minesweeper games from Windows Store , but according to them, Minesweeper app isn’t working for them on Windows 10. Minesweeper not working on Windows 10, how to fix it? Fix – Minesweeper not working Windows 10 \nSolution 1 – Use Tablet mode \nUsers reported that Minesweeper     certain buttons and elements aren’t visible on the screen, and that can prevent you from playing the game.

By turning on Tablet Mode, all Universal Apps should start working without any problems. Unfortunately, this is just a workaround, and you’ll have to repeat this process every time you want to start Minesweeper. \nSolution 2 – Reinstall the application   \nIf your Minesweeper application isn’t working properly, you should be able to fix it by reinstalling it.

Apparently, Minesweeper game is affected by those bugs,   update your Windows to the latest version.

This is just a simple workaround, but it might work for some users, so be sure to try it out. \nSolution 7 – Increase the screen resolution \nIf Minesweeper isn’t working properly on your Windows 10 PC, you might be able to fix that simply by changing your resolution.

A joint webinar is also in the works for Q1 2017 that should be of interest for anyone pursuing or currently managing an extranet with SharePoint or Office 365.\nFor more information, please visit bandrsolutions.com, follow @BandRSolutions on Twitter, or visit us on Facebook at Facebook.com/BandRBusinessSolutions.",

      "text": "{ 4 comments } \nI’ve been using a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 for almost a week now and I’ve enjoyed it significantly more than I thought I would. The size and weight makeÂ this convertible laptop perfect for everyday and travel use. I’m even seriously considering switching from MacOS to Windows 10 if you can believe that! Having said, that, will I ditch my one-year-old 13″ MacBook Pro for the SP4? Keep reading to find out. \nSince Monday, I have only used my MacBook Pro for a few minutes to edit some review pics that I had stored on the MacBook’s hard drive. Other than that, I’ve spent every night using the SP4 at a desk or on my lap while I’m living the good life reclining in my double LazyBoy recliner with my better half while we watch TV. Using the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 on my lap \nI have mainly been using the SP4 on my lap with the kickstand open and the Type Cover attached. I like to use my laptop on my lap a LOT, so I have been aware of the comfort level due to the straight edges of the computer and the kick stand sitting on my thighs.Â Using the SP4 like this is not as comfortable as using a regular clamshell style laptop on my lap.Â I can deal with it, but I prefer the feel of a normal laptop on my lap. Using the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 on a desk \nUsing the SP4 on a desktop has not been an issue. It feels just as comfortable as a normal laptop… at least to me. \nI haven’t had any issues with the keyboard. I can touch type on it as well as I can other laptop keyboards. The Touch Type cover’s keyboard is very nice. The key layout is perfect, the key size is perfect and the feel is very good. When IÂ use the SP4 on a desk with the Type Cover attached, I have noticed a very slight flex orÂ bounceÂ due to the fact that the keyboard does not lay flat attached the desk surface. This is not a big deal for me because it’s barely noticeable. \nAs for the touchpad, once I learned how to right click properly, it’s been fine. It pretty small, but it works fine for scrolling and moving the cursor around the display. Using the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 as a tablet \nI thought I’d use the SP4 as a tablet more than I’d use it as a laptop. I was wrong. I actually had to force myself to use it as a tablet. This isn’t because I hated using the SP4 as a tablet, it is because I use Gmail and work on reviews more than I do anything else. So I am constantly typing. Using the onscreen keyboard works well enough, but it is very slow for me compared to typing with both of my hands on a physical keyboard where I’m able to type about 50-60 words a minute. It was suggested that I try the onscreen split keyboard, which did end up being better but not nearly as good as a real keyboard. \nWhen I did use the SP4 as a tablet, I found that surfing sites like Pintrest and Facebook in tablet mode was enjoyable, as was playing games like Solitare. Using Windows 10 in tablet modeÂ on the SP4 was not a problem like I thought it might be. I was able to touch and tap every onscreen button that I needed to activate without any issues. \nAs for using the stylus, I thought I’d use it all the time, but just like the tablet mode, I had to force myself to use it. The stylus included with the SP4 is really nice and provides pen on paper feel. I’m not an artist and I prefer to take notes with a keyboard, so I just didn’t find a reason to use the stylus unless I just made myself do it. The three main issues that I have with the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 \nDuring the last week of exclusively using the SP4, I only ran into three issues. The first issue is comfort due to the kickstand on my lap. The second issue is that the Surface Pro 4 only has one USB port which means that I have to remove a USB dongle for my wireless mouse when I need to tether my Canon 70D to take review pics, use a flash drive, etc. The third least annoying issue is that the SP4 does not have \nThe first issue is comfort due to the kickstand on my lap. Using the SP4 on my lap is doable, but it’s slightly awkward and just doesn’t feel as natural as a laptop. \nThe second issue is that the Surface Pro 4 only has one USB port which means that I have to remove a USB dongle for my wireless mouse when I need to tether my Canon 70D to take review pics, use a flash drive, etc. The third least annoying issue is that the SP4 does not have \nThe third and least annoying issue is that the SP4 does not have a SD card slot. It has a micro SD card slot. That means I can’t use all my existing SD cards unless I use a USB card reader. Not a huge issue since I don’t use cards that often anymore because I tether my camera to the computer now, but something to be aware of if you’re thinking of buying this computer. \nI can also add a four issue which isn’t really an issue, but more of a wish. I wish the SP4 had a USB Type-C port for charging. I bet the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 due out next year will have one… What’s the verdict? \nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 4 is a great little computer and I have really enjoyed using it for the past week. I think that the weight and size are ideal as it only weighs 2 lb 7 oz. with the Type Cover attached. Carrying it around the house is a breeze, so I know that it would be great for travel too. But then I compared my 13 inch Dell XPS Â to the SP4 and found that it is only slightly heavier at 2 lb 12.8 oz. The Dell also has two USB ports and a full-sized SD card slot. Since I don’t think I’ll use the SP4 as a tablet or use the stylus, I don’t think the difference of 6 oz justifies keeping it, so I’ve decided to return it. If I didn’t already have the Dell XPS, I’d keep it the SP4. I also do not have any trips planned until the spring of 2017, so I’ll put that $1000 Â back in my checking account and wait till then to consider another upgrade. Maybe it will be an SP5. \nAlthoughÂ I may not be keeping the SP4, this experiment did help me decide one important thing. I will NOT buy another Apple MacBook. Apple computers cost way too much and they don’t innovate anymore. No, I don’t think a touch bar counts as an innovation or removing all the ports. I’m even seriously considering selling my current one and switching to Windows 10. Does anyone want to buy my 1-year-old 13″ MBP which is in perfect condition? đ \nI’m even seriously considering selling my current MacBook Pro and switching to Windows 10 now.

      "text": "Latin American grads say Google is the dream Top students seek jobs at Google, Microsoft Author: By Julia Horowitz \nThe dream for Latin America's top students: Snag a job at Google or Microsoft. Related Content \nA survey of business and engineering students conducted by Universum, a research and consulting firm, found Google to be the most attractive employer for both majors. Microsoft came in second. \nThese results aren't surprising -- Google also topped Universum's annual survey of grads in Europe and Asia. \n\"Google and Microsoft are basically popular around the world,\" said Andre Valias Siqueira, the director of Latin America at Universum. \"They really communicate and they show their value.\" \nThat value is expressed by promoting innovation and flexibility at work, Siqueira said. \nCompanies that sell consumer goods, such as Coca-Cola, Unilever and L'Oréal, are also very popular among business students in the region. They far outrank consulting companies such as McKinsey & Company, which is the third most coveted employer among Asian business students. \n\"I see the consumer industry invest strategically in Latin America,\" Siqueira said. \nSpain's Santander is the only bank to make the top 10 list for business students. But that's not because Latin American graduates are eschewing financial institutions, Siqueira said. \nA full 40% of business graduates said their preferred industry was banking and financial services. They just prefer local banks, which don't always show up in regional survey results, Siqueira said. \nJ.P. Morgan is the only U.S. bank listed among the top 30 preferred employers for business students. \nMore broadly, Latin American graduates said they prioritize opportunities for professional training and development when looking for work. \n\"We've seen a lot of change and a lot of volatility in different countries in Latin America, and that's reflected in the desire for future success,\" said Kat Lynn, a Universum spokeswoman. \"The students in the region are invested in building a career for their futures.\" \nCopyright 2016 by CNN NewSource .

Microsoft announced last night that Windows 10 CTP will be available shortly, along with server and management tools coming up soon after that. \nMicrosoft announced last night that Windows 10 CTP will be available shortly, along with server and management tools coming up soon after that. Given my misgivings about the direction the Windows OS has taken as a platform after Windows XP (which still was the best Windows OS to date in my books), I have put together this list of ten things I am looking from Windows 10 to be able to consider putting it on my shopping list. #1 UI: Phone looks like a phone, Desktop like a desktop and Server like a server. \nI absolutely don’t like the UI in Windows 8. It feels weird and unusable to have my pc and server desktops look like a phone. A phone should look and feel like a phone. A desktop PC should feel like a desktop and a Server OS should feel like a server. It is not sufficient to have the same UI over everything and have different things behind the scenes. Behind the scenes stuff is always considered after first impressions. How many features have been written into Windows since Windows 95 that no one has even heard about? Looks are what matter and they are what sells your product. #2 Manageability: Disintegration from “Live” and “One” family of services. No more OneDrive !! #3 UX: No more hard requirement of LiveID for user accounts. Bring back legacy user accounts. \nI am not a big fan of integrated operating systems that come with requirements to mandatorily subscribe to other services to let you use them. And just because some other platform does it is no reason to follow suit. All “Live” and “One” family product subscriptions should be optional. Why do I want a mandatory “OneDrive” app on my PC if I don’t use the service at all or prefer a competitor? #4 UX: Bring back Start Menu, Recent Docs, Desktop icons \nReturn to the roots! These are things that made Windows XP a hit. Every desktop shell out there try to bring this aspect of the quintessential “Windows” desktop screen. It is comfortable, familiar. Going so far away from home, it feels alien. It is not Windows anymore without these. #5 Footprint: Reduce number of Windows Services and background apps \nI don’t know about you, but I do not like things running in the background. Especially not things that I cannot decide if I want it or not from reading its name and description. Reduce the number of Windows Services and background apps. Rename the really essential ones and write descriptions that people can understand without having to do a course and write an exam. In fact, if anything needs to run in the background, it should be explicitly permitted to do so by someone with Administrator rights on that system. #6: Security: Rollback requirement to enable Auto Update and Firewall for network connectivity \nThis is a really wrong requirement in my books. Why should I have the auto update service and the firewall running on my PC to be able to access the network? Maybe I do not want to update at all or have a different strategy to doing my updates. Maybe I have an upstream firewall. It makes no sense to me to have this as a mandatory requirement to be able to use the network. #7 Connectivity: Single platform to connect with all Windows devices (phones, tablets, Xbox, etc). \nOver the past five years there has been a terrible number of Windows devices and versions. And yet, each version comes with its own way to connect and talk to each other. Between some, there is no way at all. For example, a Windows Phone 7 device will not talk to anything over Bluetooth other than your PC ! Devise and standardize a single platform for all Windows based devices to talk to each other. Backward update older devices to conform. #8 Usability: Add uninstall option for “immersive browser”. \nWindows 8 introduced something called the “immersive browser”. Users should get the option to uninstall this version without affecting the desktop browser (currently you are forced to have both or neither). #9 Manageability: No more “mandatory” immersive apps! Everything should be uninstallable. \nIn Windows 8, there are a bunch of “mandatory” immersive apps that simply cannot be turned off or uninstalled. There are also bundled apps that do not respect that they are uninstalled after an update — they come back! Everything should be uninstallable and once removed, should stay removed. #10 Stability: Remove “quick shutdown”. Go back to classic mode \nI simply don’t like the way it does that. I can never be sure if when I boot it up again if I would get a clean slate. \nLicense \nThis article, along with any associated source code and files, is licensed under The Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL) Share",

      "text": "Microsoft Corporation: Is This a Tipping Point for MSFT Stock? By Gaurav S. Iyer, IFC   Good News for Microsoft Stock (MSFT)? \nThe European Commission is set to approve Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) $26.0-billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp ( NYSE: LNKD ), but not without some caveats. Nonetheless, we believe this event could trigger a surge in Microsoft stock (MSFT). \nRegulators don’t appear to hate the deal, but they still want to err on the cautious side. Or, at least that’s according to a Wall Street Journal report that came out last Thursday. (Source: “ EU Likely to Clear Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal With Conditions ,” The Wall Street Journal , December 1, 2016.) \nHere’s what we know: Microsoft made “concessions” to ensure smooth passage of the deal, Microsoft can’t shut out LinkedIn’s competitors from its “Outlook” programs, and No one but Microsoft gets access to LinkedIn’s treasure trove of data. \nIn other words, the “concessions” aren’t so bad. In fact, Microsoft would be foolish not to accept such incredible terms. The European Commission may prevent the company from bundling LinkedIn with other products, but that wasn’t the point of the acquisition. \nMicrosoft was after the data all along. There are 400 million working professionals with accounts on LinkedIn. With the data that underlies these accounts, Microsoft can make its programs better, its artificial intelligence (AI) smarter, and its share price more valuable. \nForget the teenagers taking selfies on “Snapchat.” The real value is in working adults with enough money to buy things. Understanding how they think and how they use technology is key to building successful products in the 21st century. Data is at the heart of that understanding. \n  What This Means for MSFT Stock \nJust to recap: LinkedIn’s competitors will be able to integrate their apps with Microsoft’s Outlook products. \nThat won’t be an exclusive right of LinkedIn, even though they will technically be under Microsoft’s banner. Rivals like the network for German business professionals, XING AG (FRA:O1BC), will also have access to Outlook’s e-mail and calendar services. It could impede LinkedIn’s growth, but so what? \nOn the totem pole of things that matter, LinkedIn’s growth is near the bottom. It is already a widely used platform. The point now is to use it to the advantage of Microsoft stock. With this in mind, I can’t help but see the “concessions” to the European Commission as a good thing. \nIf you’re still skeptical, listen to this. There was one company that was pushing for Microsoft to share LinkedIn’s data: salesforce.com, inc . (NYSE:CRM). Folks at salesforce.com kept lobbying the commission, pushing them to rule against Microsoft. Why, you ask? \nBecause they know how valuable LinkedIn’s data is. In fact, salesforce.com was one of the other companies trying to buy LinkedIn, but they were outbid by Microsoft. Now they are simply trying to limit the advantage that Microsoft will have over its pool of rivals. \nUnfortunately for salesforce.com, the deal has already been approved by antitrust authorities in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, and South Africa. Other big markets, like those in Japan, South Korea, and China, don’t require regulatory approval. \nWith the European Commission expected to give its final approval on December 6, we suspect MSFT stock may break above its 52-week trading average in the coming days. The share price is currently hovering at $59.02. \nEditor’s Note : Hi, Gaurav S. Iyer   Confidential.   now .",

      "text": "How to Turn on Cortana by Voice in Windows 10 7 hrs ago 0 \nMicrosoft's Cortana voice assistant is an integral part of Windows 10. But normally, to pose a question or command, you first have to click on the microphone icon next to Cortana's \"Ask me anything\" field just to wake it up. \nBut why bother clicking on something when you can use your voice? Through Microsoft's \"Hey Cortana\" feature, you can get the attention of the voice assistant just by saying \"Hey Cortana,\" and segue into your converation seamlessly. Let's see how this works. \nIn Windows 10, click on the microphone icon next to Cortana's \"Ask me anything\" field to open the Cortana window. \nThen click on the Settings icon (the one that looks like a gear). \nIn the Settings pane, turn on the option under \"Hey Cortana\" that says \"Let Cortana respond to 'Hey Cortana.'\" \nNow Cortana will respond to you when you utter that special phrase. But, wait, there's more. The next option says: \"Keep my device from sleeping when it's plugged in so I can always say 'Hey Cortana' (unless I turn it off myself).\" If you want your laptop to never fall asleep when plugged into an outlet so that \"Hey Cortana\" will always be available, turn on this option. \nNext up is deciding who can say \"Hey Cortana\" to activate the voice assistant. If you want anybody to be able to turn on the feature by saying the magic words, then click on the button that says: \"Respond when anyone says 'Hey Cortana.'\" If you want to be the only person who can wake up Cortana by voice, then click on the next button that says: \"Try to respond to only me.\" \nIf you're going to be the sole user of \"Hey Cortana,\" then it's a good idea to help Cortana better understand the sound and quality and nuances of your voice. In that case, click on the link that says: \"Learn how I say 'Hey Cortana.'\" \nA screen pops up telling you that you'll have to repeat six phrases so Cortana can get familiar with your voice. As the screen says, it's best to do this in a quiet place so no extraneous noise interferes with the process. Click on the Start button. \nCortana prompts you to repeat the six phrases, one after the other. If it has trouble understanding a particular phrase, it will ask you to repeat it. When you've repeated all six phrases to Cortana's satisfaction, you can now say \"Hey Cortana\" followed by your question, command, or comment, but now with a bit more confidence that it will understand what you're saying. Get news headlines sent daily   \nOkay, now that Cortana can wake up via your voice, what are some questions, commands, and comments you can throw at it? Here are a few examples. You can tell Cortana to… \nOpen a specific app on your Windows 10 PC Turn key Windows 10 features on and off Set a calendar appointment for a specific date and time. Set a reminder for a specific date and time Provide a weather forecast Compose and send emails and texts to specific people Search for photos, videos, music, documents, and other files by name or other criteria Serve up information on various research questions, such as \"What is the population of the United States?\" or \"Who was the 25th US president?\" Tell you a joke \nCortana can even offer suggestions as it learns more about you. For example, it can cull information about you from its Notebook (the third icon from the top of the Cortana window) to suggest books to read, movies to see, restaurants to dine at, and events to attend. It can also track the status of your airline flights, package shipments, investments, local traffic, and an array of other items. \nFinally, Microsoft's Meet Cortana and What is Cortana webpages provide more details on just what you can ask the voice assistant.

      "title": "How Microsoft Lost In Court Over Windows 10 Upgrades - Slashdot",
      "text": "on Sunday December 04, 2016 @03:39PM from the winning-against-Windows dept. In June a California woman successfully sued Microsoft for $10,000 over forced Windows 10 upgrades, and she's now written a 58-page ebook about her battle (which she's selling for $9.99 ). But an anonymous Slashdot reader shares another inspiring story about a Texas IT worker and Linux geek who got Microsoft to pay him $650 for all the time that he lost. \"Worley built a Windows 7 machine for his grandfather, who has Alzheimer's Disease, [customized] to look like Windows XP, an operating system his grandfather still remembered well...\" writes Digital Trends. \"But thanks to Microsoft's persistent Windows 10 upgrade program, Worley's grandfather unknowingly initiated the Win 10 upgrade by clicking the 'X' to close an upgrade window.\" After Worley filed a legal \"Notice of Dispute,\" Microsoft quickly agreed to his demand for $650 , which he donated to a non-profit focusing on Alzheimer's patients. But according to the article, that's just the beginning, since Worley now \"hopes people impacted by the forced Windows 10 upgrade will write a complaint to Microsoft demanding a settlement for their wasted time and money in repairing the device,\" and on his web page suggests that if people don't need the money, they should give it to charities fighting Alzheimer's . \"If Microsoft isn't going to wake up and realize that lobbing intentionally-tricky updates at people who don't need and can't use them actively damages not only the lives of the Alzheimer's sufferer, but those of their whole family, then let's cure the disease on Microsoft's dime so their tactics and those of companies that will follow their reckless example aren't as damaging.\" Worley suggests each Notice of Dispute should demand at least $50 per hour from Microsoft, adding \"If recent history holds steady they might just write you a check!\" ",

      "title": "Microsoft’s top researchers share their expectations for the future",
      "text": "\nAs 2016 is almost coming to an end, Microsoft is getting ready for the holidays and ramping up for 2017. In a blog post today, the company’s top researchers shared their personal expectations from the future — between 2017 and 2027. Microsoft researchers from around the world, including the United States, China and Asia shared their thoughts on what we might see happen in the next 10 years. Their expectations range from artificial intelligence, machine learning, DNA storage, speech recognition, security research, and a lot more. Here’s a quick list of some of their expectations:\nWhat will be the key advance in speech and natural language processing in 2017? Kalika Bali (Researcher at Microsoft Research India): Our speech and language technology applications will be increasingly multilingual in 2017. That doesn’t just mean that we will add more languages to our offering. We will do that, but we also will have systems that understand, process and generate the language that an English-Spanish or a French-Arabic or a Hindi-English speaker uses when she effortlessly switches from one language to another, within the same conversation, chat and sometimes even within the same sentence. What will be the key advance in algorithms for machine learning in 2017? Jennifer Chayes (Distinguished Scientist and Managing director of Microsoft’s New England and New York City research labs): Deep learning is transforming many aspects of our technology, however deep learning algorithms today are still largely heuristic, based on the experience and intuition of leaders in the field. In 2017, we will develop a more principled understanding of deep learning and hence more robust algorithms. The insights here will come from many fields, including the intersection of statistical physics and computer science. What will be the key advance or topic of virtual reality in 2027? Mar Gonzalez Franco (Researcher at Microsoft Research Redmond): By 2027 we will have ubiquitous virtual reality systems that will provide such rich multisensorial experiences that will be capable of producing hallucinations which blend or alter perceived reality. Using this technology, humans will retrain, recalibrate and improve their perceptual systems. In contrast to current virtual reality systems that only stimulate visual and auditory senses, in the future the experience will expand to other sensory modalities including tactile with haptic devices. What will be the key advance or topic of discussion in artificial intelligence and machine learning in 2027? Katja Hofmann (Researcher, Microsoft Research lab at Cambridge): AI is progressing very rapidly. It has great potential to empower people and help us tackle key global challenges. To me, the most important topic of discussion is how to ensure that by 2027 these advances and great potential translate into AI technology that results in the greatest possible benefit to society. What will be the key advance in mathematics and cryptography in 2017? Kristin Lauter (Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Redmond): New mathematical solutions allowing for computation on encrypted data will be deployed to protect the privacy of medical and genomic data for patients and hospitals. The new homomorphic encryption schemes will secure the data while allowing the cloud to compute on it to make useful risk predictions and provide analysis and alerts. Homomorphic encryption will be deployed soon in the financial sector to protect sensitive banking data. What will be the key advance or topic of discussion in programming languages and software engineering in 2027? Kathryn S. McKinley (Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Redmond) By 2027, the majority of software engineers will be facile in programming systems that reason about estimates and produce models with statistical methods. This sea change will deliver applications that seamlessly integrate sensors, machine learning and approximation to interact with human beings in entirely new, meaningful and correct ways. What will be the key advance in mobile computing in 2017? Oriana Riva (Researcher at Microsoft Research Redmond): In 2017, systems will increasingly re-architect themselves to support interactions without a graphical user interface. We’ll see fewer users installing apps on their devices and more apps turning into behind-the-scenes services for chatbots and personal digital assistants. What will be the key advance in hardware and devices in 2017? Karin Strauss (Senior Research at Microsoft Research Redmond): Moore’s Law has been slowing down. It is getting too expensive to scale general purpose, silicon-based processors and capacitive memories at the same pace as before. As a result, in 2017 we will see a number of new custom hardware accelerators, mostly on FPGA fabrics, proliferate in the cloud to improve performance and lower costs, instead of simply relying on Moore’s Law. Of course, general purpose processors will continue to improve, just at a slower rate. The result will be more interesting, responsive and secure services backed by the cloud. We also will see more virtual reality and augmented reality devices and accessories, both cheap and expensive, come to market. This will result in a number of new applications experimenting with these platforms, as well as interesting developments in content creation for virtual and augmented reality, including 360 degree video recording and similar devices. What will be the key advance or topic of discussion in computer vision in 2027? Xiaoyan Sun (Lead researcher at Microsoft Research Asia): By 2027 the ability for computers to “see” will be ubiquitous as we will have highly developed imaging devices, powerful computing resources and combined deep and wide learning techniques. Advances in these techniques will lead to ubiquitous vision “eyes” that can “see” and empower humans in daily life and all kinds of professions, from manufacturing and health care to finance and security. What will be the key advance in data analytics and vision in 2017? Dongmei Zhang (Principal Research Manager at Microsoft Research Asia): In 2017, the key technology advance of data analytics and visualization will be in smart data discovery, with interactive, intuitive and instant insights at its core. Such insights will be generated automatically and recommended to users based on their analysis context. The insight generation and recommendation will take into account user response, thus creating an effective and fast feedback loop. Users will be able to complete their analytic tasks more quickly and with less effort. You can find more of Microsoft’s researchers expectations for the future here. ",

      "text": "Microsoft's second try at social chat bots arrives in Kik It should be less racist this time around. MSPowerUser \nMicrosoft's first foray into social chat bots didn't go so well given that propensity for racist diatribes . It's giving the concept another try, however, and this time it promises to be more successful. Twitter user Tom Hounsell has noticed the existence of Zo , a Microsoft chat bot currently being tested in the messaging app Kik . Effectively, Zo looks like an English-language version of Microsoft's existing Chinese bot, Xiaoce. After briefly gauging your personality, it'll participate in conversations like an overexcited teenager. The bot is far from perfect, but that's what's testing is for, isn't it? \nNotably, the bot steers clear of topics that could land it in the headlines , like you saw with Tay. Ask Zo about politics or Hitler, for example, and it will not-so-subtly try to guide you away from the subject. It's also uncannily knowledgeable about Microsoft products, and will profess to being a Windows phone fan. \nKik is an unusual proving ground for Microsoft -- you'd expect it to try the bot on Skype or a very large third-party service like WhatsApp. A mid-sized service like Kik makes sense, mind you. It limits testers to those who are genuinely interested in what Zo can do (you can request an invitation if you'd like to try), and reduces the chances that gaffes will reflect badly on Microsoft. If Zo branches out to other platforms, it'll likely happen only after the crew in Redmond is confident that its bot will behave. ",

      "text": "Software Microsoft still has work to do when it comes to malware security Tests performed by AV-Test.org show Microsoft's malware solutions work--but they're far from the best. The company needs to do better. By Mark Kaelin | December 5, 2016, 10:53 AM PST Google Plus \nImage: AV-Test.org \nAccording to AV-Test.org , an independent security research organization, more than 390,000 new malware applications are discovered and registered every day. No matter how you slice it, that is a lot of malware to track and counteract. No wonder so many enterprises fall victim to malware attacks—their defenses are overwhelmed. \nMicrosoft continues to renew its commitment to creating a secure operating environment for its enterprise clients, but there is very little the software company can do to counteract the major weakness in all security systems: people. Technology, no matter how sophisticated, can't outwit its users. Virus protection 2016 Want more about Windows? Read more \nIn October 2016, AV-Test.org conducted its annual test of all the major purveyors of security software on both a consumer and enterprise level. The organization carried out more than 13,000 malware attacks against 22 consumer applications running under Windows 10 and 12 enterprise endpoint security solutions running Windows 8.1. \nThe test criteria were based on three factors: protection, performance, and usability. The good news is that all the test applications passed and received AV-Test's official certification. As you might imagine, some applications protected better than others and some applications performed better than others. But only a few did all three factors well. \nIn the enterprise test, Microsoft's System Center Endpoint Protection fell in the fair-to-middling range, achieving an overall score of 14 out of a possible 18. By comparison, Bitdefender and Kaspersky Labs had the highest scores, both posting perfect 18s. \nImage: AV-Test.org \nExamine the numbers a little more closely and you will note that Microsoft's endpoint solution had very good performance and usability scores with a mediocre protection score. Perhaps Microsoft traded protection for better performance? \nThe consumer part of the test shows that Microsoft Windows Defender running in Windows 10 also failed to impress in the protection factor, while scoring fairly well in performance and usability. Bottom line \nOn a global scale, malware costs enterprises and consumers billions of dollars in lost productivity and worker hours every year. It is a big problem and there is little hope malware will ever be truly eliminated. \nThe AV-Test seems to show that, while Microsoft has professed a renewed effort to combat malware attacks in its products, it still has a long way to go. In real-world scenarios, Microsoft's malware protection solutions and applications are mostly adequate, but they could be, and should be, improved. \nImage: Microsoft News \nTechnology is only part of the problem, however. The easiest and most common way malware gets into an enterprise is through its people. Human beings, no matter how well-trained or how well-intentioned, are flawed and prone to manipulation by other human beings. Technology can reduce the number of ways malware can enter a system—but as we all know, users often circumvent technology in the name of convenience or expedience. \nPeople are the weakest link in any security system. IT professionals must contend with this fact on a daily basis, and while better technology certainly helps, it is not enough. So yes, Microsoft should continue to improve its security solutions across the board, but that is not going to completely solve the problem of malware in the enterprise. Unfortunately, no system is ever truly secure. Keep up with all the latest news about Microsoft. Subscribe to the TechRepublic Microsoft Weekly Newsletter! Subscribe",
