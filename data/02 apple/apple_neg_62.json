Today at the Code Conference in San Francisco, CEO Jack Dorsey announced that the Virtual Card now works with Apple Pay , reports Recode . Image via Recode The move gives the Cash Virtual Card a physical presence, allowing users to spend their Square Cash anywhere Apple Pay is accepted. Dorsey said he's been using the Virtual Card as his primary card for the past two months. Square has steadily been working toward turning Square Cash into a fully fledged payment solution. The service originally started as a peer-to-peer payment system before expanding into online payments with the Virtual Card.",

      "text": "International Business Apple says iPhone 6 battery fires in China likely caused by external factors Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. Posted 07 Dec 2016 12:25 iPhones sit on display during a preview event at the new Apple Store Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York, U.S., July 28, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly A \nBEIJING: Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted - handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov. 20 to address the issue. \n\"The units we've analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. \nThe U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. \nBut domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung's recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. \n\"The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn't necessarily equal a safe product,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. \nState media outlets featuring the Shanghai council's report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. \n\"I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it's not investigated,\" said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. \n\"The news did make me change my Apple habits,\" he told Reuters. \"For example, I don't dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.\" \n(Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Christopher Cushing) - Reuters",

The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013 and moving the operations to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards.

      "text": "ePaper Apple blames external damage for causing several China iPhones to explode or catch fire A customer using her new smartphone during the release of the iPhone 6s at an Apple store in Shanghai. PHOTO: AFP Published http://str.sg/4Aw4 Copy \nSHANGHAI (AFP) - Apple has blamed \"external physical damage\" for causing a handful of iPhones to explode or catch fire in China and insisted that its handsets posed no safety problem. \nFresh on the heels of Samsung's worldwide Galaxy Note 7 safety fiasco, a Shanghai consumer watchdog said last Friday it had received eight recent reports of iPhones that spontaneously combusted while being used or charged. \nIn a statement to AFP late on Tuesday (Dec 6), the US tech giant said it had retrieved units for analysis and conducted thorough tests on phones which had experienced \"thermal events\", but brushed off safety concerns. \n\"The units we've analysed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" the statement said. \n\"We treat safety as a top priority and have found no cause for concern with these products.\" \nThe company also denied being slow to respond, after the state-run Shanghai Consumer Council had urged it to address consumer complaints. \nThe watchdog's report quoted one woman as saying her iPhone 6s Plus exploded in August, shattering the screen and leaving the battery and back of the phone blackened. \nThe council said it had received a sixfold surge in total complaints against Apple in the past two months, including sudden shutdowns of the iPhone 6 and 6s even though batteries still had enough power. \nThe council did not say where the complaining iPhone users were located. \nApple last month offered to change iPhone 6s batteries for Chinese users who complained of the sudden shutdowns, but said the problem did not constitute a safety issue. \nSamsung suffered a severe blow over its Galaxy Note 7's woes, recalling some 2.5 million units after reports of the product catching fire.

The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash. About Us",

      "text": "Business Apple says iPhone 6 battery fires in China likely caused by external factors iPhones sit on display during a preview event at the new Apple Store Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York. Photo: Reuters Tweet Published: 12:40 PM, December 7, 2016 \nBEIJING - Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted - handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov. 20 to address the issue. \n\"The units we've analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. \nThe U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. \nBut domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung's recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. \n\"The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn't necessarily equal a safe product,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. \nState media outlets featuring the Shanghai council's report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. \n\"I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it's not investigated,\" said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. \n\"The news did make me change my Apple habits,\" he told Reuters. \"For example, I don't dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.\" REUTERS",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray After a week or so of negative data points about Apple ’s ( AAPL ) iPhone , with analysts cutting estimates, Credit Suisse ’s Kulbinder Garcha today swoops in with some good news, which is that demand for the iPhone seems just fine, and the company’s heading for record shipments.\n“Supply chain checks from our Asia team are supportive of iPhone strength, particularly around the mix,” writes Garcha, who has an Outperform rating on the shares, and a $150 price target.\n“December quarter builds are expected to be 87mn, the highest quarterly build number we’ve seen historically,” he adds.\n“Additionally, the mix of the iPhone 7 Plus continues to be strong, with the 7 Plus expected to make up ~45% of the iPhone 7/7 Plus mix, materially higher than the ~35% we currently estimate.”\nGarcha, however, is really “ looking forward to the iPhone 8 super cycle ,” he writes, referring to what is presumably the next model, coming sometime in 2017.\nIn fact, he’s so positive on iPhone, he offers up an infographic showing growth through 2018’s presumed “ iPhone 9 ” and 9-Plus and something he’s calling an “iPhone 9 Pro”:\nGarcha notes there have been a number of concerns, such as Apple’s ability to get organic light-emitting diode technology in adequate quantity for an “all-glass” version of the iPhone. He writes that Apple will figure a way:\nThe main concern is whether the production capacity will be up to speed in time for the product launch. Given this concern, we believe that Apple will likely pursue one of three product scenarios next year: (1) 2 iPhones, both OLED; (2) 3 iPhones, 1 OLED version; or (3) 3 iPhones, all OLED.\nGarcha thinks Samsung Electronics ( 005930KS ) will have enough capacity to make 71 million units of an OLED-based iPhone in 2017, and another 276 million units in 2018:\nSamsung could produce 559mn OLED smartphone displays by 2018 according to our Asian team. According to an analysis by our Asia team, given Samsung significant investment in capacity expansion, Samsung could potentially produce up to 559mn OLED smartphone displays in 2018 (assuming 90% yield). Samsung is currently allocating most of the current capacity to Other non-Apple vendors, which we estimate will make up ~283mn units in 2016. Assuming the rest of the incremental capacity goes to Apple going forward, Samsung should have capacity to produce ~276mn OLED displays for Apple by 2018. Our own meetings with Samsung also indicate that capacity could be sufficient at ~271mn OLED units by 2018. In our meetings with Samsung, the company noted that it plans to add 7 A3 lines by 2018. Assuming all of this incremental capacity goes to Apple, this implies ~271mn OLED displays for Apple by 2018. However, sole sourcing could be risky. While Apple has done it before, we would note that sole sourcing the display for an entire product line could be risky, especially as the display already accounts for ~10% of the total BOM.",

      "text": "Pin it Share 3D-printed Samsung and Apple logos are seen in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on January 26, 2016. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic More By Andrew Chung (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung <005930.KS> in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple(AAPL.O), throwing out an appeals court ruling that the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. The 8-0 ruling, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. The justices sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington to determine how much Samsung must pay. But they did not provide a road map to juries and lower courts on how to navigate similar disputes in the future. Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said in a statement, \"We remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\" A representative for Samsung did not immediately comment. Following a 2012 jury verdict favoring Apple, Samsung initially was hit with nearly $930 million in penalties, later cut by $382 million, for infringing Apple's iPhone patents and mimicking its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. Samsung in December 2015 paid its Cupertino, California-based rival $548 million. But Samsung took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make $399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications. With the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world's top smartphone maker. Tuesday's ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung for patent and trademark infringement. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years. The legal dispute centered on whether the term \"article of manufacture,\" on which design patent damages are calculated in U.S. patent law, should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product. In court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component. But Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence. Sotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote. PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY The justices nevertheless refused to devise a test for juries and lower courts to use to discern what a relevant article of manufacture is in a particular case, a task that could be fraught with difficulty when considering high-tech products. \"No doubt whether with Apple-Samsung, or some other design patent case, we are going to have a period of uncertainty where courts will be trying to formulate a test and what the boundaries are,\" Richard McKenna, an expert in design rights at the law firm Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee, said in an interview. In court papers, Apple said its iPhone's success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone's look and many user interface features, Apple said. Samsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits, saying that design elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features. Design patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years. The case is Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd v. Apple Inc, in the Supreme Court of the United States, No. 15-777. (Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham) Reblog",

The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash. About Us",

      "text": "On Tuesday, a years-long courtroom battle between Samsung and Apple — one that began way back in 2011, when Apple filed a patent lawsuit against the Seoul, South Korea-based electronics company for infringing on its iPhone’s iconic design — came to a suitably dramatic end. In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out the almost $400 million in damages Samsung had been ordered to pay Apple by a lower court.\nAt issue before the Court was how the damages were to be calculated. Samsung, which was ruled to have violated Apple’s design patents by a jury in 2012, initially found itself on the hook for the profits generated by each of the 11 patents determined to have to have infringed. Effectively, the company would have had to pay Apple a percentage of each sale. The justices disagreed, ruling that the company only needed to pay damages on the infringing components of those smartphones, rather than the smartphones themselves.\nMore: Apple marketing VP Phil Schiller responds to backlash over MacBook Pro design\nThey were persuaded by the “text of the law,” The Hill reports . In delivering the Court’s majority opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that “article of manufacture” — the legal term that refers to both a product sold to a consumer and a component of said product — has a “broad meaning,” and that an “article” could refer to “a particular thing.” In Samsung’s case, an “article” could be an infringing smartphone’s appearance, for instance, or software feature.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will now determine exact damages, but they’re likely to be far less than the hundreds of millions Samsung might have otherwise paid. The company faced $1 billion in penalties, a total representing all profits generated by the infringing smartphones. That fine was subsequently reduced to $548 million.\n“We decline to lay out a test for the first step of the damages inquiry in the absence of adequate breifing by the parties,” Sotomayor said. “The Federal Circuit may address any remaining issues on remand.”\nRecalling the design of the Volkswagen Beetle To understand the line of questioning from the Supreme Court justices to the two firms’ attorneys, you need to take a look at the law and the argument in the case.\nDesign patents, as the name suggests, protect the unique look of a product. Utility patents protect the functional parts of a product. In the original 2012 case , Apple sued Samsung saying it copied various design patents of the iPhone. The jury ended up siding with Apple, agreeing that Samsung copied the black rectangle shape and rounded corners, the bezel, and a patent that covered the graphical layout of icons on the iPhone. The Korean giant was ordered to pay “total profits” of the phones in question.\n“Whoever during the term of a patent for a design, without license of the owner, applies the patented design, or any colorable imitation thereof, to any article of manufacture for the purpose of sale, or sells or exposes for sale any article of manufacture to which such design or colorable imitation has been applied shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit , but not less than $250, recoverable in any United States district court having jurisdiction of the parties,” the law states (emphasis ours).\nSamsung, and many of its supporters, believe the reward for infringing a design patent should not involve the “total profits.” Since a smartphone is filled with thousands of patented components, infringing design patents should not amount to the total profit of the smartphone. Apple counters that the whole design sells the phone — removing the need to pay total profits would hamper legal protection for new products and design.\nMore: Samsung has finally killed the Galaxy Note 7\nIn recent court filings, Apple has said while “total profit” should mean that Samsung has to pay the total profit of a sale, “article of manufacturer” could mean specific features and not the whole product. The company said in court that significant financial damage would deter people from stealing designs of products.\nOne line of questioning that was prevalent throughout the hearing concerned how to identify the value of a design from the overall product, according to CNET .\n“If I was a juror, I wouldn’t know what to do,” Justice Anthony Kennedy reportedly said. Justices were skeptical about Samsung’s argument, according to The Verge , as Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested that the design of a phone “might drive the sale.”\nThe design of the original Volkswagen Beetle was brought up, as it features many components inside it. Justice Samuel Alito said design was important, but it isn’t the only driving force behind sales.\n“Nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks,” Justice Alito said, according to the Verge.\nBut while the car has to perform all the other functions cars are expected to do, Justice Elena Kagan said perhaps its design was indeed a primary motivator in sales.\nMore: After a slow start last month, iOS 10 now being run on a majority of Apple devices\nIn its brief , Samsung raised the point that if Apple wins, it would mean someone who infringes on the design of a “patented cupholder” may have to pay the entire profits on a car. It’s why Samsung wants “articles of manufacturing” to mean the specific components of a phone, rather than the whole phone itself.\n“The infringement wasn’t found on the whole phone,” Samsung attorney Kathleen Sullivan said after the hearing. “It asserted three narrow patents. The patent doesn’t apply to the internals of the phone, so Apple doesn’t deserve profits on all of Samsung’s phone.”\nShe said awarding total profits for infringing design patents would “devalue” the other important patents in a smartphone, according to CNET. A device typically has about 250,000 patented features, Sullivan noted.\n“We firmly believe that strong design patent protection spurs creativity and innovation,” said Noreen Krall, Apple’s chief litigation officer, after the hearing. “And that’s why we’ve defended ourselves against those who steal our ideas. Eleven times now, Samsung has been found guilty of intentionally and blatantly copying the iPhone. Every court at every level has agreed. We think that’s wrong and that it poses chilling risks to the future of design innovation.”\nThe Supreme Court has not ruled on a design patent case for more than a 100 years, so it is hard to see how this will play out. Suggestions were raised to send the case to lower courts, while the Supreme Court creates new rules on how damages for infringing design patents are awarded and judged.\nA brief history It all began six years ago in 2010, when the iPhone-maker warned Samsung that the Korean giant’s tablets and smartphones infringed on Apple patents. The company did not sue immediately because Samsung was a “trusted partner” — Apple spent billions of dollars on Samsung screens, processors, and other components.\nApple had already gone after another tech giant, HTC, in the same year. The two settled with a cross-licensing patent deal in 2012.\nMore: Why are Apple and Samsung throwing down? A timeline of the biggest fight in tech\nIn October 2010, executives from Samsung and Apple meet and the latter suggests Samsung pay $30 per phone and $40 per tablet for infringing on design patents with the iPhone and iPad. Earlier in the year, HTC agreed to pay Microsoft $5 for every Android device ever sold. Apple’s suggestion was too high for Samsung and the company declined.\nApple sued Samsung the following year for “slavishly” copying the iPhone’s design. Samsung countersued for 3G patents, and filed claims in Germany, Japan, and South Korea.\nThe next six years involved Apple getting judges to ban Samsung devices in various countries including an iPhone and iPad sales ban in Germany that lasted a few hours, failed settlement talks, and even forcing Samsung and Google to scale back the universal search bar on the Galaxy Nexus and Galaxy S3. In the U.K., Apple also had to post a public apology that said Samsung did not copy its designs.\nIn 2012, however, a trial court verdict was reached in the U.S. The jury sided with Apple, awarding the U.S company $1 billion in damages. That did not stop the iPhone maker, as it quickly followed up with another lawsuit that targeted newer Samsung devices. In 2013, the judge that presided over the first case found that the damages Samsung had to pay were calculated incorrectly . Around $450 million of the $1 billion was invalidated and a retrial kicked off later in the year.\nIn another blow to Samsung, the retrial earned Apple an additional $290 million in damages, bringing the total Samsung has to pay to $929 million, a little short of the original $1 billion victory. Samsung immediately appealed the decision. In December 2015, Samsung agreed to pay $548 million to Apple.\nThat amount was based off total profits made by Samsung — and this is where the Supreme Court comes in.\nWho’s with Apple More than a hundred designers and educators support Apple. They are industry professionals and have provided product design services to companies such as Apple, AT&T, Calvin Klein, Coca-Cola, Ford, General Electric, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Google, IBM, the New York Stock Exchange, NASA, Samsung, and more.\nMore: Designers including Calvin Klein file amicus brief supporting Apple in patent case with Samsung\nSome other notable names include Raymond Riley, executive creative director at Microsoft, Bruce Claxton, the former senior director of design at Motorola Solutions, Calvin Klein, the founder of the fashion brand, Sohrab Vossoughi, a former senior industrial designer at HP, and others.\nWho’s with Samsung A host of Silicon Valley companies are rooting for Samsung, including Google, Facebook, eBay, Dell, HP, Newegg, Vizio, and a smaller coalition of other tech firms. Non-profits like the Electronic Frontier Foundation also support the South Korean giant, as do 50 intellectual property professors from universities like Stanford, Georgetown, Notre Dame, and more.\nWhat happens after? Samsung’s win sets a precedent that could affect other design cases. And depending on the lower court’s decision, it could mean Samsung owes less money to Apple.\nIf Apple were to have won, Samsung would’ve had to pay up, and there likely would have been more trials related to other design patent cases between the two.\nThe decision won’t impact consumers, but it will affect how future design patent disputes are handled.\nArticle originally published in October 2016.

      "text": "Youtube U.S Supreme Court sides with Samsung in $399M patent battle with Apple \nThe U.S Supreme Court has sided with Samsung in its ongoing battle with Apple over smartphone patent which will potentially save the South Korean smartphone maker $399 million in damages. \nThe five year long design patent battle between the two tech giants reached Supreme Court in October. Apple had sued Samsung for copying design features of its devices, and other software features. Samsung was ordered to pay Apple $399M for copying the iPhone’s rounded edges, flat screen, and the way in which apps are arranged following which the company filed a request with the Supreme Court asking it to re-examine the decisions made in the patent infringement lawsuit against Apple. \nThe $399 million won by Apple was based on a percentage of the entire profit Samsung made from its infringing smartphones. However, Samsung argued that instead of calculating the damages on entire profit, they should be based on only part of the profit, as only part of the phone’s design was copied from Apple. \nThe latest decision from the Supreme Court does not reverse Apple’s win however the case will now be returned to the Federal Circuit to reassess the damages. \nSource Author: Sneha Bokil Sneha Bokil is a tech enthusiast and is currently using Nexus 5X but she still treasures her Nokia N70 (M).

      "text": "Apple’s 2016 MacBook Pro made quite a splash when it was introduced in October 2016. The new OLED Touch Bar stole the show, and the drive toward ever-thinner devices was also on display with the new MacBook Pro models being the thinnest ever.\nOne consequence of making the machines so thin is that every legacy port was removed, leaving the MacBook Pro with either two or four USB Type-C connections and nothing else. Apple’s unpopular solution is a bundle of dongles, which is costly and inconvenient for anyone who needs to connect to most of today’s external devices. The HyperDrive Compact Thunderbolt 3 USB-C hub aims to solve that problem, and it’s available for ordering now in a Kickstarter campaign .\nView photos\nhyperdrive-usb-c-port More More: Apple slashes the price of USB-C dongles over MacBook Pro port outcry\nBasically, the HyperDrive plugs into two of the USB Type-C connections on a 2016 MacBook Pro and offers up a host of full-speed ports without the muss and fuss of dongles. The following ports are supported on the MacBook Pro with and without Touch Bar:\nMicroSD UHS-1 104Mb/s slot SD UHS-1 105Mb/s slot 2 x USB 3.1 Gen 1 5Gb/s port USB-C 5Gb/s port USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 40Gb/s port with max 100-watt power delivery HDMI video 1080p @ goHz, 4K @ 30Hz port What separates the HyperDrive from other snap-on hubs is its status as the first that uses two USB Type-C connections to maximize bandwidth. The HyperDrive offers up to 45Gb/s bandwidth to support the use of all seven ports at the same time. The Thunderbolt 3 port provides a full 100 watts of power to fully charge the MacBook Pro at either 61 watts for the 13-inch model and 87 watts for the 15-inch.\nView photos\nOne issue that has popped up regarding the 2016 MacBook Pro is Apple’s decision to support only the newest Thunderbolt 3 controllers . According to Sanho Corporation, maker of the HyperDrive, the hubs work “perfectly” with the 2016 MacBook Pro hardware and so shouldn’t suffer from these issues.\nThe HyperDrive can be ordered now at Kickstarter, and should be delivered to Early Bird buyers in February 2017 and to everyone else in March 2017. Purchase options range from the $49 Early Bird option for a single Silver or Space Gray HyperDrive, which is 50 percent off the expected retail price of $99, to $690 for a 10-HyperDrive bundle.\nOWC Thunderbolt 3 Dock offers 13 ports for easier MacBook Pro connections Two Thunderbolt 3 ports on the 13″ MacBook Pro have reduced PCI Express bandwidth PowerColor adds devilish graphics power to your PC for under $400",

      "title": "Apple’s iPhone 6S battery woes due to overexposure to air during assembly",
      "text": "Jessica Lee Star/Digital Trends\nSamsung isn’t the only company to have experienced battery-related issues recently — Apple is also dealing with its fair share of troubles, and last month issued a recall program for certain iPhone 6S models that were shutting down unexpectedly due to rapidly decreasing battery life. The reason for the battery issues? According to Apple , it’s that the batteries were exposed to air. Yep, air is apparently the culprit.\nThat doesn’t mean that there was a hole in your phone — Apple says the batteries were exposed to “controlled ambient air,” which basically means that while the batteries were being assembled, they were exposed to a little more air than they should have been. Because of that, the batteries degraded faster than they usually would. Apple is quick to note that the problem does not result in a safety issue.\nMore: iPhone shots too dark? This phone case has built-in LEDs for smartphone photography\nIn other words. the issue seems to be a pretty mundane manufacturing flaw. And it makes sense that Apple would want to highlight the fact that there’s no safety issue — no manufacturer would want to be compared to Samsung at this point.\nIt’s still not exactly clear how many phones were affected, and Apple has only referred to a “very small number” of devices. Apple also says that a few customers outside the “affected range” of devices are experiencing issues with their phone, but the company hasn’t said why or what it might do about it. It did, however, say that it would include “additional diagnostic capability in an iOS software update” set to be released sometime next week.\nIf you’re unsure if you’re in the group of people affected by the issue, Apple has released a diagnostic tool to help you check. If you are in that group, Apple will send a replacement phone to your nearest Apple Store.\nApple has launched its second iPhone repair program in less than a week Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 debacle is far from over Microsoft’s Surface Pro 3 battery woes resurface after August’s firmware update",

      "text": "Apple is still thinking about replacing ‘everything in your wallet’, says Apple Pay boss Jennifer Bailey Credit cards, transit passes — are digital ID cards next? share Henry Dombey for Recode Apple launched Apple Pay in 2014 with a plan to try to replace your wallet . Its first service was digital payments with credit and debit cards. In the meantime, it has added support for transit passes and loyalty cards, and — as announced tonight — for Square Cash . But what about other things that still require carrying a physical wallet, such as identification cards? “Everything in your wallet, we’re thinking about,” Apple VP Jennifer Bailey, who runs Apple Pay, said at tonight’s Code Commerce Series event in San Francisco. Bailey wouldn’t elaborate on plans to digitize forms of identification, such as drivers licenses, but it sounds like it’s the sort of thing Apple would like to eventually support. Bailey did want to talk about transit, especially in Japan, where the company recently launched Apple Pay support for the country’s native Suica transit and payments system. More than a million customers are already active on Apple Pay there. And Apple’s transit customers are three times more active in the first week than traditional credit and debit users, Bailey said. “You can expect us to do more in transit.” recode_divider",

      "text": "– A + Apple selects 'Best of 2016' apps, movies, iBooks and more By AppleInsider Staff \nTuesday, December 06, 2016, 09:41 pm PT (12:41 am ET) \nApple on Tuesday unveiled its \"Best of\" selections for 2016, highlighting the year's most popular apps, TV shows, movies, e-books and other content sold across the company's various digital storefronts. \n\n\n\n\nPhoto editing app Prisma , known for its painterly renditions of iPhone snaps, and hugely successful real-time multiplayer strategy title Clash Royale took top honors as best iPhone app and game of the year, respectively. Face-shifting and photo filters app MSQRD and Reigns were runners-up. \n\nThough it didn't place in the top two, Niantic's wildly successful game Pokemon GO received special recognition as the App Store's \"Breakout Hit\" of 2016. \n\nSketchBook Motion was named Apple's top iPad app, while award-winning game Severed added to its growing list of accolades as the Best iPad Game of 2016.\n\nOn Apple Watch, fitness tracker MySwimPro won app of the year (perhaps a nod to the enhanced water resistance of Apple Watch Series 2), as farming game Field Day took home best game. Twitter's new tvOS app and Riptide GP: Renegade were respectively named best Apple TV app and game.\n\nMoving on to Apple Music, Drake swept both top song and top album of 2016 with the track \"One Dance\" off the album \"Views.\" Additionally, Apple published a list of 2016's Top 100 songs in a special Apple Music playlist , featuring songs from The Chainsmokers, Justin Bieber, twenty one pilots and more.\n\nThe \"Best of\" section in the iTunes Movies Store narrowed down selections by genre, with \"Deadpool,\" \"Sausage Party,\" \"La La Land,\" \"Kubo and the Two Strings,\" \"Weiner,\" \"Sing Street,\" American Honey\" and \"Moonlight\" each taking home awards. TV show selections include \"The People V. O.J. Simpson,\" \"O.J.: Made in America,\" \"Full Frontal with Samantha Bee,\" \"Atlanta,\" \"Steven Universe,\" RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars,\" \"The Americans\" and \"This is Us.\"\n\nPodcast selections include \"Revisionist History,\" \"How I Built This,\" \"In the Dark,\" \"Jocko Podcast,\" \"Anna Faris is Unqualified,\" \"FiveThirtyEight Politics,\" \"Pardon My Take\" and more. \n\nFinally, on the iBooks Store, Apple editors chose a number of outstanding books including \"Moonglow,\" \"Evicted,\" \"If I was Your Girl,\" \"Homegoing,\" \"Sweetbitter\" and \"Dark Money,\" among others. \n\nA full list of winner can be found on the App Store, iTunes and iBook Store.",

      "text": "Pin it Share Apple has blamed \"external physical damage\" for causing a handful of iPhones to explode or catch fire in China (AFP Photo/STR) More Shanghai (AFP) - Apple has blamed \"external physical damage\" for causing a handful of iPhones to explode or catch fire in China and insisted that its handsets posed no safety problem. Fresh on the heels of Samsung's worldwide Galaxy Note 7 safety fiasco, a Shanghai consumer watchdog said last Friday it had received eight recent reports of iPhones that spontaneously combusted while being used or charged. In a statement to AFP late Tuesday, the US tech giant said it had retrieved units for analysis and conducted thorough tests on phones which had experienced \"thermal events\", but brushed off safety concerns. \"The units we’ve analysed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" the statement said. \"We treat safety as a top priority and have found no cause for concern with these products.\" The company also denied being slow to respond, after the state-run Shanghai Consumer Council had urged it to address consumer complaints. The watchdog's report quoted one woman as saying her iPhone 6s Plus exploded in August, shattering the screen and leaving the battery and back of the phone blackened. The council said it had received a sixfold surge in total complaints against Apple in the past two months, including sudden shutdowns of the iPhone 6 and 6s even though batteries still had enough power. The council did not say where the complaining iPhone users were located. Apple last month offered to change iPhone 6s batteries for Chinese users who complained of the sudden shutdowns, but said the problem did not constitute a safety issue. Samsung suffered a severe blow over its Galaxy Note 7's woes, recalling some 2.5 million units after reports of the product catching fire. Reblog",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) \nWASHINGTON (AP) — A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone’s patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay “total profit.” Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone’s success was directly tied to its distinctive look. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Samsung prevails over Apple in $399M patent appeal Agence France-Presse / 08:45   A woman walks by a billboard of Samsung Electronics’s smartphones at a showroom of its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea. AP FILe \nWASHINGTON, United States — The US Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $399 million patent infringement penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple’s iPhone design, in a case watched for its implications for technology innovation. \nThe shorthanded justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court. \nWhile the ruling was short on specifics, analysts said it was likely to curb litigation from patent holders expecting to reap big profits from infringement on a component. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty — one element of a major patent infringement case — was inappropriate because it represented “Samsung’s entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones” for copying the iPhone’s “rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.” \nBut the court stopped short of delving into details of how the lower court should determine the penalty. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion that “doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture… and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.” \nThe court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details. \nThe case is one element of the $548 million penalty — knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award — Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents. No clarity \nObservers had been watching to see how the court — which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century — would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. \nDennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed. \n“Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,” Crouch said in a blog post. \nCrouch said the court allowed for damages at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is “an article of manufacture,” leaving the matter open to interpretation. \n“Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level (of damages) applies in particular cases,” he wrote. \nSamsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation. \nApple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics, citing precedents like Coca-Cola’s iconic soda bottle. \nReacting to the verdict, an Apple spokesman said in an email, “Our case has always been about Samsung’s blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute… We remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn’t right.” \nSamsung did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ‘Sigh of relief’ \nFlorian Mueller, an intellectual property analyst who writes a closely followed patent blog, wrote that “large parts of the (US and global) tech industry will breathe a sigh of relief now,” even if the case is not settled. \nEd Black, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which represents major tech firms, welcomed the ruling. \n“This was a pivotal court case for the technology industry and it is encouraging to see the law interpreted and applied in a way that makes sense in a modern era and protects both inventors and innovation,” Black said. \nThe lower court’s interpretation of design patents, Black said, “would have had a chilling effect on investment and the development of products — especially in the tech sector.” \nBrian Love, a law professor who follows technology at the University of Santa Clara, said it was noteworthy that the top court declined to provide detailed guidance on how to resolve the damage award. \n“The district court may well end up allowing the entire amount to stand, but it seems more likely that the award will be substantially reduced,” Love said. \nStill, Love said it may dissuade companies from launching new lawsuits on design patents. \n“Interest in design patents spiked following Apple’s first jury verdict in 2012,” he said. \n“Companies suddenly saw design patent rights as a potential gold mine. Now, it seems likely that assertion of design patents will return to being a rare occurrence.” CBB",

      "text": "  Apple blames damage for exploding phones Wed, 07 Dec 2016 8:08 AM Share Your Email An iPhone. Credit: Apple, Inc. \nApple has blamed \"external physical damage\" for causing a handful of iPhones to explode or catch fire in China and insisted that its handsets posed no safety problem. \nFresh on the heels of Samsung's worldwide Galaxy Note 7 safety fiasco, a Shanghai consumer watchdog said last Friday it had received eight recent reports of iPhones that spontaneously combusted while being used or charged. \nIn a statement to AFP late Tuesday, the US tech giant said it had retrieved units for analysis and conducted thorough tests on phones which had experienced \"thermal events\", but brushed off safety concerns. \n\"The units we’ve analysed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" the statement said. \n\"We treat safety as a top priority and have found no cause for concern with these products.\" \nThe company also denied being slow to respond, after the state-run Shanghai Consumer Council had urged it to address consumer complaints. \nThe watchdog's report quoted one woman as saying her iPhone 6s Plus exploded in August, shattering the screen and leaving the battery and back of the phone blackened. \nThe council said it had received a sixfold surge in total complaints against Apple in the past two months, including sudden shutdowns of the iPhone 6 and 6s even though batteries still had enough power. \nThe council did not say where the complaining iPhone users were located. \nApple last month offered to change iPhone 6s batteries for Chinese users who complained of the sudden shutdowns, but said the problem did not constitute a safety issue. \nSamsung suffered a severe blow over its Galaxy Note 7's woes, recalling some 2.5 million units after reports of the product catching fire.

      "text": "Drew Angerer | Getty Images A customer tries out an Apple Watch Nike+ at an Apple Store in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, October 28, 2016 in New York City. Apple Watch sales appear to have rebounded for the holidays from mid-year doldrums on a redesign, price cuts and strong promotions, but analysts say long-term demand has yet to be proven.\nThe Watch is Apple 's first new product under Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and is seen as a barometer of whether the company can find new sources of revenue to boost sales which now largely depend on the iPhone.\nCook told Reuters on Monday that Watch sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high during the first week of holiday shopping.\nCook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC that painted a more alarming picture, estimating Watch sales fell 71 percent in the third quarter of 2016.\nThe sharp change in seasonal demand, also revealed in separate data from market research firm Slice Intelligence, amplifies some analysts' concerns that the Apple Watch may not be a formidable hit on the order of the iPhone or iPad.\n\"Let's see if the demand carries through to the next quarter,\" said analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners.\nApple watch sales set record in holiday week: Reuters 12 Hours Ago | 04:28 ‹ 04:28 Apple watch sales set record in holiday week: Reuters 12 Hours Ago 00:42 Tim Cook offers update on Apple Watch sales 16 Hours Ago 01:10 Apple on Supreme Court's patent infringement case decision 9 Hours Ago › Data from Slice Intelligence shows sales were tepid in July and August and then jumped in September, when the watch was updated.\nSlice reported that sales faded somewhat in October and strengthened again in November. Average selling prices of the watch fell to $353.19 in November from $393.39 in October, according to Slice.\nApple Watch prices experienced a similar dip last year, hitting $321.63 in December 2015, although the drop this year is notable because it comes in the wake of a product update.\nApple, which declined to comment on the Slice data, has cut the retail price of the entry level watch over the last year. The original Apple Watch debuted in 2015 with a starting price of $349, but Apple trimmed the price to $299 in March 2016. It dropped it again to $269 in September, when a new generation of watches was released.\nApple also raised the profile of the Watch this holiday season. That effort included a promotional deal with Nike and aggressive advertising.\nResearcher Market Track said that promotions of Apple watches in retailer circulars have risen to 14 percent of the wearables market this year from 6 percent last year.\nApple may also be getting a boost from sales of the original Watch. It no longer sells solely in its own stores, but some third-party retailers, such as Target and Best Buy offer it, often with deep discounts for older models. Some of those same retailers, and Apple itself, offered gift-card based discounts on the newer watches as well on Black Friday.\n\"Whether Apple can sustain this strength will be the key question and at what impact to margins,\" Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um wrote in a note to investors.\nWhile Apple has cut retail prices, it has cut costs as well. This year's entry-level 38-millimeter watch cost about $92.78 to make, compared with $98.79 for last year's model, according to an analysis by IHS, a technology research firm. Analyst Kevin Keller said that the difference between retail price and production price still left Apple with a \"substantial amount of money.\"\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .",

      "text": "Apple's iPhone 6S battery issue is larger than the company first thought.\nThe problem: iPhone 6S devices that shut down the phones abruptly. After announcing an exchange program last month for certain phones, Apple said Tuesday that the issue may extend beyond phones manufactured in September or October of 2015.\nUSA TODAY\nApple to replace faulty batteries on some iPhone 6S models\n\"A small number of customers outside of the affected range have also reported an unexpected shutdown,\" wrote the iPhone maker in a posting on the company's Chinese support page . Apple notes that some phones shut down \"under normal conditions in order for the iPhone to protect its electronics,\" but that it would be releasing a software update next week to garner more information. It is also exploring a possible software fix which would be deployed in a future version of iOS.\nThe company stresses that the issue poses no safety risk to users.\nApple declined to comment on how many phones are impacted or if the issue extended to other devices such as the iPhone 6S Plus.\nThe problem stems from a component in the battery that was \"exposed to controlled ambient air\" for a longer period of time than it should have been before it was put into the battery packs.\nThose with iPhone 6S phones that they feel have been having issues can go to their local Apple Store or an authorized service provider, the small repair shops with the stickers that say they're authorized by Apple as well as retailers such as Best Buy. If it is determined that your phone is one of the affected units, the company will swap out the battery free of charge. Users can also enter their phone's serial number onto the company's support page to see if their phone is one of the bad ones.\nUSA TODAY\nTim Cook praises Watch sales amid wearable concerns\nApple is the latest major tech company to suffer from battery issues. Samsung notably recalled and cancelled its Galaxy Note 7 phone this fall after numerous devices saw their batteries catch fire or explode. There have thus far been no reports of similar issues from the iPhone 6S.\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal",

      "text": "Yesterday, 4:40 PM by Eric M. Zeman @phonescooper \nSigning into TV and other video apps should be less painful thanks to the launch of Apple 's Single sign-on service. Single sign-on allows people to enter their cable provider's credentials just once and then automatically be signed in to all that TV and video apps that require those credentials. At launch, the service is limited to CenturyLink, Prism, DirecTV, Dish, GTA, GVTC, Hawaiian Telcom, Hotwire, MetroCast, and Sling TV. Notable absences include Verizon's FiOS TV service, Comcast, Time Warner, and CableVision. Moreover, the initial batch of apps that support the service are limited, too. For example, A&E supports Single sign-on for iOS, but not tvOS. Similarly, NBC supports Single sign-on for tvOS, but not iOS. Major channels, including CBS and Disney aren't yet supporting Single sign-on. It is up to TV providers to voluntarily update their apps with support for Single sign-on, which is not mandated by Apple. Single sign-on requires iOS 10 and tvOS 10 or later.",

      "text": "For the Lifestyle Athlete: Apple Watch Series 2 \nRetail Price: $269 USD \nApple finally has something you can drop in the pool without needing a bag of rice to get working again. The new Apple Watch Series 2 has been marketed heavily to swimmers and fitness freaks alike as a do-it-all smartwatch. Add the Swim.com app to it and it’s the perfect tech gift for swimmers who live the athlete lifestyle. The Apple Watch Series 2 does everything in it’s power to keep you healthy; it even tells you when to breathe. \nThe Swim.com app takes the Apple Watch Series 2’s waterproof design and turns it into a swim tracking powerhouse. Simply press the “Start” button at the beginning of your workout and the app will automatically calculate your distance, detect when you’re swimming or resting, tell you your splits, stroke count, stroke rate, heart rate and everything else your coach has been banging into your head.

This setup tracks everything, from time spent underwater to stroke rate to turn time. And it’s all visible right on the coach’s iPad on the pool deck. \nEach swimmer being tracked wears a small unit on the back of their head that uses sensor data to track the swimmer’s motion through the water. The data is transferred wirelessly through a custom RF protocol to a base station connected to the coach’s mobile device. The coach can instantly get feedback and communicate it to the swimmer, or save that data for the swimmer to view later. \nTritonWear was developed in Waterloo, Ontario (home of Pebble and the BlackBerry) by former swimmers and is endorsed by some of the top coaches in Canada. They’ve also got a contest going on now to win a free starter pack so you just might be able to pick up your coach’s gift for free this year.

      "text": "The US Supreme Court today tossed out a $399 million patent award from Samsung over copying Apple’s iPhone design, sending the case back to a lower court. The justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, in a case closely watched by the tech industry. The 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty — one element of a major patent infringement case — was inappropriate because it represented “Samsung’s entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones” for copying the iPhone’s “rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colourful icons on a black screen.” But the court stopped short of delving",

The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013 and moving the operations to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards.

      "text": "High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple By SAM HANANELAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices. \nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. \nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market. \nIn a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts \"will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\" \n\"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,\" the company said. \"We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world's most innovative and beloved product.\" \nSamsung in a statement called the ruling a victory \"for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\" \nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone. \nOn the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs. \n\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\" Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance.

      "text": "Court ordered to relook Apple’s $399M award from Samsung Wednesday 7th December , 2016 6:00 am \nThe U.S. Supreme Court told a lower court to take another look at a $399 million award won by Apple Inc. from rival Samsung Electronics Co. for copying the design of the iPhone. \nThe unanimous decision extends a legal battle that dates back to 2011 and at one point spanned the globe and engulfed every major maker of smartphones. Writing for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said Apple might not be entitled to Samsung’s entire profit on 11 infringing smartphones. She told a federal appeals court to consider whether Apple should be able to recoup profits attributable only to particular components. The high court stopped short of deciding that question itself. \nSotomayor said the lower court’s approach “cannot be squared with the text” of the federal patent statute. \nDesign patents, which cover the ornamental look of an object rather than any functional aspect, are increasingly used by tech companies and makers of consumer products to differentiate their products from competitors. The Supreme Court hadn’t considered design patents since disputes involving spoon handles in the 1870s and carpets in the 1890s. \nThe legal issues in the case narrowed after the high court accepted it in March. Apple said it accepted that in some cases the patent holder can collect only the profit attributable to a particular component, and not the earnings from the entire product. \nApple argued, however, that Samsung failed to show that the patented designs applied only to part of its phones. Samsung contended that it was Apple’s burden to show that the infringement gave Samsung any increased profits. \nGoogle, Facebook Inc., EBay Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. said in filings that a victory for Apple would allow owners of design patents to extract unfair rewards on products that can have hundreds or even thousands of features. \nA federal appeals court said Apple could collect Samsung’s entire profit. \nApple introduced the iPhone in 2007, revolutionizing an industry that before then had received limited interest from consumers. Apple said that Samsung simply copied the look of the iPhone to avoid a loss of market share. \nThe case is Samsung Electronics v. Apple, 15-777. \n–",

      "text": "View photos\nMembers of the media film the new iPhone 7 at an Apple store in Beijing, China, September 16, 2016. REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo More BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media.\nThe Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted - handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov. 20 to address the issue.\n\"The units we've analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue.\nThe U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7.\nBut domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups.\nThe Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung's recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015.\n\"The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn't necessarily equal a safe product,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys.\nState media outlets featuring the Shanghai council's report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety.\n\"I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it's not investigated,\" said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing.\n\"The news did make me change my Apple habits,\" he told Reuters. \"For example, I don't dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.\"\n(Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",

The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) Posted: Tuesday, December 6, 2016 7:51 pm | Updated: 9:16 pm, Tue Dec 6, 2016. High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple Associated Press | \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices. \nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. \nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market. \nIn a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts \"will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\" \n\"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,\" the company said. \"We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world's most innovative and beloved product.\" \nSamsung in a statement called the ruling a victory \"for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\" \nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone. \nOn the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs. \n\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\"",

      "text": "Apple's iPhone 6S battery issue is larger than the company first thought. The problem: iPhone 6S devices that shut down the phones abruptly. After announcing an exchange program last month for certain phones, Apple said Tuesday that the issue may extend beyond phones manufactured in September or October of 2015.\nUSA TODAY\nApple to replace faulty batteries on some iPhone 6S models\n\"A small number of customers outside of the affected range have also reported an unexpected shutdown,\" wrote the iPhone maker in a posting on the company's Chinese support page . Apple notes that some phones shut down \"under normal conditions in order for the iPhone to protect its electronics,\" but that it would be releasing a software update next week to garner more information. It is also exploring a possible software fix which would be deployed in a future version of iOS.\nThe company stresses that the issue poses no safety risk to users.\nApple declined to comment on how many phones are impacted or if the issue extended to other devices such as the iPhone 6S Plus.\nThe problem stems from a component in the battery that was \"exposed to controlled ambient air\" for a longer period of time than it should have been before it was put into the battery packs.\nThose with iPhone 6S phones that they feel have been having issues can go to their local Apple Store or an authorized service provider, the small repair shops with the stickers that say they're authorized by Apple as well as retailers such as Best Buy. If it is determined that your phone is one of the affected units, the company will swap out the battery free of charge. Users can also enter their phone's serial number onto the company's support page to see if their phone is one of the bad ones.\nUSA TODAY\nTim Cook praises Watch sales amid wearable concerns\nApple is the latest major tech company to suffer from battery issues. Samsung notably recalled and cancelled its Galaxy Note 7 phone this fall after numerous devices saw their batteries catch fire or explode. There have thus far been no reports of similar issues from the iPhone 6S.\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal",

      "text": "WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court's ruling Tuesday that Samsung may not owe Apple the full profits from smartphones that copied iPhone design features could further expand the market for the popular devices. The high court reversed a lower court decision that had forced Samsung to pay $399 million in damages for violating three of Apple's design patents on the iPhone's shape and colorful icons. The justices ordered that court to decide if only components were infringed upon, not the entire product.\nThe 8-0 verdict from Justice Sonia Sotomayor was a much-needed victory for Samsung, beset with problems ranging from smartphones that burst into flames to washers with exploding tops. It initially faced nearly $1 billion in penalties, later reduced to $548 million, for imitating elements of the iPhone's design. Nearly $400 million was at stake in the current dispute.\n\"The term 'article of manufacture' is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product whether sold separately or not,\" Sotomayor wrote.\nThe ruling jibed with comments several justices had made when the highly charged case was argued in October. Chief Justice John Roberts noted then that Samsung did not infringe on \"all the chips and wires.\"\nThe ruling could impact the buying habits of consumers, who increasingly are being offered a slew of new smartphones from Apple, Samsung and others that offer similar features. While Samsung still could pay a hefty penalty, the decision may ease the risk for manufacturers who mimic other products.\nThe legal battle between the two tech giants represented the first design patent case to reach the high court in more than a century. A jury in 2012 had ruled that because Samsung infringed on three of Apple's iPhone design patents, it must fork over the entire profits from the phones in question.\nBut the high court's ruling left open what courts should do when balancing design against a full product. An \"article of manufacture,\" it said, \"is simply a thing made by hand or machine.\"\n\"In the case of a design for a single-component product, such as a dinner plate, the product is the 'article of manufacture' to which the design has been applied,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"In the case of a design for a multi-component product, such as a kitchen oven, identifying the 'article of manufacture' to which the design has been applied is a more difficult task.\"\nThe five-year-old fight between the world's two most successful smartphone makers had threatened to upend the tech industry. It was watched closely by companies with a stake in the outcome — from Facebook, Google, Dell and Lenovo on Samsung's side, to more than 100 designers from companies such as Nike and Calvin Klein in Apple's corner.\nApple took a hard line Tuesday against what it called Samsung's \"blatant copying of our ideas\" and said it hoped lower courts \"will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\"\nSamsung did not immediately respond. During oral argument, its attorney, Kathleen Sullivan, told the justices that \"a smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work.\"\nSamsung's attorney, Kathleen Sullivan, answers questions outside the Supreme Court following oral argument Oct. 11. (Photo: Kevin Wolf, AP Images for Samsung)\nNow the case will return to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has jurisdiction on patent cases, to determine what portion of its profits Samsung must pay.\nSeveral experts on intellectual property law predicted it won't be easy for courts to differentiate between a product's design and its overall use, not to mention setting dollar figures for components.\n\"It is possible that we will enter into years of turmoil over the proper tests for calculating damages for infringement of a design patent,\" said Rick McKenna, head of the design rights group at the law firm Foley & Lardner.\nContributing: Jon Swartz in San Francisco.",

(Reuters) Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. The Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted – handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov. 20 to address the issue.\n“The units we’ve analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,” an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue.",

The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013 and moving the operations to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there.",

      "text": "Share View photos iPhones sit on display during a preview event at the new Apple Store Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York, U.S., July 28, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly More BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. The Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted - handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov. 20 to address the issue. \"The units we've analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. The U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. But domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. The Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung's recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. \"The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn't necessarily equal a safe product,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. State media outlets featuring the Shanghai council's report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. \"I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it's not investigated,\" said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. \"The news did make me change my Apple habits,\" he told Reuters. \"For example, I don't dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.\" (Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Christopher Cushing) Reblog",

      "text": "SHARES Henry Dombey | Recode \nApple and Square have announced a new partnership that will allow people to add money stored on Square's virtual card, an app called Square Cash, to their Apple Wallet. \nThis allows users to tap to spend money from Square Cash anywhere that accepts Apple Pay, with the tap of their mobile device. \nSquare CEO Jack Dorsey and Apple Vice President Jennifer Bailey, who runs Apple Pay, unveiled the new partnership at the Code Commerce conference in San Francisco on Tuesday evening. \n\"People just want a more modern interface to their finances,\" Dorsey, who is also co-founder and chief executive of Twitter , said. Chris Ratcliffe   \nThe goal of the deal is to drive adoption of both services and give consumers better, more secure options than they currently had with credit and debit cards, the executives said. Many people hate the new chip cards because of the time it took for merchants to process transactions, Dorsey added. \n\"The benefit to Apple Pay is our experience is much better and it's much faster,\" said Bailey, who noted that Apple Pay was now accepted by 35 percent of U.S. merchants. \n\"We see this growing,\" said Dorsey. \"The rest of the world is mainly tap.\" \nApple revealed in September that Apple Pay transactions had grown 500 percent over last year. \n\"Our goal is to replace the wallet,\" Bailey said. \n  Harriet Taylor CNBC Tech Reporter Related Securities",

      "text": "Apple pays $450,000 for alleged hazardous waste violations     \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \" Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. \nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. \nCalifornia's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash. About Us",

      "text": "Enlarge (credit: Valentina Palladino)\nA new report from IDC shows Apple Watch sales have slumped since last year. The report estimates that Apple has sold 1.1 million Watch units in the third quarter of 2016, down 71 percent from a year ago. However, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly told Reuters that sell-through, or the number of Apple Watches that reach consumers rather than the number on store shelves, reached a new high.\n\"Sales growth is off the charts,\" Cook said. \"In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product’s history. And as we expected, we’re on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.\"\nApple also expects the holiday shopping season to be big for the Watch. This could prove to be true, since it is arguably the most complementary device in Apple's lineup and more suited as a gift than an iPhone. Apple generally doesn't talk about Apple Watch sales on its earnings calls, nor does it reveal exact sales numbers for the device. The Watch remains in an \"other products\" category (along with the iPod and Apple TV), rather than standing on its own in the company's sales figures.\nRead 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "Apple recently acknowledged the iPhone 6s battery issue that was causing some devices to abruptly shut down. The company mentioned that iPhone 6s models manufactured between September and October 2015 have been affected, and blamed it on the ‘controlled ambient air’ for causing this issue. Apple also announced a free battery replacement for the affected devices saying that “very small number” of devices have been affected.

Apple further mentioned that it needs more diagnostic data to figure out the problem and a software fix may be able to fix certain issues. “Outside the affected batch, a small number",

Prisma, for example, adds cool effects on top of your photos: what's not to like? Pokemon Go being the top free app, too — no surprise there. Same for the top grossing app. But it sure seems like people spend a lot of money on face-tuning apps. Just take better selfies , people. \nApple's Top 10 Apps For 2016 - Editor's Choice: Prisma ",

      "text": "A bug in Apple’s aapl iPhone 6s battery that causes some phones to abruptly shutdown before their charge is exhausted is more widespread than the company initially thought.\nOn Tuesday the iPhone maker announced that the issue may affect some phones not manufactured in September or October of 2015, which it had previously determined as the only susceptible batch.\nIn the English translation of a message posted on the company’s Chinese support page , Apple said that a “small number of customers outside of the affected range have also reported an unexpected shutdown.”\nThe bug -- which the company put down to a battery component being “exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been” before assembly -- is not a safety issue, Apple stressed.\nAfter a wave of complaints flooded Beijing-based regulator the China Consumers Association last month, Apple announced in November that it would offer free battery replacements for iPhone 6s units purchased in September and October 2015 that fell within an undisclosed serial number range.\nIn its latest announcement, the California-based tech company said that, as part of an information gathering effort, it would be incorporating additional diagnostic capabilities in an iOS software update, which would be available next week. It did not disclose how many phones might be affected.\nFor more on Apple’s iPhone 6s battery issue, watch Fortune’s video: \n\nIt has been a tough year for smart phone makers. Earlier this year Samsung ssnlf was forced to recall and cancel its Galaxy Note 7 after numerous users reported their phones exploding or catching fire. That bug was down to overheating lithium-ion batteries. ",

      "text": "Apple says iPhone 6 battery fires in China likely caused by external factors 4 Hours Ago Reuters SHARES \nBEIJING, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted - handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov. 20 to address the issue. \n\"The units we've analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. \nThe U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. \nBut domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung's recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. \n\"The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn't necessarily equal a safe product,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. \nState media outlets featuring the Shanghai council's report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. \n\"I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it's not investigated,\" said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. \n\"The news did make me change my Apple habits,\" he told Reuters. \"For example, I don't dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.\" \n(Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",

      "text": "Donald Trump has ditched his stakes in Apple, Google , J.P. Morgan Chase, Nike , and Microsoft , a spokesperson for the president-elect said Tuesday.\nThe investment moves, which included selling shares of not only those companies, but all of his public traded shares, appear to be part of the president-elect’s effort to remove some of the many conflicts of interest Trump will have to tackle as president.\nTrump transition spokesperson Jason Miller told reporters that the real estate mogul made the stock sales in June. The disclosure came on a call with reporters after one asked about Trump’s stake in Boeing—a company that Trump criticized on Twitter Tuesday .\nCritics have argued that Trump’s stock holdings could be a conflict of interest for the president-elect after he steps in to the White House on Jan. 20. The president-elect held an interest in several financial institutions including Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, as well as energy companies such as Halliburton and ExxonMobil. Those holdings have worried onlookers, who say that it could skew the president-elect’s stance of Wall Street regulation and climate change. Trump had already gotten criticism for owning a stake in Energy Transfer Partners etp , the company trying to develop the Dakota Access Pipeline .\nIt’s unclear when exactly Trump sold out of those holdings, though the S&P 500 was up roughly 2% at the beginning of June, before falling following the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union on June 24.\nGranted, Trump had a relatively small fraction of his overall wealth in the stock market, according to May filings with the Federal Election Commission. Roughly $40 million of his estimated $4 billion net worth was invested in the stock market, many of which were large-cap, value stocks, which generally do better than others when the market drops. But it also means that he hasn’t benefitted from the so-called Trump Bump. The stock market is up over 3% since Trump was elected president.\nThe bulk of Trump’s wealth is still tied up in his real estate development company, which will continue to create conflicts for the president-elect, and be an issue for critics.\nHere were Trump’s 14 biggest stock holdings, according to the May filing , including shares of companies that Trump criticized on the campaign trail . (Campaign finance disclosure laws only require candidates give a range of value for their investments.)\n14. Alphabet : $100,000 to $200,000\n13. Caterpillar : $100,000 to $200,000\n12. Phillips 66 : $100,000 to $200,000\n11. Celgene : $100,000 to $250,000\n10. Gilead Sciences : $100,000 to $250,000\n9. Visa : $100,000 to $251,000\n8. General Electric : $100,000 to $250,000\n7. Johnson and Johnson : $100,000 to $250,000\n6. Nike : $100,000 to $250,000\n5. McKesson : $100,000 to $250,000\n4. J.P. Morgan Chase : $100,000 to $251,000\n3. PepsiCo: $150,000 to $350,000\n2. Microsoft : $300,000 to $600,000\n1. Apple : $600,000 to $1.251 million\nTrump is also expected to discuss his business holdings, as well as plans for the Trump Organization, at a Dec. 15 news conference. Trump has said he plans to turn over operations of his company to his adult children, though he has not given details on that transition.",

Apple is requesting that Samsung pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. The ruling, unanimously agreed upon by all justices, held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. The case now heads back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington to determine how much Samsung must pay. The dispute began in 2012 after a jury said Samsung infringed upon Apple's iPhone patents, forcing the South Korean company to pay $548 million.",

      "text": " Brent Kendall\nWASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled a lower court should reconsider how much money Samsung Electronics Co. owes rival Apple Inc. for infringing patents on the iPhone's design.\nSamsung has been challenging a $399 million award to Apple after jurors in 2012 found that 11 smartphone models from the South Korean electronics giant infringed Apple's design patents.\nThe Supreme Court said an appeals court used the wrong analysis when it ruled for Apple.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for a unanimous court, said the holder of a design patent isn't always entitled to the total profit on an infringing product sold to consumers. In multicomponent products, sometimes a patent holder will only be entitled to the infringer's total profit on the specific component that infringed the patent, she said.\nThe decision, however, didn't resolve the dispute between the smartphone makers. The court declined to apply its legal rules to the specifics of the case, so it didn't determine whether Samsung must pay its total profit on the 11 phones or just its profit attributable to the screen and case design of those products. The justices said a lower court should sort out that issue.\nA Samsung spokesperson called the ruling a landmark decision that \"is a victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\"\nAn Apple spokesman said, \"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute.\" He said Apple remained \"optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\"\nThe case had been closely watched in tech circles. An array of companies including Dell Inc., Facebook Inc., and Google Inc. had filed a court brief in support of Samsung.\nThey argued it would be absurd to require companies to fork over their total profit on complex modern technological products when one component among thousands in a device infringed another company's design.\nA group of design professionals and companies including Crocs Inc., Tiffany & Co. and Adidas AG supported Apple, saying a total-profits remedy was important for protecting valuable and innovative designs that drive consumer demand and are the lifeblood of many businesses.\nThe smartphone makers have been locked in a variety of patent battles. The case before the high court involved the highest profile litigation, which dates back to 2011.\nThe $399 million was part of a $930 million award Samsung was ordered to pay by a trial court. The rest of the money stemmed from other Apple claims not before the Supreme Court. Part of the overall damages award already was scheduled to be revisited in the lower courts.\nFor all the money involved, the case isn't expected to have much impact on smartphone consumers. Despite losing past rulings to Apple, Samsung has been able to continue selling phones and has moved on to newer models.\nWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com\n 160248ET ",

      "text": "  Ende November startete Apple ein Austauschprogramm um iPhone 6s -Kunden, die von oftmaligem unerwarteten Abschalten der Geräte betroffen sind, rasch und kostenlos zu helfen. Die Ursache der Probleme war laut Apple eine schadhafte Batterie und zwar in Geräten die zwischen September und Oktober 2015 produziert wurden. Später reichte Apple noch eine genauere Erklärung nach: Die Batterien in diesen Geräten waren offenbar zulange der Luft ausgesetzt. Damit sollte die Sache erledigt sein, könnte man meinen, doch offenbar sind auch iPhone 6s -Modelle von diesen Problemen betroffen, die nicht in dieser Zeit produziert wurden. Dagegen will Apple nun mit einem Software-Update vorgehen. In iOS 10.2, welches derzeit in der Beta-Phase ist, werden zusätzliche diagnostische Informationen gesammelt, die Apple helfen sollen, in einem zukünftigen iOS-Update die Algorithmen in Bezug auf die Batterie-Performance und Shutdowns zu optimieren. Es dürfte also für diese Anwender noch dauern, bis sich an den Problemen etwas ändert, wobei Apple auch erwähnt, dass manche für den Benutzer unerwartete Shutdowns durchaus zum Schutz des Geräts gewollt sein können, beispielsweise bei zu kaltem Wetter.

The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013 and moving the operations to Sunnyvale.\nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there.\nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards.\n ",

It sent the long-running patent infringement case back to a lower court to decide how much it should relinquish. An earlier damage award totaling $399 million is likely to be reduced under reconsideration.\nSamsung argued that the damages should be limited because the Apple patents covered only a small portion of its smartphone designs. A jury found that Samsung had infringed Apple design patents covering a rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.\nThe lower court's damage award was based on an overly broad interpretation of the law, the Supreme Court said in a unanimous decision. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the federal circuit court, but did not establish criteria for determining damages based on the components at issue.",

      "text": "02:04 PM, December 07, 2016 / LAST MODIFIED: 02:10 PM, December 07, 2016 US Supreme Court backs Samsung in smartphone fight with Apple 0 Viber Copy this link 3D-printed Samsung and Apple logos are seen in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on January 26, 2016. Photo: Reuters/Dado Ruvic Reuters \nThe US Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs. \nThe 8-0 ruling, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing. \nThe justices sent the case back to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington to determine how much Samsung must pay. But they did not provide a road map to juries and lower courts on how to navigate similar disputes in the future. \nApple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said in a statement that the US company remained \"optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\" \nSamsung told Reuters in a statement the ruling was a \"victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\" \nFollowing a 2012 jury verdict favoring Apple, Samsung initially was hit with nearly $930 million in penalties, later cut by $382 million, for infringing Apple's iPhone patents and mimicking its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices. \nSamsung in December 2015 paid its Cupertino, California-based rival $548 million. But Samsung took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make $399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications. \nWith the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world's top smartphone maker. \nTuesday's ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung for patent and trademark infringement. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top US court in recent years. \nThe legal dispute centered on whether the term \"article of manufacture,\" on which design patent damages are calculated in US patent law, should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product. \nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the US government all agreed that the term could mean a component. \nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence. \nSotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote. PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY \nThe justices nevertheless refused to devise a test for juries and lower courts to use to discern what a relevant article of manufacture is in a particular case, a task that could be fraught with difficulty when considering high-tech products. \n\"No doubt whether with Apple-Samsung, or some other design patent case, we are going to have a period of uncertainty where courts will be trying to formulate a test and what the boundaries are,\" Richard McKenna, an expert in design rights at the law firm Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee, said in an interview. \nIn court papers, Apple said its iPhone's success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone's look and many user interface features, Apple said. \nSamsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits, saying that design elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features. \nDesign patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years. \nThe case is Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd v. Apple Inc, in the Supreme Court of the United States, No 15-777.

      "title": "Pokémon Go snubbed: Apple chooses Clash Royale as its iPhone Game of the Year",
      "text": "Pokémon Go wasn’t the best game of the year on iPhone. At least that’s what Apple is saying.\nThe iOS company revealed the results of its official Game of the Year awards for iPhone, iPad, and more. The iPhone Game of the Year, which is arguably the biggest category, went to developer Supercell’s Clash Royale head-to-head strategy battler. That app has players facing off against one another by dropping cards from their deck onto a battlefield. That cards then turn into units with various capabilities. It’s a free download, but you can of course spend cash to improve your deck, so you can face even better players with better cards (which makes you want to spend more money on cards to improve your deck). It’s a vicious cycle, and it’s the best game that came out for iPhone in 2016, according to Apple. That means it beat out Niantic’s Pokémon Go. That location-based Google Maps-powered game that has players catching digital pocket monsters in the real world was the only mobile game to outgross Clash Royale on iPhone.\nDespite that success, Pokémon Go didn’t even make Apple’s iPhone top 10:\nAnd here’s the iPhone top 10:\nClash Royale Reigns Inks FIFA Mobile Football Klocki Rodeo Stampede: Sky Zoo Safari Pktball Snakebird Twofold Inc. The Trail Most of those games are deserving of recognition — although I would argue that EA made some small downgrades to the overall quality of FIFA to make it run better on older phones on slower networks. But that’s something Apple might approve of as it considers qualifications for its Game of the Year list.\nReigns is especially noteworthy. From developer Nerial and publisher Devolver Digital, the game turns the act of swiping on profile pictures from matchmaking apps into a gameplay mechanic as you take on the role of a king. Each new profile pictures comes with new choices, and those choices will have consequences.\nBeyond Reigns, I’m not the biggest fan of Clash Royale, but I won’t deny its quality. It has among the best presentation on mobile platforms, and it is incredibly playable. Supercell also made synchronous multiplayer work on smartphones, which is something that most people thought couldn’t work on a massive scale. But Clash Royale turns into a bummer when you hit that wall where you are doomed to never advance unless you spend all of your free time playing or a significant chunk of money.\nBut I can see why Pokémon Go didn’t make this list. Many of its basic features were broken for months, and its presentation looks cheap compared to what Supercell is doing.\nHere’s the full Game of the Year list from Apple for each of its platforms:\nGames of the Year:\niPhone Game of the Year: Clash Royale iPad Game of the Year: Severed Apple TV Game of the Year: Riptide GP Apple Watch Game of the Year: Field Day  \n",

      "text": "Apple ( AAPL ) iPhone sales will improve next year as more users upgrade to newer handsets, but declining demand in China remains a big concern, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said Monday.\nMilunovich is forecasting iPhone unit growth of about 6% in fiscal 2017, which began Sept. 25, thanks to the company's iPhone 7 series handsets. In fiscal 2016, Apple's iPhone shipments declined 8% vs. a 4% decrease for the overall premium smartphone market, Milunovich said in a research note Tuesday.\nHe sees double-digit unit-sales growth in fiscal 2018 as a result of the iPhone 8 launch. The iPhone 8 is expected to include a revamped design with an OLED display.\n\"The (Apple) brand and retention rates remain strong, which should set up double-digit growth in fiscal 2018,\" Milunovich said. \"China, however, stands out like a sore thumb, not only for its rate of decline but with a 10-point (market)-share loss.\"\nIBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has been below its 50-day moving average, a negative sign, since Nov. 1. More attractive stocks for investors to consider can be found on the IBD 50 list of top growth companies.\nChina fueled much of Apple's iPhone sales growth in fiscal 2015, but became a headwind in fiscal 2016, Milunovich said.\nApple's share of the premium smartphone market in China dropped from 60% in fiscal 2015 to 50% in fiscal 2016. Among companies taking market share from Apple were domestic brands Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, he said.\n\"Chinese consumers want more differentiation than provided by the (iPhone) 6S and 7,\" Milunovich said.\nApple's iPhone sales in China deteriorated in the June and September quarters, he said. Evidence indicates that the lower-cost iPhone SE was not well-received in China and the iPhone 7 was \"supply constrained or received poorly,\" he said.\nMilunovich rates Apple stock as a buy with a 12-month price target of 127.\nApple shares closed 0.8% higher at 109.94 on the stock market today , with a possible buy point of 118.79 out of a flat base.\nOn Tuesday, Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of 150.\nHe says the iPhone 7 will drive Apple's smartphone business back to growth ahead of an expected iPhone 8 \"supercycle.\"\nRecent investor concerns about iPhone 8 gross profit margins and a possible shortage of OLED displays are misplaced, he said.\nApple might have to raise the price of its OLED iPhone 8 models by about $50 to cover the added cost of the new display and to keep its margin profile, Garcha said. If OLED displays are in short supply, Apple likely will limit the technology to higher-end handsets, he said.\nAlso Tuesday, Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um maintained his sector perform rating on Apple stock with a valuation range of 105 to 120.\nUm said his main concern about Apple involves its iPhone business, which accounted for 63.4% of revenue and over 70% of gross profits in fiscal 2016, he said.\nLoading the player...",

      "text": "Apple has updated its online support system to make it easier for customers to find somewhere to get their phone or computer repaired. As first spotted by MacRumors, the company has added details for authorized third-party service providers to its online site, meaning that when you log in to find someone that will replace your cracked iPhone screen, Apple won’t just direct you to its own stores. You can even book an appointment with third-parties right from your browser.\n\nIt’s a small change, but a welcome one. Anyone who’s had to get an Apple repair in a big city will know that wait times at official stores can often run into weeks. Authorized service providers are those shops which have been assessed by the company to do both AppleCare...",

      "text": "Apple will allow its artificial intelligence teams to publish research papers for the first time, marking a significant change in strategy that could help accelerate the iPhone maker's advances in deep learning.\nWhen Apple introduced its Siri virtual assistant in 2011, the company appeared to have a head start over many of its nearest competitors. But it has lost ground since then to the likes of Alphabet Inc.'s Google Assistant and Amazon.com Inc.'s Alexa.\nResearchers say among the reasons Apple has failed to keep pace is its unwillingness to allow its AI engineers to publish scientific papers, stymieing its ability to feed off wider advances in the field.\nVIDEOS TOP JOBS That policy has now changed, Russ Salakhutdinov, an Apple director of AI research, said Monday at the Neural Information Processing Systems conference in Barcelona, according to Twitter posts from those present.\nOne attendee posted a photo of a slide from Salakhutdinov's presentation stating \"Can we publish? Yes. Do we engage with academia? Yes.\"\nAn Apple spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to an email requesting comment.\nApple hired Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University in October. The ban on publication has hindered the company's ability to hire the best talent because researchers are often less willing to work in a secretive environment where they can't engage openly with others.\nTo compensate for the hiring difficulties, Apple has bought a series of AI startups, spending $200 million on Seattle-based Turi Inc. earlier this year to add to half a dozen other acquisitions.",

The ad begins like a scene out of a romance film, as Shakespeare’s star-crossed lovers meet up at the balcony for one of the most famous scenes from the play, except Romeo and Juliet are played by children. As Romeo bids a heartfelt good night to his love, it is revealed that the scenario is playing out in the theatre of a school. Like last month’s ‘Frankie’s Holiday’, the ‘Romeo and Juliet’ ad takes an emotional approach, featuring a proud father at a school play—a moment most parents would be able to identify with. While the phone only makes a brief cameo in the 30-second spot, Apple sends its message loud and clear with the tagline, “Your movies look like movies on iPhone 7”. Watch the adorable and heartwarming ad below.",

      "text": "Square Cash now works with Apple Pay Square Cash now works with Apple Pay Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + Apps - Apps + Square, one of PayPal's main competitors, introduced virtual Visa cards in September. They work as virtual debit cards that pull money straight from a user's Square Cash account. Now Square and Apple have partnered up to bring those virtual cards to Apple Pay.The integration was announced by Square's CEO, Jack Dorsey, at Recode's Code Commerce event, and it means that users can now pay with their Square account at every store, accepting Apple Pay. This includes both online and walk-in stores. “I've been using this as my primary card for about two months,” said Dorsey, explaining that he uses his Square card for pretty much anything, including Netflix subscriptions.In the meantime, at the same event, Jennifer Bailey, who runs Apple Pay, added that Apple is still looking to replace your entire wallet with its mobile payment app. Not just cash and cards, but everything. We're curious to see what Apple will come up with in terms of lucky charms, though.",

      "text": "Samsung Wins In Supreme Court Against Apple 9:17 am By Roland Hutchinson \nSamsung and Apple have been fighting it out in court since 2011, Apple were previously awarded damages against Samsung of $399 million relating to 11 patents on the iPhone. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has now ruled 8-0 in favor of Samsung, the company had challenged the amount that it would have to pay Apple. \nTechCrunch reached out to Apple after the ruling and were given a statement by the company, which you can see below. \nThe question before the Supreme Court was how to calculate the amount Samsung should pay for their copying. Our case has always been about Samsung’s blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute. We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world’s most innovative and beloved product. We remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn’t right. – Apple spokesperson. \nTechCrunch also reached out to Samsung and were also given an official statement, this can be seen below. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision today is a victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace. We thank our supporters from the world’s leading technology companies, the 50 intellectual property professors, and the many public policy groups who stood with us as we fought for a legal environment that fairly rewards invention and fosters innovation. – Samsung spokesperson.",

      "text": "Pandora will take on Spotify, Apple Music with Pandora Premium Pandora will take on Spotify, Apple Music with Pandora Premium Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Android - Android + Music - Music + Pandora is gearing to go head-to-head with Spotify early next year with its own take on on-demand music streaming in the form of Pandora Premium. Just like all other streaming services, Pandora Premium will offer its subscribers full access to a massive music library ad-free at a standard rate of $9.99 a month.Pandora briefly demoed Premium during an event in New York, highlighting the service's highly personalized nature. Pandora Premium features a smart search engine, which means each user's browsing experience will be unique - based on their preferences and listening history, not on overall song popularity. The familiar thumbs-up-and-down icons are not going anywhere, and all the songs you've liked over the years will be used to present you with results and suggestions relevant to your preferences. In line with all other on-demand music streaming services, Pandora Premium will also let you take all of your music offline.Pandora Premium will reportedly feature a sleek and streamlined design, very similar to that of now defunct Rdio, which Pandora acquired last year. The personalized nature of the service will span the app's UI as well, reflecting album cover artwork designs and color schemes on various levels across the interface.Between the popular free version and the upcoming Premium, Pandora also offers a $5/month Plus streaming service that will be pushed in the mid-tier when Premium launches in 2017. Pandora Plus offers ad-free music streaming, lets you skip more tracks than the free version, and has some offline features, but is more limited than the full-on premium subscription coming next year. Pandora is reportedly planning to make Premium available to its “VIPs” a few months before the official launch, which sounds a bit like a closed beta. PhoneArena is on Instagram .

Which is why its upcoming Galaxy S8 could be the company’s messiah, and it is all or nothing for Samsung. Curiously however, reports have leaked that the new phone will be ditching its 3.5mm jack in favor of a USB-C port, adopting its competitor Apple’s controversial move this year. In an exclusive report by SamMobile , this decision may allow Samsung to “make the Galaxy S8 thinner while also freeing up more space… for a bigger battery.",

      "text": "iPhones are not only shutting down unexpectedly in China, but apparently they’re also exploding.\nShanghai Consumer Council (SHCC), a consumer watchdog group chaired by a Shanghai member of the Municipal People’s Congress, put up a notice on its website on Dec. 2 that eight iPhones reportedly exploded from Sept. 1 to Nov. 30. The group highlighted two specific cases involving an iPhone 6 and 6s Plus:\nMr. Zhang reported to the SHCC that his iPhone 6 (bought in November 2014) suddenly started smoking and spontaneously self-combusted in standby mode on Sept. 30 this year.\nMs. Chen reported to the SHCC that an iPhone 6s Plus (bought in March 2015) spontaneously self-combusted, cracking the screen and the phone’s back with a blackening battery on Aug. 31 this year. Apple gave Chen a new one in the same model without offering a detailed explanation.\nApple told Quartz that it had analyzed some “thermal units” and found they “have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event.” It insisted it has “found no cause for concern with these products.”\nThe new allegations are the latest wrinkle in an ongoing dispute between Apple and China. In November, the China Consumers Association, a consumer watchdog group affiliated with China’s State Council (chaired by premier Li Keqiang), demanded answers from Apple after many Chinese users reported their iPhone 6 and 6s devices were abruptly shutting down.\nThe group was dissatisfied with Apple’s response when the Cupertino, California, company insisted the problem affected only a “ very small number of iPhone 6s devices ” and offered to replace customers’ iPhone batteries . The China Consumers Association said the problem was much more widespread than Apple has admitted to.\nAlong with its recent notice about the iPhone explosions, SHCC said it had received 2,763 consumer complaints of Apple products from Jan. 1 to Nov. 30, twice that of 2015. Nearly half of the complaints were made in the past two months alone.\nNeither Chinese media nor consumers seem pleased with Apple’s explanations so far. “Apple’s consecutive decline in revenues and profits (paywall) has shown that Apple is sliding and if the combustions were to cause bigger influence, Apple might very likely walking Samsung’s path,” Beijing Business Today wrote on Dec. 6 (link in Chinese).\nA Weibo user (link in Chinese, registration required), meanwhile, has described iPhones as “time bombs” in people’s pockets. “There are so many iPhone users, so it’s like everyone’s walking with a time bomb? What happened if the mobiles explode like Samsung Note 7? ”\nThe full statement from Apple is below:\nTitle: Statement regarding Thermal Events \nWe appreciate that customers are more concerned than ever about the performance and safety of batteries in their mobile devices. SHCC recently published accounts of a small number of iPhones which reportedly experienced thermal incidents. We want to assure our customers that we thoroughly investigate any such report. We have been in touch with the customers and retrieved these units for analysis.\nAs part of our standard process, we do a thorough forensic investigation including CT scans, cross sections, and more. The units we’ve analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event. We treat safety as a top priority and have found no cause for concern with these products.\nWe encourage any customer who experiences an issue with an Apple product to visit an Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, or to contact Apple Support.\n",

Photo: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg via Getty Images \nSHANGHAI - Apple has blamed \"external physical damage\" for causing a handful of iPhones to explode or catch fire in China and insisted that its handsets posed no safety risk. \nOn the heels of Samsung's worldwide Galaxy Note 7 safety fiasco, a Shanghai consumer watchdog said on Friday that it had received eight recent reports of iPhones that spontaneously caught alight while being used or charged. \nIn a statement to AFP late on Tuesday, the US tech giant said it had retrieved units for analysis and conducted thorough tests on phones that had experienced \"thermal events\", but brushed off safety concerns. \n\"The units we’ve analysed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them, which led to the thermal event,\" a statement said. \n\"We treat safety as a top priority and have found no cause for concern with these products.\" \nREAD: China users complain of combustible iPhones: consumer watchdog \nThe company also denied being slow to respond, after the state-run Shanghai Consumer Council had urged it to address consumer complaints. \nThe watchdog quoted one woman as saying her iPhone 6s Plus exploded in August, shattering the screen and leaving the battery and back of the phone blackened. \nThe council said it had received a six-fold surge in total complaints against Apple in the past two months, including sudden shutdowns of the iPhone 6 and 6s even though batteries still had enough power. \nThe council did not say where the complaining iPhone users were located. \nApple last month offered to change iPhone 6s batteries for Chinese users who complained of the sudden shutdowns, but said the problem did not constitute a safety issue. \nSamsung suffered a severe blow from its Galaxy Note 7's woes, recalling some 2.5 million units after reports of the product catching fire.

      "text": "  2:34pm Apple dismisses design issues for iPhone 6 battery fires in China   BEIJING, 7 Dec 2016: Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. The Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted – handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov 20 to address the issue. “The units we’ve analysed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,” an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement late yesterday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. The US tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. But domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. The Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung’s recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 – itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. “The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn’t necessarily equal a safe product,” said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. State media outlets featuring the Shanghai council’s report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. “I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it’s not investigated,” said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. “The news did make me change my Apple habits. For example, I don’t dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.”",
