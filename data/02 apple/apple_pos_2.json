      "text": "One of Apple's proposed designs for a device with a flexible display.\nPhoto by Apple/USPTO Apple was granted a patent on Tuesday for \"flexible display devices,\" which could someday lead to a bendable iPhone .\nThe proposed designs envision a foldable device -- remember flip phones ? -- with an organic light-emitting diode screen. The company filed the patent application in July 2014 with the US Patent and Trademark Office. The news was reported earlier by AppleInsider .\nIn June, Lenovo showed off a flexible phone prototype that you could wrap around your wrist. Around the same time, Samsung was reported to be working on two bendable models.\nNext year marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. There's already been speculation that at least one of the new models will get an OLED display .\nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n ",

It might very well be this concept Apple Mirror, as designed by New York-based web developer Rafael Dymek . Created for a personal project, Dymek took a traditional full-length wall mirror and installed Apple's iOS 10 interface to create a fully-functioning touchscreen smart mirror.\nThe large reflective surface includes useful daily information such as the date, time and weather on the top corners, and gives users access to their apps (hello Netflix and Uber), emails and Siri, all of which can be activated and moved around with the touch of a finger. When not in use, the Apple Mirror turns back into an ordinary mirror so you can take a moment to reflect. We just hope it also includes an oleophobic coating to prevent smudges. Watch the video of the Apple Mirror in action and let us know if you think this will become a real product.\nRead more at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

For the first time since 2014, Apple is hosting a Black Friday sale. No matter your reaction to that news, you likely are still curious about the deals. But so far, Apple is leaving the details a mystery. \nThe company updated its homepage on Tuesday with a “Save the date” message and an image of an Apple Watch. Interesting, right? Two years ago, Apple’s deal involved iTunes gift cards with certain purchases, but this image seems to hint at discounts on actual electronics. Nothing bad ’bout that! \nOther claims involve free two-day delivery on in-stock items before 5 p.m., a call to action to download the Apple Store app for the fastest access to the one-day event and extended in-store hours, aka the brick-and-mortar shops are going to be insane . But hey, if you’re already out in the madness, you might as well stop by. \nLet us know if you hear anything else about this sale. We’re sweating in our chairs over here. In the meantime, shop these other Black Friday deals .",

      "text": "4.5 stars 1 user review The Good Dual rear cameras delivers true 2x optical zoom, with a cool bokeh Portrait mode. Battery lasts longer than last year's model, and longer than iPhone 7. Water resistant. Fast. Bigger storage options include 256GB model for serious photographers. The Bad There's no standard headphone jack: you'll have to use Lightning, or the included adapter, or go wireless. Design is showing its age, as competing phones squeeze a 5.5-inch screen into smaller, sexier bodies. And it's really expensive. The Bottom Line The iPhone 7 Plus is one of the best point-and-shoot cameras ever -- and it's a great phone, too. 8.8 Overall",

      "text": "Best 'Black Friday' 2016 Deals: Amazon, Apple, Best Buy, Target And Walmart   Samsung Is Going To Include An Ai Assistant In Its Next Phone \nBlack Friday is nearly here and to celebrate, I have rounded up all the best deals from my guides to Amazon, , , And Walmart to present the best of the best. Let’s break them down: \nNote: my thanks to BestBlackFriday.com which has worked with me to collate these deals and create order from the inevitable annual chaos Black Friday 2016 has some fantastic offers and some you should avoid. Image credit: Target via BestBlackFriday \nStar Buys Toshiba 49-inch LED 4K Ultra HDTV w/ Built-in Chromecast (49L621U) for $199.99 (save $250) – Best Buy Phillips 55-inch Class Smart 4K UHDTV for $298 – Walmart – a standard brand at a stunning price \nBlack Friday general TV tip: always remember to check the specific TV model when retailers release them before making a purchase. Even the best manufacturers have weak models in their line-up that you are better off avoiding, so do your research. Any iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus – get up to a $250 Best Buy Gift Card with installment billing agreement with Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T – Best Buy – a massive gift card win iPad Pro 9.7″ starting at $449 (save $150.99) – Target - the cheapest iPad Pro deal iPad Air 2 (All Models) for $125 Off - Best Buy - as above Apple Watch Series 1 starting at $198 (save $71.99) – Target – Best best Series 1 deal, $22 less than Best Buy. There are no Series 2 discounts this Black Friday from any retailer Samsung Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge + $250 Gift Card + Samsung Gear VR Headset + $50 Oculus Content Pack with activation of the phone – Target – beats Best Buy’s similar deal as it includes the $50 Oculus Content Pack Microsoft 12.3″ Surface Pro 4 Bundle with Signature Type Cover for $599.99 (save $400) – Best Buy - a ‘Doorbuster’ worthy of the name Xbox One S 1TB Battlefield 1 Special Edition Bundle + Xbox Wireless Controller for $299.99 (save $114.99) – Best Buy – the extra controller deal is hidden but comes free with any 1TB bundle making this a winner Xbox One S 500 GB Battlefield 1 Bundle + Gears of War 4 + Extra Controller for $249.99 (save $170) – Dell - not from the retailers listed, but added as it is too good to miss and far above the standard $250 Black Friday deal for one game and a single controller Sony PlayStation 4 Uncharted 4 Bundle + Ratchet and Clank and The Last of Us (Remastered) Games for $249.99 (save $50) – Best Buy - two additional games compared to the standard $250 bundle DJI Phantom 3 Standard Drone for $369 (save $130) – Walmart – a red hot product and $30 cheaper than the next best deal Amazon Tap for $89.99 (save $40) – Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet for $74.99 (save $25) – Amazon – was $84.99 for Black Friday 2015 Walmart Black Friday gaming offers are strong in 2016. Image credit: Walmart via BestBlackFriday \nSolid Deals \nThe best of the Solid Deals. While the offers above are truly superb, these deals are too good to leave behind if you’re interested in any of these products: Apple iPhone SE starting at $9.99/mo. for 24 months, 0% APR for qualified Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T customers – Best Buy LG 40-inch 1080p LED HDTV (40LH5000) for $149.99 (save $130) – Best Buy Xbox One S 500GB Minecraft Favorites Bundle for $249.99 (save $50) – Best Buy PlayStation 4 Slim 500GB Uncharted 4 Bundle for $249.99 (save $50) – Target HP 15.6″ Laptop w/ AMD A10 Quad Core Processor for $259.99 (save $140) – Target Roku Express Plus for $25 (save $14) – Walmart DJI Phantom 4 White Quadcopter for $999.99 (save $200) – Best Buy FitBit Charge 2 for $129 (save $20) – Walmart - a price you will also found widely elsewhere, but still a solid deal FitBit Alta for $99 (save $30) – Walmart – as above Best Buy iPhone deals are strong, but watch out for some weaker iPad and Apple Watch offers. Image credit: Best Buy via BestBlackFriday \nTreat With Caution \nAlong with the best of the best comes the worst of the worst. When shopping this Black Friday be very care to avoid these deals, for the following reasons: Apple Watch Series 2 starting at $369 – Best Buy (and others) - misleading as this is not a discount, but the standard retail price. Take $105 in Kohl’s Cash if you want to pay $369 for the Series 2 now iPad Pro 9.7″ Tablet (All Models) for $125 Off - Best Buy - Target offers this for $150.99 off, so why pay more? iPad Mini 2 32GB for $199 (save $70) – Walmart – an old model likely to be discontinued in early 2017. Put the money towards a Star Buy iPad deal instead Otterbox Defender for Samsung and Apple for $25 (save $14.96) – Walmart – regularly on sale throughout the year for under $15 Alcatel POP 4 Plus 16GB 4G LTE Unlocked Cell Phone for $49.99 (save $100) – Best Buy – a mediocre phone with poor storage. Put the money towards a better smartphone offer Xbox 360 500GB Forza Horizon 2 Bundle for $129 (save $50) – Walmart – an old, dead console available pre-owned from GameStop for $50 after rebate. Ignore when a new Xbox One S 500GB bundle costs just $120 more Google Chromecast for $25 (save $10) – can be found cheaper in the off season 32-inch 720p LED TV, $69.99 – Amazon – very cheap, but no brand mentioned (see Black Friday TV tip above and there are simply too many great, premium brand TV offers available this year to risk this Insignia 7-inch Portable DVD Player with Swivel Screen for $39.99 (save $40) – Best Buy – a largely dead product category and not a premium brand RCA 9-in. Portable DVD Player for $53.99 (save $36) – Target – as above, and poor customer rating as well \nFor a full breakdown of Black Friday deals at Amazon, Apple, Best Buy, Target, Walmart plus eBay, Microsoft and Samsung please find the links below: \nBlack Friday Guides On Forbes",

      "text": "Mobile Devices, Tablets & Phones Trump is confident Apple will make iPhones in the US Trump wants to give Apple a 'very large tax cut' and 'substantial regulation cuts' to bring iPhone production back to the USA   \nApple could bring production of its iPhones back to the US, with president-elect Trump talking with Apple CEO Tim Cook about it. Cook called Trump after his victory a couple of weeks ago, and their conversation was interesting, to say the least. \nIn an interview with the New York Times, Trump said that Cook called him to congratulate him on his victory over Hillary Clinton, where he talked with the Apple boss about his expectations. Trump said: \" I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here \". \nCook said: \" I understand that \", with Trump adding that he's confident that Apple will begin manufacturing in the US again with his proposed \" very large tax cut \" and \" substantial regulation cuts \" he plans on offering. \nWith this tease between Trump and Apple, what do you think about it all? iPhones being manufactured in the US will create thousands upon thousands of jobs, and while the prices of iPhones might go up - maybe Apple will reduce the costs a little as an incentive of having a \"Made in the USA\" stamp on the back of them.",

Here’s what they had to say: \nApple is now studying how to apply its 3D camera technology into LG Innotek’s smartphone camera. Since LG Innotek also has its own 3D camera and related technologies, such joint efforts will likely to bear fruit sometime within next year. \nThe Cupertino titan has already used LG Innotek’s dual-cam solution in its larger iPhone 7 Plus model. In fact, it’s precisely this technology that Apple leveraged to offer its much touted ‘ Portrait Mode .’ \nWhile details are scarce, Apple’s ambition to bring 3D photography capabilities to its next-generation lineup of smartphones could mean the manufacturer is contemplating implementing LG’s dual-cam tech in all of its phones. \nAmong other things, the next-gen iPhone camera is rumored to also support features in 2D and 3D for augmented reality gimmicks that will make it easier for people to interact with the physical world in new meaningful ways.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan The best Black Friday deals on Apple MacBook laptops, Mac desktops Discounts are often hard to come by, but here are the best sales if you want to buy a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, or other Apple computer. | Topic: Apple \nBest Buy has a number of Black Friday deals on Apple MacBook laptops and iMac desktops. \nApple isn't big on discounting, especially when it comes to its computers, which remain much higher priced than most Windows PCs. As hard as it's getting to find iPad specials on Black Friday, it's even harder to locate sales for MacBooks and iMacs. If you're set on buying a Mac during this shopping holiday, however, there are a handful of deals we've tracked down below. Black Friday 2016 Dell's ad leaks with $100 laptop, desktop deals \nWe'll be updating this when and if new deals arise. Also note that some of these sales won't be available online, or will be gone quickly, so you may have to endure all of the pain of Black Friday shopping to snatch one up. Apple MacBook Air \nApple's cheapest laptop, relatively speaking, is now limited to a 13.3-inch version, as the 11-inch model has been discontinued. Best Buy takes $200 off the base configuration, lowering the price to $799. It also knocks the same amount offer the $1,199 version with double the solid-state storage, as does regional retailer Fry's . If you want to upgrade to a Core i7 processor, B&H Photo takes anywhere from $100 to $200 off, depending on the specific configuration. Apple MacBook \nThe most design-conscious Apple laptop gets little discount love from Best Buy, which is selling it at the regular price. You'll have to rely on Amazon and B&H, both of which take $100 off the two basic models (regular prices of $1,299 and $1,599, respectively) and B&H knocking $150 off the pricier configuration with a Core m7 processor update. Apple MacBook Pro \nApple just updated its pro-level laptop, which means you aren't likely to see deals on the controversial refresh that are more than a few dollars off. Again, the exceptions are Amazon and B&H Photo, both of which cut $100 from the base 13-inch version. B&H Photo also offers discounts ranging from $100 to $200 on additional 13-inch configurations, but does not offer any specials on the 15-inch MacBook Pro. On the other hand, there will be plenty of price cuts on the now-discontinued configurations, so if you don't want the latest and greatest MacBook Pro, this is your chance to save on older hardware. Apple Mac mini \nThe least expensive Mac of all, the diminuitive mini hasn't been updated in a while, and doesn't receive much in the way of discounts. Best Buy has deals that take a smidge off the price of the base $499 version ($37 off) and the step-up version ($29 off), but you'll have better luck through Amazon, which takes $70 off either the base config or the most expensive model (normally $999). B&H matches Amazon's savings, but slashes $100 from the middle $699 edition. Apple iMac \nApple's popular all-in-one has three distinct versions currently available (21.5-inch, 21.5-inch with Retina 4k display, 27-inch with Retina 5k display), all of which have deals available from the same sources as above. Best Buy has the best price on the cheapest version, the 21.5-inch system that normally runs $1,099 receives a $200 discount. In comparison, B&H only offers $100 off, but does take $120 away from the $1,299 configuration price. It also does a little better on the base Retina 4k iMac, chopping $150 off the $1,499 price whereas Best Buy offers $100 off. \nAmazon joins the other two retailers in discounting the Retina 5k base model by $200, knocking the price down to $1,599. Best Buy also has sales on the other 5k configurations, taking $100 from the mid-range edition and $156 from the top-end one. You'll have better luck at B&H, though, as it takes $170 and $250 off, respectively, from the same models. Apple Mac Pro \nYou don't buy a Mac Pro if you're looking to save money, but just because you can spend at least $2,999 on a computer doesn't mean you wouldn't appreciate a discount if you can get it. Amazon and B&H take a hundred bucks off the base model's price -- Best Buy offered the same price cut, but is sold out online -- while B&H slices $300 off the pricier edition that regularly costs $3,999.

There are no Series 2 discounts this Black Friday from any retailer Samsung Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge + $250 Gift Card + Samsung Gear VR Headset + $50 Oculus Content Pack with activation of the phone – Target & Best Buy – Edit: the Oculus Content Pack was left off the Best Buy listing, but is included by Samsung on all S7/S7 Edge purchases Microsoft 12.3″ Surface Pro 4 Bundle with Signature Type Cover for $599.99 (save $400) – Best Buy - a ‘Doorbuster’ worthy of the name Xbox One S 1TB Battlefield 1 Special Edition Bundle + Xbox Wireless Controller for $299.99 (save $114.99) – Best Buy – the extra controller deal is hidden but comes free with any 1TB bundle making this a winner Xbox One S 500 GB Battlefield 1 Bundle + Gears of War 4 + Extra Controller for $249.99 (save $170) – Dell - not from the retailers listed, but added as it is too good to miss and far above the standard $250 Black Friday deal for one game and a single controller Sony PlayStation 4 Uncharted 4 Bundle + Ratchet and Clank and The Last of Us (Remastered) Games for $249.99 (save $50) – Best Buy - two additional games compared to the standard $250 bundle DJI Phantom 3 Standard Drone for $369 (save $130) – Walmart – a red hot product and $30 cheaper than the next best deal Amazon Tap for $89.99 (save $40) – Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet for $74.99 (save $25) – Amazon – was $84.99 for Black Friday 2015 Walmart Black Friday gaming offers are strong in 2016. Image credit: Walmart via BestBlackFriday \nSolid Deals \nThe best of the Solid Deals. While the offers above are truly superb, these deals are too good to leave behind if you’re interested in any of these products: Apple iPhone SE starting at $9.99/mo. for 24 months, 0% APR for qualified Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T customers – Best Buy LG 40-inch 1080p LED HDTV (40LH5000) for $149.99 (save $130) – Best Buy Xbox One S 500GB Minecraft Favorites Bundle for $249.99 (save $50) – Best Buy PlayStation 4 Slim 500GB Uncharted 4 Bundle for $249.99 (save $50) – Target HP 15.6″ Laptop w/ AMD A10 Quad Core Processor for $259.99 (save $140) – Target Roku Express Plus for $25 (save $14) – Walmart DJI Phantom 4 White Quadcopter for $999.99 (save $200) – Best Buy FitBit Charge 2 for $129 (save $20) – Walmart - a price you will also found widely elsewhere, but still a solid deal FitBit Alta for $99 (save $30) – Walmart – as above Best Buy iPhone deals are strong, but watch out for some weaker iPad and Apple Watch offers. Image credit: Best Buy via BestBlackFriday \nNote: for specialist camera coverage read Paul Monckton’s Black Friday guides while John Archer is covering TVs . \nTreat With Caution \nAlong with the best of the best comes the worst of the worst. When shopping this Black Friday be very care to avoid these deals, for the following reasons: Apple Watch Series 2 starting at $369 – Best Buy (and others) - misleading as this is not a discount, but the standard retail price. Take $105 in Kohl’s Cash if you want to pay $369 for the Series 2 now iPad Pro 9.7″ Tablet (All Models) for $125 Off - Best Buy - Target offers this for $150.99 off, so why pay more? iPad Mini 2 32GB for $199 (save $70) – Walmart – an old model likely to be discontinued in early 2017. Put the money towards a Star Buy iPad deal instead Otterbox Defender for Samsung and Apple for $25 (save $14.96) – Walmart – regularly on sale throughout the year for under $15 Alcatel POP 4 Plus 16GB 4G LTE Unlocked Cell Phone for $49.99 (save $100) – Best Buy – a mediocre phone with poor storage. Put the money towards a better smartphone offer Xbox 360 500GB Forza Horizon 2 Bundle for $129 (save $50) – Walmart – an old, dead console available pre-owned from GameStop for $50 after rebate. Ignore when a new Xbox One S 500GB bundle costs just $120 more Google Chromecast for $25 (save $10) – can be found cheaper in the off season 32-inch 720p LED TV, $69.99 – Amazon – very cheap, but no brand mentioned (see Black Friday TV tip above and there are simply too many great, premium brand TV offers available this year to risk this Insignia 7-inch Portable DVD Player with Swivel Screen for $39.99 (save $40) – Best Buy – a largely dead product category and not a premium brand RCA 9-in. Portable DVD Player for $53.99 (save $36) – Target – as above, and poor customer rating as well \nFor a full breakdown of Black Friday deals at Amazon, Apple, Best Buy, Target, Walmart plus eBay, Microsoft and Samsung please find the links below. \nBlack Friday Guides On Forbes ",

      "text": "Well, you have to say this for Apple, they sure acted quickly this Black Friday. No sooner had the clock ticked over to midnight on November 25 here in the UK and they've updated their website with details of their one-day-only shopping event live right now. Related: Best Black Friday 2016 deals: How to save serious cash on TVs, smartphones, headphones and wearables But we'll say this too: it's a pretty sweet deal, so it's no wonder Apple wants to make the most of it. So, what could make purchasing an Apple product all the better today, we hear you ask? Well, how about some free money to go right along with it? Alright, so the free money comes in the form of an Apple Gift Card, meaning you'll have to spend it on yet more Apple products, but with values of up to £120 available on selected purchases, that's still a lot of cases and accessories to be dealing with. Fancy a new iPhone? Pick up the SE, the 6S or the 6S Plus today, pay in full and get yourself an Apple Gift Card worth up to £40. How about an iPad? Well, selected iPad models - namely the iPad pro, iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 4 - will land you a gift card worth up to £80 too. Purchasing any Apple Watch Series 1 models or Apple TV will also land you a £20 gift card, while the biggest reward comes with the purchase of selected Mac computers, where you could find yourself holding a gift card up to the value of £120 right alongside your shiny new Mac. The offer is valid in the UK today only (November 25) and is available both in store and online. Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

      "title": "Apple Black Friday deals are today and its offering free gift vouchers - Business Insider",
      "text": "print \nApple's one-day shopping event is today. Apple \nApple's pre-announced Black Friday event is here, and it's offering free Apple gift cards worth up to $150 when you buy selected Apple products at full price for today only. \nAfter opting out of Black Friday last year, the deals are more than what people might have been expecting, but the best discounts on Apple products are still through third-party retailers. \nHere's the breakdown: MacBooks : Get a $150 Apple Gift Card when you buy a Mac computer, ranging from the cheapest MacBook Air model ($999) to the MacBook Pro's ($1,299-$1,999) — though notably not the new ones with the Touch Bar — or the iMacs ($1,099-$1,499). iPads: Get an $100 Apple gift card when you buy one of three iPads, the Mini 4 ($399), the Air 2 ($399), or the Pro ($599). iPhones: Get a $50 Apple gift card when you buy an iPhone SE ($399), iPhone 6s ($549), or an iPhone 6s Plus ($649). Apple Watch: Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy any Apple Watch Series 1 model ($269-$299). Apple TV: Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy an Apple TV ($149). \nApple also wants you to shop the event online — it is offering free delivery on products ordered today, as previously announced, and it has said the best way to shop the event is via the Apple Store app. \nIt looks like Apple is also offering Apple Music, its subscription music-streaming service, free for three months.

      "text": "apple black friday gift card deal news storefront feat More Apple is getting into the spirit of the holidays this year with its own Black Friday deal. It teased us earlier in the week, without revealing any details, only that the Apple Watch would likely be included in the promotion. Apple has now lifted the lid on its Black Friday surprise , and it’s giving a gift card out with almost each product purchased from its online store today.\nThe value of the gift card varies depending on what device you end up buying, but it does include the aforementioned Apple Watch, along with the iPhone, iPad, Apple Mac computers, and the Apple TV. If you’ve been tempted by one of these already, then the gift card is a pleasant bonus. However, as with all promotions like this, the more you spend, the higher the card’s value will be.\nMore: The best Black Friday deals\niPhone Apple iPhone 6S Plus More Apple iPhone 6S Plus\nJessica Lee Star/Digital Trends\nIf the new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus is on your list, then you’re out of luck here, because Apple’s only giving a $50 gift card with the iPhone SE , the iPhone 6S , and the iPhone 6S Plus . These are the SIM-free models, purchased without a contract, and cost from $400, $550, and $650 respectively, depending on the storage capacity you select.\nApple Watch Apple Watch Sport More Andy Boxall/Digital Trends\nIt’s a similar situation with the Apple Watch. Only the Series 1 models — that’s the one without GPS and water-resistance — are included in the promotion. There are six models available, with either the silver, gold, or space gray case and various strap colors, all at either $270 or $300, unless you decide to customize them at checkout. A $25 gift card will be included with your Watch.\niPad Apple iPad Air 2 rear 2 More Read More The iPad Pro , iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 4 all come with a $100 gift card, with prices for the hardware starting at $600, $400, and $400 respectively.\nApple TV Apple TV (2015) More Bill Roberson/Digital Trends\nThe Apple TV starts at $150, and includes a $25 gift card. This is at least the latest version of the set top box, complete with the excellent touch sensitive remote, and Siri to help out.

      "text": "Apple iPhone 6S Plus Jessica Lee Star/Digital Trends \nIf the new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus is on your list, then you’re out of luck here, because Apple’s only giving a $50 gift card with the iPhone SE , the iPhone 6S , and the iPhone 6S Plus . These are the SIM-free models, purchased without a contract, and cost from $400, $550, and $650 respectively, depending on the storage capacity you select. Apple Watch \nAndy Boxall/Digital Trends \nIt’s a similar situation with the Apple Watch. Only the Series 1 models — that’s the one without GPS and water-resistance — are included in the promotion. There are six models available, with either the silver, gold, or space gray case and various strap colors, all at either $270 or $300, unless you decide to customize them at checkout. A $25 gift card will be included with your Watch. iPad \nThe iPad Pro , iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 4 all come with a $100 gift card, with prices for the hardware starting at $600, $400, and $400 respectively. Apple TV \nBill Roberson/Digital Trends \nThe Apple TV starts at $150, and includes a $25 gift card. This is at least the latest version of the set top box, complete with the excellent touch sensitive remote, and Siri to help out. Spend $200, and you get 64GB of internal storage, twice that of the lower cost version. Mac \nDigital Trends \nBuying an Apple Mac computer will get you the gift card worth $150, the highest available value in the company’s Black Friday deal. Don’t go looking for a model with the new Touch Bar though, as it’s not included, but you can still pick up a MacBook , a 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Pro , a MacBook Air , an iMac , or a Mac Pro. Prices vary greatly, depending on spec, with the cheapest MacBook Air costing $1,000, all the way up to the $3,000 Mac Pro.",

      "title": "Apple’s best device deals are being offered at Best Buy and Target - MarketWatch",
      "text": "Apple Inc. devices are proving popular this Black Friday weekend, but iPads and Watches are actually cheaper at Apple’s big-box retail partners than they are when bought directly from the manufacturer, which is hosting its own one-day online shopping event.\nEarlier this week, Apple AAPL, +0.54% announced that it would be hosting a one-time shopping event the Friday after Thanksgiving after skipping the event in 2015. Details on the company’s ad for the event were scarce, but Apple teased it with a photo of the Apple Watch, spurring rumors that it might discount hardware, a break from the past practice of offering deals on gift cards. The company also teased free two-day shipping, mirroring Amazon Prime AMZN, -0.02% and certain partner distributors.\nOpinion: Why Black Friday sales aren’t for the truly frugal\nThis year, however, proved to be more of the same, with Apple offering Apple gift cards on select products bought at full price. In other words, a shopper spends just as much money now as they would have yesterday on certain devices to get a store discount for a later purchase. But even after subtracting the Apple gift card from the regular retail price, certain devices are actually cheaper at Best Buy Co. BBY, -0.40% and Target Corp. TGT, +0.52% today than they are shopping directly at Apple.com.\nAlso Read: Apple products and TVs the big drivers for Target’s Thanksgiving sales\nWhen taking advantage of Apple’s deals, a full-price iPhone SE, iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus yields a $50 gift card; a full-price iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 4 comes with a $100 gift card; a full-priced Apple Watch Series 1 includes a $25 gift card; and a full-priced MacBook, MacBook Pro 13-inch, MacBook Pro 15-inch; MacBook Air and iMac yields a $150 gift card.\nBreaking this down further, the iPad Air 2 Wi-Fi 32-gigabyte costs $274.99 at Best Buy and $274 at Target, compared with $399 at Apple, or $349 when including the $50 gift card.\nThe Apple Watch Series 1 rose gold model with a sport band is $219 at Best Buy and $198 at Target, compared with $269 at Apple, or $244 when including the $25 gift card.\nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro with 8GB of memory is $1,099.99 at Best Buy and $1,149 at New York-based consumer tech retailer B&H, compared with $1,299 at Apple, or $1,149 when including the gift card. The MacBook isn’t sold at Target.\nAlso See: Dow, S&P 500 hit new record in quiet postholiday trading\nThe only time going straight to Apple is better is if you’re buying an older-model iPhone. The iPhone 6s Plus 32GB rose gold, for example, is $649 at Apple.com, or $599 including the gift card. That’s compared with a retail price of $699.99 at Best Buy.\nFor the iPhone 7, however, the deal is better at Best Buy, with Apple selling its newest iPhone at full price and Best Buy offering discounts and e-gift cards on certain models. The iPhone 7 black 128GB, for example, is $36.58 a month for 24 months with the iPhone upgrade program, or $749 retail when purchased at Apple.com, whereas Best Buy is offering it for $31.25 a month for 24 months along with a $100 Best Buy e-gift card.\nAlso Read: U.S. online sales tally more than $1 billion on Thanksgiving Day\nApple has been trying to boost device sales after suffering recent declines in hardware, which are its largest source of revenue. The company reported its first-ever annual decline in iPhone sales last month. This has prompted the company in recent months to shift the conversation on its earnings conference calls to services, which now make more money than the Mac family, while analysts have started to question the company’s ability to innovate on pace with its biggest rivals in certain areas such as augmented reality and television. The company’s much-hyped BlueTooth AirPods , meanwhile, still aren’t available.\nShares of Apple rose 0.3% to $111.52 in late-morning trade Friday, while those of Best Buy fell 0.3% to $46.83 and Target’s rose 0.4% to $78.79 – all on unusually light volume given the holiday.\nApple’s shares have risen 3.7% in the past three months, but remain down 5.5% in the past year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.28% , meanwhile, is up 3.7% in the past three months and up 7.4% in the past year. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.26% has gained 8% on the year.\nBlack Friday Shopping Secrets (3:10) Shoppers who missed out on $97 Beats headphones, a $99 Nikon camera and other Black Friday deals last year needn’t worry. Chances are those same items will be on sale again this year—for the same price. WSJ's Suzanne Kapner explains on Lunch Break with Tanya Rivero.

      "text": "Apple’s Black Friday surprise is a gift card worth up to $150 Andy Boxall More Apple is getting into the spirit of the holidays this year with its own Black Friday deal. It teased us earlier in the week, without revealing any details, only that the Apple Watch would likely be included in the promotion. Apple has now lifted the lid on its Black Friday surprise , and it’s giving a gift card out with almost each product purchased from its online store today. The value of the gift card varies depending on what device you end up buying, but it does include the aforementioned Apple Watch, along with the iPhone, iPad, Apple Mac computers, and the Apple TV. If you’ve been tempted by one of these already, then the gift card is a pleasant bonus. However, as with all promotions like this, the more you spend, the higher the card’s value will be. Apple iPhone 6S Plus Jessica Lee Star/Digital Trends If the new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus is on your list, then you’re out of luck here, because Apple’s only giving a $50 gift card with the iPhone SE , the iPhone 6S , and the iPhone 6S Plus . These are the SIM-free models, purchased without a contract, and cost from $400, $550, and $650 respectively, depending on the storage capacity you select. Apple Watch More Andy Boxall/Digital Trends It’s a similar situation with the Apple Watch. Only the Series 1 models — that’s the one without GPS and water-resistance — are included in the promotion. There are six models available, with either the silver, gold, or space gray case and various strap colors, all at either $270 or $300, unless you decide to customize them at checkout. A $25 gift card will be included with your Watch. iPad More Read More The iPad Pro , iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 4 all come with a $100 gift card, with prices for the hardware starting at $600, $400, and $400 respectively. Apple TV More Bill Roberson/Digital Trends The Apple TV starts at $150, and includes a $25 gift card. This is at least the latest version of the set top box, complete with the excellent touch sensitive remote, and Siri to help out. Spend $200, and you get 64GB of internal storage, twice that of the lower cost version. Mac More Digital Trends Buying an Apple Mac computer will get you the gift card worth $150, the highest available value in the company’s Black Friday deal. Don’t go looking for a model with the new Touch Bar though, as it’s not included, but you can still pick up a MacBook , a 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Pro , a MacBook Air , an iMac , or a Mac Pro. Prices vary greatly, depending on spec, with the cheapest MacBook Air costing $1,000, all the way up to the $3,000 Mac Pro. ",

      "text": "Email NEW YORK — Apple is offering up gift cards in lieu of discounts to its Black Friday shoppers. \nThe company is giving out gift cards ranging from $25 to $150 with the purchase of select products on Black Friday. The amount ranges depending on what shoppers buy. \nA $25 Apple gift card goes to Apple TV or Apple Watch Series 1 buyers; $50 gift cards for select SIM-free iPhones; $100 for some iPad models and $150 cards when buying select Macs. \nThe products are older models — not Apple’s newest offerings like the latest MacBook Pro or iPhone 7. \nOf course, there are also other ways of getting discounted Apple products. Best Buy, for instance, is selling the 13-inch MacBook Air at a discounted rate of $999. \nApple’s Black Friday offering wasn’t a given: The company didn’t offer any sales or discounts in 2015. \nThe gift card perk is valid online as well as in Apple stores.

      "title": "Is The Market Share of Google Pixel Phones in India Really Worth the Hype?",
      "text": "The best of Android and Apple has raised the smartphone standards in the market. Google Pixel and iPhone 7 are giving a tough challenge to the Smartphone leader Samsung in India. According to ET , citing data from Counterpoint, a market research firm, Google Pixel and Pixel XL has captured 10% of premium smartphone market in India within just 17 days of its launch . It is a great achievement for the company given that the Pixel phones are the first ever smartphones launched by Google.\nOver 330,000 units of premium smartphones were shipped in India. Counterpoint took into account the premium smartphones with a tag price of INR 30,000 or more for the report.\nApple has also strengthened its position in the Indian smartphone market. Pushing Samsung behind, Apple secured the Numero uno position in the Indian premium smartphone market with 66% share. Samsung slipped to second place with 23% market share. On the other hand, Google shipped 33,000 units of Google Pixel and Pixel XL devices in India. The Pixel phones consequently captured 10% of the Indian market.\nGoogle Pixel Phones: Best Bet Ever from Google! Google has put its best foot forward with the Pixel phones. It left no stones unturned to capture a sizeable chunk of the Indian smartphone market. Starting with exchange programs, Interest-free EMIs to Cashback; Google did everything to lure the Indian buyers.\nGoogle also invested an undisclosed amount for the online and offline advertisement. The ads were mainly targeted towards the users in Metro and Tier cities of India. Initially, the price tag of INR. 57,000 (US$799) for Google Pixel and Pixel XL was considered a bit higher. However, considering the response to the devices, it is almost evident that people found the phones worth this investment.\nIs Google Pixel Really Gaining Grounds? Google now lists among the top three smartphone vendors in the premium segment in India. Ironically, Google is yet to find acceptance in the market. A thorough evaluation of the preferences and buying habits of those who have bought the Pixel phones can reveal why Google Pixel phones are far from wide acceptance in India.\nAnalysts believe that Google benefitted largely from the debacle of Samsung Note 7 . A huge chunk of people in India was waiting to upgrade to Galaxy Note 7. Their hopes went in vain when news of battery explosions in Note 7 hit the headlines. Samsung had to announce the recall and later stop the entire production of Note 7 before it could be launched in India. As a result, most of the prospective Galaxy Note 7 buyers opted for the Pixel phones. Whether they were looking to upgrade or exchange their old smartphones, Google Pixel and Pixel XL were the best available options in the market. There couldn’t have been better phones to fill up the void that Note 7 created.\nAnalysts also pointed out another reason; It is quite unlikely that a sizeable number of iPhone users made a shift to Google. Rather, it is possible that few iPhone 6 or iPhone 6s users purchased the Pixel phones to experience the best of both worlds. Albeit, the number of such users is minuscule.\nPremium Smartphone Market in India It is hard to understand if the data mentioned in the Counterpoint Research Report is monthly, quarterly, or yearly. However, taking into account the historical data of overall smartphone shipments in India, the report apparently talks about the monthly shipment scenario. 83.3 million units of smartphones were shipped in India during the first three quarters of 2016, recording a 17.5% QoQ growth. Our estimation shows that nearly 38 million units of smartphones will be shipped in India during the ongoing fourth quarter of the year , of which a sizable share will be shipped in the month of December alone.\nIf we put all the above figures together, it’s safe to say that on an average, 10 million units of smartphones are shipped in India on a monthly basis. According to IDC 71% of these smartphones belong to the sub-$150 category. If we do a simple calculation and factor the data from Counterpoint and IDC, nearly 26.7% of smartphones shipped in India belong to the price range of $151 – $450. Disappointingly, the market of premium segment smartphones is limited to mere 3.3% . Drilling down this data further, Google has apparently captured just 0.3% of the total smartphone shipments in India in October 2016 with Pixel and Pixel XL phones.\nWill the Pixel Phones Make a Mark? Whether it’s Apple, Samsung or Google, it doesn’t matter which company owns the premium segment market in India. We already know that India is a price sensitive market. It is led by smartphone manufacturers that have offerings for an entry-level and mid-range segment. Indian smartphone market is one of the largest smartphone markets in the world and is growing pretty fast. Hence, it would be interesting to see how Google penetrates the smartphone market and make a strong foothold with its Pixel Phones in India.\n",

      "title": "The 16 best Apple Watch straps you can buy right now",
      "text": "Apple made it very easy to change the strap on your Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2, but it made the official straps it sells very, very expensive. Beautiful though they are, there’s no need to be limited to Apple’s range of replacement bands, regardless of how much you have to spend.\nRelated: Ten annoying Apple Watch problems, and how to fix them\nLike putting your phone inside a case, changing the strap on your watch is the quickest way to give it an entirely new look, and it’s easy to build up a collection that goes with different outfits, or for when you’re doing certain activities. The choice is huge, so we’ve gathered together a list of our favorite straps and bands for the Apple Watch here.\nSouthern Straps Nato Strap ($25) A more textured nylon strap than the Nyloon example below, the Southern Straps band also has stitching running down each section, giving it a different look. It feels very hard-wearing, and has been double bonded and heat sealed to make sure it doesn’t just fall apart under tough conditions. We love the khaki and red version seen here, which comes with a choice of colors for the Apple Watch connectors, and in either 38mm or 42mm sizes. Let down slightly by the strap loop, which sometimes pinched wrist hairs.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon Southern Straps\nNyloon Watch Band ($39) Nyloon’s nylon watch band feels like it’ll last a while and withstand some rough treatment, which is just what you need from this popular style. We’ve been wearing the Napier design, which comes in navy blue and red, and found it comfortable and stylish. The shiny hardware is attractive, and the Apple Watch adapter pieces have spring-loaded bars, so you can swap out the strap for another 20mm or 22m version of your own choice.\nBuy one now from:\nNyloon\nNomad Leather Strap ($60) Nomad’s classic leather strap, found elsewhere on our list, is available at a lower cost at the moment, but its new version has a more modern style. It loses the stitching for a sleeker, flatter look. We particularly love Nomad’s straps due to the custom designed Watch adapters, which change the look of the Watch’s face considerably. Both the adapters and the buckle have a matt finish and also come in black, ready to match your Watch model. It’s still quite a masculine design, but less so than the previous strap. The Horween leather is wonderfully supple out of the box and needs only a few hours to bed in.\nBuy one now from:\nNomad\nNomad Vulcanized LSR Silicone Strap ($40) If you like the stylish custom Nomad Watch adaptors, but don’t want a leather strap, then its new silicone strap may appeal. Incredibly soft, completely waterproof, and friendly to the skin, it’s the ideal accompaniment to the new swim-proof Apple Watch Series 2. The hardware comes in sliver or black, and the latter attached to a black watch gives a very cool stealth look. Unlike some silicone straps, the Nomad doesn’t get sweaty thanks to a special channel on the underside of the strap, but it did catch the hair on my arm occasionally.\nBuy one now from:\nNomad\nPad & Quill Field Strap ($100) Pad & Quill’s Field Strap is an interesting take on the fabric Watch strap, combining very hard wearing Cordura fabric with classy and comfortable leather, along with nickel hardware. The leather is stitched to the fabric on the underside, making the strap very easy to wear. Leather is also incorporated into other areas to give the band some visual excitement. The black and gray color combo is our pick, as it’s versatile enough to match most outfits and situations. Next to Nomad’s silicone strap, this is one of the most comfortable Apple Watch straps we’ve worn recently.\nBuy one now from:\nPad & Quill\nUllu Watch Band ($100+) Ullu Apple Watch Strap More Using sustainable leather sourced from Italy, Thailand, Africa, and the U.S., these handcrafted leather bands are beautiful, and come in a wide range of rich colors. Available for both Apple Watch sizes, there’s a choice between premium or hand-colored leather, or moving up to the more expensive options of ostrich, stingray, or alligator leather. You can pick a case for your iPhone or iPad in the same color, for a complete matching look.\nBuy one now from:\nUllu Shop\nLunatik Epik Apple Watch Kit ($46+) Lunatik Epic Bike Lifestyle More If just changing the strap isn’t enough to transform the look of your Apple Watch, how about wrapping the body up in a chunky case at the same time? That’s the solution provided by Lunatik and its crazy Epik watch straps. The body is made from aluminum and protects the Apple Watch, while still allowing the sensors room to work, and the strap is made from silicone. It all works and fits together as one, giving your Watch a look like no other.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nIncipio Premium Leather Band ($30+) View photos\nIncipio Premium Leather Band More Made from leather with stainless steel metalwork, Incipio’s Watch strap is more subtle than many other leather options, with a slimmer, sleeker profile. Made for the 38mm and 42mm watches, the strap comes in a choice of two shades of brown, or a darker black color. Incipio’s smartphones cases are great, and this strap has a classic design that’s sure to appeal to anyone who doesn’t want too much flash on their wrist.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nBurkley Soft Leather Band ($60) Burkley Soft Leather Band More You’ll love the look and feel of these soft, genuine leather straps for the Apple Watch. Burkley is expert at fashioning leather accessories, and these straps come in a choice of different finishes and with different buckle styles. The antique coffee finish with the classic buckle gets our vote, but you can pick whatever suits you. The clasp is included, for your chosen size. You’ll find the natural leather ages, so it looks even better when it’s worn in.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon Burkley\nPad & Quill Lowry Leather Cuff ($130) Pad and Quill Lowry Cuff Apple Watch Strap More Renowned for its high quality, great looking leather Apple accessories, Pad & Quill makes three different straps for the Apple Watch, but we’ve singled out the Lowry Leather Cuff. Made from full grain leather in black, chestnut, or tan colors, with hand finished stitching and nickel buckles, the look is rugged yet classy. Suede on the underside of the strap makes it comfortable to wear. The one problem? It’s only for the 42mm Apple Watch.\nBuy one now from:\nPad & Quill\nMonowear Design Nylon Strap ($48) View photos\nMonowear Design Nylon Strap More Monowear Design has a wide range of straps for the Apple Watch, but its Nylon range stands out as good value, plus there are several customization options to ensure it perfectly matches your own watch. The strap comes in various colors, while the buckle and adaptors come in stainless steel, silver, space black, rose gold, or gold. Straps are sold for the 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch.\nBuy one now from:\nAmazon\nForm Function Form Button Stud Band ($48+) View photos\nForm Function Form Button Stud Band More If you want something a little different, then take a look at Form Function Form’s funky Button Stud strap, which does away with any type of buckle or clasp. Instead, it has a stainless steel stud that holds a long, leather band in place. The stud and adaptor can be ordered in the color to suit your Apple Watch, just make sure you check the length to ensure the overall fit is correct. The company even provides lifetime, free size adjustments if you buy one.\nBuy one now from:\nBirchBox Form Function\nHyperLink Bracelet ($30) HyperLink Bracelet More A design classic, this stainless steel bracelet costs a fraction of Apple’s version, yet is made from the same material. It looks fantastic, has a cool clasp, and promises not to catch hair or skin even when worn all day. We tried an early version, and had no issues with it at all. Available in silver or a specially produced space black to match your Watch, you can buy the HyperLink bracelet for either the 38mm or 42mm watch.\nBuy one now from:\nHyperLink\nClessant Nubuck Buffalo ($115) View photos\nClessant Nubuck Buffalo More Hardwearing leather straps are everywhere, but nubuck straps are far less common. Clessant sells three in different colors, with the same glorious textured nubuck finish that’s soft on the skin and very easy on the eye. Buffalo leather is apparently more resistant than other types of nubuck leather, so it should stay looking good for longer. We’re partial to the purple version, which comes in 38mm or 42mm sizes, and a choice of adaptor colors.\nBuy one now from:\nClessant Nubuck Buffalo\nArrow & Board Triple Tour Strap ($120) View photos\nArrow & Board Double Tour Split Strap More Apple’s partnership with fashion house Hermes popularized the double tour style strap amongst Watch owners, but picking up a genuine version is very expensive. Arrow & Board’s option is far more reasonable, and comes with a split strap so it can be worn in three different ways. Made to order, it’s finished in tanned leather with hand stitched features and a series of brass loops and a buckle to keep the strap in place.\nBuy one now from:\nArrow & Board\nNomad Strap ($150) Nomad is well-known for its attractive Apple accessories, and its own Apple Watch strap is no exception. The Italian leather is chunky, and the oversize stainless steel buckle and wide loops give the strap a strong, rugged look. The draw here is the untreated leather, which means it’ll age in a way other straps may not, gaining its own character over time. It’s sold for the 38mm and 42mm Apple Watch, comes in three colors, and a choice of black or silver metalwork.\nBuy one now from:\nNomad\nThe best deals on accessories for the iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch How to order the new iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Apple Watch Series 2, and Nike+ Apple Watch Twenty-five cases to keep your iPhone SE looking like new",

A hill on which to throw myself and hysterically weep. \nImage: YouTube \nSadly, it won't be Apple's Hill , a giant mound of dirt at the company's fancy new campus in Cupertino. But all good things must come to an end, and as some new drone footage shows, the time has finally come for Hill. \nThe pile of mud, which Vogue scribe Rob Haskell once described — in all seriousness, allegedly — as \"Giza brought to Cupertino, as if that ancient triumph of human hands had decided to seek an audience with the high priests of technology,\" is no longer. The majestic material was used to landscape the campus, which will reportedly house thousands of employees and feature cafés, a parking garage, an auditorium and an R&D facility. \nAlas, Apple didn't die on its Hill, but decided to kill it instead. Ever the innovator, that Apple. ",

      "text": "Reddit \nAccording to a new report from Recode , Apple has recently hired one of the top editors from Wired to join its design team. Billy Sorrentino is Wired’s creative director and while the publication confirmed that he will be joining Apple’s design team, it couldn’t offer more details or specifics at this point. \nAt Wired, Sorrentino held the title of Head of Creative, which as Recode notes, is a top-tier position at a design-centric publication such as Wired. Sorrentino was tasked with leading “the brand’s four creative departments—design, photo, video, and production, and is responsible for cross-channel brand presence, including print, web, digital editions, mobile, social media, retail, and live events,” according to his bio . Essentially, Sorrentino had a say in nearly everything Wired published, across all of its brands. \nPrior to Wired, Sorrentino was designed director at Condé Nast’s Editorial Development Group. In that position, he “worked closely with the company’s editorial brands on the creation of future content visions, particularly in the digital landscape, including launching many digital editions for Condé Nast brands.” \nOther brands to which Sorrentino has applied his touch consist of WWE, Maxim, Blender, Adobe, Vanity Fair, Sony Records, Vogue, GQ, and many others. But now, Sorrentino gets to add Apple to his already impressive list of employers. \nApple itself has yet to comment on the addition of Sorrentino to its design team, but its likely that the former Wired editor will be focusing on software design as opposed to hardware design. Nevertheless, it’s a notable addition for Apple and a big loss for Wired. Filling the void left by Sorrentino is David Moretti, who previously served as the publication’s deputy creative director. \nWe’ll be sure to keep an eye out as to what Sorrentino does at Apple, but for now his specific role remains unclear.

      "text": "Apple hires Wired magazine creative director to design team By Tuesday, November 29, 2016, 02:59 pm PT (05:59 pm ET) Apple is adding a new member to its design team, as Billy Sorrentino, Wired magazine's Head of Creative, on Tuesday announced he will depart the publication to take on an undisclosed role at the Cupertino tech giant. Billy Sorrentino. | Source: Semi Permanent Wired confirmed Sorrentino's move to Re/code but declined to elaborate on what post the former editor would take at Apple. Apple has not yet responded to requests for comment on the matter. According to his LinkedIn bio , Sorrentino was responsible for each of Wired's four major creative departments, a job that required proficiency in design, photography and video production. As part of his daily duties, he handled various magazine initiatives across a number of platforms, including print, web, digital, social media, retail and live events. Though it is unknown as to how, exactly, Sorrentino will contribute to Apple's design team, his position will likely involve graphic design. In 2016, Sorrentino was presented a National Magazine Award, or Ellie, honoring excellence in print magazine design for his work at Wired. He is also the recipient of awards from the Art Director's Club Global, D&AD, The Society of Publication Designers, the Type Director's Club, American Photography, American Illustration, the One Club, and the Webby Awards. Prior to his three years at Wired, Sorrentino served as design director at Condé Nast's digital publishing arm. He also headed up design at WWE, Maxim, and Blender Magazine, and served as creative director at his own design agency from 2003 to 2010. Taking Sorrentino's place at Wired is deputy creative director David Moretti. Topics:",

The real answer is more complicated than that, and Jon tries to break it down as best as he can in the latest episode of Ask the Buffalo.\nWhich one would you choose? What are the best features?

It will also widen the types of purchases that will funnel an unspecified percentage of the sale to Red, which helps provide AIDS/HIV medicines. \nAmong the products included in the latest Red initiative are iPhone 7 battery pack case, Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones, App Store games such as Angry Birds and Clash of Clans, and iTunes purchases like The Killers new album \"Don't Waste Your Wishes.\" iTunes will also offer free downloads of Spike Jonze's 2010 AIDS documentary \"The Lazarus Effect.\" \nAnd Apple said it would donate $1 to Red for every item bought at an Apple Store using Apple Pay. Bank of America will match that if the Apple Pay purchase uses one of its cards. \nApple and its executive team have long had a close relationship with U2. Bono was close with former Apple CEO Steve Jobs. In 2004, the company and the band released a special edition iPod with a facsimile of the band members' signatures on the back, and Red introduced a special edition iPod Nanoin 2006. \nBut that closeness went awry in 2015, when Apple launched its subscription music service Apple Music with an automatic download of a new U2 album to iTunes users worldwide . Some users revolted, worried that their accounts had been hacked or annoyed that music they didn't want sudden showed up in their libraries. Share your voice",

      "title": "Will Apple Launch The iPhone 7s Or The iPhone 8 Next?",
      "text": "The world of Apple and its iPhones is an ever-changing one; we’ve only just had the release of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and we’re already talking about what comes next. Right now the rumor mill is at a fever pitch with different factions talking about an iPhone 7s and others about the iPhone 8. Here is what has been said about the possibility of each device seeing the light of day.\nImage Source: ConceptiPhones.com iPhone 7s or iPhone 8? Conventional naming “wisdom” suggests that Apple will release the iPhone 8 in 2017 because next year happens to be the tenth anniversary of the first iPhone launch. Many industry analysts and so-called “knowledgeable” people can’t see Apple going down its usual “s” route in such a year.\nTo be honest, up until yesterday, we would have agreed with them. After all, what Apple needs right now/in 2017 is an all-conquering smartphone that will bring back the glory days and reverse slowing iPhone sales. Earlier this week we reported that the company is looking to produce an iPhone 8 with a screen that has higher resolution than the Galaxy S7. While we and others still stand firmly by that belief, new information has come to light which could throw an iPhone 7s into the mix.\nImage Credit: iDropNews OLED and AMOLED displays Bloomberg recently indicated that Apple could struggle to get all the OLED panels it requires for 2017.\nThe report states, “The four main suppliers for such components [OLED panels] won’t have enough production capacity to make screens for all new iPhones next year, with constraints continuing into 2018.”\nThis means that, as previously reported, Samsung could be the sole supplier of OLED panels to Apple this year and next. However, it might not be able to meet the demand put on by Apple for the iPhone 8, although some analysts suggest Apple already has contingency plans for this, such as using AMOLED technology.\nThree new iPhones in 2017? There have been rumors swirling that Apple could deliver three iPhone 8 models in 2017. However, the revelation that OLED panels may not be available for such a lineup has sparked new interest in the iPhone 7s. The reason is because while there will supposedly be enough panels to accommodate a certain number of iPhone 8s using OLED panels, Apple is rumored to be looking into producing two lower-spec handsets, both of which could use AMOLED panels.\nSo a lineup for 2017 could look something like this: iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and an iPhone 8 with an all-new glass design. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently issued a research note in which he stated that he believes Apple’s suppliers are gearing up for something big. Next year could see a huge upgrade cycle which may include upwards of 150 million units under production that year.\nHe states that a premium OLED iPhone 8 will reach out to high-end users, while the lower-end iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus will both have AMOLED displays, but not much more in the way of upgrades compared to the 7 and 7 Plus beyond the display upgrade.\nImage Source: Tobias Buettner Handset sizes According to analysts, each of the handsets available in 2017 will have a different size display. With the iPhone 8 sporting a 5.5-inch OLED, it could be bezel-less. However, the detail is yet to be revealed.\nAs for what could be the two iPhone 7s models, one could be 4.7 inches, and the other 5.1 or 5.2 inches. Again, no detail other than they could be AMOLED-based is known.\nWhile rumors still float around being unsubstantiated by an official Apple announcement, you should take all of the information contained here with a grain of salt. Having said that though, it does seem like a consensus has been reached regarding the iPhone 8, meaning that Apple will do away with the Home Button, instead placing its functionality and that of the Touch ID sensor into the handset’s display.\nAs for the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, keep checking back. As we learn more, we will publish and keep you updated.\nThe post Will Apple Launch The iPhone 7s Or The iPhone 8 Next? appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "\nNintendo and Apple really love each other. Apple gave Nintendo a prime spot on the stage at their iPhone 7 event earlier this year, Super Mario Run is launching exclusively for iOS devices to begin with, and now, Nintendo’s legendary Shigeru Miyamoto and the creator of Mario will be at the Apple Store in New York next week.\nWhat will he be doing there? He will be demoing Super Mario Run , also allowing people who are there an early chance to play the game ahead of its December 15 launch (you’d have to register for it on Apple’s website first, though). He will also be talking to tech journalist Katie Linendoll, discussing his philosophy to “share the importance of fun and the inspiration behind the gameplay”.\nSuper Mario Run represents the first true Nintendo smartphone game- Miitomo was more social networking app than game, and the immensely successful Pokemon GO wasn’t really a Nintendo game at all. It’ll be interesting to see how the higher priced Mario Run does.",

      "title": "iPhone 8 Rumors: Release date, screen size and everything we know so far",
      "text": "What will Apple release in 2017? A new year is on the horizon, and with it comes a new iPhone. The iPhone 8, as it's being called, is widely anticipated to arrive in September with an ambitious redesign commemorating the smartphone's 10th anniversary . It's still early, but a number of unsubstantiated rumors are spreading around. What's possible, what's likely and what's just a pipe dream? Here's everything we know about the iPhone 8 so far.\niPhone 8 rumors and leaks: OLED display with Touch ID, wireless charging and more Edge-to-edge curved OLED display: Business Insider obtained a research note from Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn describing a \"bezel-less design with screen sizes getting larger and curved edges in the original envelope.\" The analysts went on to predict an OLED display — which is thinner and brighter, despite consuming less battery — outfitted in the Plus model of the iPhone 8.\nGlass body with built-in Touch ID: Japanese news outlet Nikkei reported Apple's alleged plans to equip its new line of iPhones with glass backs. According to the report, Apple will release three new versions: 5.5 inches, 5 inches and 4.7 inches.\nIn addition, Apple is rumored to embed Touch ID within the body's display, thus eliminating the home button and allowing the screen described above to fill the device's entire front. Cult of Mac dug up a patent that further corroborates this theory.\niPhone 8 rumored to have larger, curved screens that extend to the edges: 2015 concept design of... https://t.co/m5YxycDbwL #Technology\nWireless charging: Looks like Apple may finally adopt wireless charging, according to reputable KGI Securities analyst and famed Apple insider Ming-Chi Kuo. 9to5Mac described his report, writing, \"iPhone 8 owners will be able to charge their batteries using an inductive pad similar to how the Apple Watch charges.\"\nThat's a bit off the mark from an earlier Bloomberg report that claimed Apple is developing a far superior option for 2017: long-range wireless charging. Let's hope Apple can pull off Bloomberg 's version.\nDual optical image stabilization: Another Kuo research note obtained by MacRumors claims two of Apple's iPhone 8 models will possess optical image stabilization in both of its camera lenses. Previously, only the iPhone 7 Plus' wide-angle lens was equipped with the feature, but now telephoto is expected to include OIS as well. (Great news for anyone who loves zooming in really close on Snapchat.) The rumored 5.5-inch and 5-inch iPhone 8s should benefit, while the standard 4.7-inch is expected to retain just one camera lens.",

      "text": "The Best Tablets of 2016 The Best Tablets of 2016 Whether you're looking for an Android, Apple, or Windows tablet, here's what to consider, along with our top-rated slates. 7.5 by 4.5 by 0.4 inches 8.4 by 5.0 by 0.4 inches 9.4 by 6.6 by 0.24 inches 0.35 by 8.27 by 11.5 inches 11.5 by 7.93 by 0.33 inches 8.7 by 5 by 0.4 inches 0.78 by 10.39 by 6.81 inches 9.34 by 6.65 by 0.22 inches 10.3 by 6.7 by 0.4 inches 0.62 by 11.5 by 7.93 (HWD) inches Screen Size Alone: 1.73 lbs; With Keyboard: 2.46 lbs 1.73 lbs Next \nThere are countless tablets on the market, but which one is right for you? Whether you're eyeing an iPad, one of the many Android tablets available, or a Windows slate for productivity, here are the key factors you need to consider when shopping, along with some of the top-rated models we've tested. \nWe'd like to make one note for the fall: Apple's iPad lineup is starting to look a bit old. It's been almost two full years since the company updated its midrange iPad Air series. It's still a fine tablet, but we'd suggest holding off, if you can, to see if Apple announces a late October update, if you're looking for an iOS tablet that's not an iPad Pro. \nChoose Your Operating System Just like with a full-fledged computer, if you're getting a tablet, you need to pick a camp. And just like with a computer, your decision will likely come down to your gut feeling. Right now, the top contenders are Apple with its iPads and Android with its many hardware choices from the likes of Acer, Amazon, Asus, Samsung, and others. And we're seeing affordable Windows 10 tablets built around Intel's Atom processor from various manufacturers like Acer and Asus. \nGenerally speaking, the greatest strength of Apple's iOS, the operating system on the iPad Air, iPad mini , and iPad Pro tablet lines, is twofold: It's very clean and intuitive, and the wide selection of iPad apps that you can buy right on your tablet—more than one million iPad-specific titles at the time of this writing—work uniformly well with very few exceptions. For more, check out our iOS 10 review. \nGoogle's Android mobile OS gives you a choice of hardware from several different manufacturers and offers maximum configurability, a top-notch notification system, fast and smooth Web browsing, and seamless integration with Google applications like Gmail, Google Maps, and Hangouts for video chat. Android also includes support for multiple user logins so you can share your tablet with a friend or family member, a useful feature that's missing in Apple tablets (despite Apple's Family Sharing, which isn't the same thing). See our Android 7.0 Nougat review for more. \nWindows 10 comes the closest to offering a traditional computing experience with full x86 support for all of your Windows software. And you can run the full version of Microsoft Office when you buy a Win 10 tablet. Also, connectivity options and hardware add-ons for Windows models are typically more plentiful than with other tablet types. Check out our Windows 10 review for more. See How We Test Tablets \nWhat About Apps? What's a tablet without quality apps? If you want third-party apps specifically designed for a touch-screen interface, nothing out there beats the iPad with its huge library of programs and games designed specifically for Apple tablets. The App Store is well-curated and monitored, offers a deep selection, and includes every popular app you can think of. If a wide range of compelling apps that look good and work well your tablet is your main priority, Apple is your best bet. For more, see The 100 Best iPad Apps . \nAndroid has made great strides on app selection, courting more developers and offering more high-quality tablet apps, but it's still not as many as Apple offers. It's tough to say exactly how many tablet-optimized Android apps are available, but it's likely in the thousands, rather than the hundreds of thousands. There are also Android phone apps, which look decent on a 7-inch tablet, but less so on a 9- or 10-inch one, so you're likely to have more problems getting high-quality apps for larger Android tablets. That said, check out The 100 Best Android Apps for our top picks. \nWindows 10, meanwhile, offers an impressive array of more than 100,000 touch-screen-friendly tablet apps, but its real strength is in running the millions of existing Windows desktop apps. Many of those aren't designed for touch screens, though, and may be better handled with an add-on keyboard and mouse. \nScreen Size and Storage This consideration is a bit obvious, but size—both screen real estate and storage capacity—is important to consider. First things first: When you hear the term \"7-inch or 10-inch tablet,\" this refers to the size of the screen, measured diagonally, and not the size of the tablet itself. 7-inch tablets are considered small-screen, while 8.9-inch tablets and above are considered large-screen. Apple's iPads, Amazon's Fire, and Samsung's Note- and Tab-branded tablets all come in small- and large-screen iterations. And more than ever, phones are blurring the lines with tablets. Big smartphones (or phablets) like the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus and the Galaxy S7 Edge are challenging the need to even carry a separate tablet. \nScreen resolution is important too, especially for ebook reading and Web surfing. A sharp, bright display is key. Right now, the highest resolution you'll find is 2,732 by 2,048 pixels, on Apple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro . If you're in the market for a 10-inch Android tablet, look for a display with at least a 1,280-by-800 resolution. \nThe weight of a tablet is one definite advantage it has over a laptop—but with large-screen tablets typically weighing around a pound, they're not cell phone-light. After you hold one with a single hand on a subway ride for 20 minutes, your hand will get tired. Setting one flat in your lap, rather than propped up on a stand, can also be a little awkward. And few tablets will fit in your pocket, unless you're wearing a very large jacket. If you want pocketabiity, you might want to consider one of the aforementioned phablets. \nCloud (off-device) storage is an option for many tablets (iCloud for iPads, Amazon Cloud Storage for Fire tablets, and OneDrive for Windows), but when it comes to onboard storage, more is always better. All those apps, when combined with typical music, video, and photo libraries, can take up a lot of space. Many non-Apple tablets have microSD memory card slots that let you expand storage. \nWi-Fi-Only vs. Cellular Models Some tablets come in a Wi-Fi-only model or with the option of always-on cellular service from a wireless provider. If you want to use your tablet to get online anywhere, you should opt for a model that offers a cellular version, like the aforementioned iPads. Of course, this adds to the device's price, and then you need to pay for cellular service. Generally, though, with a tablet, you can purchase data on a month-to-month basis without signing a contract. \nAnother way to get your tablet online: Use your phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot . This won't work with every phone/tablet combo, so you should check with your carrier before you seal a deal. You can also buy a dedicated mobile hotspot , which won't kill your phone's battery life. Some even double as backup batteries to charge your tablet. \nThe Top Tablets (Right Now) The tablets chosen here represent the best we've tested across a wide range of operating systems and price levels. Because we test so many and the market is constantly evolving, we update this story monthly to include the latest products.

      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo Apple constantly adds fun new functions to Siri and now the voice assistant has a fun new trick to celebrate the rental release of the new movie The Secret Life of Pets . I noticed a teaser for it earlier this week while browsing through my Apple TV with my wife, so I quickly asked Siri: “What do my pets do when I’m not home?”\nI won’t spoil the response, but Siri offers up a couple of cute quips that suggest your pets are doing much more than sitting around on the couch or making a regular pass at the water bowl. My guess is Apple is using Siri to help promote The Secret Life of Pets . After all, it does seem like a fun little tie-in to share with your kids.\nIf you own an iPhone, ask Siri what your pets do when you’re not home and see what she says. It’s worth a quick smile at the very least, right?\n\n\nSource : iMore ",

      "text": "Reddit \nNow is a good time to buy the Apple Watch. A new version with GPS called Series 2 came out in September, and the original model was updated with a speed boost and a new name: Series 1. Both models fix issues that made the original Apple Watch fine for early adopters but harder to recommend to the masses. \nThere’s also an ecosystem of Apple Watch accessories that we’ve tested and can recommend. Read on for my hand-picked Apple Watch gift guide choices including some out-of-the-box suggestions. \nFirst, a quick primer on Apple Watch models in case you’re considering one as a gift for yourself or someone else. First-generation: Not recommended if buying new due to performance issues ( discontinued ) Series 1: Recommended for many customers, same speed as Series 2 ( reg. $269-$299 ) Series 2: Recommended for fitness use, features GPS and brighter display plus more case choices ( reg. $369-$1499 ) \nDeciding between Series 1 and Series 2 can be confusing; this is what I wrote in my Series 2 review : \nPersonally, I think these questions are necessary when deciding between Series 1 and Series 2: Do you want stainless steel with wider band compatibility or ceramic instead of aluminum? Do you want to map runs or outdoor cycles without bringing your iPhone? Do you want to get credit for swimming workouts? Do you care about display visibility in very bright sunlight? \nIf you answer yes to any of those questions, then buy Series 2. If not but you’re still in the market for an Apple Watch, strongly consider Series 1. I do not recommend the first generation Apple Watch if you want to have the best experience unless you’re on a tight budget. \nFor the best Apple Watch deals, stay tuned to 9to5Toys . Now for our recommendations: \nBest Apple Watch Docks \nYou don’t need a dock to charge Apple Watch but they’re certainly nice to have. Nomad Stand for Apple Watch is my top pick. Stand works with all Apple Watch models including both open- and closed-style bands. \nIt’s a solid dock with a minimal, modern look. You have to supply your own Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Cable like the one that comes in the box and Stand doesn’t support Nightstand mode , but it’s an attractive dock worthy of presenting any Apple Watch. \nStand is reasonably priced at $39.95 from Nomad and Amazon and comes in two colors: silver and space gray aluminum. \nIf you want to go the official route, Apple Watch Magnetic Charging Dock is your only option. I personally use this dock but it’s not my top recommendation because of its price: $79. \nApple Watch Magnetic Charging Dock is a soft padded disk with a firm weighted bottom. An integrated charging connector in the center pops up for closed-style bands and lays flat for open-style bands. \nMagnetic Charging Dock does support Nightstand mode and doesn’t require supplying your own charging cable. \nIt actually relies on an included Lightning cable (2 meters) for power. This cable can be useful when traveling if you need a spare iPhone charger although you can’t charge both your iPhone and Apple Watch overnight when sharing. \nThis dock’s $79 price makes it difficult to recommend given its basic function but it’s a nice-to-have accessory if you like its look. \nApple Watch Magnetic Charging Dock is available in one color — white — from Apple and Best Buy . \nIf you like the disk shape of Apple’s official dock, Bluelounge Kosta is a $15 charging coaster that has a similar footprint. Like Nomad Stand, you supply your own charging cable like the one that comes with your Apple Watch. \nThe charging end can stand upright or lay flat to support both open- and closed-style bands, although it’s not fixed in place so it can be difficult to keep positioned. Bluelounge Kosta is available in dark gray for $14.95 on Amazon ; check out our hands-on review here . \nFinally, Belkin has a few dock options with integrated charging connectors like Apple’s solution. Pictured is Belkin Valet Charge Dock for Apple Watch + iPhone in rose gold. It’s a pricey Apple Store exclusive at $129.95 but includes everything you need to power both your iPhone and Apple Watch. \nBelkin also makes a cheaper version that only serves the Apple Watch plus a new design with a lower price tag called PowerHouse Charge . Check out our full review of the combo Valet Charge Dock here . \nBest Third-Party Apple Watch Bands \nNomad is back with my favorite third-party Apple Watch band: Leather Strap for Apple Watch . Priced at $59.95, Leather Strap comes in brown or gray for silver or black hardware. \nThe leather is sourced from Chicago’s Horween Leather Company and the hardware comes in two styles: modern or traditional. See our hands-on review here . Nylon band alternative: Incase Nylon Nato Band ($39) \nBest Active Lifestyle Accessories \nApple Watch features an integrated heart rate monitor that stays active when logging workouts, but it can be a battery drain during lengthy exercises. Polar H7 Bluetooth Heart Rate Sensor & Fitness Tracker (~$50) wirelessly pairs with Apple Watch and provides heart rate data without taxing the Apple Watch battery. \nI don’t use it for casual workouts, but it’s beneficial during days when I know I’ll be logging a lot of activity. A side benefit is capturing constant heart rate data throughout the day even when you’re not logging workouts; Apple Watch only measures about every ten minutes when not logging workouts to preserve battery. \nSpeaking of battery life, Kanex has one of the only all-in-one solutions for keeping your Apple Watch charged during a weekend off the grid. Kanex GoPower Watch features an integrated charging connector that can recharge your Apple Watch over several nights. It’s pricier than other options at $74-$99 but makes for a nice gift or splurge purchase. See our hands-on review here . \nIf you’re using Apple Watch as a fitness tracker with the goal of getting in shape, a connected scale can be super convenient. I manually logged my weight in Apple’s Health app for months before upgrading to a Withings Wi-Fi Scale that automatically logs weight and BMI with Apple’s HealthKit feature. Prices start around $129 and vary depending on additional measurement features . \nFor me, Apple Watch has kickstarted a lifestyle change that involves a lot less junk food and a lot more physical activity. I purchased a Schwinn road bike earlier this year just to try using Apple Watch’s Workout app to measure outdoor cycling; now it’s a regular part of my physical activity. One thing leads to another then you realize you need a bottle mount to stay hydrated during longer rides and an iPhone mount for music and podcast playback. \nAfter starting to get serious about regularly running with Apple Watch Series 2, this week I decided to my running shoes need an upgrade and I’m in the market for running gloves to help get me through the winter — preferably something touch screen compatible for controlling Apple Watch. \nBefore cycling and running, my fitness story with Apple Watch started with a NordicTrack elliptical that I use for at least 30 minutes a day when I can’t get out and run or bike. I also keep a gym membership (Black Card at Planet Fitness ) primarily for exercise equipment access when traveling. \nI also rely on a few third-party apps on my Apple Watch that may be worth recommending or checking out: MyFitnessPal which I use to log my meals on iPhone and glance at goal progress from the app dock, Nike+ Run Club where I log my runs, and Fantastical ($2.99 currently during sale) which provides a streamlined calendar and customizable watch face complication. \nTK",

      "title": "How to Make tvOS Games and Apps With v-Play and QT! IoT",
      "text": "tvOS is the smart TV operating system from Apple that lets you play games and use apps on your Apple TV. Support for tvOS apps and games has been added to V-Play & Qt so now you can launch your cross-platform games and apps on your Apple TV too.\nWhat Is tvOS? Apple based tvOS on iOS but it also includes a range of frameworks that are only supported on Apple TV. The company launched it in September 2015 alongside the 4th generation of Apple TV. The Apple TV is a device that acts as a digital media player and micro-console with a touch-screen interface.\ntvOS lets you play games and use apps from your Apple TV. It offers a unique experience in comparison to a mobile device or tablet. It’s better suited than smaller devices at creating a shared experience for users. This is because the large screen allows multiple people to interact with it at the same time.\nThis shared experience is the focus of the tvOS user experience. You need to keep it in mind when you create your own tvOS apps and games.\nWhy Develop for tvOS? There are many reasons why making tvOS apps and games make sense.\nThe Growing Popularity of Smart Homes Smart devices like the Apple TV are only a small part of the Internet of Things that will become more popular in the next few years. Many companies are working on ways to make the home more intelligent. As this trend grows , Apple TVs and tvOS may become as popular in homes as the MacBook or iPad.\nAs it’s only been a little over a year since it’s release, tvOS is still a relatively young OS. While there’s no guarantee of success, it’s hard to see Apple letting one of Steve Job’s greatest passion projects fail.\nThese factors point to one thing for developers considering the tvOS marketplace. It’s an opportunity to place your apps and games on a platform with huge potential for growth. A Lack of Competitors It’s no secret that it’s becoming harder for apps and games to get seen on both Google Play and the App Store. It’s not just harder for your app to get discovered, cost-per-install is on the rise for most developers too.\nThere are other avenues available to mobile developers. But targeting a platform other than these two means entering into shrinking marketplaces . These marketplaces are already struggling for relevance and will do for years to come.\ntvOS apps and games don’t have either of these problems. They exist in a small marketplace that still has the opportunity to grow.\n\nNot having to worry so much about app store optimization and user acquisition is a bonus. It means you can invest more time in developing a great app rather than marketing. And as the marketplace grows, you’ll be in the right place to take advantage of it’s popularity\nThe Unique Monetisation Possibilities of tvOS V-Play developers will know about all the mobile platforms they can launch their apps & games on. But it’s worth noting that you will also be able to port your existing apps and games to tvOS with minimal effort.\nWith it being so easy to bring your game or app to this new platform, you should know that it can be profitable too. Opportunities exist for both F2P and premium apps and games to make money from Apple TV users.\nIf your F2P game or app is doing well, it won’t hurt to get a little extra ad revenue by putting your app or game on Apple TV. The real benefit is for developers seeking to release premium apps and games .\nHistorically, people seem to have no problem paying to see stuff on their televisions. Whether it’s extra channels, pay per view events or apps and games. There seems to be less resistance to shelling out for something that appears on TV.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Apple users are more likely to buy premium apps anyway. Paid apps make up 47% of the apps available for Apple TV. So some developers must have had success in this area already.\nWhat to Know Before Getting Started Before you get started on making your tvOS app, here are a few considerations to keep in mind.\nThe Big Screen Experience Using an app or playing a game on a TV screen is a different experience than using a phone or tablet. Make sure you understand the differences before you start making your app or game. If possible, try out the Apple TV for yourself and test some games and apps to see what works best.\nRemote Controls & How to Use Them All Apple TVs come with a remote that’s used for navigation. The main feature of the remote is a touch surface that works extensively with swipe gestures. It also features buttons for standard actions such as play/pause and volume up/down. You’ll need to consider if these navigation differences will affect the UX that your app or game provides.\nWill you need to change the user interface for your app or game to accommodate the remote? It’s an important factor to consider before porting your app or game to tvOS. The purpose of the remote control is to make navigation seamless. This means you need to straighten out any hitches in your UI before you target the platform. Keep Multiple Users in Mind As mentioned, the Apple TV creates a shared experience; just like a traditional television set. There’s no such thing as creating a tvOS app or game for just one person. You need to be aware that there may be multiple users viewing your app or game at any time.\nNo Local Storage tvOS apps have a maximum size of 200 MB and don’t make use of local storage. Instead, you need to stream app data from iCloud. Apps larger than 200MB can be packaged and loaded with On-Demand Resources . If you’re not a fan of a data-conscious approach, then tvOS apps mightn’t be for you.\ntvOS Development With V-Play You can develop apps and games for tvOS using the exact same V-Play workflow as you would for Android or iOS. You write your code in Qt Creator and deploy it from there to an Apple TV or simulator. Porting your existing games is easy too. tvOS support for V-Play uses the same API as the current SDK, so your game or app won’t change in any way when you port it to Apple TV.\n\nV-Play is yet to support touch input but it supports a range of swipe gestures on remote control. V-Play mapped these gestures to the up/down/left/right keys of a keyboard. This makes it possible to test your game or app on desktop before deploying to Apple TV.\nNativeutils are fully implemented for tvOS. This makes it possible to show native confirmation dialogs and input dialogs in your app or game. This feature is essential for providing your users with a native UX.\nV-Play added support for key events such as buttons and focus hints. This enables you to improve the UX of your app or game by making it easier for users to see which button is selected.\nYou can also add the Google Analytics plugin to your tvOS app or game in just a few minutes. See our documentation for more details on how to add this plugin with just a few lines of code.\ntvOS Example Game – One Card! V-Play has an example tvOS game on the App Store. V-Play released One Card! for iOS and Android but we were able to port it to tvOS with only minor additions to the source code.\nThe only change we needed to make was to add support for keyboard input (up, down, left, right, enter). We wanted this feature so it would be easy to test apps and games on desktop before deployment to Apple TV.\nAs there’s no point device available, we also added a focus hint for the currently active (selected) item, like the currently active card from the user’s stack or the selected menu item in the main menu.\nFinally, we added one of those shiny app icons with parallax effect, which are the essence of the Apple TV user experience All of these changes took less than a day. You can do the same with your V-Play games or apps!\n\nOne Card! uses V-Play Multiplayer , an all-in-one multiplayer component that adds the following features to your game:\nYou can use this open-source game example as the basis for all your multiplayer card games. You can access the free source code when you download V-Play .\n\nYou can download One Card! for tvOS here and view the source code in the V-Play SDK .\nYou can also play One Card! on Android and iOS devices Current V-Play developers can also find more info on One Card! in the V-Play documentation and the source code in the V-Play SDK here:\n  /Examples/V-Play/demos/OneCard/OneCard.pro",

      "text": "Apple’s director of AI research Russ Salakhutd has announced at a conference that the company’s machine-learning researchers will be free to publish their findings. This is an apparent reversal of Apple’s previous position. \nIt was suggested in October that Apple’s extreme secrecy was harming its prospects in AI … \nRefusing permission to publish was said to be keeping the company out of the loop and meaning that the best people in the field didn’t want to work for Apple. ‘Publish or die’ has long been a watchword in academia, with many researchers feeling they would no longer be part of the scientific community if unable to share their research with their peers. \nBusiness Insider noted a series of tweets from the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference in Barcelona, including the above slide. \nAnother reported challenge for Apple in AI has been its reluctance to use customer data for privacy reasons. Machine-learning generally relies on crunching large volumes of data which Apple, in many cases, does not collect as a matter of policy.",

By: PTI | New Delhi | Published: December 6, 2016 10:25 PM India is one of the fastest growing markets for the Cupertino-based company. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, Apple’s iPhone sales in India were up 51 per cent year-on-year. (Reuters) \nApple Inc officials today met Commerce Ministry top brass amid its plans to open stores in India without initially having to source components locally. \nAccording to sources, the meeting chaired by Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) Secretary Ramesh Abhishek lasted for almost an hour with senior officials from Apple discussing details of the new Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) rules in single-brand retail and the company’s retail expansion plans. \nApple officials are believed to have sought clarity on the changes in mandatory domestic sourcing norms for single brand retail brought in earlier this year. However, no official word on the meeting was received from either side. \nIn June this year, government had relaxed FDI norms by giving a three-year exemption from local sourcing to foreign players in single-brand retail and a five-year relaxation for ‘state-of-the-art’ and ‘cutting-edge’ technology. \nIndia is one of the fastest growing markets for the Cupertino-based company. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, Apple’s iPhone sales in India were up 51 per cent year-on-year. \n[You may also like to watch] \nIn May this year, Apple’s CEO Tim Cook had visited India and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as key industry leaders like Sunil Bharti Mittal and veteran banker Chanda Kocchar. \nApple had also announced setting up of a design and development accelerator to support Indian developers creating innovative applications for iOS and opened a new office in Hyderabad to accelerate maps development. \nCook during his May visit, had discussed issues including manufacturing and setting up retail stores in the country with Modi. \nThe FDI rules for single brand retail call for mandatory sourcing of at least 30 per cent inputs from domestic companies.

      "text": "\nAndri Koolme/Flickr \nApple is proud of the camera on its iPhones. \nOn Tuesday, Apple enlisted some pro photographers to provide some tips for using the iPhone 7 Plus, which can create some beautiful photographs. It's got a double lens, which enables it to create a cool blurry background for certain photographs, called \"bokeh.\" \nIf you'd like to hear more about the pro photographers Apple collected, look at their photographs, and read their advice, it's on Apple's newsroom blog . We've also collected the tips below: Get up close to your subject to bring out the details. Minimize the background to cut out the distractions from your subject. Try to find the shade and put the sun behind your subject as a nice back light. Pulling the exposure down just a hair can make images look more cinematic. When taking photos of animals, give your pup some space. Portrait mode uses the telephoto lens, so a distance of about eight feet away is recommended. Have treats ready. You'll get the best results when your subject isn't moving. Soft, diffused lighting will help with keeping the photo flattering to your subject. Find a space that isn't too busy or distracting, as Portrait mode will create a photo that really pops. ",

      "text": "| The Back Page \nJean-Louis Gassée has an excellent piece on the future of desktop and mobile operating systems . It includes some lore—including that time Apple tried to buy a a code dump of BeOS from Palm—and some interesting speculation on the future. Both are well worth your time, and it got me thinking about an old interview of Steve Jobs from the mid-1990s. \nHere are some highlights from Jean-Louis Gassée’s piece: \nAn ex-Apple acquaintance recently told me there are something like 10,000 “open” bugs on an on-going basis. The number that are urgent is, of course, a fraction of the gamut, but like any mature operating system, macOS has become a battlefield of patch upon patch upon patch. \n[…] \nAt the time that Apple’s smartphone project began, an Apple employee and former Be engineer offered Palm Inc. $800K for a BeOS “code dump” — just the code, no support, no royalties. The engineer was highly respected for his skill in mating software to unfamiliar hardware; BeOS was a small, light operating system; draw your own conclusion \n[…] \nA couple of friends of mine, unknown to each other, posited a scenario in which we carry our smartphone around with us and then, when we reach our office or home desk, plunk it down next to a large screen and keyboard+trackpad combo. The mobile device connects wirelessly and, presto, the comforts of desktop computing. Surely, they both said, this is just a matter of software and time. \nGo read it. It’s good. Steve’s Vision of Taking His Desktop with Him \nI’ll one-up Mr. Gassée here with something that has stuck with me for almost 20 years. It was an interview with Steve Jobs during his transition from NeXT back to Apple. The thing that struck me was him talking about the magic of logging into his NeXT desktop from any NeXT station. I mean the GUI, too, not just a command line. \nI’ve tried and tried to find that piece since, but can’t. It was with a mainstream publication that either went under or underwent so many overhauls the archives got hosed. If you recall it, drop a note in the comments. \nIt always seemed like a magical idea. Sure, this is essentially Unix at its heart, but true my-desktop-goes-with-me-anywhere-on-any-device is still little more than science fiction. With security being what it is, I am much more taken with the idea of hauling my desktop and its data with me—in my pocket—and accessing it like it was a proper Mac wherever I am. \nThink displays you can project or roll up and an interface that changes according to the task you are doing. Reading email? What we think of iOS is great. Doing research and writing? Give me a keyboard, mouse, display, and macOS, thank you. Being able to do either with the same device as your engine would be magical. What if One Device Served Up the OS You Needed? \nIt’s sort of the antithesis of Microsoft’s approach of making one operating system serve two masters—mobile and desktop. This is what Tim Cook called the ToasterFridge. Keeping the operating systems separate—like Apple has done—makes more sense to me. Being able to eventually serve them up from the same device seems even better. Still Alive? \nThis concept must surely still be alive at Apple. Clearly Apple didn’t pursue the so-called “thin client” model of the early 2000s that would have seen desktops being dished out by a server. But that vision Steve Jobs had of taking your desktop with you everywhere is surely cooking in the labs at Apple. \nIf so, when technology advances far enough to makes such dreams reality, we might see the reverse ToasterFridge: an Apple device that serves the proper operating system suited to our tasks, with all our data in one-central place—on that device. \nSuch a vision plays directly into Tim Cook’s approach to data security, and it dovetails with such far-fetched rumors as Apple working to port macOS to ARM processors. It’s also precisely the sort of leapfrogging Apple does so well. \nOne way or another, I hope this vision is alive at Apple. It’s definitely a future I’d embrace. Share this:",

      "text": "Severed for iOS review : A charming slasher where great timing is mandatory \nFor editorial picks in Canada, Drake’s One Dance took best song while Kaytranada’s 99.9% took best album. Best movies went to Deadpool (starring Canadian Ryan Reynolds) and Finding Nemo , which make for two rather opposite extremes. Canadian developer Drinkbox Studios’ Severed won best iPad game, while Saskatoon’s Noodle Cake Studios got runner up for Chameleon Run . Editorial pick for best iPhone app went to the popular photo tool Prisma , Clash Royale was awarded best iPhone game and Sketchbook Motion got best iPad app of the year. Scotiabank Giller Prize winner Madeleine Thien was awarded best book by the editors for Do Not Say We Have Nothing. \nBut what is always most interesting to see is consumer behaviour for the year and how Canadians spoke with their wallets throughout the 12 months. Here are the top downloaded lists in Canada for 2016, according to Apple: Songs Drake – One Dance (feat. Wizkid & Kyla) Lukas Graham – 7 Years Mike Posner – I Took a Pill in Ibiza (Seeb Remix) Twenty one pilots – Stressed Out Justin Bieber – Love Yourself Justin Timberlake – Can’t Stop the Feeling Sia – Cheap Thrills (feat. Sean Paul) Flo Rida – My House The Chainsmokers – Closer (feat. Halsey) Calvin Harris – This is What You Came For (feat. Rihanna) Albums ",

      "text": "  \nFacebook, Google, Apple and Clorox were listed among the best places to work for 2017, according to a Glassdoor survey released Wednesday. \nSilicon Valley companies in the top 10 of Glassdoor’s list included Menlo Park-based Facebook at No.2, Mountain View-based Alphabet unit Google at No. 4, Mountain View-based LinkedIn at No. 8 and San Jose-based Adobe Systems at No. 9. \nBoston-based Bain, an investment firm, was No. 1, Glassdoor reported . \nOther Bay Area companies on the list: Oakland-based Clorox made the list for the first time, and was ranked No. 12; San Francisco-based Salesforce was No. 17; Mountain View-based Intuit was No. 20; Santa Clara-based NVIDIA was No. 30; South San Francisco-based Genentech was No. 32; San Francisco-based Airbnb was No. 35; and Cupertino-based Apple was No. 36. \nAirbnb tumbled in the rankings all the way from No. 1 to No. 35. \nAmong high-profile companies located near the Bay Area: Modesto-based E & J Gallo Winery was No. 47. \n“Company culture and the employee experience are critical considerations for job seekers everywhere when deciding where to work,” said Robert Hohman, chief executive officer of Glassdoor. \nThe survey included comments from employees of the companies listed. \nIn the 2017 list, Facebook rose higher than its previous placement. The tech company had listed No. 5 in the 2016 survey. \n“From its openness to its diversity, Facebook has truly surpassed all tech companies in terms of culture, perks, and employee lifestyle,” said a Facebook software engineer. \nGoogle also rose in the new survey, after ranking No. 8 in the previous list by Mill Valley-based Glassdoor. \n“Smart people, data-driven decisions and culture, a mission I can feel good about when I go to sleep every night. This is as good as it gets,” a Google engineering manager said. \nLinkedIn dropped a bit in the 2017 list, having been ranked No. 6 in 2016. \n“They truly invest in the professional development of employees. Very proactive at making sure that you’re in a role you want to be in. Their benefits are fantastic,” said a LinkedIn product marketing manager. \nAdobe rose from the No. 19 spot in 2016. \n“People are very open, knowledgeable and potential for advancement is very much available,” an Adobe order management employee said. \nClorox was on the list for the first time and earned an average employee rating of 4.3. \n“Great learn and grow culture with emphasis on work life balance,” said a Clorox manager in Pleasanton. “The people are great and foster a mentoring environment.” \nApple fell considerably from its ranking of No. 25 in the 2016 survey. \n“Great pay and bonuses,” an Apple senior engineer said. “Excellent healthcare benefits and work environment.” \nGoogle, Apple and Bain are the only companies to have made the list all nine years since Glassdoor initiated the survey in 2008. \n“Employers where employees love to work continue to prove that they have a recruiting and business performance edge,” Glassdoor’s Hohman said.
