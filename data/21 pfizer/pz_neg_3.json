      "title": "Fitch Rates Pfizer's Notes Offering 'A+(exp)'; Outlook Stable",
      "text": "  15:53 PM EST Fitch Rates Pfizer's Notes Offering 'A+(exp)'; Outlook Stable Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+(EXP)' rating to Pfizer's senior unsecured notes offering. The net proceeds of the issuance will be used to fund the purchase of the company's 6.2% notes due March 15, 2019. \nFitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+(EXP)' rating to Pfizer's senior unsecured notes offering. The net proceeds of the issuance will be used to fund the purchase of the company's 6.2% notes due March 15, 2019. \nThe ratings apply to roughly $42.3 billion of debt outstanding at July 3, 2016. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. \nKEY RATING DRIVERS \nLittle Leverage Flexibility: Despite Fitch's expectation that Pfizer will continue to generate stable operating performance and significant free cash flow (FCF), leverage remains strained, stemming from acquisitions and share repurchases during the past two years. The company's net cash outlays for acquisitions and share repurchases were roughly $30.5 billion during the period (excluding the subsequent $14 billion acquisition of Medivation), while FCF was $7 billion. As a result, Pfizer currently has little-to-no flexibility to increase leverage further within the 'A+' rating category. \nStrategic Uncertainty Removed: Pfizer will retain its Global Established Pharmaceuticals (GEP) business for the time being. Fitch would view a divestiture as strategically positive for Pfizer, as it would narrow the company's focus on its higher margin, innovative portfolio. However, the company's business model would be more reliant on its innovative drug discovery efforts. Regardless, the decision removes the uncertainty regarding whether it would decrease debt subsequent to the spin. \nManageable Patent Expiries: The company's intermediate-term patent cliff is manageable. Over the next three years, roughly 18% of standalone Pfizer's drug portfolio is at risk of losing market exclusivity, including two of its five best-selling medicines - Lyrica (approximately 10% of total firm sales) and Enbrel (approximately 7%). The base patent for Enbrel expired internationally beginning in 2015. Pfizer does not have rights to Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada, but does receive modest royalty income from Amgen for sales in those regions. Lyrica's U.S. patent expires in late 2018. \nFitch does not expect that Enbrel will face as serious a competitive threat from generic alternatives as with traditional small molecules such as Lyrica. Enbrel is a biologic, and a generic biologic that is automatically interchangeable with Enbrel will not likely emerge. Therefore, Fitch expects competitive challengers will require significant research and marketing investments, making steep price discounts and drastic market share gains by competitors less likely. \nPipeline Successes: Helping to mitigate the anticipated revenue challenges from patent expiries, Pfizer has added new revenue sources over the past two years, including Ibrance/palbociclib (breast cancer), Trumenba (Neisseria meningitis vaccine), (Duavee (vasomotor symptoms of menopause), Adult Prevnar 13 (pneumococcal vaccine expanded use), Xeljanz (arthritis) and Bosulif (cancer). \nThe company is making progress with late-stage pipeline candidates, such as tafamidis (polyneuropathy), dacomitinib (lung cancer), inotuzumab (leukemia), tanezumab (pain) and avelumab (various cancers). Pfizer is conducting clinical trials that could expand the market of its marketed products by gaining approvals for their broader clinical use. Pfizer is also pursuing external pipeline projects through collaborations and acquisitions, such as its recent acquisition of Medivation. \nKEY ASSUMPTIONS \nFitch's key assumptions for Pfizer include: \n--Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth during 2016-2017 supported by newer product sales and manageable patent expiries; \n--Incrementally improving margins driven by new product sales mix and the achievement of $800 million in Hospira acquisition related cost savings; \n--Annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures minus dividends) of $6 billion to $7 billion during 2016-2017; \n--Leverage to decline to below 1.7x by 2017 through increased operational EBITDA or a combination of debt reduction and increased EBITDA. \nRATING SENSITIVITIES \nPositive: While Fitch does not anticipate a positive rating action in the near term, future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to such an action include: \n--If Pfizer maintains gross debt leverage in the range of 1.0x to 1.3x; \n--If the company sustains strong operational performance through the current patent cliff period, including relatively stable-to-positive trends in revenues, margins and FCF. \nNegative: Future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action include: \n--If Pfizer does not return to a sustainable gross debt leverage of 1.7x or lower. This could stem from marketplace pressures, adverse actions from regulatory bodies, unfavorable clinical developments or an aggressive capital deployment strategy; \n--If Pfizer pursues transactions (another large acquisition and/or significant share repurchases) that place pressure on gross leverage without the expectation of deleveraging in a timely manner. \nLIQUIDITY \nAdequate Liquidity: Fitch looks for Pfizer to maintain solid liquidity through strong FCF generation and ample access to the credit markets. FCF for the latest 12 months (LTM) ending July 3, 2016 was $6.2 billion. At the end of the period, Pfizer had approximately $20.9 billion in cash/short-term investments and full availability on its $7 billion revolver, maturing in November 2020. \nFitch views Pfizer's debt maturity schedule as manageable and expects the company to refinance the vast majority of its upcoming maturities with additional borrowings. Pfizer has approximately $3.7 billion of long-term debt maturing in 2016, $4.3 billion in 2017 and $2.3 billion in 2018. \nFULL LIST OF RATINGS \nFitch currently rates Pfizer as follows: \nPfizer Inc. \n--Short-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'F1'; \n--Commercial paper 'F1'; \nThe Rating Outlook is Stable. \nWyeth LLC \n--Senior unsecured notes 'A+'. \nDate of Relevant Committee: April 6, 2016 \nSummary of Financial Statement Adjustments - Financial statement adjustments that depart materially from those contained in the published financial statements of the relevant rated entity or obligor are disclosed below: \n--Historical and projected EBITDA are adjusted to add back non-cash stock based compensation. \nAdditional information is available on www.fitchratings.com \nApplicable Criteria \nCorporate Rating Methodology - Including Short-Term Ratings and Parent and Subsidiary Linkage - Effective from 17 August 2015 to 27 September 2016 (pub. 17 Aug 2015) \nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatory \nALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

      "text": "Health Rob Stein · NPR · Nov 13, 2016 Pfizer's Celebrex fared well in a safety study that compared the pain reliever with ibuprofen and naproxen. Bloomberg via Getty Images 3min 40sec \nA large study has produced reassuring evidence about a drug that millions of people use to alleviate pain from arthritis and other ailments. \nThe study found no evidence that the drug Celebrex , or generically, celecoxib, poses any greater risk for causing heart attacks and strokes than two other widely used pain relievers. \n\"What we found was surprising,\" says Steven Nissen , a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic who reported the results Sunday at an American Heart Association meeting in New Orleans. \nDoctors have been concerned about Celebrex for more than a decade because it is very similar to another pain reliever, Vioxx , which was pulled from the market in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks and strokes. \nCelebrex \"didn't share the risks that were seen with Vioxx,\" says Nissen, whose findings were also published online by the New England Journal of Medicine . \nNissen and other heart specialists cautioned that Celebrex can increase the chance of cardiovascular complications. But it doesn't appear to boost those odds nearly as much as Vioxx, or even as much as other painkillers thought to be safer. Both Vioxx and Celebrex are so-called Cox-2 inhibitors, which act by blocking an enzyme involved in inflammation. \nMoreover, the study suggests Celebrex may be less risky than other so-called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs , in other ways. For example, Celebrex appears to pose less of a risk of causing kidney problems. \n\"It is very reassuring,\" says Milton Packer , a cardiologist at Baylor University who was not involved in the study. \"I think what we'll see is a greater confidence in the use of drugs like Celebrex. I think people will turn to it now more frequently.\" \nBut others cautioned that all the drugs tested remain risky, especially for people with heart disease. \"It's reassuring that it's not as bad as Vioxx, but it's not a recommendation to take the medication,\" says Dr. Mary Norine Walsh , the president-elect of the American College of Cardiology. \nAfter Vioxx came on the market in 1999, it quickly became a blockbuster used by millions of people because it was designed to cause fewer gastrointestinal complications than existing NSAIDs. \nThe Food and Drug Administration allowed continued sales of Celebrex even though it was very similar. But the agency ordered Pfizer Inc ., the company marketing Celebrex, to study the drug's safety. In 2005, however, Pfizer withdrew Bextra, another Cox-2 inhibitor, at the FDA's request. \nCelebrex is used by an estimated 2 million Americans each year for arthritis, menstrual cramps and other aches and pains. \nThe new study involved 24,081 patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. One-third of the patients took Celebrex. One-third took prescription doses of ibuprofen. The remaining third took prescription naproxen. \nIbuprofen is sold over the counter in much lower doses as a generic and under a variety of brand names, including Advil and Motrin. Naproxen, also generic, is sold over the counter with various names, like Aleve and Naprosyn. \nHigher, prescription doses of ibuprofen and naproxen were more likely than Celebrex to cause digestive system problems, such as ulcers and bleeding, the researchers found. \nSpecifically, naproxen had a 1.5 percent risk of gastrointestinal complications, ibuprofen had a 1.6 percent risk, and Celebrex had a 1.1 percent risk in a 30-month period. \nThat wasn't a surprise. Celebrex and Vioxx were designed to be easier on the digestive system than the existing NSAIDs. But some other risks were surprising, Nissen says. \nCompared with Celebrex, patients taking ibuprofen were more likely to experience kidney problems, including kidney failure and the need for dialysis. \nSpecifically, there was a 1.1 percent risk of kidney complications among those taking ibuprofen for 30 months, versus a 0.7 percent risk among those taking Celebrex and a 0.9 percent risk among those taking naproxen, the researchers report. \nAll these drugs are known to carry some risks to kidney function, but the risk from ibuprofen was higher than expected, Nissen says. \nThere was also a hint that naproxen and ibuprofen may pose more of a risk of causing cardiovascular complications that Celebrex. Nissen stresses, however, that that finding was only borderline-statistically significant for ibuprofen. \nIn addition, there was an even weaker hint that naproxen might increase the risk for death for any reason, compared with Celebrex. But that wasn't statistically significant either. \nIt means those risks could have been statistical flukes. But they do warrant further investigation, he says. \n\"What is so surprising about it is that most authorities have believed that if there was a drug that was the safest, it was naproxen,\" Nissen says. \"So we were pretty surprised that there was this borderline significant increase in all-cause mortality with naproxen.\" \nCelebrex turned out to be the least likely of the three drugs to increase the risk for cardiovascular complications. The risk of dying, suffering a stroke or having a heart attack among patients taking Celebrex was 2.3 percent during a 30-month period, compared to 2.5 percent for naproxen and 2.7 percent for ibuprofen. \nNissen stresses that all the patients in the study took doses of these drugs available in the prescription formulation — not the much lower doses most people take when they buy them without a prescription and use them occasionally. \nThe maximum recommended over-the-counter dose of ibuprofen is typically 1,200 milligrams daily. The study used 600 milligrams of ibuprofen three times a day, or 1,800 milligrams daily. Naproxen tablets are sold over the counter at a dose of 220 milligrams, and are taken twice a day. The study used doses between 375 and 500 milligrams taken twice a day. \n\"I don't want the public to think that if you take an occasional ibuprofen or naproxen that you're going to have kidney failure or you're going to die,\" Nissen says. \"We didn't study that. We studied daily doses in arthritis patients [taking] ... high doses of these drugs.\" \nBut the findings should encourage people who need pain relief to take the lowest dose of the drugs for the shortest time possible. \n\"If you twist your knee and you hurt, I want people to take medicines for pain relief,\" Nissen says. \"But when they're better, try to get off the drugs and not take them every day and not take them in very high doses.\" \nOther doctors agreed. \n\"There's probably a risk of all of these drugs, especially at high doses,\" Packer says. \"The question is: If you need these drugs for pain, which is the safest? Right now, based on this study, it appears Celebrex has advantages.\" \nSeveral experts pointed out that the study has some flaws. The dose of Celebrex tested was relatively low, for example, and a significant number of subjects dropped out of the study, which raises questions about the reliability of the findings. ",

      "text": "For more than a decade, Pfizer’s blockbuster Celebrex has been nagged by the perception that extended use of the arthritis drug carried an increased risk for heart problems. It has outlasted its patent and a host of legal entanglements over the drug. But Pfizer declared that that perception turned out to be a myth that has been dispelled by new data.\nThe Precision study, which was conducted at the FDA’s request, found that Celebrex had no greater cardiovascular risks than the commonly prescribed ibuprofen or naproxen. On top of that, the patients taking Celebrex had fewer gastrointestinal issues than those taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The study was conducted on people who had osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis and were considered at high risk for cardiovascular disease.\nWhile the lead investigator acknowledged to the Wall Street Journal limitations to the study, the drug giant pulled out its top gun to announce the results.\n“The study demonstrated that patients treated with prescription doses of celecoxib, ibuprofen or naproxen had similar rates of cardiovascular events and dispels the long held perception of excess cardiovascular risk associated with long term use of Celebrex,” Pfizer CEO Ian Read said today in a statement.\nMore specifically, the study found that 2.3% of patients taking Celebrex had cardiovascular episodes compared to 2.5% of those taking naproxen and 2.7% getting ibuprofen. Serious gastrointestinal events affected 1.1% of those on Celebrex compared to 1.5% and 1.6% of those taking naproxen ibuprofen respectively.\nSome researchers pointed out that doctors could give patients no greater than a 200 mg dose of Celebrex while they were free to give comparably higher doses of the others. They told WSJ that may have skewed the results in favor of Celebrex. But lead investigator Dr. Steven E. Nissen, of the Cleveland Clinic, said he thought that was a “red herring.”\nThe long, painful saga of Celebrex started back in 2004 when its rep was tainted by a similar drug. Merck's ($MRK) Vioxx and Pfizer's Bextra were pulled from the market when serious heart risks were found. The FDA then added additional warnings to other so-called Cox-2 inhibitors, including Celebrex, leading to a domino effect.\nLawsuits by patients and shareholders accused Pfizer of hiding the increased heart risks, leading the drug maker to pay out millions of dollars, including one class action suit settled just last August over Vioxx and another Pfizer drug, Bextra.\nPfizer made lots of money on the drug nonetheless. It generated nearly $3 billion in 2013 sales before generics hit in late 2014 and started eating away at its revenues. Celebrex in the U.S. brought in $833,000 last year.",

      "title": "Stocks Open Higher; Early Risers: Pfizer, Harman, Mentor Graphics",
      "text": "Stocks traded mixed Monday, as bonds took a steep drop and merger news gave premarket action a stir.\nDow industrials climbed 0.3%, hitting a fresh all-time high. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% and the Nasdaq fell a fraction.\nLast week's rally shifted the market onto more bullish footing, leaving the Nasdaq down 1.4% and the S&P 500 down less than 1% so far in the fourth quarter and initiating a healthier buying environment for investors .\nEarly Movers: Pfizer, Akamai, Harman, Mentor Graphics Earnings reports continued to roll out, with Transdigm ( TDG ), India's Tata Motors ( TTM ) and China's Autohome ( ATHM ) all in motion after early reports. But news on several mergers, and continued adjustment to the changed political environment drove the heaviest portion of trade.\nHarman International ( HAR ) cranked up a 25% gain Monday, after South Korean smart phone maker Samsung confirmed Monday it had agreed to pay $8 billion in cash for the Stamford, Conn.-based company. Harman is a leading audio components and automotive infotainment systems maker. Harman ended Friday's session 4% below a 90.91 buy point in a flat base .\nDigi International ( DGII ) spiked 17% in early action. Cable maker Belden ( BDC ) announced Saturday it bid $380 million to acquire the maker of electronic connectivity components. Digi confirmed on Monday it rejected the offer, saying it undervalued the company. Digi surged 22% last week on takeover speculation. The stock has been corralled in a range of 6 to 18 for more than a decade. Belden shares were up nearly 3%.\nMentor Graphics ( MENT ) vaulted 18%. The design automation software developer confirmed it would be acquired by Germany's Siemens ( SIEGY ) in a $4.5 billion cash deal. Siemens expects $100 million in earnings before interest and taxes within four years, and projects a closing by the second quarter of next year. Siemens shares were flat.\nPfizer ( PFE ) fell less than 1%. Drugmakers soared broadly last week, rebounding as investors recalculated the positives in a Donald Trump presidency vs. Hillary Clinton, who was expected to target drugmakers for tighter regulatory control.\nOn the IBD 50 list, Gigamon ( GIMO ) added 1% in premarket trade. The network performance gear maker is eyeing new highs and is extended from its second rebound off a support level since a breakout in June.\nAmong other leading stocks, Akamai Technologies ( AKAM ) edged up a fraction. The stock is extended above a 56.15 cup-with-handle buy point.\nFed Speaks, Oil Slips, Bonds Take a Tumble The week's busy economic calendar gets off to a slow start Monday, with no significant data set for release until Tuesday. Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan speaks at 1:20 p.m. ET, followed by Jeffrey Lacker of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank and the San Francisco Fed Bank's John Williams after the close. A week that is jam-packed with Federal Reserve commentary includes Chairwoman Janet Yellen's testimony before Congress on Thursday.\nOil futures lost ground, with West Texas Intermediate trading down more than 1% to below $43 a barrel. Oil prices are now trading below their 200-day moving average, and threatening to undercut a Sept. 23 low.\nGold dipped a fraction to near $1,223 an ounce. Copper jumped more than 2%, continuing the rally that began in late October. The dollar climbed and bonds dropped hard as markets reopened after Friday's break for Veterans Day, sending the 10-year yield up 10 basis points to 2.25%.",

      "text": "Pitt, Pfizer team up on health data analytics They will develop a model for brain imaging-genetic study of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia University of Pittsburgh Print E-Mail \nPITTSBURGH--The University of Pittsburgh and biopharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. have announced a partnership to develop a computational model that will help identify the drivers of schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and related brain diseases and enable researchers to better understand and treat the diseases. \nKayhan Batmanghelich , assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at Pitt's School of Medicine, will be the principal investigator in the one-year study. The goal of the study is to develop a statistical model that relates abnormal anatomical variations of brain structure to the underlying genetic markers of the diseases in order to develop an algorithm that explains causal relationships between such heterogeneous data, and to be able to use the method in similar settings for precision medicine. \nIn addition to the genotype data, measurements from magnetic resonance brain images will be used to characterize abnormal brain variations. \n\"By studying brain images and relating the variations of each brain region to the genetics and clinical observations of patients, we provide deeper insight about the underlying biology of the diseases,\" said Batmanghelich. \nThe study will use the publicly available datasets of ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) and private datasets of the GENUS (Genetics of Endophenotypes of Neurofunction to Understand Schizophrenia) Consortium, both of which contain images, genetic information, biological information, and clinical observations of patients, to develop software that can be used to associate the images with gene patterns. \n\"The exciting thing about this type of translational research with Pfizer is that it expands the research impact of what we do at Pitt, inclusively involves participation across our campus, and meets the core missions of both our University and industry partner,\" said Donald Taylor, assistant vice chancellor for commercial translation in the health sciences at Pitt. \"Discovering the relationship between the disease status and the results of imaging and genetic positions to search for undiscovered variables in images and DNA also leverages our core commercial translation themes in precision medicine, brain health, and digital health. We wouldn't be able to do this specific research without an industry partner, and we're thrilled to have Pfizer's collaboration.\" ### \nDisclaimer:  ",

      "text": "Novartis’ Cosentyx and Celgene’s Otezla aren’t just battling it out in the psoriasis arena. As of early this year, they’re competing in psoriatic arthritis, too—and each drugmaker made its case this week with new data in that disease.\nCosentyx can steadily improve the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis—including patient-reported pain—over three years, Novartis said at the American College of Rheumatology’s (ACR) annual meeting. Long-term follow-up data from a previously reported study showed that 77% of patients hit the target “20” mark on the ACR’s response scale at the three-year mark.\nOtezla, meanwhile, showed that it could hit its own 20 mark in a Phase IIIb trial. The med significantly upped the proportion of patients to achieve a 20 response at week 16 when compared with placebo in patients who hadn’t yet received a biologic therapy.\nWith the psoriasis space already teeming with next-gen treatments, more and more drugmakers are chasing psoriatic arthritis indications to help them get ahead. And while Otezla’s competition may have a leg up in the efficacy department—England’s cost watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, last month declared that Celgene’s product was “a less effective treatment” than existing rivals—it has its own distinguishing feature. It’s the only pill in a sea of new-age injectable treatments, one fact that prompted NICE to recommend the drug for routine NHS use.\nOne drugmaker is skipping the crowded psoriasis track altogether and going straight to psoriatic arthritis : Pfizer, whose Xeljanz also came up big in studies presented at ACR. Both trials—which enrolled patients who had fully responded to conventional disease-modifying drugs or to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors—met their primary endpoints , the pharma giant said.\nMeanwhile, Novartis is looking to take on the old-guard blockbusters in addition to its newcomer nemeses. It plans to start up head-to-head trials comparing Cosentyx with the world’s best-selling med, AbbVie’s Humira, in both psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.",

      "title": "Pfizer's vaccine ad is a blast from the past",
      "text": "Pfizer's vaccine ad is a blast from the past Pharma company \"derives\" a nostalgic ad from a hit 1970s Hong Kong movie.   \nHONG KONG - A deadly disease before medical science gifted a vaccine to humanity, pneunomia has provided a plot device for generations of period-film directors to create dramatic death-bed scenes filled with violent coughing. But it does not always have to be so morbid when a character from an old movie reenacts a coughing fit, as a new piece of marketing for Pfizer shows. \nTargeting people aged 65 and above, the company, together with agency partner Secret Tour Hong Kong, has resurrected a rather comedic coughing sequence from 1970s Cantonese classic The House of 72 Tenants in order to promote its pneumonia vaccine, Prevenar 13. Pak Gu, the queen bee landlady character in the movie, will not be invited to a much-anticipated party unless she gets a shot of the vaccine. \nStephen Chung, creative partner at Secret Tour , said in a statement that the campaign paves a path for 'derivative' work in Hong Kong. \"While the local creative industry has started to recreate classic works of the olden times by mimicking the tone, costume and dialogues, some copyright owners regard such acts as violation of copyright laws and disrespect of the original work,\" said Chung. \"Seeking a way out, this campaign demonstrates a success of balancing the interests of both parties with maximum effectiveness to arouse audience attention.\" \nThe campaign, which is being run on YouTube and carried on the social-media pages of local dailies Apple Daily and Ming Pao, received favourable reviews from netizens since its launch last week. The video posted on the Facebook page of Apple Daily has received over 151,000 views. Many viewers said the movie was their parents' favourite, and some mused about the good old days when the community vibe was much more lively in Hong Kong. A screening of the orginal movie, sponsored by Pfizer, will be held next month. \nCampaign's view: The clever puns littering the reworked script of the ad, starting from its title, are hilarious and will no doubt be appreciated by the Cantonese-speaking target audience. Pfizer has been spot on in getting the right medium to address the target audience. Moviegoers are likely to form a strong emotional attachment with a favourite film for a long, long time, so the ad will resonate well with baby boomers who have fond memories of watching the movie.

The growth is mainly due to Xeljanz’s high efficacy as a monotherapy and increasing brand awareness. Xeljanz is also included in the guidelines for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (or RA) by the American College of Rheumatology. \nThe launch of Xeljanz XR (extended release Xeljanz) helped boost the drug’s sales in 2016. To know more about these trends, please refer to Xeljanz ER Is Driving Growth for Pfizer This Year . \nWall Street analysts have projected that Xeljanz’s revenues will rise year-over-year about 67.5%, from $523.0 million in 2015 to $876.0 million in 2016. \nIf Xeljanz manages to surpass this revenue target, it may boost Pfizer’s share price as well as shares of the iShares Core High Dividend ( HDV ). Pfizer makes up about 5.0% of HDV’s total portfolio holdings. Market expansion \nOn March 23, 2016 , the EMA (European Medicines Agency) accepted for review Xeljanz’s application for regulatory approval as a therapy for RA patients who don’t respond sufficiently or are unable to tolerate methotrexate. This application includes additional data based on the oral development program. The data further establish the efficacy and safety of Xeljanz. Pfizer expects a positive response from the EMA. \nIn 2017, Pfizer plans to file an application with the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) to seek approval for Xeljanz as a therapy for ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis. These developments are expected to enable Pfizer to pose strong competition to other I&I players such as AbbVie ( ABBV ), Celgene ( CELG ), and Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ). \nIn the next part of this series, we’ll explore the growth prospects of crisaborole, an investigational drug.

      "text": "Pfizer Inc. ( PFE - Free Report ) announced that detailed results of phase III PALOMA-2 study evaluating the combination of its breast cancer drug Ibrance (palbociclib) and Novartis AG’s ( NVS - Free Report ) Femara (letrozole) for the treatment of first-line ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer were published in The New England Journal of Medicine .\n\nIn the study, it was seen that a combination of Ibrance and Femara led to an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), or the time before tumor growth, by more than 10 months compared with Femara plus placebo. In other words, the study demonstrated median PFS for women treated with Ibrance plus Femara of 24.8 months, compared with 14.5 months on the Femara -placebo combination arm, indicating a 42% reduction in the risk of disease progression. PALOMA-2 had enrolled a total of 666 women from 186 global sites in 17 countries. We remind investors that this data was presented at the 52nd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June.\n\nOn the basis of the phase II PALOMA-1 study, Ibrance was approved under accelerated approval in Feb 2015 for use in combination with Femara for the treatment of post-menopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+, HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer who did not received previous systemic treatment for their disease. Pfizer believes that the PALOMA-2 confirmatory trial has proven the clinical benefit of the combination therapy and should help the company obtain continued approval in the U.S in this indication.\n\nA supplemental New Drug Application to support the conversion of the accelerated approval into a regular approval based on the PALOMA-2 results has been submitted to the FDA.\n\nEarlier this year, the FDA approved a label expansion for Ibrance to include the treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with AstraZeneca plc’s ( AZN - Free Report ) Faslodex in patients whose disease has progressed following endocrine therapy.\n\nMeanwhile, the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has rendered a positive opinion on the approval of Pfizer’s marketing authorization for Ibrance for the treatment of women with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Presently, Ibrance is approved in over 50 countries.\n\nIbrance has been off to a strong start, having registered sales of $1.5 billion in the second half of 2016 compared with $0.4 million in the year-ago period. The drug’s label and geographical expansion would boost its commercial potential significantly. Going forward, we expect investor focus to remain on the commercialization and sales ramp-up of Ibrance.\nPFIZER INC Price \n \n\nPFIZER INC Price | PFIZER INC Quote \nZacks Rank & Key Picks \nPfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": "Pfizer Inc. ( PFE - Free Report ) announced that detailed results of phase III PALOMA-2 study evaluating the combination of its breast cancer drug Ibrance (palbociclib) and Novartis AG’s ( NVS - Free Report ) Femara (letrozole) for the treatment of first-line ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer were published in The New England Journal of Medicine .\nIn the study, it was seen that a combination of Ibrance and Femara led to an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), or the time before tumor growth, by more than 10 months compared with Femara plus placebo. In other words, the study demonstrated median PFS for women treated with Ibrance plus Femara of 24.8 months, compared with 14.5 months on the Femara -placebo combination arm, indicating a 42% reduction in the risk of disease progression. PALOMA-2 had enrolled a total of 666 women from 186 global sites in 17 countries. We remind investors that this data was presented at the 52nd American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in June.\nOn the basis of the phase II PALOMA-1 study, Ibrance was approved under accelerated approval in Feb 2015 for use in combination with Femara for the treatment of post-menopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+, HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer who did not received previous systemic treatment for their disease. Pfizer believes that the PALOMA-2 confirmatory trial has proven the clinical benefit of the combination therapy and should help the company obtain continued approval in the U.S in this indication.\nA supplemental New Drug Application to support the conversion of the accelerated approval into a regular approval based on the PALOMA-2 results has been submitted to the FDA.\nEarlier this year, the FDA approved a label expansion for Ibrance to include the treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with AstraZeneca plc’s ( AZN - Free Report ) Faslodex in patients whose disease has progressed following endocrine therapy.\nMeanwhile, the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has rendered a positive opinion on the approval of Pfizer’s marketing authorization for Ibrance for the treatment of women with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Presently, Ibrance is approved in over 50 countries.\nIbrance has been off to a strong start, having registered sales of $1.5 billion in the second half of 2016 compared with $0.4 million in the year-ago period. The drug’s label and geographical expansion would boost its commercial potential significantly. Going forward, we expect investor focus to remain on the commercialization and sales ramp-up of Ibrance.\nPFIZER INC Price\nPFIZER INC Price | PFIZER INC Quote:\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\nPfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Cambrex Corp. ( CBM - Free Report ) , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "text": "A few years ago, emerging markets were souped-up engines heating up pharma growth. Now, with economic slowdowns in key markets such as China, they’ve moved into a lower gear—but in the third quarter, drugmakers saw signs of an upward shift, at least in the short term.\nEmerging markets growth for Big Pharma’s top companies ticked upward to 3.6% in Q3, Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson wrote in a Wednesday note to investors. That’s up from 1.8% in Q2 , if down slightly from the first quarter, when growth amounted to 4.4%.\nThis means that emerging markets growth is leading the way again, ahead of U.S. and the rest of the developed world at 2.3% and 0.9% for the group, respectively.\n“In our view, drug companies should continue to invest to ensure they capture share in the longer-term, gradual, yet inevitable shift from older off-patent medicines to more lucrative, novel, on-patent medicines,” Anderson noted.\nAnd while the emerging markets may not be as hot as they were, they’ll still account for about 25% of global drug spending by 2020, QuintilesIMS said in a report last November. And per-capita script volume and drug spending in all the “pharmerging markets” are expected to grow between now and then, at average rates of 45%-plus. Part of that spending growth, the report noted, will come from broader use of new, on-patent meds that naturally cost more per patient—and deliver more sales per script.\nPfizer tops growth list; GSK trails\nOf course, some multinational drugmakers saw higher growth than others, as acquisitions, new products and marketing initiatives paid off. Pfizer, for instance, posted 8% growth over the past four quarters, thanks to its Hospira acquisition and its growth in sterile injectable drugs. More growth could be coming as well; Pfizer recently restored its vaccines unit in China after authorities finally approved its pneumococcal vaccine Prevenar 13, a big seller in other countries. And in June, the pharma giant said it would build a $350 million biosimilars plant in the country.\nPfizer’s fellow Big Pharmas have been pushing for faster approval of their new-to-market drugs, particularly in China, where Gilead Sciences and AstraZeneca have tapped new executives and partners to push approvals and production on the ground. While it waits for broader approval, Merck & Co.'s immuno-oncology med Keytruda won an import license for China's resort island Hainan under a government program designed to draw medical tourists .\nAmgen and Sanofi, meanwhile, suffered setbacks in their attempts to bring new products Repatha and Dengvaxia to India; both companies lost their bids for clinical trial waivers that would have allowed them to launch in that country without local clinical trials.\nMeanwhile, GlaxoSmithKline, very active in the developed world, delivered the slowest emerging markets growth among its rivals over the past four quarters, at 0.4%, Anderson calculated. Its China sales outpaced the rest, however, at 24%, partly in thanks to inventory stocking.\nGSK’s growth may be impressive of late, but it’s also having trouble with China’s drug gatekeepers, with recent decisions emblematic of pricing challenges other pharma companies face there, too. In May, China slashed the price of the antiviral drug Viread, marketed by GSK in that country, by two-thirds, and cut AstraZeneca’s lung cancer pill Iressa back by half.\nPrice caps on older meds\nAnd for off-patent drugs, the cuts could be more severe, in China and beyond, Anderson wrote. Some sources say off-patent meds account for more than 50% of multinational drug company sales in these countries, he noted.\n“One risk to appreciate ... is that off-patent drugs are likely to see increased pricing pressure over time as emerging markets healthcare delivery modernizes,” the analyst said.\nIt’s certainly happening in India, where the government is not only working on revamping its entire pharma regulatory framework , but expanding its list of drugs subject to price caps . Last December, the country’s health ministry expanded its list of essential medicines, which are subject to price controls, by adding 100 new drugs.\nSanofi’s managing director in India, for one, has spoken out against India’s pricing policies, which come at a time when the country is tightening up its quality standards . “Any pricing regime must be predictable and transparent,” Shailesh Ayyangar said during the unit’s general meeting in May, “and must take into consideration the stringent requirements on the quality front that the manufacturers have to adhere to for patient safety.”",

      "text": "Better Buy: Eli Lilly and Co vs. Pfizer \nEli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) are two of the most widely recognized dividend-paying Big Pharma stocks in the world. However, these two elite drugmakers appear to be on drastically different trajectories, thanks to their varying strategies in dealing with a spate of fairly recent patent expirations. With this in mind, let's consider which of these dividend stocks is the better long-term buy right now. Battle of Dividends: McDonald's Corporation vs. PepsiCo Inc. \nMcDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) have both been known as excellent dividend stocks for decades. McDonald's has paid a dividend each and every year since 1976, and Pepsi has paid dividends for 44 years straight. What's more, both companies are known for religiously increasing their dividends annually. But which stock's dividend is better? ×",

Please send the good word—or the bad—from your shop to Eric Sagonowsky or Angus Liu , and we will feature it here at the end of each week.\nSyntimmune appoints Boehringer, Pfizer alum David de Graaf CEO\nSyntimmune\nDavid de Graaf joins as CEO.\nNew York-based Syntimmune recently took in the final $8 million of the total $26 million for its Series A and named, at the same time, a partner from Apple Tree Partners—which co-led the company’s first round of financing—as its CEO. David de Graaf , the newly appointed Syntimmune CEO, also happens to have much experience in the biopharma industry, having held leadership titles at Boehringer Ingelheim, Pfizer and AstraZeneca. De Graaf will be leading the company in advancing its lead clinical candidate, SYNT001, which targets IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases by blocking FcRn-IgG interactions. FierceBiotech article\nGilead promotes James Meyers to EVP of worldwide commercial operations\nGilead\nJames Meyers is promoted to EVP.\nGilead has promoted James Meyers , its SVP of North American commercial operations since 2007, to EVP of worldwide commercial operations. He will be responsible for the company’s commercial operations in North America, Europe and Japan. The appointment came just days after Gilead released its lackluster third quarter figures. Even though its HIV meds performed well, sales for the hepatitis C blockbusters plummeted more than 30 percent for the quarter. Jumping ship from AstraZeneca, Meyers joined Gilead in 1996 first as a regional sales director. During his 20 years at Gilead, he has been crucial in the company’s launches of products in HIV, oncology, cardiovascular, respiratory and liver diseases.

      "text": "By: Pfizer Inc. via Business Wire News Releases November 18, 2016 at 14:55 PM EST Pfizer Announces Pricing of Tender Offer for Any and All of its 6.200% Senior Notes Due March 15, 2019 Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) (the “Company”) today announced the pricing of the previously announced tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 6.200% Senior Notes due March 15, 2019 listed in the table below (the “Notes”). \nPfizer Inc. ( NYSE:PFE ) (the “ Company ”) today announced the pricing of the previously announced tender offer (the “ Tender Offer ”) to purchase for cash any and all of its outstanding 6.200% Senior Notes due March 15, 2019 listed in the table below (the “ Notes ”). \nTitle of Tender Offer Consideration (as defined below) calculated on the basis of pricing for the U.S. Treasury Reference Security as of 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 18, 2016. \nThe Tender Offer is being made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, dated November 14, 2016, and the related letter of transmittal and notice of guaranteed delivery (as they may each be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “ Tender Offer Documents ”), to purchase for cash any and all of the Notes. The Company refers investors to the Tender Offer Documents for the complete terms and conditions of the Tender Offer. \nThe “ Tender Offer Consideration ” listed in the table above for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer was determined in the manner described in the Tender Offer Documents by reference to a fixed spread for the Notes (the “ Fixed Spread ”) specified in the table above plus the yield based on the bid-side price of the U.S. Treasury Reference Security specified in the table above at 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 18, 2016. \nHolders also will receive accrued and unpaid interest on Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase from the last interest payment date up to, but not including, the date the Company initially makes payment for such Notes, which date is anticipated to be November 21, 2016 (the “ Settlement Date ”). \nInformation Relating to the Tender Offer \nCitigroup Global Markets Inc. is the dealer manager for the Tender Offer. Investors with questions regarding the Tender Offer may contact Citigroup Global Markets Inc. at (800) 558-3745 (toll-free) or (212) 723-6106 (collect). Global Bondholder Services Corporation is the depositary and information agent for the Tender Offer and can be contacted at (866) 470-4300 (toll-free) or (212) 430-3774 (collect). \nNone of the Company or its affiliates, their respective boards of directors, the dealer manager, the depositary and information agent or the trustee with respect to the Notes is making any recommendation as to whether holders should tender any Notes in response to the Tender Offer, and neither the Company nor any such other person has authorized any person to make any such recommendation. Holders must make their own decision as to whether to tender any of their Notes, and, if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender. \nThis press release is for informational purposes only and is not an offer to buy, or the solicitation of an offer to sell, any of the Notes and the Tender Offer does not constitute an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell Notes in any jurisdiction or in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation are unlawful. The full details of the Tender Offer, including complete instructions on how to tender Notes, are included in the Tender Offer Documents. Holders are strongly encouraged to read carefully the Tender Offer Documents, including materials incorporated by reference therein, because they will contain important information. The Tender Offer Documents may be downloaded from Global Bondholder Services Corporation’s website at http://www.gbsc-usa.com/pfizer/ or obtained from Global Bondholder Services Corporation, free of charge, by calling toll-free at (866) 470-4300 (bankers and brokers can call collect at (212) 430-3774). \nAbout Pfizer \nAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

Such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “will,” “may,” “could,” “likely,” “ongoing,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “target,” “forecast,” “goal,” “objective,” “aim” and other words and terms of similar meaning or by using future dates in connection with any discussion of, among other things, expectations regarding the pricing, expiration and settlement of the Tender Offer. A list and description of risks, uncertainties and other matters can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended April 3, 2016, July 3, 2016 and October 2, 2016, in each case including in the sections thereof captioned “Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results” and “Risk Factors,” and in our Current Reports on Form 8-K. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. \nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of anticipated results is subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements, and you are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports and our other filings with the SEC.

      "text": ", an antifungal drug from Pfizer. \"> Ajanta Launches Antifungal Drug Voriconazole NOVEMBER 21, 2016 Krystle Vermes Ajanta has launched voriconazole tablets in 50-mg and 200-mg doses in the US market. These tablets are the equivalent generic version of Vfend , an antifungal drug from Pfizer. Vfend is used to treat conditions such as invasive aspergillosis, candidemia, and serious infections caused by Scedosporium apiospermum and Fusarium species, including Fusarium solani , when other treatments are ineffective. Pfizer has also launched Vfend on the market in 50-mg and 200-mg doses. However, there is also an injectable version containing 200-mg of voriconazole, as well. Vfend is not recommended in patients who are pregnant or nursing. It has not been studied in pediatric patients, meaning its safety and efficacy for these individuals remains unestablished. The most common adverse effects associated with Vfend are visual disturbances, fever, nausea, rash, vomiting, chills, and headache. Some patients also experienced tachycardia and hallucinations. The manner in which the medication is used for treatment depends on the condition of the patient. Those with invasive aspergillosis and serious fungal infections may need to receive Vfend immediately and continue receiving it for 7 days. Individuals with candidemia might need to be treated for a minimum of 14 days. These variations should be considered by patients and their physicians.",

      "text": "Welcome to the first edition of our FiercePharmaAsia weekly wrap-up. Scientists led by oncologist Lu You at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China, have beaten out several U.S. academics and biotechs to become the first to test CRISPR-Cas9 in humans. GlaxoSmithKline ’s bribery scandal in China has not settled down yet as private investigator couple Peter Humphrey and Yu Yingzeng have sued the company for misleading them about an investigation of a suspected whistleblower. Pfizer and AstraZeneca did best in emerging markets, especially with smooth operations in China, while Big Pharma together enjoyed an optimistic 3.6% growth in that market in Q3. Takeda is carrying out a 20,000-patient Phase III study in Asia and Latin America for its dengue vax candidate, which an exec says demonstrates a unit with a \"global footprint.\" Japan has slashed the price of Bristol-Myers Squibb ’s Opdivo in half. Japanese API maker Sekisui Medica l was hit with an FDA warning letter because of data integrity problems.\n1. Chinese scientists become first to test CRISPR in humans, as ‘Sputnik 2.0’ begins As reported in Nature, Chinese scientists led by oncologist Lu You at Sichuan University in Chengdu injected modified cells using CRISPR into a patient with a form of lung cancer at the West China Hospital, beating out U.S. academics and biotechs to become the first in testing new gene editing tech known as CRISPR-Cas9 in humans. “I think this is going to trigger ‘Sputnik 2.0’, a biomedical duel on progress between China and the United States, which is important since competition usually improves the end product,” said Dr. Carl June, who is also being sponsored to research on CRISPR.\n2. Private eyes imprisoned in China sue GSK for bribery-scandal damages Years removed from a bruising bribery scandal in China, GlaxoSmithKline seems to be gradually stepping out from that dark shadow. But private investigator couple Peter Humphrey and Yu Yingzeng, whom GSK hired to investigate a whistleblower about the bribery, have filed a lawsuit in a U.S. federal court alleging that the company had misled them about the case, ultimately leading to their imprisonment.\n3. Pfizer, AstraZeneca outpace Big Pharma in emerging markets as growth ticks upward A few years ago, emerging markets were powerful engines heating up pharma growth. Even though they have slowed down because of economic environments in key markets such as China, Big Pharma still enjoyed a 3.6% growth in that market in Q3, up from 1.8% in Q2. Pfizer has been taking the lead with 8% growth over the past four quarters, thanks to the Hospira acquisition and growth in sterile injectable drugs. The company could see more growth as it recently got approval in China for its well-received pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar 13. AstraZeneca is also doing well, with new exec hires and partnerships to push approvals and production. GlaxoSmithKline, on the other hand, is falling behind.\n4. Takeda's hefty dengue PhIII displays a vaccine unit with new 'global footprint,' exec says Takeda is taking its experimental dengue vaccine into a massive, 20,000-patient Phase III study in Asia and Latin America. To get there, however, the company’s vax unit has had to expand its global footprint. If approved, the vaccine will pose some challenges to Sanofi’s Dengvaxia, whose sales are falling behind initial estimates.\n5. Japan cuts Opdivo price in half as costs surge After Japan's prime minister weighed in, officials in Japan have halved the price of Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo in the country, taking the cut more than a year ahead of the med’s regularly scheduled price review. The cut is more dramatic compared with the health officials' original plan for 25%. The med’s price in Japan runs twice its U.S. tag and more than five times than in the U.K.\n6. Japanese API maker Sekisui Medical hit with FDA warning letter For the second time in recent weeks, the FDA has handed a Japanese API maker a warning letter, this time predominantly for data integrity problems at Sekisui Medical. The FDA discovered the company was not keeping results of failed tests.",

      "text": "Pfizer has faced scrutiny for its drug pricing over the last year, but now it’s bringing some heat of its own to protect those numbers from prying eyes. The pharma giant last week sued a Texas agency, claiming officials there illegally leaked its private drug-pricing info.\nAfter public information requests, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission sent private pricing and rebate info to the chair of the Texas Senate Health and Human Services Committee and the chair of the Texas Senate Finance Committee, Pfizer said in a new lawsuit . That's a violation of state law, the company contends.\nAn HHSC spokesperson said the agency is \"aware of the suit and will respond at the appropriate time.\"\nPfizer itself keeps a tight lid on pricing information, even shielding the details from most of its own employees, according to the lawsuit. If discounts are made public—particularly larger discounts often given to state agencies—other payers might demand the same deal.\nIt's a serious matter for the drug giant because it operates in a “fiercely competitive” industry where “small differences in pricing and rebates can make the difference between success and failure,” Pfizer says. One way companies get ahead in the industry is to look for “efficiencies and cost savings.”\nIf the pricing info were leaked to competitors, the New York-based pharma could be at a disadvantage “in a highly competitive marketplace and in competitive bidding situations,” the suit states.\nFurther, private pricing details help keep costs low for agencies such as Texas Medicaid, Pfizer says. That’s in part because, if the info were public, “the purpose of competitive bidding would be defeated.\"\nPfizer seeks a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief in the action. The company wasn’t notified when the pricing information was released, it says. HHSC’s actions “created a situation that is capable of repetition, but evading review.”\nThe agency will continue the practice unless told otherwise by a court, according to the company.\nFor its part, Pfizer has had a role in the larger, ongoing drug pricing conversation that's had a hold on the industry for more than a year now. Following big price hikes by Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Turing Pharmaceuticals, which initially stoked the flames, Pfizer raised the prices on more than 100 drugs on January 1. Separately, a Senate committee in June took the company and others to task over the rising costs of naloxone, which is used to reverse the effects of opioids.",

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) \nPfizer will consolidate its research and development operations in the St. Louis region into a new $200 million facility in Chesterfield. \nThe pharmaceutical giant has operations in the Missouri Research Park in Weldon Spring and on Monsanto’s Chesterfield research campus, where it leases space from the agriculture company. Pfizer plans to keep its existing workforce of 450 jobs in the St. Louis region and hire about 80 more people over the next several years. \nConstruction firm Clayco and its development subsidiary CRG will begin building the new campus at 875 Chesterfield Parkway by the middle of 2017. When construction is complete around 2020, Pfizer will lease the new space from Clayco and CRG. \nIncluding about 100 Pfizer contractors, about 625 people will work out of the new facility when it's complete, a company spokesman said. \nNew York-based Pfizer’s St. Louis facility houses the company’s bio-therapeutics group, which develops biologic therapies and vaccines for clinical trials. \n“Missouri is an important part of Pfizer’s R&D network, and we’re proud of the world-class employee base we’ve built here,” John Ludwig, Senior Vice President of BioTherapeutics Research for Pfizer, said in a statement. “Thanks to the support we’ve received from the state of Missouri, St. Louis County and Chesterfield, our new St. Louis laboratory facility will provide the right location and space as we continue to evolve our business over the coming years.” \nSt. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger said Pfizer won’t have any trouble finding skilled, scientific workers from the region to staff the new facility.",

Stenger said the value of incentives being offered by St. Louis County hasn’t been tallied up yet. The company could also gain access to incentives through the state Missouri Works program, which are tied to “strict job creation criteria.”\nConstruction of the facility is expected to start in the middle of next year and wrap up by 2020.\nIt ranks as one of the largest business investments in the history of St. Louis County, Stenger said.\n",

Pfizer Inc. (Credit: AP Photo / Mark Lennihan) \nCHESTERFIELD, Mo. (KMOV.com) – Pfizer has announced plans to move into a state-of-art research and development facility in St. Louis County. \n“This is one of the biggest business investments in St. Louis County history with more than $200 million dollars being spent on this facility,” said St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger. “Securing this was a very competitive process. Company leaders tell us St. Louis County’s excellent quality of life and our willingness to work closely with Pfizer over many years helped us win this project. We greatly look forward to the groundbreaking and grand opening.” \nThe new development, which will be located in Chesterfield, is expected to create more than 80 jobs and allow for more than 450 employees to remain in the region. \n“Pfizer’s decision to open their new facility in St. Louis County is a great enhancement to our already strong reputation as a leader in the biomedical sector,” said Sheila Sweeney, CEO, St. Louis Economic Development Partnership. “The pharmaceutical sector is important to our local economy, and the Partnership is focused on industries that are growing here in the fields of biomedical, agricultural technology and information technology.” \nThe biopharmaceutical company is headquartered in New York, but has been operating in St. Louis County for more than 13 years. CRG and Clayco will develop and own the new facility. \nConstruction on the building expected to begin in 2017. \nCopyright 2016 KMOV (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved Watch News 4 Now ",

(AP) - Drugmaker Pfizer Inc. says it will consolidate its St. Louis-area research and development operations into a new $200 million laboratory building in Chesterfield. \nThe decision announced Tuesday is expected to create more than 80 jobs and retain more than 450 employees in the region. That’s where New York-based Pfizer has had operations for more than 13 years. \nConstruction of the new building is expected to begin next year. \nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the state of Missouri and St. Louis County are offering the company an incentive package. The state’s Department of Economic Development says that if Pfizer meets job-creation thresholds, it could tap $5 million through the state’s Missouri Works program and $800,000 through the Missouri Works Training program. \nCopyright © 2016 The Washington Times, LLC.",

A massive $150 billion merger between Pfizer and Allergan has been called off after the Obama administration issued new rules designed to crack down on corporate tax avoidance. \nCLAYTON, MO (KTVI) – Pfizer is moving into a new $200 million facility in Chesterfield for research and development. St. Louis County says the development will create more than 80 jobs and retain 450 positions. The building is being constructed by ClayCo. \nConstruction of the facility is expected to begin in 2017. It will be designed to develop biotherapeutic molecules like vaccines, immune-oncology therapies. Pfizer plans to bring employes from two sites together once the new building is complete. \n“Missouri is an important part of Pfizer’s research and development network, we’re proud of the world-class employee base we’ve built here,” said John Ludwig, Senior Vice President of BioTherapeutics Research in a statement. \nPfizer received support from the state of Missouri, St. Louis County and Chesterfield to build the new $200 million facility. \nPfizer is one of the world’s largest biopharmaceutical companies. They are headquartered in New York and have been located in St. Louis for the past 13 years. The company has labs, office space and manufacturing operations in two locations in St. Louis County.

The endometrial tissue is shed from the body during menstruation.\nThe tissue growing outside the uterine cavity is called endometrial implants. Endometriosis can also occur in the fallopian tubes, ovaries, pelvic cavity, vagina, cervix, and bladder. In rare cases, it has been reported in other parts of the body such as the lungs, brain, and skin. These implants are usually benign in nature. Women of reproductive age are often affected by this condition.\nEndometriosis often occurs due to retrograde menstruation, where the menstrual blood flows back into the pelvic cavity instead of leaving the body.

      "text": "News Archive November 22, 2016 Global biopharmaceutical company to use state-of-the-art facility to house R&D and process development operations; project expected to result in more than 80 new jobs   announced a plan to support the building of a new, state-of-the-art facility in Chesterfield to be leased by Pfizer Inc. , one of the world’s premier biopharmaceutical companies. Pfizer has been in Missouri for more than 13 years and currently employs more than 450 scientists and other professionals in the state. \nThe company expects to create more than 80 new jobs through the Chesterfield project over the next few years. To support Pfizer’s new facility, the state has offered a strategic economic incentive package that the company can receive if it meets strict job creation criteria. The expansion is also being made possible through local incentives offered by St. Louis County. \nConstruction of the $200 million facility is expected to begin in mid-2017 and be completed by 2020. St. Louis-based CRG together with Clayco will be the developer and owner of the new facility in Chesterfield. \n“From startups on the brink of discovery to global companies moving the needle on advanced medicine and solutions, Missouri continues to garner expansions and job creation, further solidifying its position as the epicenter of bioscience and tech innovation,” Gov. Nixon said . “Our education and research institutions are shaping the brightest minds that are eager to get into the lab and make a difference in the world. Companies like Pfizer benefit from this growing talent pool and the natural synergy that comes with being part of the region’s burgeoning bioscience community.” \nOnce the new building in Chesterfield is complete, Pfizer will bring together colleagues from two sites and multiple buildings under one roof to house its bioprocess, analytical and formulation development, non-GMP processing, as well as GMP cell banking operations, and cell bank storage necessary to support both its R&D and commercial biologic and vaccine products. \n“Missouri is an important part of Pfizer’s R&D network, and we’re proud of the world-class employee base we’ve built here,” said John Ludwig , Senior Vice President of BioTherapeutics Research for Pfizer. “Thanks to the support we’ve received from the state of Missouri, St. Louis County and Chesterfield, our new St. Louis laboratory facility will provide the right location and space as we continue to evolve our business over the coming years.” \n“Pfizer is yet another example of an innovative company that has chosen St. Louis County as an important base. The company had several location options, but wanted to be here because St. Louis County is a great place to live and do business. That’s why we continue to attract businesses with diverse talent and true vision. John Ludwig and his team are at the forefront of biopharma, and they will be a true asset to our community,” said St. Louis County Executive Steve Stenger . \n“Pfizer's further investment in St. Louis helps solidify the importance of the biosciences industry in the region,” said Joe Reagan , President & CEO of the St. Louis Regional Chamber. “We are very pleased to support this development that will drive further research and continue to attract top talent to our region.” \nPfizer’s continued presence in Missouri builds onto the state’s strong bioscience industry. In addition to being home to St. Louis-based Monsanto and a Bayer facility that has operated in Kansas City since the 1950s, Missouri’s other assets include the Danforth Plant Science Center and the Stowers Institute. The Show-Me State also includes world-class research institutions such as Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Missouri System. Missouri has the largest concentration of plant scientists in the world per capita, as well as the most animal health industry assets in the world through the KC Animal Health Corridor. \nOver the past few years, Missouri’s position as the center for bioscience and biotechnology has been bolstered through several major announcements of new jobs and investments by Pharma Medica Research Inc. and Express Scripts. The state also has garnered expansions from several foreign bioscience companies that are setting up headquarters and labs right here in the Show-Me State for the first time. Related News",

That's where New York-based Pfizer has had operations for more than 13 years. \nConstruction of the new building is expected to begin next year. \nThe state of Missouri and St. Louis County are offering the company an incentive package.

(AP) - Drugmaker Pfizer Inc. says it will consolidate its St. Louis-area research and development operations into a new $200 million laboratory building in Chesterfield.\nThe decision announced Tuesday is expected to create more than 80 jobs and retain more than 450 employees in the region. That's where New York-based Pfizer has had operations for more than 13 years.\nConstruction of the new building is expected to begin next year.\nThe state of Missouri and St. Louis County are offering the company an incentive package. The state's Department of Economic Development says that if Pfizer meets job-creation thresholds, it could tap $5 million through the state's Missouri Works program and $800,000 through the Missouri Works Training program.\n ",

      "text": "Pfizer plans $200M building, consolidation in St. Louis area Updated 1:02 pm, Tuesday, November 22, 2016 CHESTERFIELD, Mo. (AP) — Drugmaker Pfizer Inc. says it will consolidate its St. Louis-area research and development operations into a new $200 million laboratory building in Chesterfield. The decision announced Tuesday is expected to create more than 80 jobs and retain more than 450 employees in the region. That's where New York-based Pfizer has had operations for more than 13 years. Construction of the new building is expected to begin next year. The state of Missouri and St. Louis County are offering the company an incentive package. The state's Department of Economic Development says that if Pfizer meets job-creation thresholds, it could tap $5 million through the state's Missouri Works program and $800,000 through the Missouri Works Training program .

      "text": "Competitive Results May Affect Omeros Corporation Nov.23.16 \nData from Pfizer's Amaryllis study should be forthcoming. \nThere is a competitive landscape for a successful IgAN treatment. \nOMS721 probably has the lead at this early stage with Rigel scheduled. If you have been following Omeros Corporation (NASDAQ: OMER ) for a while, chances are you take an interest in the press releases that are regularly issued. Of course, backgrounds in, and knowledge of, science and medicine can be varied. So, unless some time and effort are spent, sometimes one can only gain familiarity as opposed to a better notion of significant implications of new information. It can be a struggle. The objective here is to take a closer look at the evaluation of potential treatments for IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The clinical landscape surrounding IgAN is not the only thing that can substantially move the share price in the near term. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) should be announcing its own results from a phase 2 study of its PDE10 inhibitor as a potential treatment for Huntington's disease. Omeros Corporation has a competing product, that may have advantageous dosage requirements, known as OMS824. Medications for cognitive conditions tend to be expensive to evaluate, requiring added time, and have lower odds of success. Shares of OMER have been exhibiting weakness thus far this week; though data from Pfizer is not the only relevant near term news. Pertaining to IgAN, while there are other firms working on treatments, the company's OMS721 shows promise. Market participants perhaps agree, because the equity capitalization of competing corporations, or even known partnering arrangements, do not indicate commercial potential pursuant to success. There has been clear indication that OMS721 is intended to help corticosteroid dependent IgAN - though steroid dependency evidently is not necessary to obtain breakthrough designation with the FDA. Another potential medicine is identified as a corticosteroid, budesonide. Per a description of findings , \nefficacy was measured as change in 24-h urine albumin excretion, serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The median relative reduction in urinary albumin excretion was 23% during the treatment period (interquartile range: -0.36 to -0.04, P = 0.04) with pretreatment values ranging from 0.3 to 6 g/24 h (median: 1.5 g/24 h). The median reduction in urine albumin peaked at 40% (interquartile range: -0.58 to -0.15) 2 months after treatment discontinuation. Though we do not have access to Omeros Corporation's actual data, the descriptive press release provides information indicating superiority, albeit with only two patients. It is discussed later. A variant of budesonide is being researched by Sweden's Phamalink . It is a formulation known as NEFECON . Here is a description of past findings, which not surprisingly include some positive effects: \nTreatment was generally found to be safe and well-tolerated. There was a significant reduction in proteinuria in patients at 6 months compared to levels at the study start and a small but significant improvement in their estimated glomerular filtration rate, a measure of renal function. The frequency of typical side effects that could be related to corticosteroid treatment was low, and no different to the levels recorded prior to the start or after the cessation of treatment. I have observed no mention of glomerular filtration rate in association with OMS721. NEFECON is being further evaluated in a phase 2b trial. There is research into potentially different methods of treatment. Anthera Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ANTH ), a microcap firm, is carrying on clinical trial to measure proteinurea . \nEvidence for a role of BAFF in IgAN disease pathology is observed in patients and animal models. Elevated serum concentrations of BAFF are reported in patients with IgAN, and these correlate with histological disease severity. In addition, BAFF is known to stimulate the production of immunoglobulins, and mice that over express BAFF have elevated levels of circulating IgA along with IgA deposits in the kidney. Collectively, these data provide the basis for the use of blisibimod as the first potential targeted therapy to reduce production of IgA-containing immune complexes and thereby prevent kidney damage and disease progression. Another that may be particularly exciting, in part because there should be data before the end of the year, is known as fostamatinib . However, data shows some mild and moderate adverse events in previous evaluation for a different condition. A description of an underlying rationale is available , although it is somewhat difficult to read. A video clip is shown on the web site of the corporation carrying out studies, Rigel Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: RIGL ). Fostamatinib research has been varied. Investigation of it as a treatment for IgAN is in phase 2, pursuant to preclinical and ex-vivo findings. Here is commentary from Rigel's Q3 conference call that mentions safety and efficacy considerations that pertain to dosage: \nEun Yang \nOkay. And then this IgA nephropathy, so I think that you mentioned that about 150 milligram dosing may be needed to some effect. So the 100 milligram dose at the core data that we are expecting by end of this year, is it fair that we do not expect much of it because more of the safety? \nRaul Rodriguez \nI think we're hoping for a very good safety out of it but usually we see a higher level of efficacy at the higher dose group which is why we're saying, we think, we will see better efficacy in the second dose cohort. But that's not to say I don't know what the results will be in this first one as yet it's still obviously blinded. A graphic from the most recent investor presentation shows that results are anticipated soon: The only known clinical endpoint is proteinurea, and it may not be easy to improve upon NEFECON or OMS721 (a listing at clincialtrials.gov does not specify any endpoints). As a detail, the estimated number of cases shown in the graphic is higher than specified by some other sources, though there seems to be a consensus that only approximations of prevalence are available: There is other information pertaining to human, ex-vivo evaluation: ChemoCentryx (NASDAQ: CCXI ) is investigating CCX168, sometimes referred to as avacopan, for IgAN among other conditions. CCX168 has shown clinical efficacy at reducing thrombus size. I suspect that it offers a superior alternative to Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ALXN ) Soliris for thrombotic diseases. ChemoCentryx stock has done quite well since the announcement of an $85 million agreement giving Vifor Pharma the right to market avacopan outside the USA. In Europe alone, there should be over 13,000 incidences of IgAN. (A separate matter that might be worth attention is CCX872, undergoing early stage evaluation for pancreatic cancer, a particularly difficult illness). Lastly, here is what we know of OMS721's results: \nThe mean baseline urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) was 1264 mg/g and reached 525 mg/g at the end of treatment (p = 0.011), decreasing to 128 mg/g at the end of the follow-up period. Measures of 24-hour urine protein excretion tracked uACRs, with a mean reduction from 3156 mg/day to 1119 mg/day (p = 0.017). Both patients experienced reductions of approximately 2000 mg/day and both achieved a partial remission (defined as greater than 50 percent reduction in 24-hour urine protein excretion and/or resultant protein excretion less than 1000 mg/day; complete remission defined as protein excretion less than 300 mg/day)…Also, during the trial, daily steroid doses for both patients were able to be reduced substantially (60 mg to 0 mg and 30 mg to 5 mg). There have been no serious adverse events reported. So, in addition to a lack of side effects, there appears to be a rationale that is clinically supported through the showing of partial remission. Budesonide has peaked at 40% urine albumin reduction; any commentary on OMS721's effect upon estimated glomerular filtration rate could be illuminating. There are several small cap and smaller drug firms working on an effective treatment for IgAN. Investors, and partners, do not appear to ascribe commercial potential to them. While future possibilities are implicit, at this early stage, OMS721 appears to lead with data awaited from Rigel (and also Pfizer). Work Cited Disclosure: I am/we are long OMER.

      "text": "Pfizer Suing Texas For Disclosing Drug Prices 4 hours ago share \n(Austin, TX) -- Pfizer is suing the state of Texas for telling one of its elected officials how much Pfizer charges taxpayers for its pharmaceuticals. In its lawsuit, the company says its trade secrets are on a need-to-know basis and that the Department of Human Health and Services in Austin had no business disclosing the negotiated prices to Senator Charles Schwertner, chairman of the state Senate Committee on Health and Human Services. The information that Pfizer calls a trade secret was never released publicly. Critics of major pharma say prices paid by state Medicaid programs should be made public to make the industry more competitive. #WeekInRock ",

      "text": "Reprints \nStocks opened slightly higher Friday, as Wal-Mart ( WMT ) received a Black Friday boost. \nDow industrials and the S&P 500 rose 0.2% as the Nasdaq rose a fraction. The Russell 2000 climbed 0.1%. \nThe Nasdaq, Dow and the S&P 500 all rolled into Friday's session up 1.1% in the holiday-shortened week, all tapping new highs and looking to add a third week to their advance. Small caps have easily outpaced the group, with the Russell 2000 up more than 2% so far this week and showing a 12.7% gain for November. The S&P Smallcap 600 holds a 2.3% gain this week, and is up 13.7% since the start of the month. \nThe Nasdaq and S&P 500 are up 3.7% for November and the Dow boasts a 5.2% gain. In Motion: Wal-Mart, Pfizer, Ctrip.com International \nWal-Mart rose 1%. Pfizer's ( PFE ) made a 0.6% advance. Exxon Mobil ( XOM ) and Chevron ( CVX ) were stragglers on the Dow, each down a fraction. \nCtrip.com International ( CTRP ) rattled off a 10% gain at the open, as HSBC upgraded the stock to buy from hold, and raised its price target to 53 from 46. Ctrip.com reported late Wednesday its third-quarter earnings fell less than expected, and a 61% revenue gain easily cleared analyst targets. The stock has been seeking to regain technical support in a year-long consolidation. \nIBD 50 stocks traded flat to higher, but holding to gains or losses of less than 0.5%. Services PMI On Deck, Copper Jumps; Global Markets Mixed \nThe earnings calendar was quiet on the stock market today , and the economic docket led off with an expansion in the U.S. trade deficit, to $62 billion, in October, according to the Commerce Department. That was up from a $56.1 billion trade gap in September, and wider than the increase to $59.7 billion expected by economist consensus. \nLondon-based researcher Markit is scheduled to report its preliminary purchasing managers' index reading on November services at 9:45 a.m.ET. \nOil futures traded lower — West Texas Intermediate dipped 1% to $47.38 a barrel. Metals futures were mixed, with gold down slightly to below $1,188 an ounce and copper up nearly 2% to near $2.66 a pound. The dollar gave up some ground and bonds eased, lifting the 10-year yield 1 basis point to 2.36%. \nInternational trading was mixed and tame on Friday with markets across Asia taking home mild gains. Europe's benchmark indexes were narrowly mixed in afternoon trade, the FTSE 100 in London up 0.2% and benchmarks in Frankfurt and Paris down a fraction each. \nRELATED:",

      "text": "With development support from the state of Missouri and local governments, Pfizer plans to centralize 450 of its St. Louis employees, plus add 80 new jobs, at a planned $200 million R&D site.\nUpon the facility’s expected completion in 2020, the company will move its employees in the area from “two sites and multiple buildings” to one location in Chesterfield, a St. Louis Suburb.\nThe site will be designed for R&D in vaccines, immuno-oncology drugs, monoclonal antibodies and biosims, according to a statement from the St. Louis Economic Development Partnership.\nHaving operated in the area for more than 13 years, Pfizer is “very proud of the world class employee base we’ve built here,” a spokesperson told FiercePharma.\nDevelopment incentives from the state will be contingent on “strict job creation criteria,” with construction set to begin next year. The company received additional assistance from the county and city for the $200 million project.\nLocal developers CRG and Clayco will build and own the facility with Pfizer planning to sign a lease to operate there.\nFor the pharma giant, the move in St. Louis comes as it looks to move corporate headquarters in New York City, a spokesperson said last month. The company hopes to begin relocating to \"a new, more modern\" Manhattan HQ by the middle of 2019.\nThe St. Louis consolidation also comes on the heels of the company’s Q3 earnings that fell 38% to $1.32 billion.",

      "text": "Grey Wins Pfizer's Nexium as Pharma Giant Consolidates Its U.S. Agency Roster Leo Burnett had the account since 2013 By Patrick Coffee November 28, 2016, 3:28 PM EST Advertising & Branding The company spent $66 million marketing the brand last year. Shutterstock Pfizer, the world's second largest pharmaceutical company by sales, has picked Grey as lead creative agency on its antacid brand Nexium in the U.S. after a review. The business had been with Leo Burnett, which won a global remit in a 2013 review . At the time, the Publicis shop's Chicago, Paris, Berlin and London offices joined forces to beat out an Omnicom team led by TBWA\\Chiat\\Day New York. Leo Burnett Chicago handled the U.S. portion of the account but will not continue to do so moving forward. Representatives for both Grey and Leo Burnett deferred to the client on the news, and a Pfizer rep wrote, \"We can't comment on rumor or speculation.\" Multiple sources with direct knowledge of the matter, however, confirmed that the review did occur with Grey emerging as the winner. The WPP shop has been a member of Pfizer's agency roster for some time and currently works on multiple brands including Robitussin, Emergen-C, Advil and ThermaCare after winning the latter two assignments back from Dentsu's mcgarrybowen in a 2013 review . In 2012, Pfizer announced plans to consolidate its global advertising accounts with the three largest holding companies. Earlier this year, the company scrapped a planned $160 billion merger with rival Allergan, which also makes Botox. Pfizer continues to work with all three of the industry's top holding companies on various global accounts, but the Nexium move hints that the conglomerate still seeks to cut its overall marketing expenses. At least one trade publication also reported earlier this year that Pfizer had launched a global creative review for the Viagra brand, which is handled by BBDO in the U.S. But the client declined to confirm the news and has not yet named a new agency partner on that brand. Pfizer spent $66 million on paid media promoting the Nexium brand in the United States in 2015, according to Kantar Media. The total for the first half of this year was just under $28 million.

      "text": "© 2016 Adweek All Rights Reserved Pfizer’s Nexium Goes to Grey as Pharma Giant Consolidates Its Agency Roster Advertisement Comment \nThe world’s second largest pharmaceutical company Pfizer has further consolidated its agency roster by moving the Nexium account to Grey after a review. \nLeo Burnett won the business in early 2013 , beating out TBWA\\Chiat\\Day New York in a review that involved more than 200 people in its Chicago, London, Paris and Berlin offices. At the time, Pfizer was transitioning the heartburn medication from prescription-only to over the counter status. \nGrey and Leo Burnett both declined to comment on today’s news, and a client rep wrote, “We won’t comment on rumor and speculation.” \nBut several sources confirmed that the business went to Grey, which will almost certainly run the account out of its New York office. The WPP shop currently handles several Pfizer brands including Advil, Robitussin, EmergenC and Advil Cold. All went into one of Grey’s five major “portfolio groups” when they were established last year. \nIn 2012, Pfizer announced plans to consolidate all of its global marketing business with the three biggest holding companies. Many speculated that its proposed $160 billion merger with Allergan would have required even more such moves, but the company cancelled that deal early this year when it ran up against an Obama administration regulation designed to kill “ tax-dodging corporate mergers. ” \nWe hear that Pfizer will continue working with Publicis and Leo Burnett outside the U.S. In May, Campaign reported that the company was seeking a new global creative lead for Viagra. There have been no subsequent updates on that brand, which remains with BBDO domestically. \nThe company spent $66 million promoting the Nexium brand in the United States in 2015 and $27.8 million in the first half of this year. \nSeveral law firms have attempted to launch class action lawsuits accusing Pfizer and other drug makers of false advertising after a January 2016 study linked Nexium and its “proton pump inhibitor” rivals Prilosec and Prevacid to kidney disease. \nLeo Burnett Chicago produced this holiday ad for the brand.",

      "text": "Many drugmakers have voiced displeasure after England’s cost watchdog gave negative assessments for their promising but costly new meds. Now, though, Pfizer is voicing concerns about its Ibrance review ahead of a ruling by NICE.\nNICE’s methodology puts Ibrance in a poor position to gain coverage, oncology exec David Montgomery told pharmaphorum, because the breast cancer med is used in combo with other drugs. In its reviews, NICE looks at costs for such “add on” meds in addition to the other components in a regimen, giving little ability for new combos to show cost-effectiveness.\nCast in point, Roche’s Perjeta. Used in combo with Herceptin and chemo, the cancer-fighting cocktail didn’t fare well at the agency, at least at first. The drug won EU approval in 2013, but it was not until this month that it secured NICE’s backing to treat early-stage breast cancer.\nIbrance won its EU approval earlier this month for breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or, in women who’ve received prior endocrine therapy, with AstraZeneca’s Faslodex.\nSince its U.S. approval last year, Ibrance has shot out of the gate to deliver blockbuster sales for the New York pharma. The med hauled in third-quarter sales of $550 million, more than double last year’s $230 million. In the second quarter , Ibrance contributed $514 million to Pfizer’s top line.\nDespite the strong U.S. launch, Montgomery said he believes the med might struggle in the U.K. based on NICE’s review methodology. The company will price Ibrance “sensitively in a way that is socially responsible” in the country, he told pharmaphorum.\nIn recent months, as NICE works to take over the burdened Cancer Drugs Fund, companies including Merck and Eisai have seen pricey new cancer meds turned away on cost concerns. But Pfizer’s Bosulif was the first drug to see its previous coverage decision reversed by the agency when it won backing in June based on a new discount offer.\nNICE decisions only directly affect patients in the U.K., but other countries use the agency’s assessments to shape their own coverage, giving added gravity to judgments by the U.K. agency.",

      "text": "Earlier this month, Pfizer dumped development of a new cholesterol-lowering drug candidate that had not lived up to expectations in a late-phase trial. Now Pfizer is dumping much of the €400 million plant expansion in Ireland it was planning to support it.\nWith the decision not to proceed with the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9i) bococizumab, the New York drugmaker will not need the 371,300-square-foot expansion of its Grange Castle biologics manufacturing unit or the 300 or so jobs that would have brought, the Irish Times reported today.\nA company spokeswoman pointed out in an email today that Pfizer had never confirmed an expansion, only that it had submitted plans for one to authorities in Ireland. It said today it will still do a smaller version of the expansion for production of other drugs at the massive site, where it currently employs about 1,100 workers.\n“Following the decision to discontinue the development of bococizumab, part of the potential expansion for which the planning permission was sought will not now go ahead,” she said. “Expansion in relation to other incoming products will continue as planned, involving investment, recruitment and new technology.”\nWhen Pfizer confirmed last summer that it was contemplating a $423 million expansion of the facility, it said the project would be completed in two phases, adding 200 jobs to Pfizer’s Ireland operations with the initial phase and another 100 jobs upon completion of the second.\nThat changed when the drug giant announced this month that it found that bococizumab “is not likely to provide value to patients, physicians, or shareholders” after data showed its ability to lower LDL-C weakened over time and increased the risk of some adverse events. It said that “taken together with the evolving treatment and market landscape for lipid-lowering agents,” it had decided to discontinue the development program, including the two ongoing cardiovascular outcome studies.\nThat leaves the field to Amgen and partners Sanofi and Regeneron, which already have PCSK9 cholesterol-fighters Repatha and Praluent on the market. But the “market landscape” Pfizer referred to includes the fact that payers have slapped prior-authorization hurdles on the drugs and uptake has not been what was originally anticipated. Many doctors say they're waiting for more data that would show whether Praluent and Repatha significantly cut the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, data that would change their thinking on use significantly.",

(Reuters) \nDrug maker Pfizer is planning to extend its Corex brand to a series of new products to treat respiratory ailments as part of a revamp of its product portfolio. \nThe company has also decided to discontinue the manufacturing of current Corex cough syrup formulation. \n“The company will be launching a series of products as line extensions under the Corex brand name, starting with the first launch in December 2016 and subsequent launches over the next year,” Pfizer said in a statement. \n“The company has also decided to discontinue the manufacturing of the current Corex Cough Syrup formulation. Pfizer stands by the safety and efficacy of its current Corex Syrup formulation that has been duly approved by the central and state regulator,” It added. \nIn March this year, Pfizer had discontinued manufacture and sale of its popular cough syrup Corex after the government banned fixed dose combination of Chlopheniramine Maleate+ Codeine Syrup. \nAccording to Pfizer, with this formulation, all additional line extensions will be introduced with all due regulatory approvals in place. \n“Pfizer remains committed to provide a more comprehensive set of solutions in respiratory indications, while ensuring minimal impact towards patients resulting from the discontinuation of manufacturing of the current Corex syrup formulation,” it said. \nBefore the ban, Corex Cough Syrup had sales of Rs 244.48 crore in FY 2015-16.

      "text": "Pfizer Scraps $425M Dublin Plant Expansion (PFE) By Shobhit Seth | November 28, 2016 — 11:36 AM EST \nPfizer Inc. ( PFE ) scrapped plans to launch its cholesterol drug bococizumab after clinical trials showed the drug became less effective over time, and the impact of the drug failure is being felt in Ireland. (For more, see Pfizer Sees 4Q Charge for Dumping Drug .) \nPfizer has canceled a €400 million (or US $425 million) expansion of its Grange Castle plant in Dublin. The expansion was expected to generate permanent employment for 350 people and 1,250 construction-related jobs during the two-year project. \nPfizer's cholesterol-lowering drug bococizumab was expected to hit sales of almost $1 billion a year, and the planned plant expansion was intended to accommodate mass manufacturing. \nPfizer is one of the largest private-sector employers in Ireland. It has 1,100 people employed at the former Wyeth plant in west Dublin and another 3,300 people across multiple facilities in Ireland. \nThe Grange Castle plant continues to produce two of Pfizer’s bestselling drugs – Enbrel, the arthritis drug, and Prevenar vaccine, used to prevent pneumococcal infections in children. \nIndicating continued smaller activities in Dublin, a Pfizer spokesperson said, “Expansion in relation to other incoming products will continue as planned, involving investment, recruitment and new technology.” (For more, see Pfizer Exits Brazil: Teva Is Suitor .) Struggling Sales of Cholesterol Drugs \nBococizumab was a much-anticipated drug that was expected to come to market in 2017, though it was not approved in any country for any cholesterol-related treatments. \nThough a few cholesterol drugs secured approvals and were launched last year, their sales continue to struggle due to high price, a long list of required documents, and lack of data regarding long-term impacts. They include Amgen Inc.’s ( AMGN ) Repatha, and Sanofi ( SNY ) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s ( REGN ) Praluent (alirocumab). (For more, see New-Age Cholesterol Drugs Don't Sell .)

REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo \nFRANKFURT German drugmaker Merck KGaA and U.S. partner Pfizer have been granted priority review status in the United States as they seek approval to fight a rare and aggressive form of skin cancer with immunotherapy drug avelumab. \nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has accepted the request for approval and will review the trial data for the drug against metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma within six months instead of the usual 10, Merck said on Tuesday. \nAvelumab belongs to a new generation of biotech drugs that stop some tumors from hiding from the immune system, similar to Merck & Co's Keytruda or Roche's Tecentriq. \nThe future of Merck KGaA's pharmaceuticals division rests largely on avelumab, after the business suffered development setbacks in several other medicines and amid rising competition for its established brands, such as Rebif against multiple sclerosis. \nThe FDA has previously granted Merck and Pfizer other support schemes for the drug, such as breakthrough therapy designation. \n(Reporting by Ludwig Burger; Editing by Georgina Prodhan) Next In Health",

      "text": "Tweet Share FRANKFURT, Nov 29 (Reuters) - German drugmaker Merck KGaA and U.S. partner Pfizer have been granted priority review status in the United States as they seek approval to fight a rare and aggressive form of skin cancer with immunotherapy drug avelumab. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has accepted the request for approval and will review the trial data for the drug against metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma within six months instead of the usual 10, Merck said on Tuesday. Avelumab belongs to a new generation of biotech drugs that stop some tumours from hiding from the immune system, similar to Merck & Co's Keytruda or Roche's Tecentriq. The future of Merck KGaA's pharmaceuticals division rests largely on avelumab, after the business suffered development setbacks in several other medicines and amid rising competition for its established brands, such as Rebif against multiple sclerosis. The FDA has previously granted Merck and Pfizer other support schemes for the drug, such as breakthrough therapy designation. (Reporting by Ludwig Burger; Editing by Georgina Prodhan) Reblog",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs, Pfizer Are Buys; J&J, Wendy's Downgraded (Investor's Business Daily) \nFollowing the election, the Universal Banks outlook for 2017 and beyond now reflects higher interest rates, only modest benefits from deregulation and better trading results due to increased volatility, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods’ Brian Kleinhanzl said in a report. He raised the 2018 EPS estimates by 9 percent and projected an average total return of 9.9 percent for the group. \nThe macro outlook now includes the assumption of a 25bps (basis point) hike in the Fed’s interest rate in December 2016, two additional hikes of 25bps each in June and December of 2017, and two increases in June and December of 2018, as compared to the prior forecast of just a single 25bps increase in late 2018, Kleinhanzl mentioned. \nMoreover, the 10-year treasury rate is now expected to reach 2.50 percent by end-2017 and 2.75 percent by end-2018. Upgrades \nKleinhanzl upgraded the ratings on Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC ) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS ) from Market Perform to Outperform, while raising the price targets from $17.50 to $23 and from $185 to $240, respectively. \nAlthough Bank of America’s shares have appreciated 20.5 percent post-election versus a 13.5 percent gain by peers on average, potential upside remains from an improved earnings outlook. \n“As we look to 2018, we expect BAC to post 6.9 percent positive operating leverage as the combined benefit of higher rates and the ongoing cost save program help push BAC’s operating leverage to best among peers (2.6 percent average operating leverage),” the analyst commented. \nKleinhanzl believes investors would be “best positioned” to benefit from increased volatility and trading volumes by owning Goldman Sachs’ shares. The earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 have been raised by 11.8 percent and 13.9 percent, respectively. While the price target has been raised, a faster improvement in global economic growth or deregulation on a wider scale may lend further upside. Price Target Revisions \nKleinhanzl reiterated Outperform ratings on JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ) and Bank of New York Mellon Corp (NYSE: BK ), while raising the price targets from $77 to $88 and from $50 to $54, respectively. \n“We continue to believe that rising consensus estimates, actual increases in the fed funds rates, and actual policy proposals on the state of the regulatory environment in the future will keep Universal bank stocks moving upward — but the pace of relative outperformance will slow versus the recent performance period post election,” the analyst wrote. At Last Check Bank of America was up 1.01 percent at $20.50. Bank of New York Mellon was up 0.47 percent at $47.25. Goldman Sachs was up 1.35 percent at $212.54. JPMorgan was up 0.87 percent at $79. \nImage Credit: By Andrew Jameson (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0 or GFDL], via Wikimedia Commons Latest Ratings for BAC",

      "text": "Pfizer and Merck KGaA took a step closer to becoming the fourth to market in the new checkpoint inhibitor space as they announce that the FDA has accepted for review their BLA for avelumab as they eye a possible 2017 approval.\nSpecifically, the FDA said it has accepted for priority review the partners PD-L1 for avelumab in patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), based on tumor response results from the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial. Last year, it was also handed a breakthrough tag in this setting.\nIt could be the first treatment indicated for metastatic MCC (a rare and aggressive form of skin cancer in older patients) in the U.S., if approved, and likely be the fourth co to bring a checkpoint inhibitor to market after Bristol-Myers, Merck and most recently Roche.\nIt would also be the second to bring a PD-L1 after Roche’s Tecentriq (atezolizumab) got the FDA nod earlier this year. It is looking to beat out AstraZeneca’s durvalumab to market, which has been hit by a series of setbacks in testing, although it was earlier this year given an FDA breakthrough tag in bladder cancer.\nThis also comes a month after the EMA said it was to also review avelumab for Merkel cell carcinoma.\n“We are pleased the FDA has granted a priority review designation for avelumab,” said Luciano Rossetti, EVP and global head of R&D at the biopharma business of Merck.\n“There are currently no approved treatment options for metastatic MCC, and we are committed to working with the FDA to potentially bring the first approved cancer immunotherapy to patients with this aggressive disease.”\nBack in the summer, Merck’s Keytruda (pembrolizumab) saw some promising data coming out of a test in MCC, but avelumab, which inhibits PD-L1 interactions, showed in a midstage trial back in May of 61 patients that about 30% of those with Merkel skin cell carcinoma who had failed on a previous treatment saw their tumors shrink or disappear when treated with the experimental cancer immunotherapy.\nMerkel skin cell carcinoma develops in the top layer of the skin and is a rare type of neuroendocrine tumor. These typically occur in the head and neck and are predominately found in older patients, or those with weakened immune systems.\nCurrent treatments include surgery and chemotherapy agents, although Novartis is currently conducting a study of its marketed cancer drug Votrient to see if it too can help Merkel patients.\nThe drug was not tested against another medicine or placebo, but researchers concluded from an interim analysis that avelumab demonstrated a manageable safety profile with durable responses.\nIn all, six patients (10%) experienced complete responses with no signs of cancer, while 12 others saw significant tumor shrinkage. The data were also presented at ASCO in Chicago.\nPfizer, which has lagged behind its Big Pharma rivals in this therapy class, signed an $850 million deal with Germany’s Merck back in 2014 to gain access to its PD-L1 program. The two are also testing the drug in a host of other cancers in NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma and ovarian, gastric and bladder cancer, as well as joining them up with other meds from Pfizer’s pipeline and portfolio to see if a cocktail therapy can extend patients’ lives.",
