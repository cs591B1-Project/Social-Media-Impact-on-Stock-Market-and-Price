The former Secretary of State addressed the crowd, speaking for the first time since her concession speech one week ago. PHOTOS: Hillary Clinton’s A-List Supporters \nClinton, who wore minimal makeup for the appearance, discussed child poverty and talked candidly about her emotional state after losing the 2016 presidential election in a shocking turn of events to Republican Donald Trump . \n“Many times this week I wanted to curl up with a book or my dogs and never leave the house again,” the politician candidly shared. “…I know many of you are deeply disappointed about the results of the election … I am too … but as I said last week our campaign was … about building an America that is hopeful … I ask you to stay engaged … America needs you … I know this isn’t easy. I know over the past week a lot of people have asked themselves whether America is the county we thought it was … America is worth it,” Clinton said. “Our children are worth it. Believe in our country … and never ever give up.” Clinton: There were a few times this week \"when all I wanted to was just to curl up…and never leave the house again\" https://t.co/NzN1vorDnK pic.twitter.com/Sxi6pmOddA — ABC News (@ABC) November 17, 2016 \nClinton also discussed how no child should have to live in fear and that “every child deserves the opportunity to live up to his or her potential\" while sharing her mother Dorothy's story.",

Hadid announced the news on Instagram with a street-style picture of her standing in front of a billboard she is featured on in New York, and the body shamers were out in force. A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST \n\"So excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE @NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon,\" the model captioned her post . \nAnd while some comments were positive, many criticised the brand for promoting unrealistic expectations. \n\"This is why young girls get eating disorders, when being abnormally thin is glorified,\" wrote one commenter. \"Well done @nike.\" \n\"Nike? She's not an athlete but more importantly it's giving young girls unrealistic expectations yet again,\" another argued. \"Why not use [Ashley Graham] come on now @NIKE have some sense.\" \nAnother wrote: \"Worst candidate for a sport brand. She doesn't even have an athletic body. She's just plain. She should just stay as a runway model. She also doesn't have curves to be a VS model.\" \nThis is not the first time a company has received backlash for using an influencer over professional athletes as ambassadors, with similar resistance stirred when Kylie Jenner was announced as a face of Puma and Bella's sister Gigi joined Reebok. \nOne commenter shaded the industry signing ambassadors rather than athletes: \"I love how so many athletic companies are signing models now and not athletes because they know people look up to models more [than] they lookup to people with real talent.\" \nHadid recently told People she was conscious she had lost too much weight in the lead up to her Victoria's Secret debut later this month because of her strict training regime - hitting back at those who have skinny-shamed her physique. \n\"I didn't really mean to [lose weight],\" she said. \"Like I want boobs. I want my ass back. But it's not my fault. My weight fluctuates and so does everybody's and I think that if people are gonna judge, that's the worst you can possibly do because everybody is different,\" she told the magazine. \n\"I worked out so hard and everybody is like, 'Oh, she looks so skinny blah, blah, blah. But I think that if you just stick to something you can really achieve so much. I've been eating hard protein every day, and working out for three hours every day. It's crazy but I think that you know if you set your mind to something I think you can succeed.\" \nOthers have commented that any negative dissent with Hadid's appointment should be taken up with Nike and leave body shaming women out of it.

This time the slick style has found it’s way onto the Air Jordan 1, and aside from the colorway the model also boasts a little extra shoe as well. The style of silhouette seen here is an Ultra High version with an extended ankle collar in place of it’s tongue. As for colorway, the pair is dipped in black patent leather and wool with hits of concord blue used on the branding. A white midsole shines below with an ice blue outsole serving up a bit of Space Jam realness. You’ll be able to cop this Air Jordan 1 Ultra High Space Jam on December 3.

However, Trump ‘s victory in the U.S. election last week has overshadowed the event.\nTrump has threatened to tear up the U.S. commitment to the accord.\nThe 360+ group called on U.S. leaders to continue to participate in the Paris Agreement, support the continuation of U.S. commitments on climate change and continue to invest in low-carbon solutions at home and abroad.\n“Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness,” the group said, in the statement presented at U.N. climate talks being held this week in Marrakesh, Morocco.\n“Implementing the Paris Climate Agreement will enable and encourage businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars in existing low-carbon investments into the trillions of dollars the world needs to bring clean energy prosperity to all,” the group added.",

By Brendan Dunne \nThe Nike Air Foamposite Pro \"Dr. Doom\" colorway is set to make a return in 2016, with this shoe's sneaker release date marked for Nov. 25. The Black Friday launch will be part of a larger group from Nike and Jordan Brand that perhaps has its zenith at the \"True Blue\" Air Jordan 3 retro. \nThe Nike Air Foamposite Pro style pictured first released in 2006, its colorway ostensibly representing Marvel villain Dr. Doom in Nike's \"Fantastic Four\" pack. \nThis pair is set to be one of the last Foamposites for 2016 before Nike's onslaught of 20th anniversary designs for the Foamposite line begins in 2017. \nNike Air Foamposite Pro \"Dr. Doom\" Release Date: 11/23/16 Style #: 624041-006 Price: $230 \nUPDATE 11/16: Detailed images of this year's \"Dr. Doom\" Foamposites releasing on Nov. 23 that will, of course, not be referred to by that name for legal reasons. \nUPDATE 11/9: The first official photo from Nike can be seen above.

      "text": "Starbucks , Nike and more than 360 other businesses and investors have called on President-elect Donald Trump and other world leaders to remain committed to the Paris agreement on climate change.\n\"Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness,\" the group said in a statement released and presented at United Nations climate talks in Marrakesh, Morocco, on Wednesday .\nOther signers include conglomerate Unilever, chemicals giant Dupont, and technology company Hewlett Packard.\nThe Paris treaty was signed by nearly 200 countries to try and restore greenhouse gas emissions to sustainable levels by the year 2100 . A major goal is to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\nA number of the world's largest companies are urging President-elect Trump to remain in the Paris Agreement. Source: Mark Lennihan/AP Backers of climate change action are concerned because there's good reason to expect that the United States might try and walk back its efforts to limit emissions in Trump's administration.\nThe president-elect has called climate change a \" hoax ,\" promised to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency , and appointed Myron Ebell — who has argued greenhouse gas emissions could actually be beneficial — to lead his EPA transition effort.\nEven Exxon Mobile, the oil and gas multinational that has had a fraught relationship with climate change activists in the past, backs the Paris agreement.\nSuzanne McCarron, Exxon's vice president of public and government affairs, tweeted about the company's ongoing support of the treaty on Nov. 10, the morning after the election.\nThe Paris agreement is an important step forward by governments in addressing the serious risks of #ClimateChange https://t.co/X7JubyyArv\nOf course, other countries in the agreement may fight back in the event that the U.S. tries to back out.\nFormer French President Nicholas Sarkozy — who will also likely be his center-right party's nominee for President — has floated the idea of imposing a tariff on U.S. imports to make up for reneging on the Paris agreement's financial commitments.\nThat would need to be approved by other countries in the EU for it to have the desired effect, although it would pack a punch — Europe is still the United States' biggest trading partner.\nThe clock is ticking: September 2016 was the hottest September in 136 years , as long as records have been kept.",

Related This Cult Boston Sneaker Shop Is Opening Up in Los Angeles \nNike Air Foamposite Pro “Dr. Doom.” Courtesy of Nike. For the retro basketball shoe fan, the “Black, White & Forbidding” iteration of the Air Foamposite Pro — commonly referred to as “Dr. Doom” —  will hit retail shelves again with a $230 retail price. The shoe boasts a simple black and white color palette, with black taking up the upper (with white Swoosh branding) and completed with a white outsole.\nIf you’re looking for a basketball sneaker with a contemporary look, Nike will deliver the “Cool Grey” Kobe A.D., the latest signature shoe from NBA legend Kobe Bryant. The first iteration — also dubbed “Ruthless Precision” — boasts a tonal gray color palette with white accents and a metallic panel on the heel. The shoe will retail for $160.\nAnother look at the Nike Kobe A.D. Courtesy of Nike. The last two looks dropping are retro favorites: the Air Max 90 and the Air Griffey Max 1. The “Winter Ready” Air Max 90 arrives in men’s and women’s sizing for $135, and come dressed with natural tones with an upper executed with premium nubuck. The “Flax” iteration of the Air Griffey Max 1 — worn by Hall of Fame baseball standout Ken Griffey Jr. — features a similar color execution to the “Winter Ready” Air Max 90, executed with a premium full-flax upper for the first time, according to Nike. The sneaker comes with a $150 price tag.\nNike Air Max 90 “Winter Ready.” Courtesy of Nike. Nike Air Griffey Max 1 “Flax.” Courtesy of Nike. ",

      "text": "Bella Hadid Body-Shamed For Being 'Too Thin' To Model For Nike The fitness brand has been accused of promoting eating disorders. 17/11/2016 16:25 Rosy Cherrington Style Writer, The Huffington Post UK \nBella Hadid has faced a wave of body-shaming on social media over her new contract with Nike . \nThis week the 20-year-old supermodel announced she was part of the Nike family, sharing some behind-the-scenes snaps of her first photoshoot on Instagram. \nBut hundreds of social media users have since criticised the decision, calling Nike “irresponsible” for choosing an “unhealthy” model, and claiming Hadid is “too thin” to represent a fitness brand. Jawad Elatab / Splash News \nSome people have gone as far as to accuse Nike of encouraging eating disorders in young women. \nA spokesperson for Beat , the UK’s leading charity supporting people affected by eating disorders, told The Huffington Post UK that it is dangerous for people to make judgements like this. \n“Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses,” they said. “It is not possible to tell just by looking at someone whether they have an eating disorder, and their causes are complex, including biological factors as well as social and environmental factors. A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 3:40pm PST \nThe charity acknowledged the importance of positive role models in the media, but warned about the effects of leaving body-shaming comments on the internet. \n“We encourage celebration of people for the things they do, rather than the way they look,” they said. \n“As a society, we all have a responsibility to promote healthy body image.” A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST \nNeither Nike or Hadid has made an official statement about the comments, but Hadid’s latest Instagram post - a shot of her working out alongside the caption “Everyday” - could be seen as a covert response to those claiming she shouldn’t represent a fitness brand. A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 16, 2016 at 6:40pm PST \nHadid has previously spoken out about body-shamers, telling People Magazine she finds the scrutiny difficult to deal with. \n“My weight fluctuates and so does everybody’s and I think that if people are gonna judge, that’s the worst you can possibly do because everybody is different,” she said.

      "text": "This undated photo provided by Nike shows their Lunar Epic Flyknit Shield running shoe. ( Nike via AP ) What A Trump Presidency Means For The Sneaker Industry \nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to renegotiate America’s international trade deals could have a costly impact on the U.S. sneaker market, according to a prominent market research company. \nContinue Reading Below \nTougher restrictions on China, which accounted for 66% of U.S. footwear imports in 2014, and on Vietnam, another key trade market, would keep sneaker prices high and could dissuade consumers from buying new pairs. That’s bad news for companies like Nike ( NKE ) and Under Armour ( UA ), whose stock prices have plunged considerably in 2016 amid industrywide headwinds. \n“While the GOP has traditionally been a party to support free trade and international trade deals, Trump’s position was for renegotiating the terms of key deals and he widely supported tougher trade terms with China – the nation’s top sourcing market. … Any change between U.S. and China trade relations is likely to impact the footwear industry,” NPD Group analyst Matt Powell , who tracks the U.S. footwear industry, wrote in a November 10 note. More on this... UFC 205's Record-Setting Night, By The Numbers \nTrump vowed throughout his campaign to crack down on perceived trade imbalances with China and to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. He was staunchly opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Barack Obama-endorsed agreement that would reduce import tariffs and promote freer trade between the U.S. and 11 other countries, including Vietnam and Japan. Republican lawmakers have said the deal will not pass Congress. \n“If the tariffs are eliminated or reduced under TPP, this increases the likelihood that footwear costs would be lowered and therefore retail prices could go down without sacrificing margin. Brands and retailers would sell more shoes and consumers would get a better deal,” Powell added. “By keeping tariffs in place, however, it’s likely that prices would stay high and consumers may be more inclined to purchase fewer shoes.” \nRepresentatives from Nike, Under Armour and German apparel brand Adidas did not respond to FOXBusiness.com’s requests for comment. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nThe TPP has been a divisive issue across both the political and financial spectrum. Nike, which manufactures footwear in Vietnam, said last May that the reduced import tariffs proposed in the deal would help the company create 10,000 jobs on domestic soil. \n“We believe agreements that encourage free and fair trade allow Nike to do what we do best: innovate, expand our businesses and drive economic growth. Nike has always led the way in product innovation, and now we will be able to accelerate our investments to continue to drive manufacturing innovation,” Nike CEO Mark Parker said in a statement. \nNew Balance, which operates five factories in Maine and Massachusetts and manufactures a significant portion of its sneakers domestically, is staunchly opposed to the TPP. The privately-held footwear brand argues relaxed trade regulations will make it more difficult for it to maintain operations in the U.S. \nNew Balance drew criticism on social media this week after a company executive praised Trump’s victory. \n“The Obama administration turned a deaf ear to us and frankly, with President-elect Trump, we feel things are going to move in the right direction,” Matthew LeBretton, New Balance’s vice president of public affairs, told the Wall Street Journal . The company later clarified that LeBretton’s comment was made in reference to the TPP. What do you think? ",

      "text": "  \nModel Bella Hadid may have just landed a campaign with one of the world’s biggest brands, but already the 20-year-old has been body slammed for being too thin. Featured Image VIA \nAfter becoming the new face for Nike, as well as getting a spot secured for next month’s Victoria Secret show, she decided to post her achievement to her many Instagram followers. A photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST \nBut it wasn’t long before people were commenting on Hadid’s post, claiming that her thin frame isn’t in line with the athletic ethos of Nike. Here are just a few comments from the online community: \nThis is why young girls get eating disorders, when being abnormally thin is glorified. Well done @nike. \nI love how so many athletic companies are signing models now and not athletes because they know people look up to models more then they lookup to people with real talent. \nNike? She’s not an athlete but more importantly it’s giving young girls unrealistic expectations yet again. \nWhy not use @theashleygraham come on now @NIKE have some sense. \nHadid has commented that she perhaps has been working a little bit too hard with the Victoria’s Secret trainer in the run up to the show in December: \nI’ve been eating hard protein every day, and working out for three hours every day. \nI don’t think it’s very fair to rip into Hadid and call her ‘abnormally thin’ when she’s clearly worked hard to get herself into shape. Fair enough if they want to point this out to Nike, which they have done, but she’s simply trying to make it in the modeling world. It’s just unfortunate that she landed a Victoria’s Secret deal at the same time as working for an athletic brand. After all, we all know Victoria’s Secret is that the models have to be incredibly slim – and walk like you’ve had lots of sex apparently .",

      "text": "Victor Cruz is equal parts football star and fashion standout. The next colorway of his Nike signature shoe is an example of the latter.\nThe “Light Bone” iteration of the Nike Air TR. V. Cruz arrives in select Nike stores and via the SNKRS app on Friday and will retail for $140. The look will be available on the app starting at 10 a.m. ET.

The latest edition of the shoe features a light bone upper that is executed in full suede and leather. The upper also boasts white highlights, including a profound eyelet — emblazoned with the word Cruz — approaching the shoe’s collar. The silhouette is completed with a white midsole and outsole.\nThe lateral side of the Nike Air TR. V. Cruz “Light Bone.” Courtesy of Nike. The medial side of the Nike Air TR. V.

The New York Giants receiver first wore the upcoming iteration at the Foot Locker “On Our Feet” gala in October, where the Super Bowl champion told Footwear News how he prefers to style sneakers with a suit or tuxedo.\n“For me, it’s got to be the right shoe. It’s got to be a specific height — preferably a low-top because the slacks come down, and it’s all about the tailoring,” he said. “You’ve got to let your tailor know you’re wearing those pants with a specific sneaker and tailor the pant a certain way so it’s streamlined and it looks good and not all bunched up at the bottom. Tonight I’m wearing the light gray [Nike] Air Trainer Cruz; this colorway comes out in December. I love this shoe mainly because it’s my shoe. I was a part of the design process, but I feel like it’s a dress-up and dress-down shoe — it covers so many different realms.”\nWant More? \nNike Made 50 Pairs of Pink Victor Cruz Sneakers for Breast Cancer Awareness \nHere’s How Victor Cruz, Matt Forte & Other Celebrities Style Sneakers With Suits and Tuxes \nTravis Scott & Victor Cruz Attend Givenchy Men’s Fall ’16 Show In Paris ",

Nike, Starbucks, and Gap Urge Trump to Stay in the Paris Climate Deal \nMore than 360 businesses and investors called on U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and world leaders on Wednesday to continue to support agreed curbs on global warming and to speed up efforts to move to a low-carbon economy. \nIn a statement addressed to Trump , U.S. President Barack Obama, members of the U.S. Congress and global leaders, the group, called 360+, reaffirmed its commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change. \nThe 360+ group includes companies such as DuPont dd , Gap gps , General Mills gis , Hewlett Packard hpq , Hilton hlt , Kellogg k , Levi Strauss & Co., L’Oreal USA, Nike nke , Mars Incorporated mars , Schneider Electric sbgsy , Starbucks and Unilever ul . \nThe Paris Agreement, aiming to phase out net greenhouse gas emissions this century, came into force on Nov. 4 and now has backing from 110 nations including the United States. \nThe Nov. 7-18 meeting in Marrakesh is where U.N. officials and government representatives are trying to work out the details of the pact. However, Trump ‘s victory in the U.S. election last week has overshadowed the event. \nTrump has threatened to tear up the U.S. commitment to the accord. \nThe 360+ group called on U.S. leaders to continue to participate in the Paris Agreement, support the continuation of U.S. commitments on climate change and continue to invest in low-carbon solutions at home and abroad. \n“Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness,” the group said, in the statement presented at U.N. climate talks being held this week in Marrakesh, Morocco. \n“Implementing the Paris Climate Agreement will enable and encourage businesses and investors to turn the billions of dollars in existing low-carbon investments into the trillions of dollars the world needs to bring clean energy prosperity to all,” the group added.

      "text": "Nike \nIn an effort to strengthen its direct-to-consumer business, Nike is reimagining its retail experience. New York City's Soho neighborhood is where the brand is making its stand, with a 55,000-square-foot store spread across five floors in a newly constructed building. But what makes this store different from Nike's other retail outlets in the city?\nChief among them are what Nike is calling \"immersive experiences.\" If you ever wanted to do a layup in a pair of Jordans before dropping some cash on them, now you can. Cameras in the store track your movements and progress in these experiences and upload it to the Nike+ app. The store is completely connected, intended to bridge the gap between digital and brick and mortar. Not only will it know your stride and the last time you got on the store's treadmill, it will know which shoes you tried on last time, too.\nA guided sales team will take time to be with you one-on-one for up to an hour, whether you're trying on running shoes or shooting baskets.\n\"We see [the store] as the global debut of the future of sport retail, and we see Soho as the start,\" Heidi O'Neill, Nike's president of direct to consumer initiatives, told Business Insider. \nThe store, which opens for business November 18, comes at a pivotal time for Nike, which is running into problems with select parts of its third-party retail business  and is shifting focus to its steadily growing direct-to-consumer division. Nike is hoping that it can take this store concept and apply it, either as a whole or in part, to other areas around the country.\nThe new Nike store is located in the heart of Soho, at the corner of Spring and Broadway. It's housed in a brand-new building at 529 Broadway, enabling it to take up a staggering 55,000 square feet across five floors. Nike \n\nAs you enter the store, the largeness of the store is immediately apparent. To the left are the stands where Nike will hold community events like meet and greets with designers (both inside and outside of the company), athletes, and celebrities. It's also where the local Nike run club will meet. The center of the store will showcase Nike's latest innovations — in this case, the self-lacing HyperAdapt 1.0. Nike \n\nNext to that are a few desks where customers can meet one-on-one with a Nike expert to talk about their needs and concerns with whatever product they're interested in. You can make a one-on-one appointment with Nike's digital platform, Nike+, for up to an hour. Nike \n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "title": "U.S. Companies to Trump: Don’t Abandon Global Climate Deal",
      "text": " count=\"257\" data-total-count=\"257\">Hundreds of American companies, including Mars, Nike, Levi Strauss and Starbucks, have urged President-elect Donald J. Trump not to abandon the Paris climate deal, saying a failure by the United States to build a clean economy endangers American prosperity. In a plea addressed to Mr. Trump — as well as President Obama and members of Congress — 365 companies and major investors emphasized their “deep commitment to addressing climate change ,” and demanded that he leave in place low-emissions policies in the United States.\n“Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk,” the companies said in a joint letter announced on Wednesday in Marrakesh, Morocco, where global leaders are determining the next steps for the Paris deal. “But the right action now will create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness.”\nThe companies also said that they would push ahead with their own targets to reduce their carbon footprints regardless of steps taken by Mr. Trump once he is in office. During his campaign, Mr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax , pledged to leave the Paris accord, dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency and undo Mr. Obama’s climate change policies.\n“This doesn’t change our commitments,” said Kevin Rabinovitch, global sustainability director at Mars, which has pledged to eliminate 100 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions from its factories and offices by 2040. “We’re doing this because we see a real business risk. We see a real business problem.”\nShort Answers to Hard Questions About Climate Change The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet.\nBusinesses large and small have scrambled in the days since Mr. Trump’s victory to chart their next moves in an uncertain regulatory situation. Mr. Trump’s campaign pledges and musings have been driven by the belief that the economy will grow faster if businesses are freed from cumbersome federal regulations, especially those that limit carbon emissions.\nThe president-elect has heightened environmentalists’ fears that his administration will take on an anti-climate, anti-environment bent by appointing the climate contrarian Myron Ebell to lead the E.P.A. transition. Climate change activists have denounced Mr. Ebell, whose Competitive Enterprise Institute has received funding from oil and gas interest groups.\n Some corporations, like the country’s largest automakers, have already seized on a potential upside to the president-elect’s leanings, urging a rethinking of stringent federal auto emissions standards. An easing of federal standards for passenger cars, which together with the rest of the transportation sector emit more carbon dioxide than any other part of the American economy, could have immense implications for overall emissions.\nOthers, like solar and wind power companies, have raced to find common ground with Mr. Trump, pressing for reassurances that his administration will not slash investment in renewable energy or alter federal tax credits on renewable energy projects.\n“Mr. Trump talks about infrastructure, he talks about jobs,” said Michael Skelly, founder and president of Clean Line Energy Partners, a company based in Houston that builds transmission lines for renewable energy.\nMore Reporting on Climate Change “What we’re creating are welding jobs, steel manufacturing jobs, in Kansas, Oklahoma, Iowa,” he said. “These are projects that create income for landowners, create jobs in the middle of the country.”\nThe stakes are high. Damage from climate change — especially from extreme weather events like hurricanes, flooding and drought — could shave as much as 5 percent off annual global gross domestic product by 2100, according to a study commissioned by the British government that is considered one of the most comprehensive.\nEnvironmental groups have been left with the daunting prospect that, with a climate skeptic in the White House, they will need to look directly to corporations to assume the mantle of leading the country’s response to climate change. But without strict regulatory standards or oversight, companies will be left freer to pick and choose which climate-friendly policies to pursue, and which they will choose to ignore or abandon.\nStill, some American corporations have already made significant efforts to reduce their environmental footprints. So reversing them now would be disruptive not just for the environment, but for their bottom line. And even with a move away from climate-friendly policies back home, American corporations face tightening regulations overseas.\n“Now more than ever, Levi Strauss believes it is important to reaffirm our commitment to address climate change by supporting the Paris Climate Agreement,” said Michael Kobori, the company’s vice president for sustainability.\n“Building an energy-efficient economy in the U.S. will ensure our nation’s competitiveness,” he said, “and position U.S. companies as leaders in the global market — all while doing the right thing for our planet.”",

      "text": "The top floor of the store features Nike's basketball collection. Nike\nIn an effort to strengthen its direct-to-consumer business, Nike is reimagining its retail experience. New York City's Soho neighborhood is where the brand is making its stand, with a 55,000-square-foot store spread across five floors in a newly constructed building. But what makes this store different from Nike's other retail outlets in the city?\nChief among them are what Nike is calling \"immersive experiences.\" If you ever wanted to do a layup in a pair of Jordans before dropping some cash on them, now you can. Cameras in the store track your movements and progress in these experiences and upload it to the Nike+ app. The store is completely connected, intended to bridge the gap between digital and brick and mortar. Not only will it know your stride and the last time you got on the store's treadmill, it will know which shoes you tried on last time, too.\nA guided sales team will take time to be with you one-on-one for up to an hour, whether you're trying on running shoes or shooting baskets.\n\"We see [the store] as the global debut of the future of sport retail, and we see Soho as the start,\" Heidi O'Neill, Nike's president of direct to consumer initiatives, told Business Insider.\nThe store, which opens for business November 18, comes at a pivotal time for Nike, which is running into problems with select parts of its third-party retail business and is shifting focus to its steadily growing direct-to-consumer division. Nike is hoping that it can take this store concept and apply it, either as a whole or in part, to other areas around the country.\nView As: One Page Slides The new Nike store is located in the heart of Soho, at the corner of Spring and Broadway. It's housed in a brand-new building at 529 Broadway, enabling it to take up a staggering 55,000 square feet across five floors. Nike As you enter the store, the largeness of the store is immediately apparent. To the left are the stands where Nike will hold community events like meet and greets with designers (both inside and outside of the company), athletes, and celebrities. It's also where the local Nike run club will meet. The center of the store will showcase Nike's latest innovations — in this case, the self-lacing HyperAdapt 1.0. Nike Next to that are a few desks where customers can meet one-on-one with a Nike expert to talk about their needs and concerns with whatever product they're interested in. You can make a one-on-one appointment with Nike's digital platform, Nike+, for up to an hour. Nike The women's dressing room at the rear of the store is referred to as a lounge. It's a large, well-lit area with dedicated salespeople. Nike The dressing rooms themselves are double the size of a standard dressing room at a Nike store, enabling stretching and lunging. You can also adjust the lighting in the rooms with a touch on a nearby panel — modes include \"Night Run\" and \"Yoga Studio.\" Nike On the second floor, customization is front and center. Nike is working with local artists to produce prints that can be customized on shirts and other apparel in limited two-week runs. Items can be customized while you wait. Nike On the second floor is both men's and women's sportswear, including shoes. It includes the largest wall of shoes to ever be built in a Nike store — more than 50 feet of some of the Swoosh's most popular models, with a focus on lifestyle and training. Nike The Soho store will be the best place to get limited-release sneakers, which can be reserved through the Nike+ app. Some of the brand's rarer designs will only be released through this particular store. Nike On the running floor, you can try out any of the shoes on a specialized treadmill with cameras that will track your running pattern and stride. Nike calls this an \"immersive experience,\" and it's one of three in the store. Nike A specialized Nike employee will help you test the shoe with a simulated run through two NYC running landmarks: Central Park and Riverside Park. Afterwards, you'll get a full rundown of your stride, and the expert will recommend certain shoes for you.\nThere's also a special section for Nike's collaboration Apple Watch. Nike There's an AstroTurf field — akin to the ones players might find in New York — where customers can test various cleats and put them through their paces. This is the only place where you can't test shoes from off the shelf, because of soccer's unique ability to wear out shoes. Nike The top floor is where things get a bit more interesting. With ceilings rising to a symbolic 23 feet (both Michael Jordan's and LeBron James' jersey numbers), this floor houses Nike's vast Jordan brand and basketball collection. Nike But the real highlight is the half-court basketball testing area seen here. Nike Enthusiastic trainers will whip you into shape and adjust their challenge and enthusiasm depending on each player's skill level. Nike The hoop is regulation size and height, but it can be lowered for special events. The screen below it shows iconic basketball arenas in NYC in order to simulate playing on them. Cameras above track your performance.

      "text": "Bella Hadid recently landed a major contract with Nike. (Photo: Getty Images) More Are professional athletes better ambassadors for athletic brands than celebrities? Olympic ice dancer Meryl Davis seems to think so, as she recently called out Puma and Nike for using celebrity faces. The Dancing With the Stars alum tweeted a collage of model Bella Hadid, who just landed a major contract with Nike, Kylie Jenner, who works with Puma , and two-time Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman, who is a spokesperson for Reebok. She captioned the image, “I’ll take the one promoted by the athlete please.” I'll take the one promoted by the athlete please pic.twitter.com/MRe1baOBtX \n— Meryl Davis (@Meryl_Davis) November 15, 2016 Davis’s point actually touches on a larger issue impacting nearly every retailer in the sportswear industry, one that’s especially present with the rise of athleisure. Using non-athletes to front activewear campaigns has always been controversial, but many brands still do it because of the major following that celebrities bring. “Just like with the athletes, the idea from the brand is to get some fashion credibility from celebrities that will make kids want to buy their shoes,” Matt Powell, sports industry analyst for research firm The NPD Group, told Fortune . Celebrities appeal to consumers for different reasons than athletes. When Kylie Jenner partnered with Puma in early 2016, the brand’s Global Director of Brand and Marketing said in a statement that she “represents a fresh and exciting new era for fashion and we couldn’t think of a more fitting and influential female to headline this campaign for PUMA.” Even though the brand’s choice to feature the young celebrity over an accomplished athlete was considered unconventional and even frowned upon by some, it’s undeniable that the 19-year-old has helped Puma’s sales to skyrocket. In the company’s impressive third-quarter results , Puma Chief Executive Bjørn Gulden said, “New product lines like the Fierce, the Platform, the Ignite Dual and the Fenty lines have shown to be “right” for the consumers and our marketing with personalities like Rihanna, Kylie Jenner, Cara Delevingne and, of course the unbelievable performance of Usain Bolt, have increased our brand heat.” Jenner fronts the campaign for the brand’s Fierce sneaker, and, as stated by Gulden, Rihanna’s influence is noteworthy. Her highly sought-after creepers bring in major sales for the brand. Rihanna celebrates the opening of the FENTY PUMA by Rihanna pop-up shops powered by SIX:02 on September 6, 2016 in New York City. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for FENTY PUMA by Rihanna) More The sneakers from her Fenty x Puma line recently won F ootwear News ’s award for Shoe of the Year , which is unsurprising considering the shoes sold out in just three hours when they were unveiled last fall. Although the brand relies heavily on celebrity influence, it still holds high profile partnerships with athletes like Italian professional soccer player Mario Balotelli and Bolt. Puma is far from the only brand to work closely with non-athletes. While Nike’s been a big proponent of athletes throughout its long history, the Oregon-based company jumped on the social media influencer bandwagon by bringing on 20-year-old Hadid. The model, who was actually training to compete in the Olympics as an equestrian but abandoned that ambition due to health issues, has walked runways around the world, fronted campaigns for prestigious designers, and landed a coveted spot in the upcoming 2016 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. Read More It’s an interesting move for a company that counts athletes including Michael Jordan, Serena Williams, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Cristiano Ronaldo among its contracted athletic elite. Hadid certainly doesn’t belong within the aforementioned group, but by appointing Hadid it’s obvious that Nike is trying to appeal to a larger audience beyond sports. Despite this trend, the brand’s sales of course will always be most substantially impacted by the high profile athletic endorsements it holds. Like Rihanna and Jenner’s influence in bringing Puma to the forefront, athletes have the same pull, if not even stronger, in boosting sales for companies. Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry is largely credited with bringing about the resurgence of Under Armour since signing with the brand in 2013. Earlier this year it was reported that sales of Curry’s signature basketball shoe are up 350 percent since the beginning of 2016, making them higher than sales of any Nike signature shoes except for Jordan. In Davis’s tweet she commends Reebok for using female athletes. The gold-medal winning gymnast Aly Raisman and UFC fighter Ronda Rousey are just two of the many strong women that the brand has partnerships with and featured in numerous adverts. Yet what Davis failed to mention is that Reebok’s not exempt from trying to leverage the popularity of celebrities. In fact, Reebok’s latest ambassador is none other than Bella’s older sister Gigi Hadid.

It wouldn't be possible without the athletes' commitment to me and their leadership in mentoring all of their training partners and each other,\" she said. \"I'm thankful to USA Track and Field, Nike and the University of Texas. I'm especially thankful to Gary Winckler, my mentor, who constantly told me when I was a runner that coaching was my gift.\" \nThe highlight of the year of course were her Olympians. \nMorolake Akinosun won gold for Team USA in the 4x100 meter relay by running the anchor leg in the semifinal round. She also was the alternate on the team for the 100 meters after finishing fourth at the U.S. Olympic Trials where she posted a personal best time and ran sub-11 seconds in all three rounds. \nCourtney Okolo closed the Games with a gold medal in the 4x400 meter relay for Team USA. She ran the opening leg in both the semifinals and the final, a change from her usual anchor leg for the Longhorns but one she welcomed as she handed the baton off with a big lead after each of her runs. \nIn her first full year as a professional runner, lifetime Longhorn Ashley Spencer had a storybook year with Buford-Bailey's guidance. At the Olympic Games in Rio, Spencer ran her way to a bronze medal performance in the 400 meter hurdles, an amazing feat after switching back to the event following a collegiate career focused on the 400 meters. \nSpencer also made history at the Olympic Trials as she attempted an unprecedented double. She tried to make Team USA in both the 400 meters and the 400 meter hurdles. She opened the meet by reaching the final of the 400 meters and finishing seventh. Spencer then turned her attention to the hurdles after three days off and ran her way to a silver medal over three races to earn her way to the Olympics and become the first American woman to qualify for the finals of both events at the U.S. Olympic Trials. \nOne other American coached by Buford-Bailey at the Games was current Texas senior Byron Robinson . He finished ninth in the men's 400 meter hurdles and missed making the final by just .01 of a second. Robinson posted a personal best time of 48.65 seconds during that semifinal race to cross third in his heat. \n\"The 2016 Season would be what I would call a journey. We talked about how important this season was going to be and what goals we wanted to accomplish. The focus was on the college season and to make certain that it carried on into the Olympic Trials and hopefully on to the Games,\" Buford-Bailey said. \"It took a lot of discipline and long-term motivation from the athletes and myself as their coach. We discussed how valuable that was to the process knowing it was going to be a long mentally challenging season for such young athletes. Ashley, Courtney, Morolake and Byron were all either in college or one year out and all but Ashley their first major international team.\" \nThe foundation for those impressive Olympic showings started during the Longhorns' season with Buford-Bailey seeing Okolo and Akinosun represent half of UT's winning 4x400 relay at the NCAA Championships, both indoors and out in 2016. The 4x400 team ran two times this year that rank No. 4 and No. 6 indoors in collegiate history, plus No. 9 outdoors. \nOkolo swept the indoor and outdoor NCAA titles in the 400 meters this year and shattered her own collegiate record outdoors with a time of 49.71 seconds at the LSU Alumni Gold. In her win at the NCAA Indoor Championships, Okolo ran 50.69 for the No. 3 time in collegiate history. Okolo also is one of three finalists for The Bowerman, the most prestigious award in collegiate track and field awarded by the USTFCCCA. \nAt the Big 12 Championships, Buford-Bailey's group dominated winning every sprint event on the women's side outdoors but the 100 meter hurdles and the 4x400 after the team title was already well in hand. \nAkinosun became the first woman in Big 12 Conference history to win either the 100 meters or the 200 meters three consecutive years as she won both events all three years she was a Longhorn. For her efforts she was named Big 12 Women's Outstanding Performer of the Year. \nFreshman Teahna Daniels also set the standard in 2016 for future freshman. She became the first freshman woman to ever win the 60 meter dash at the NCAA Indoor Championships. Daniels broke the school record and American junior record (Under 20) in the process, clocking in at 7.11 seconds in the final. That time ranks fifth all-time in collegiate history as well. \nThe men's sprint group also saw great success in 2016 with the school record in the 4x400 relay going down twice during the indoor season and once during outdoor. The outdoor record was 33 years old. \nZack Bilderback also became the first Longhorn to win the men's 400 meters at the NCAA Indoor Championships. He broke the school record in both the 200 and 400 in winning titles at the Big 12 Championships. \n\"I'm very fortunate as a coach to have athletes who believe in me and were willing to work together as a team on this journey to accomplish all the goals we talked about starting in September of 2015,\" Buford-Bailey said. \nAdditional Quotes from Athletes \nAshley Spencer Tonja has meant the world to me since 2011. She's been my second mom, my inspiration, my tough love and my right hand man. You can always depend on her and she's the type of woman who can demand 100-percent from her athletes who, in turn, will do anything and everything to be just that. I'm honored to have been able to call her my coach for all these years and I look forward to many more. \nMorolake Akinosun Coach Bailey is so much more than just my coach. She's a mother figure, advisor, mentor, friend and someone who believes in me. She cares about me and everyone that she coaches as a person first and then an athlete. She works tirelessly to make sure that all of us are the best possible version of ourselves and she's not in it for recognition. So I'm extremely happy for her and honored to be coached by the Nike Coach of the Year. \nByron Robinson Every blessing that comes Coach Bailey's way is well deserved and I personally couldn't be more happy for her. I'm so proud and honored to call her my coach. She's exemplary of a loving and passionate coach, mother and human being. I love Coach Bailey and wish nothing but blessings continue to come her way. \nCourtney Okolo Coach Bailey is a very talented coach. Over the years I've observed how can be in three places at once during practice and still give each athlete the attention they need. She is truly amazing and more than dedicated to the success of all her athletes.",

      "text": "Self-lacing Nikes on sale — for a big price KO By Kyle O'Brien - 17 November 2016 17:42pm The Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 \nIt costs a pretty penny if you don’t want to tie your own shoelaces. Those who want their shoes to work for them now have an option, thanks to the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0, a technological marvel of a sneaker with “adaptive lacing.” \nA limited number of Nike+ app users will have early access to the shoes, which will retail at $720, starting November 28 through the “Reserved for You” feature. Then the shoes will go on sale to the public starting December 1 at the Nike Soho store and the Nike+ ClubHouse at 45 Grand, both in New York, where consumers can also learn about and trial the new shoes. \nThe adaptive lacing technology automatically adjusts when the wearer puts them on. The shoe utilizes deep research in digital, electrical and mechanical engineering to fit each athlete. \n“When you step in, your heel will hit a sensor and the system will automatically tighten,” e xplained Tiffany Beers, senior innovator, Nike, Inc., and the project’s technical lead, on the Nike site . “Then there are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen. You can adjust it until it’s perfect.” \nThe technology is supposed to eliminate the undue pressure caused by laces being tied too tight and slippage from loose laces. \nThe HyperAdapt 1.0 will be available in black/white-blue lagoon and metallic silver/black-white colorways.",

      "text": "Starbucks , Nike and more than 360 other businesses and investors have called on President-elect Donald Trump and other world leaders to remain committed to the Paris agreement on climate change.\n\"Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk. But the right action now will create jobs and boost U.S. competitiveness,\" the group said in a statement released and presented at United Nations climate talks in Marrakesh, Morocco, on Wednesday .\nOther signers include conglomerate Unilever, chemicals giant Dupont, and technology company Hewlett Packard.\nThe Paris treaty was signed by nearly 200 countries to try and restore greenhouse gas emissions to sustainable levels by the year 2100 . A major goal is to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\nA number of the world's largest companies are urging President-elect Trump to remain in the Paris Agreement. Source: Mark Lennihan/AP Backers of climate change action are concerned because there's good reason to expect that the United States might try and walk back its efforts to limit emissions in Trump's administration.\nThe president-elect has called climate change a \" hoax ,\" promised to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency , and appointed Myron Ebell — who has argued greenhouse gas emissions could actually be beneficial — to lead his EPA transition effort.\nEven Exxon Mobile, the oil and gas multinational that has had a fraught relationship with climate change activists in the past, backs the Paris agreement.\nSuzanne McCarron, Exxon's vice president of public and government affairs, tweeted about the company's ongoing support of the treaty on Nov. 10, the morning after the election.\nThe Paris agreement is an important step forward by governments in addressing the serious risks of #ClimateChange https://t.co/X7JubyyArv\nOf course, other countries in the agreement may fight back in the event that the U.S. tries to back out.\nFormer French President Nicholas Sarkozy — who will also likely be his center-right party's nominee for President — has floated the idea of imposing a tariff on U.S. imports to make up for reneging on the Paris agreement's financial commitments.\nThat would need to be approved by other countries in the EU for it to have the desired effect, although it would pack a punch — Europe is still the United States' biggest trading partner.\nThe clock is ticking: September 2016 was the hottest September in 136 years , as long as records have been kept.",

      "text": "This is why it’s unfair to say Bella Hadid is “too thin” to be in a Nike ad Caitlin Gallagher Pin it Share More We want to live in a society that accepts every single body type — every. single. one. And that’s why it’s not OK for people to say that Bella Hadid is too skinny to model for Nike . While we totally get the frustration surrounding the media not featuring diverse body types , Hadid’s own body is not the problem here. There’s no need to body shame Hadid. And beyond the negativity, we know the model is going to be FIERCE in her new Nike campaign . Hadid excitedly shared the news that she’ll be representing Nike in a new ad campaign on Instagram. While she has over 529,000 likes on her post, some people took the opportunity to criticize her and the sports apparel company. One person commented that her thin body type is what leads girls to have eating disorders. Others were more angry at the fact that Nike had chosen a model to represent the company instead of an athlete. Even figure skater Meryl Davis , an Olympic gold medal winner, expressed disappointment in companies like Nike for using models instead of athletes on her Twitter page. I'll take the one promoted by the athlete please — Meryl Davis (@Meryl_Davis) November 15, 2016 Of course, we’d love to see more inclusive body types when it comes to depictions of women in advertisements. But it’s a complicated issue and we shouldn’t bring down Hadid in the process. Even though models being brand ambassadors for sports companies is nothing new (Bella’s own model sister, Gigi Hadid, is repping Reebok ), it should be noted that both Nike and Reebok have many athletes who do advertisements for them, too. Even Aly Raisman, who was in Davis’ tweet, works for Reebok. And Nike featured a 86-year-old triathlon athlete who is a nun! The focus of these campaigns is also usually on fitness — like Gigi’s spot for Reebok, which shows her doing an intense boxing workout. As Bella has been preparing for the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, she has been dealing with backlash about her body already, telling People that people have claimed she lost too much weight recently . Despite Bella’s love of pizza , she followed a strict diet and worked out three hours a day to achieve her new look. So she’s worked hard to be as toned as she is and we expect that will be on full display for her Nike campaign. Anyone who exercises — and that should be everyone — can use the things Nike sells, like sneakers and workout apparel, no matter their body type. Of course, Bella has been graced with genes that have made her an international model, but that doesn’t mean she’s “too” much of anything to represent the company. “My weight fluctuates and so does everybody’s and I think that if people are gonna judge, that’s the worst you can possibly do because everybody is different.” PREACH.",

      "text": "Loading... \nNike’s partnership with retail giant Nordstrom continues with a new pop-up location in Chicago focusing on women’s sportswear. Nike first announced the Seattle spot in mid-October with some crispy Air Max 90s featuring city-specific laser-etched graphics, and this weekend’s grand opening of the Nike x Nordstrom Chicago will feature the yet another exclusive. Their Air Max 90 is limited to just fifty pairs and will be available exclusively at the new spot this Saturday. In addition to those lasered shoes, Nike will also have the Beautiful x Powerful Collection available to shoppers on Sunday. \nLast night, Nike celebrated the grand opening with special guests Sanya Richards-Ross, Skylar Diggins, Olivia Kim of Nordstrom, and actress/YouTube personality Andrea Russett. Check out some selects of the event last night and the upcoming shoes right ahead. ",

      "text": "Scientists are worried that Donald Trump's ascension to the White House will speed the rise of global temperatures. × Starbucks, Gap, Nike and others demand Trump to stand by climate deal Scientists are worried that Donald Trump's ascension to the White House will speed the rise of global temperatures. NEW YORK – If President-elect Donald Trump is going to go soft on climate change regulations, big business is going to put up a big stink. \nIn an open letter on Wednesday, Starbucks, Gap, Nike, L’Oreal, and hundreds of other American businesses joined together to tell Trump that they are committed to fighting global warming. And they implored the future president — who has called climate change a hoax —to keep the current low-carbon policies championed by President Obama. \n“We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy,” they wrote, adding “failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.” \nMore than 300 businesses signed the letter. It was announced in a press conference during the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) currently being held in Morocco. \nTrump said during his campaign that he would pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Climate Agreement. The 175 signatories to the non-binding treaty, including the United States, are committed to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases as a way of fighting climate change. \nBusiness leaders are not the only ones concerned over Trump’s climate change stance. Scientists have questioned what a refusal of the Paris Agreement would mean for the environment, and have expressed concern over Trump’s signaling that he will place climate change deniers in top White House positions. \nBy Danielle Wiener-Bronner, CNN ",

      "text": "Nike Flyknit Racer (Triple Black) November 18, 2016 Posted by: Shay Tags: Nike , Flyknit Racer \nThe Nike Flyknit Racer was a game-changer when it first dropped. At the time, Flyknit was a revelation and the sneaker’s lithe silhouette was celebrated both on track and on the high street simultaneously. After an initial range of ultra-bright iterations and then some super special treatments, à la hand-dyed indigo , we finally get a ‘Triple Black’ colourway. Already well and truly sleek, the lightweight runner looks incomparably streamlined in the total tonal takeover. The patterned Flyknit weave of the upper shows no other hue and is adorned with a blacked-out Swoosh. Finished with a dark outsole and a Volt insole, the latest Flyknit colourway is text-book perfection. \nNo offical word on a release date as yet for the Nike Flyknit Racer Triple Black. Stay tuned. \nMore Nike Flyknit Racer",

      "text": "Nike Inc. boosted its quarterly dividend to 18 cents from 16 cents, marking its 15th consecutive year of higher payouts.\nThe sportswear and sneaker giant said the dividend and its $12 billion buyback plan announced last year reflect its continued confidence in producing \"sustainable, profitable growth and strong cash flows.\"\nThe dividend has a Dec. 5 record date and is payable Jan. 3. Based on Thursday's closing price, the new payout provides a 1.4% yield. In after-hours trading, shares rose 5 cents to $51.64.\nOn Sept. 27, the company posted a higher profit and an 8% increase in quarterly sales, but futures orders were lower than a year earlier.\nNike has been facing increasing pressure from Under Armour Inc. and Adidas AG in its domestic market.\nWrite to Josh Beckerman at josh.beckerman@wsj.com\n 17, 2016 17:35 ET (22:35 ",

      "title": "Starbucks, Gap, Nike And Others Demand Trump Stand By Climate Deal",
      "text": "If President-elect Donald Trump is going to go soft on climate change regulations, big business is going to put up a big stink.\nIn an open letter on Wednesday, Starbucks, Gap, Nike, L’Oreal, and hundreds of other American businesses joined together to tell Trump that they are committed to fighting global warming. And they implored the future president — who has called climate change a hoax —to keep the current low-carbon policies championed by President Obama.\n“We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy,” they wrote, adding “failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.”\nMore than 300 businesses signed the letter. It was announced in a press conference during the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) currently being held in Morocco.\nTrump said during his campaign that he would pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Climate Agreement. The 175 signatories to the non-binding treaty, including the United States, are committed to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases as a way of fighting climate change.\nBusiness leaders are not the only ones concerned over Trump’s climate change stance. Scientists have questioned what a refusal of the Paris Agreement would mean for the environment, and have expressed concern over Trump’s signaling that he will place climate change deniers in top White House positions.",

      "text": "Nike just released a pretty sweet pack as they link up with tennis legend Roger Federer to drop the Nike Tennis Classic Ultra RF Pack. The pack is comprised of two different colorways done in a premium/luxe fashion. Let’s take a closer look at the two.\nComing in your choice of Black and White or a tonal Wheat, both iterations will come constructed out of a nubuck upper accompanied by the Nike Swoosh on the paneling done in perforated fashion. Inside the shoe you will find a neoprene bootie for added comfort and style. Additional features on the shoe include the tonal waxed laces with gold tips, pull tabs on the heel, White rubber midsoles and the Nike branded leather tassels. RF (Roger Federer) branding appears on the tongue tab to help give the shoe even more of a unique look. The Nike Tennis Classic Ultra RF Pack is available in-store only at the Nike x Kith Shop as well as in KITH for the retail price of $200.\n \nvia: KITH \nAuthor’s Take Very nice, especially the Wheat pair. I’d be down to pick up a pair for this Fall season.\n\nAvailable Now on Kixify \nThe post The Nike Tennis Classic Ultra RF Pack Comes In Two Premium Offerings appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "  Understanding the Difference Between Apple Watch Nike+ and the Standard Apple Watch \nNew to the market is the Apple Watch Nike+ edition. It brings a few new features of its own, yet sells for the same price as the regular Apple Watch Series 2. This begs the question, are there any significant differences beside just looks? Additionally, are you able to get the exclusive Nike+ bands or any of the Nike+ software features for your regular Apple Watch? Let’s run through the list to compare. Is there more to the Apple Watch Nike+ than just the cool bands? | Photo: Anna Hoychuk / Shutterstock.com Nike+ Bands and Models \nLet’s start with the obvious. If you’ve seen the Apple Watch Nike+ you know that the bands are different than regular Apple Watch bands. They’re essentially just sport bands, but with stylistic perforations in them so they breathe a little better around your wrist. Two out of four also feature Nike’s signature volt yellow color. \nYou can’t buy any other model of Apple Watch and choose to get the Nike+ band later. Photo: Apple \nThese bands come alongside your Apple Watch Nike+ and nowhere else. You can’t buy them separately and therefore can’t buy any other model of Apple Watch and choose to get the Nike+ band later. (Some knockoffs are available on Amazon, but we can’t in good conscience endorse those.) \nThe Nike+ models are available in four color combinations: black/volt, black/cool gray, silver/volt and silver/white. The bands with black in them come with a space gray aluminum Apple Watch and the bands with silver come with a silver one. They’re all available in either 38 mm or 42 mm sizes for $369 and $399 respectively. \nThe Apple Watch Nike+ is not available in Series 1 either. The bands and branding only come alongside Series 2 , which adds swim-proof casing, a brighter display and GPS. Nike+ Watch Faces \nIn addition to the bands, the Apple Watch Nike+ comes with several exclusive watch faces. The most notable is the one you see in product images with Nike’s big bold font displaying the digital clock, plus customizable complications on the left and bottom. There are other options though, some with a traditional analog clock too. \nBoth the watch faces and the volt color option for them are not available on other Apple Watches. Photo: Apple \nThese watch faces also feature one new signature color option: volt yellow. When you’re customizing your watch face to pick a color, the Apple Watch Nike+ lets you choose volt (separately from regular yellow) to match the Nike branding. \nBoth the watch faces and the volt color option for them are not available on other Apple Watches. These are two features exclusive to your Apple Watch Nike+ purchase. Nike+ Run Club \nThe Nike+ Run Club is also available as an iPhone app and an iMessage app. \nNike+ Run Club is an Apple Watch app that lets you time and track your runs plus compete against friends to achieve goals. The app sends motivational reminders about the weather or your friends’ progress to get up and get going. It uses the Apple Watch’s GPS to track where you ran and draws out a map of your run. Nike+ Run Club also takes advantage of the iOS/watchOS Health app and built-in heart rate monitor to record your health data. \nThe Nike+ Run Club is also available as an iPhone app and an iMessage app . Therefore, it’s available on all Apple devices and not just exclusive to the Apple Watch Nike+. While it’s also not preloaded, Apple Watch Nike+ buyers do get a special prompt while setting up their new Watch to install the Run Club app right away. Photo: Apple \nIn summary, the only exclusive features of the Apple Watch Nike+ are the bands, watch faces, and on-screen volt yellow color. It shares all other features with the Apple Watch Series 2. Run Club is available for any Apple Watch. More from Guiding Tech",

      "text": "Yuriko Nakao/Reuters \nStarbucks, Nike, Gap, and hundreds of other businesses have signed an open letter to president-elect Donald Trump urging him not to repeal key policies that protect against global warming.\n\"We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy,\" the letter reads. \"Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.\" \nMore than 300 companies signed the letter, requesting that Trump continue policies that regulate carbon emissions and move forward with implementing the Paris Climate Agreement — a non-binding treaty between the US and more than 100 other countries to reduce greenhouse gases.\nTrump has advocated for the US to pull out of the agreement. He has also referred to climate change as a \"hoax\" perpetrated by China to make US manufacturing non-competitive.\nBut many businesses disagree, according to the letter. \nBarry Parkin, chief sustainability officer at Mars Incorporated, released a statement on the letter saying: \" This is an important moment in global political and economic history, and we absolutely must come together to solve the immense challenges facing the planet. Climate change, water scarcity and deforestation are serious threats to society.\" \nNOW WATCH: McDonald's responds to Burger King's prank disguising its restaurant as the 'ghost of McDonald's' \n",

She captioned the pic, “I’ll take the one promoted by the athlete please.”\nBella ‘s mom Yolanda Hadid has come to her defense and told TMZ that her daughter competed in equestrian riding from when she was 3 until she was 15, when she was diagnosed with Lyme disease.

All eyes were on the matchup between Karl-Anthony Towns and Joel Embiid with Towns rocking the Nike Hyperdunk 2016 while Embiid wore the adidas Light Em Up 2. Towns wound end up getting the better of this one as he outplayed Embiid in helping leading Minnesota to a decisive 110-86 win. \nTowns’ teammate Zach LaVine brought out some heat as he rocked the Nike Air Zoom Kobe 1 FTB. And while that shoe might normally headline the top kicks of the night, LaVine was outshined by Miami’s James Johnson as he wore the same model, but in an even rarer colorway—an original Kobe Bryant PE edition featuring Bryant’s No. 24 embroidered on the side. Out in Houston, adidas’ premier basketball athletes faced off as James Harden and his Harden Vol.1 “Pioneer” went up against Damian Lillard and his adidas D Lillard 2 “Shark Black.” Harden would finish the night with another triple-double as Houston defeated Portland 126-109. \nThe rest of the night in NBA kicks is just a few clicks away.

      "text": "Meryl Davis Slams Bella Hadid's Nike Campaign, Yolanda Hadid Speaks Out \nMeryl Davis thinks the athleticwear brands should only use athletes in their ad campaigns and she’s not happy with Nike for hiring Bella Hadid to model in a new campaign. \nThe Olympic figure skater took to her social media page to share a collage featuring Bella in Nike , Kylie Jenner in Puma, and Aly Raisman in Reebok . She captioned the pic, “I’ll take the one promoted by the athlete please.” \nBella ‘s mom Yolanda Hadid has come to her defense and told TMZ that her daughter competed in equestrian riding from when she was 3 until she was 15, when she was diagnosed with Lyme disease. She even had dreams of going to the Olympics in the sport. \n“You obviously don’t have to be an athlete to wear or enjoy Nike wear,” Yolanda said. \nWHO DO YOU AGREE with on the matter – Yolanda Hadid or Meryl Davis?

      "text": "  AnalogFolk Wins Global Work for Nike Training Advertisement Comment \nNike has expanded its relationship with London-based AnalogFolk, officially adding the shop to its global agency roster. This means the shop’s offices in New York, Portland, Hong Kong and Sydney will almost certainly be working on the account as well. We’re excited to partner with Nike Training globally! pic.twitter.com/8O6kGv5fWZ \n— AnalogFolk (@AnalogFolk) November 17, 2016 \nThe size, scope and specifics of the win are not yet clear; we’ve tried to get Nike to elaborate for the last 24 hours, but they have simply confirmed their reputation for being nonresponsive. \nFor context, AnalogFolk is not a “traditional” agency; their tagline involves using digital to make the analog world better, and their specialties include “Retail innovation” and “Stuff that hasn’t been invented yet.” \nBut their homepage gives us a clear clue about the new contract: AnalogFolk helped develop the Nike Trainers Hub, which is a “1:1 connection tool and intelligent database designed to help all athletes take their training to the next level.” In other words, it’s a mobile platform/web interface that allows would-be athletes to interact with real trainers and serves as part of the Nike+ Training app, which was developed (at least in part) by R/GA. So it’s sort of like the Football Pro Genius App developed by AKQA, but completely different. Can you tell we’ve never used it? \nAt any rate, expect AnalogFolk to be behind some of Nike’s tech work in coming years. Just not their ads.",

      "text": "Bella Hadid's Mom Defends Her Nike Campaign After Meryl Davis' Comments \nBella Hadid ‘s mom is defending her after she was called out by Olympic athlete Meryl Davis for her Nike campaign. \nThe Olympic figure skater thinks the athleticwear brands should only use athletes in their ad campaigns and she’s not happy with Nike for hiring Bella to model in a new campaign. She took to her social media page to share a collage featuring Bella in Nike , Kylie Jenner in Puma, and Aly Raisman in Reebok . She captioned the pic, “I’ll take the one promoted by the athlete please.” \nBella ‘s mom Yolanda Hadid has come to her defense and told TMZ that her daughter competed in equestrian riding from when she was 3 until she was 15, when she was diagnosed with Lyme disease. She even had dreams of going to the Olympics in the sport. \n“You obviously don’t have to be an athlete to wear or enjoy Nike wear,” Yolanda said. \nWHO DO YOU AGREE with on the matter – Yolanda Hadid or Meryl Davis?

      "text": "Olympian Slams Puma and Nike for Using Kylie Jenner, Bella Hadid in Ads \nThem’s fightin’ words! By Rachel Torgerson Nov 18, 2016 On Tuesday, Bella Hadid announced she was fronting Nike’s newest campaign and social media backlash was almost immediate. Commenters deemed her “too thin” to model for an activewear brand and said the ad was just another example of “why young girls get eating disorders.” Now former Olympian Meryl Davis is weighing in, saying she stands with the haters. Oh, and she’s not a fan of those Kylie Jenner Puma ads either. Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Davis, an ice dancer who won gold in Sochi in 2014 (and won season 18 of Dancing With the Stars ) tweeted out a collaged picture of Bella wearing her Nike swoosh, Kylie in a Puma sports bra, and Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman wearing her collection with Reebok. “I’ll take the one promoted by the athlete please 💪🏼,” she captioned the image, obviously taking a dig at Bella and Kylie. I'll take the one promoted by the athlete please 💪🏼 pic.twitter.com/MRe1baOBtX — Meryl Davis (@Meryl_Davis) November 15, 2016 For her part, Bella admitted that she may have shed too many pounds while preparing for her first-ever walk down the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show runway. “I didn’t really mean to [lose weight],” she told People of her workout routine. “Like I want boobs. I want my ass back. But it’s not my fault. My weight fluctuates and so does everybody’s and I think that if people are gonna judge, that’s the worst you can possibly do because everybody is different.” Later on, one commenter also pointed out that Bella actually ~is~ an athlete and her dreams of being on the Olympic equestrian team at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games were dashed because of an on-going battle with Lyme disease — a chronic condition she shares with her mother and former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star, Yolanda Hadid, and her brother, Anwar Hadid. While this is all going down on Twitter and Instagram, the activewear retailers will probably be concerned with just one thing: sales. Only time will tell whether Bella and Kylie, or professional athletes will win out in the end from a revenue standpoint.

      "text": "Bella Hadid's Mom Defends Her Nike Campaign After Meryl Davis' Comments \nBella Hadid ‘s mom is defending her after she was called out by Olympic athlete Meryl Davis for her Nike campaign. \nThe Olympic figure skater thinks the athleticwear brands should only use athletes in their ad campaigns and she’s not happy with Nike for hiring Bella to model in a new campaign. She took to her social media page to share a collage featuring Bella in Nike , Kylie Jenner in Puma, and Aly Raisman in Reebok . She captioned the pic, “I’ll take the one promoted by the athlete please.” \nBella ‘s mom Yolanda Hadid has come to her defense and told TMZ that her daughter competed in equestrian riding from when she was 3 until she was 15, when she was diagnosed with Lyme disease. She even had dreams of going to the Olympics in the sport. \n“You obviously don’t have to be an athlete to wear or enjoy Nike wear,” Yolanda said. \nWHO DO YOU AGREE with on the matter – Yolanda Hadid or Meryl Davis?

      "title": "Starbucks, Gap, and Nike Have a Warning for Donald Trump",
      "text": "Hundreds of major companies are fearing that the environmental policies of a Trump presidency might seriously hurt the environment--and their businesses.\nMore than 300 firms--including Starbucks , Nike , and Gap--signed an open letter to P resident-elect Trump urging him not to repeal policies that safeguard against global warming. Specifically, the companies are asking him to continue regulating carbon emissions and move forward with the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement--a non-binding treaty between the U.S. and more than 100 countries to cut down on greenhouse gases.\n“We want the U.S. economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy,” the letter says. “Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.”\nTrump has previously urged the U.S. to pull out of the Paris Agreement. He’s previously referred to climate change as a hoax “created by and for the Chinese”:\nThe concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 \n\nHowever, many major corporations consider climate change to be a more urgent peril.\n“This is an important moment in global political and economic history, and we absolutely must come together to solve the immense challenges facing the planet,” Mars Incorporated’s chief sustainability and health and well-being officer, Barry Parkin, wrote in the letter. “Climate change, water scarcity and deforestation are serious threats to society.”",

      "text": "Starbucks, Gap, Nike And Others Demand Trump Stand By Climate Deal Photo by Getty Images \nIf President-elect Donald Trump is going to go soft on climate change regulations, big business is going to put up a big stink. \nIn an open letter on Wednesday, Starbucks, Gap, Nike, L’Oreal, and hundreds of other American businesses joined together to tell Trump that they are committed to fighting global warming. And they implored the future president — who has called climate change a hoax —to keep the current low-carbon policies championed by President Obama. \n“We want the US economy to be energy efficient and powered by low-carbon energy,” they wrote, adding “failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk.” \nMore than 300 businesses signed the letter. It was announced in a press conference during the 22nd session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 22) currently being held in Morocco. \nTrump said during his campaign that he would pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Climate Agreement. The 175 signatories to the non-binding treaty, including the United States, are committed to reducing the emission of greenhouse gases as a way of fighting climate change. \nBusiness leaders are not the only ones concerned over Trump’s climate change stance. Scientists have questioned what a refusal of the Paris Agreement would mean for the environment, and have expressed concern over Trump’s signaling that he will place climate change deniers in top White House positions.",

      "text": "1 of 3 LOS ANGELES, Nov. 18 (UPI) -- Yolanda Hadid defended daughter Bella Hadid this week after the 20-year-old was announced as the newest Nike spokesmodel.\nThe 52-year-old Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum responded in an interview with TMZ to Olympic figure skater Meryl Davis criticizing Bella's campaign for the athletic wear company.\n\"You obviously don't have to be an athlete to wear or enjoy Nike wear,\" she said after stressing that Bella was an accomplished equestrienne before she was forced to quit competitive riding due to chronic Lyme disease.\nDavis had posted a side-by-side photo of Bella in Nike, reality star Kylie Jenner in Puma and Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman in Reebok, writing, \"I'll take the one promoted by the athlete please.\" In addition, many social media users suggested on Instagram that Bella is too thin to represent Nike.\n\"Nike? She's not an athlete but more importantly it's giving young girls unrealistic expectations yet again,\" one person wrote.\n\"Yeh this is why young girls get eating disorders, when being abnormally thin is glorified. Well done @nike,\" another added.\nđso excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE @NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon â¤ď¸đđ\nA photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST\nHadid herself was diagnosed with chronic Lyme disease in 2012, and revealed in October 2015 that Bella and son Anwar Hadid also have the condition . Bella, who shared a photo of her treatment in August, previously confirmed her illness ended her competitive riding career.\n\"It affected my memory so I suddenly wouldn't remember how to drive to Santa Monica from Malibu where I lived,\" the model told ES magazine. \"I couldn't ride. I was just too sick. And I had to sell my horse because I couldn't take care of it.\"\n\"If I'd had the chance to succeed in riding, I might not have modeled,\" she admitted. \"I didn't know that I was going to get sick.\"\nBella, the younger sister of model Gigi Hadid , is known for her modeling work with Balmain and Chanel. She will walk in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for the first time in December.\nLike Us on Facebook for more stories from UPI.com Related UPI Stories Gigi Hadid responds to Tommy Hilfiger weight remark The Weeknd and Bella Hadid split after almost two years Gigi Hadid, Jay Pharoah to host 2016 American Music Awards Gigi and Bella Hadid land 2016 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show",

      "text": "\nBella Hadid’s Nike ad is getting skewered by the public because many are noticing the model appears much too thin to be considered athletic (think of Serena Williams, Ronda Rousey and Hope Solo), and some people probably think she looks too skinny to be even considered healthy.\n????so excited to announce that I am OFFICIALLY PART OF THE @NIKE FAMILY! More coming very soon ❤️ \nA photo posted by Bella Hadid (@bellahadid) on Nov 14, 2016 at 10:15am PST \n\nIt all started when Meryl Davis, an Olympic gold medalist figure skater, took to Twitter to criticize Bella Hadid’s Nike ad. The reason she called it out is because she does not agree with sports-related corporations, such as Nike, using non-athletes to promote their brands, as reported by E! News . Davis’s followers naturally agreed with her and many of them responded with the concern that the new Nike spokesmodel looks too thin in the ad.\nI have to admit that she does look underweight in the ad, and not at all does she personify fitness or athleticism. This, however, does not mean she’s not a very attractive young lady whose look is better suited for high fashion and editorial content. I’m sure she’s a photographer’s dream.\nBella Hadid’s Nike ad is far from the first to draw public disapproval for promoting “unhealthy” and/or “unrealistic” expectations of women. In April, an ad by Gucci was banned in Britain after people expressed ire at it featuring an underweight-looking model, according to The Huffington Post .\nIn 2015, also in the U.K., a Protein World ad was banned after a large number of Brits complained that it “objectified women,” as well as promoted idealistic aims for weight loss, according to The Guardian . The ad features an attractive, thin, busty blonde in a bikini. To the left of her are the words “Are You”, and to the right of her it says, “Beach Body Ready?”\nBella Hadid’s Nike ad has more similarities to Protein World’s ad than Gucci’s, as the former two are encouraging of athleticism, though do not show traditionally athletic bodies of female form. Does it bother people more that supermodels are being used in sports-related advertising, like in the case of Meryl Davis, or are people more bothered by the quixotic nature they promote?\nAs it turns out, I am able to share a unique perspective on this issue, as I’m a survivor of anorexia, and “unrealistic” advertising of the female body poisoned my mind quite a lot during the years I battled the disease.\nI think it’s common knowledge that Bella Hadid’s Nike ad, like all advertising, is a computer generated creation. No human is as perfect as they’re tailored to look in magazines, billboards and the like, so they must be perfected. This obsession with perfection, I believe, is noxious to the developing brain of an adolescent.\nBella Hadid sporting the Nike symbol in New York City on July 13. [Image by Star Max/IPx/AP Images] According to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), marketing images, like the one in Bella Hadid’s Nike ad, play a huge role in how we see the world, often setting unhealthy standards of beauty that have the power to impact us throughout our lifetimes.\n“The effect of media on women’s body dissatisfaction, thin ideal internalization, and disordered eating appears to be stronger among young adults than children and adolescents. This may suggest that long-term exposure during childhood and adolescence lays the foundation for the negative effects of media during early adulthood.”\nThe is a huge concern in the society we live in, because let’s face it, there are not a lot of unattractive, non-ideal celebrities out there. Do you think Kim Kardashian, who is essentially famous for being famous, would be as well-known as she is if she wasn’t easy on the eyes?\nWhen I was an adolescent, my idea of beauty could not have been classified as healthy, and because of my belief that “skinny equals pretty” I starved myself and lost around 40 pounds, becoming significantly underweight at the age of fifteen. I stunted my own growth thanks to malnourishment, which bugs me to this day.\nI’m not suggesting there were not other factors at play in my case, but negative body image was a big one for me.\nI find myself feeling encouraged by the collective annoyance Bella Hadid’s Nike ad conjured up among the online community, because it means people are recognizing the negativity the marketing niche is capable of spreading.\nIf ya missed it, meet bombshell behind 2015's Protein World ad https://t.co/9YEFQOdPvc pic.twitter.com/cAwhOyEKk7 \n— Daily Star (@Daily_Star) January 12, 2016 \n\nHadid and Nike, however, are far from the only companies and models promoting unattainable images of beauty. I happen to think it’s not as bad as it was twenty years ago, but it still has a long way to go. It’s not limited to portrayals of skinny females either. According to NEDA, men’s muscle magazines provide the same kinds of quixotic goals and expectations. The perfection of advertising also plays a role in the highly successful field of plastic surgery.\nBella Hadid’s Nike ad, despite what people think of it, does have the potential to do harm. Young women and girls compare themselves to the models they see in advertising, often coming to the incorrect conclusion that they’re imperfect for not being able to achieve the same look, when nothing could be farther from the truth.\n[Featured Image by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images]\nBella Hadid’s Nike Ad: Perfection In Advertising Is A Problem And Needs To Be Addressed [Opinion] is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",
