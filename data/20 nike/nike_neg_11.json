      "text": "Photo via Nike You can finally own self-lacing shoes—but it's not going to be cheap or easy. \nMovie-inspired footwear has generated plenty of excitement in 2016, and an equal amount of disappointment. Keep that in mind as you take a look at Nike's Back to the Future -inspired HyperAdapt 1.0. \nThe self-lacing sneakers seem like a no-brainer for fans of the time-travel franchise, especially after hoverboard technology landed far short of where we imagined it would be back in 1985. But there are two big caveats likely to dampen excitement for Nike's self-lacing shoes: price and availability. \nYou'll have to lay down a cool $720 if you want to get your hands on a pair of these high-tech kicks. For the same money, you could buy a brand new PlayStation 4 Pro and an Xbox One holiday bundle, and still have cash left for a few packs of bubblegum. Not only does that put the shoes far outside the price range of most consumers, it also means you'd be a fool to actually wear them and risk degrading their value. \nSomething similar happened earlier this year when Aliens fans were disappointed to discover that just 426 pairs of Ripley's \"Alien Stomper\" boots and 1,986 pairs of Bishop's mid-top sneakers were available after Reebok hyped the shoes for weeks. The original price tag was a more manageable $174, but a quick sweep through eBay shows resale values in the $700-800 range. \nWhat kind of market does that leave for the HyperAdapt 1.0? We're pretty much down to hardcore sneakerheads. Nike Nike If you fit into that category, there are a couple ways to nab a pair, and they're just as discouraging as the price. The shoes will be available on Dec. 1 at Nike's Soho store and the Nike+ ClubHouse in New York City. Be forewarned: Customers need to book appointments through the Nike+ app to try them on. A news release from Nike also states that a small group of Nike+ app users will get early access to purchase the shoes on Nov. 28, but it's unclear what users (and how many of them) will get a shot at the sneakers. \nNike says both color variations of the shoes—black/white-blue lagoon and metallic silver/black-white—will be available at additional select stores and the Nike+ app later in December, but there's no date or details on just how many pairs will be available. When the Daily Dot asked for more specific numbers, a representative for Nike responded only that the shoes are available in \"limited quantities.\" \nEarlier this year Nike produced a total of 89 Nike Mag sneakers —more direct replicas of Marty McFly's self-lacing shoes. The shoes were distributed via a charity lottery in partnership with the Michael J. Fox foundation.",

NikeLab stores in New York, London, Paris, Milan, Shanghai and Hong Kong have also provided opportunities to experiment in retail design and explore sustainable materials, adaptable furnishings and various local integrations. \nWith a thematic focus on uniting nature and technology, the seventh NikeLab store, NIKELAB MA5, uniquely engages the senses — through interior and exterior directional sound systems, a scent exclusive to the store and soft track flooring material made using Nike Grind, a palette of premium recycled and regenerated materials. \nAdditionally, Nike designers worked with long-term engineering partner, Arthur Huang, founder of design firm Miniwiz, to incorporate Japanese culture and traditions. Tatami mat floors pair with locally sourced wood walls in the digitally-powered fitting rooms; the same wood appears on modular display cubes alongside Nike Grind display benches, allowing for seamless restructuring around the store. \nNIKELAB MA5 opens on December 1 with a special display of the latest NikeLab ACG collection . The entrance of NIKELAB MA5 featuring the Holiday 2016 ACG collection, which has advanced weather protection, seamless integration with past and future ACG apparel and adaptable elements like interior strap systems and adjustable collars.",

First up was the ripest fruit on the family tree, the Air More Uptempo , but now we’re getting a closer look at some of the lesser-known, yet equally sweet fruit. The Air Uptempo 97 is all about that crazy midsole, those rounded triangular midsole pods, the wavy extended air unit – there’s a lot going on down there. The black upper keeps it low-key, with some similar elements built in when you look up close. \nThe Nike Air Uptempo 97 ‘Black/White’ will be available December 6 from select stockists, including online from Overkill . \nMore Nike Uptempo",

In the months that have followed, we’ve seen a plethora of fresh colourways, as well as the introduction of the Air Zoom Talaria Flyknit Mid that adapted Tinker Hatfield’s unique runner into a hardy sneakerboot fit for the looming Northern Hemisphere winter. After a number of tonal drops, the Swoosh have channeled the balls-out spirit of the ’97 original by hitting the weather-resistant revision with the Talaria’s signature colour blocking of neon, black and white. This is one sneakerboot for those that like to snap necks all year round. \nNo official release date has been announced for the Nike Air Zoom Talaria Flyknit Mid in ‘Neon’, but we’ll keep you posted as we have any updates.",

Forecasted prices have undulated and dates have played musical chairs but the HyperAdapt has finally been locked down for a December 1 release. It’ll sting you $720USD (which is still a lot better than the original $1k) and be available through a selective process you can read-up on here . \nAs the days to release dwindle, Nike have released the most detailed look of the shoe yet.

Twitter/@IramFlorCamacho Stumble \nCleanup in — every aisle. \nEmployees at a Nike store were left with a nightmare cleanup after thousands of shoppers rushed through aisles of the store on Black Friday, throwing empty shoeboxes, chunks of cardboard and mismatched shoes in their path. \nHundreds of shoe boxes were thrown on the floor and discarded, CBS Seattle affiliate KIRO-TV reported. \nThe sight was so shocking people who dropped by the Nike factory store at the Seattle Premium Outlets in Tulalip, Washington, took to social media to provide evidence of the store’s destruction. \n“The wake of consumerism at the #Nike Factory Store is savage,” customer Larry Downer posted on Facebook early Saturday morning. “Found Davis some basketball shoes, saved a lady from drowning in a sea of orange boxes, and sprained my neck from shaking my head so much. Yikes.” \nThe video went viral with more than 190,000 views and received dozens of comments. \nThe wake of consumerism at the #Nike Factory Store is savage.

      "text": "With Nike out of the game, Tiger Woods switches to Bridgestone ball Posted by Liam McGuire on Nov 28, 2016 12:20 With Tiger Woods being forced to find new equipment with Nike out of the picture, his preferred ball is an unexpected choice. \nNike announced back in August a full closure of their golf brand. Woods, a Nike faithful, whose most iconic moments in his storied career have been assisted by the brand , was left to make a decision in new equipment in his comeback attempt. \nAs Woods prepares for his next tournament, he surprisingly revealed to ESPN.com his new ball of choice is a Bridgestone golf ball. \n“The most important thing is the ball,” he said. “Once you find a ball, then you can work around everything else. The ball is No. 1. The most important club in the bag is the ball.” \nWhile Woods plans to still use Nike Irons, but shifting from a Nike Ball to a Bridgestone is not the expected choice. With Woods changing balls, one would think he’d go with a big player in the sport, like Titleist (which he used to play with before going to Nike) or a Callaway ball. Bridgestone makes good balls, but if Woods was switching from Nike, you’d think he’d go somewhere else. The biggest stars that use Bridgestone balls are Matt Kuchar and Brandt Snedeker and… no a lot of others. The Bridgestone site prominently features players like Fred Couples and Nick Price who do their playing on the Champions Tour. \nWoods pumped up the Bridgestone ball like it’s golf’s great tool, so perhaps he’s landed a sponsorship deal with the brand. Regardless, it’s going to be strange to see Woods hit anything but a Nike ball. Let’s see if the change can resurrect his limping career. \n[ ESPN.com ] About Liam McGuire Staff writer for The Comeback. I also write for Awful Announcing and Vice Sports.

      "title": "A Nike Store In Seattle Got Completely Destroyed By Black Friday Shoppers",
      "text": "https://twitter.com/komonews/status/803065810277175296 \nFor some reason, no phrase brings out the worst in people quite like “Black Friday shopping.” The second someone gets the opportunity to save money on a potential gift, said person becomes hyper-aggressive and will fight another human being in an attempt to get the best deal possible. It’s absurd, and every once in a while, a store gets destroyed because of greedy shoppers.\nAn example of this happened over the weekend in Seattle, when a bunch of people tore up a Nike store on Black Friday. According to SB Nation , 20,000 people made their way through the store and caused it to look like a total mess.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BNQSIsKBQNx/ \nBuzzfeed reached out to one shopper who recorded a video of the store after it was ripped apart and said that he had to save a woman from “drowning in a sea of orange boxes.” As he told Buzzfeed, “I thought there was an earthquake that happened.”\nWanting sneakers is obviously fine, but doing it in a way that destroys a store, makes the lives of employees exponentially more difficult, and causes other shoppers serious headaches is never cool. Hopefully no one got hurt in what was certainly a chaotic scene, and hopefully all of the employees who are tasked with cleaning this up get paid overtime.\n",

There are also buttons on the side of the kicks to further adjust their fit. \nThe Cavaliers don't have to worry about Irving's fit this season. He's averaging 24.8 PPG, 4.6 APG and 3.1 RPG for the defending champs, who lead the Eastern Conference with a 13-2 record. \n-- Nick Ostiller ",

Its cognac leather upper conceals winter ready fleece lining, while remaining tough and handsome to behold.

After securing access the undisclosed location, Covetuer were also able to shoot some pictures of what is displayed inside. \nWhen you picture the space in which Nike archive their technological progress you’d likely picture something akin to a lab environment. A room with clean enamel surfaces and reimagined Arne Jacobsen furniture occupied by technicians with white gloves. Yet, while there were white gloves, the DNA looks more like a time capsule of the era Nike was born from. \nAcross cork walls shoes are propped up next to handwritten Post-it notes , with models on display from 70s right up to the unreleased VaporMax . Pivotal models that birthed annual upgrades are shown beside those that never made it to release. Memorabilia from the Back to the Future movies is there, as well as gems like the very first ever Air Max shoe from 1987. \nPeruse here, and get the full story from Coveteur . \nMore Nike",

      "text": "Email \nSOHO, Manhattan — A new Nike store that was expected to be a big hit has instead angered SoHo residents and created a crowding issue in the popular shopping area. \nThe New York Post reported that the 55,000 square-foot store, which opened on Nov. 18, has been drawing large and unruly crowds that clog sidewalks and block store entrances. \nA number of SoHo residents are fed up with the new neighborhood nuisance at Broadway and Spring Street. \nThe Post quoted longtime SoHo resident Pete Davies, who said he heard “crazy screaming” and described the scene as “a nightclub” around 11:30 a.m. on the store’s opening day. \n“I was sitting in my [home] office with the windows closed when all of a sudden I heard all this crazy screaming,” Davies told the Post . “It looked like a nightclub, not a store. There were big guys like bouncers out front yelling and pushing people.” \n“It was a ridiculous mess. One of the most disruptive events of this type I’ve ever seen,” Davies said. \nA doorman at a nearby Broadway building told the Post crowds blocked sidewalks in the area and even building entrances across the street from their sportswear destination. \nNike has reportedly assured neighbors that they have a “crowd control” plan in place, according to the Post . Locals said they have not seen any measures put into place. \nThe store is an outlet which sells exclusive shoe designs and features a digital interactive basketball court. Another feature is Nike’s “Swoosh Saturdays” which are another concern for SoHo residents. These “Swoosh” events reportedly attract large crowds since they typically feature a celebrity guest or an athletic event, and neighbors said they dread these events because of the potential for an even bigger disturbance. \nConstruction began on the store two years ago, and SoHo residents have resisted it every step of the way. Despite a zoning law that limits retailers to 10,000 square feet, the Nike store was able to build a 55,000 square-foot store due to a loophole in which city officials considered the project a building “alteration,” the Post reported. \nDepartment of Buildings spokesperson Joseph Soldevere told the Post the project was reviewed “numerous times” and was determined to have “complied with the NYC Construction Codes.” \nAccording to CurbedNY , the controversial store was supposed to open on Veteran’s Day, but was delayed due to a rescinded DOB permit and protest from the neighborhood. \nCity leaders joined the protest , calling the new store a burden to an already over-saturated shopping area and a threat to the historic character of the neighborhood. \nThe DOB reportedly wanted to review the building’s electrical and plumbing systems before allowing the store to open. 40.723041 -73.998786 ",

      "text": "Nike Air Zoom Talaria Flyknit Mid (Neon) November 29, 2016 Posted by: Matt Tags: Nike , Talaria \nNike surprised us all earlier this year by reviving the Air Zoom Talaria in OG form – eye-popping tennis ball yellow and all . In the months that have followed, we’ve seen a plethora of fresh colourways, as well as the introduction of the Air Zoom Talaria Flyknit Mid that adapted Tinker Hatfield’s unique runner into a hardy sneakerboot fit for the looming Northern Hemisphere winter. After a number of tonal drops, the Swoosh have channeled the balls-out spirit of the ’97 original by hitting the weather-resistant revision with the Talaria’s signature colour blocking of neon, black and white. This is one sneakerboot for those that like to snap necks all year round. \nNo official release date has been announced for the Nike Air Zoom Talaria Flyknit Mid in ‘Neon’, but we’ll keep you posted as we have any updates.

      "text": "With so many Nike Sportswear silhouettes having been treated to the Triple Black colorway the last couple of years, it makes you wonder why the uber popular Flyknit Racer has been left out.\nFor those of you that have been asking yourself the same question, Nike has heard you and will be giving you what you want. This week we’ll see the release of the Flyknit Racer in the Triple Black colorway which looks exactly what you’d think it would look like. Black takes over the breathable Flyknit upper as well as the laces, tongue, branding, midsole, and outsole.\nCheck out how the sneakers look on-feet in the images above and look for them to hit retailers on November 30, 2016 for a retail price of $150.\nimages: Overkill \nAuthor’s Take I’m a really big fan of the Flyknit Racer, but I’ m just not the biggest fan of all-black sneakers. I prefer the Blackout pair that released earlier this year that looked identical to this colorway but with a white midsole.\n\nThe post On-Feet Images Of The Nike Flyknit Racer Triple Black appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Nike And Foot Locker Look To The Finish Line Nov.29.16 Davis For NYS Summary \nFinish Line has been in my opinion a third tier company behind names like Nike, and my top choice, Foot Locker. \nThe athletic wear space is an incredibly tough market to compete in. \nThe sector has upside. \nI like all three names moving forward and think that finish line can be stuck with. Finish Line (NASDAQ: FINL ) has been in my opinion a third tier company behind names like Nike (NYSE: NKE ), and my top choice, Foot Locker (NYSE: FL ). Owners of Nike and Footlocker need to be aware of Finish Line as it is a profitable company with over 1,000 Finish Line branded locations in U.S. malls and shops inside Macy's (NYSE: M ) department stores. The athletic wear space is an incredibly tough market to compete in, with names like Nike and Foot Locker simply taking a large chunk of the market share. Still, it does not mean that Finish Line through its many different store-front brands cannot deliver wealth generation, but they have to deliver. Why do I say this? Well, to me it all comes down to performance, cash flow and expectations. Finish Line has been holding its own considering that it has been in business for so long and continues to grow. The stock is just a point under a 52-week high, so it has been a good one to own this year. We know that for the most part Nike and Foot Locker continue to beat estimates, but just what is going on with Finish Line? After a few so-so quarters, the company has started to deliver beats. In its most recent quarter, Finish Line delivered a top line beat and an in line bottom line. Consolidated net sales were $509.4 million, an increase of 5.4% over last year's quarter, while same-store sales increased by a strong 5.1%. These sales numbers beat estimates by a $14.4 million. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.53 hitting consensus estimates. These numbers are strong and we do know is that the stock is a point off of a 52-week high, and while I continue to like both Foot Locker and Nike, I think Finish Line has some upside potential. You are just better off buying Foot Locker long-term, but I see a profitable opportunity with Finish Line. Sam Sato, chief executive officer, shed some light on the quarter: \"Following a solid start to the year, our comparable store sales accelerated during the second quarter. The combination of top-line growth and disciplined expense management allowed us to partially offset the planned gross margin pressure from our successful inventory reduction actions and deliver earnings in-line with expectations. With our enhanced supply chain now operating efficiently, our focus shifts to streamlining our organizational structure to optimize productivity, adapt more quickly to market changes and better serve our customers. I am pleased with how we continue to execute our plan for fiscal 2017 while at the same time taking the necessary steps to position the company for long-term profitable growth.\" I want to point out that one big positive is the company is trying to be more shareholder friendly. In Q2 Finish Line repurchased 1.0 million shares of common stock, totaling $21.3 million. It has 5.3 million shares remaining on its current Board authorized repurchase program. The company had no interest-bearing debt and has $114 million in cash and cash equivalents. It also recently hiked its dividend to $0.10, which I see as being raised soon. All in all, it is going well. Further, Finish Line looking ahead to fiscal year 2017, the company still expects Finish Line comparable store sales to increase in the 3% to 5% range and earnings per share to be between $1.50 and $1.56. I would stay long this name. At the end of the day, Finish Line is doing what it needs to compete. I like this. I think the stock has upside here as does Foot Locker and Nike. I love the share buybacks and the dividend. While I prefer Foot Locker for the longer-term, this one deserves consideration. Note from the author: Christopher F.

      "text": "Nike Declines Despite Its Aim To Be Bolder And Bigger, Adidas and Under Armour Closing In By Nathalie Fox   29, 12:37 am The commercial made by Nike comprises some of our favorite football players. (Photo : YouTube funnyraptorex) \nNike's Chief Executive Mark Parker made a public pledge that he will make its company become bigger and bolder. He predicted that Beaverton-area juggernaut's sales will explode from $30 billion to $50 billion by 2020. There are only a few who questioned it given its impregnable position when it comes to athletic footwear and apparel. \nHowever, it seemed that Nike is a long way off since its rival Adidas has become the top story of 2016. Two years ago, Adidas was considered to be dead in the water particularly in North America, but it boomed its way to sports and pop culture that it currently sustained double digit sales. \nOf course, Nike continues to grow in its athletic footwear and apparel industry. But, Adidas, not to mention, Under Armour are growing faster that they are gaining market share from The Swoosh for the first time as memory is concerned. \nAn analyst from Stifel Financial Corp Jim Duffy said that although Nike had a terrific run, but Adidas experienced the opposite. Adidas acted together which made it gain shares and he further said that it will gain more. \nD.A. Davidson analyst Andrew Burns said that he has seen no mis-execution at Nike. According to Oregonlive , Nike's pipeline of new products has run dry. He also criticized Nike's groundbreaking footwear technology Flyknit that it has been around for four years but it cannot take credits forever. \nFlyknit is said to be great but motivation is lacking. Besides, the flyknet technology was used by Nike to beat Adidas during the Olympics according to Highsnobiety . Canaccord Genuity analyst Camilo Lyon echoed those sentiments saying that the new products offered by Nike are weak and uninspiring. \nSince Mark Parker became the CEO a decade ago, Wall Street noticed that the stocks of Nike have declined by 17.5 percent, which is more than $19 billion market value loss. However, the company insisted that it is even stronger and it still aims to grow bigger and bolder as declared by its CEO. \n  Sign up for our Newsletter Most Popular",

Yikes.” \nThe video went viral with more than 190,000 views and received dozens of comments. \nSeveral others also shared photos of fallen towers of shoes, which nearly covered every inch of the floor. \nAccording to Buzzfeed , roughly 20,000 people passed through the store between 9 p.m. Thursday and 10 p.m. Friday. \nNike has not yet returned CBS News’ request for comment. \n© 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Two Legendary Investors Like These Stocks (NKE, RCL) By Dan Moskowitz | November 28, 2016 — 2:06 PM EST \nGeoff Wilson is the founder of Wilson Asset Management. According to the Financial Review in Australia, Wilson likes NIKE, Inc. ( NKE ) and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. ( RCL ). It should be noted that Wilson Asset Management doesn’t charge any fees and donates all profit to charities. \nMatthew Halkyard of Ironbridge Capital is also a fan of Nike and Royal Caribbean. He said, “There have only been three times in the last 10 years you could have bought Nike at a discount and right now Adidas has got a hot hit with its Stan Smith range.” \nHis point is that the recent hit for Adidas won’t last, and that it has presented a discount opportunity to buy NKE for the long haul. He also pointed to Nike’s direct-to-consumer business growing at a 50% clip year over year as a longer-term catalyst. \nHalkyard is concerned about the schizophrenic reaction to the United States presidential election results, and he believes that the stock market is assuming a lot will go right next year. However, this hasn’t dissuaded him from being bullish on NKE and RCL. \nHalkyard likes Royal Caribbean for much different reasons. The first reason is today’s consumer prefers experiences over merchandise. He is likely referring to Millennials , but this wasn’t specifically stated. His second reason for liking Royal Caribbean is that only 1% of Chinese travelers take cruises, and he believes that percentage will grow in the future. \nNKE has depreciated 22.10% over the past 12 months, and it currently offers a dividend yield of 1.40%. The stock is trading at 23 times earnings . The short interest is low at 2.57%, but that’s actually high for NKE. \nRCL has depreciated 10.36% over the past 12 months and currently offers a 2.31% dividend yield. The stock is trading at 15 times earnings. The short interest is relatively high at 8.85%.

      "text": "Who's to Blame? Nike or Consumers? (NKE) By Dan Moskowitz | November 28, 2016 — 1:42 PM EST \nThanksgiving Day and Black Friday did not go well at the NIKE, Inc. ( NKE ) store at Seattle Premium Outlets in Tulalip, Washington. According to The Huffington Post, a Nike employee told BuzzFeed that 20,000 shoppers passed through the store between 8 a.m. on Thanksgiving Day and 10 p.m. on Black Friday. \nThat’s the good news. The bad news is that those consumers trashed the store. If you watch the videos (easy to find online), you will see that there are orange Nike boxes scattered all over the store. A customer by the name of Larry Downer told KTRK, “It looked like an earthquake just rocked the place.” Downer also stated that he had never shopped on Black Friday and never will again. After searching for a pair of LeBron James shoes for his son, finally finding the box, and then seeing that there was only one shoe inside, he had enough. \nManagement at this Nike location was obviously unprepared for the influx of customers shopping for discounts. On the other hand, you can ask whether or not there was any way to prevent such a mess. Apparently, some customers were kicking and stepping on shoe boxes with no regard. Who was at fault can be debated, but there is another factor here that can’t be debated. \nIf this store saw 20,000 customers walk through its doors over a two-day period, then you can rest assured that demand for Nike products remains high. While this is only one location, this store only made the news because of an incident. This massive traffic might indicate that traffic at other Nike stores was also high, and that demand for Nike products remains high despite increased competition from Adidas and Under Armour. \nNKE has depreciated 22.10% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 1.40%.",

      "text": "51.01 -0.51 Shoppers finally got their hands on Nike 's self-lacing, \"Back to the Future Part II\"-inspired sneakers after it went on sale in the U.S. Monday. \nThe HyperAdapt 1.0 shoe, which will retail at $720, is Nike's \"first step into the future of adaptive performance,\" the brand claims. In real language, that means the hi-top sneaker can sense how snugly it should be laced, without the wearer having to tighten and loosen it manually. \nThe 'original' shoe was featured in the film where Marty McFly, played by Michael J Fox, puts on the trainers whose Nike logo lights up as they lace themselves. A video showing Nike's new product has been watched more than 4 million times. \nIt's not the first time movies have inspired products that then went on to be created in real life, though it may be one of the longest waits fans have had for such items – \"Back to the Future Part II\" was released in the U.S. on 22 November 1989, just over 27 years ago. \nThese are our picks of the products inspired by the big screen. \nRoald Dahl's 1964 novel, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" was made into a film in 1971 and both featured the \"perfect candy bar,\" the Wonka Bar, named after its maker Willy Wonka. It was inevitable that a real chocolate bar of the same name would be launched, with Quaker Oats (which is said to have financed the film) initially planning to produce the sweet treats. Nestle now lists Wonka as a brand that \"opened its doors in 1983\" and following the 2005 movie, it made golden ticket bars, however Wonka-branded products now appear to be unavailable. \n\"Sixty percent of the time, it works every time,\" goes the strapline for Sex Panther cologne , a men's fragrance that was first featured in the 2004 movie \" Anchorman ,\" which character Brian Fantana states is \"illegal in nine countries.\" Tru Fragrance (which also makes men's products with names like Chancellor, Steel Spur and Stud) now sells the aftershave for $40 a go, but be warned: The carton actually growls when opened. \nThe flying game made famous by the Harry Potter franchise now has its own governing body, overseeing 500 teams in 26 countries. The International Quidditch Association was founded in 2010, after two Vermont students started organizing intercollegiate matches three years earlier. There are some obvious differences between games, although broom (sticks), seekers and chasers (goal scorers) are involved in both. The IQA website makes clear that it is not associated with author JK Rowling or producer Warner Bros, and is a nonprofit business. \nThe 1994 movie \"Forrest Gump\" featured Tom Hanks (playing the eponymous hero) eventually going into the shrimp business with Benjamin Buford Blue, nicknamed \"Bubba\". Just two years later, the first Bubba Gump Shrimp Co opened in Monterey, California, a partnership between film rights owner Paramount Pictures and Rusty Pelican Restaurants Inc. Its website currently lists 43 restaurants in the U.S., Japan, Mexico, Malaysia and U.K. \nFox Movies' 2002 \"Minority Report\" features ads for Lexus and Guinness targeting Tom Cruise's character, John Anderton, by name as he walks through a mall. His eyes are scanned and he's also recognized by American Express and is shown an ad as one of its customers. So far, so much product placement. With brands already using artificial intelligence to personalize campaigns to people, this kind of marketing could soon become a reality. \nBut it doesn't have to be creepy: in 2012, charity Plan UK used facial-recognition technology for its out-of-home advertising, showing ads using the line \"I can see you looking at me,\" serving up different content depending on the sex of the viewer, to highlight the importance of girls' education in developing countries. \nThe 1988 Tom Hanks movie \"Big\" arguably invented the tablet computer. No manufacturer picked up on it, probably because the internet was barely in existence by then. In one scene, Hanks pitches it as a kids' toy, saying: \"There's this flat screen inside with pictures on it and you read it. And when you get down to the bottom you have to make a choice of what the character's going to do...\" \n\"Like if he's going to go in and fight the dragon then you have to push one of the buttons. ... See, there's a computer chip inside which stores the choices, so when you reach the end of the page, you decide where the story goes. That's the point.\" \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .",

      "text": "\nIBM and Nike may be great places to work, but they're fighting a bruising war for digital talent—where even Google is taking some hits. \n[Photo: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg via Getty Images] Maureen Mullen 11.29.16 5:00 AM \nWant to know just how much or how well a given company is innovating? Take a look at the talent it attracts—or loses. These days, acquiring and hanging onto top-notch tech talent isn't easy. IBM is your dad, and Google is his younger brother. Both are kind of lame, but your Uncle Joe drives a Porsche. \nPlenty of companies are fooling themselves that they're keeping their digital skills current simply by changing job titles and adding roles that include the term \"digital.\" The number of professionals on LinkedIn calling themselves \"chief digital officer\" grew from 965 in 2015 to 3,255 in 2016—a 237% increase. \nThat semantic shift conceals a stark reality: A select handful of companies—those that have always lived and breathed digital technology (not to be confused with those other \"digital natives\" )—are sucking up top-notch tech talent, leaving everyone else to pick over the scraps. The Invisible (Working) Hand \nSome things remain true that have long been so. According to our research here at L2 , it's clear that a solid brand makes a company beautiful to strangers. If your company has a reputation as a tech innovator, tech talent will come a-knocking. What's changing, though, is that some of the most traditionally aspirational employers are struggling as a result. \nTake Nike for instance. It's regularly ranked as one of the best companies to work for, and it's consistently more popular than other top consumer brands like L’Oréal, P&G, and LVMH. But Nike’s popularity still pales in comparison to digitally native technology companies. Searches for Amazon, Facebook, or Google \"jobs\" outpace searches for \"Nike jobs\" by an order of magnitude. \nIn fact, it appears there's already been an exodus of digital talent from agencies to digital-native companies. WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, and Interpublic Group bleed talent to Facebook and Google. Based on L2’s analysis of LinkedIn data, the two tech giants employ 2,227 people who have worked at WPP, while WPP has only attracted around 124 former Facebook or Google employees—a net loss of over 2,100 people. \nEmployees who leave agencies tend to be high-value, too. Their expertise tends to beat out the experience of those moving in the opposite direction. Many of the people that agencies can hire away from Facebook or Google are often student ambassadors or interns who weren't given full-time offers by the tech giants. \nYou can almost hear the dejected whispers in the HR departments of the biggest ad firms: \"They get our best people, and we get their interns.\" All In The Family \nWhere do tech companies get their talent? From each other. But all things aren't equal. Legacy tech players are ceding talent to the new titans. Microsoft, in fact, is the top source of talent for all other tech firms. There are nearly 13,000 previous Microsoft employees currently working at the other 10 digitally native companies we examined. \nNot surprisingly, Yahoo is also losing top digital talent to its competitors. While most digital-native companies have also sourced talent from IBM, it's younger organizations like Pinterest and Snapchat that are now sourcing talent from Google. IBM is your dad, and Google is his younger brother. Both are kind of lame, but your Uncle Joe drives a Porsche and is less lame than Dad is. \nThat places the older digital-native juggernauts in something of an unfamiliar position. Google, which makes massive investments in human capital (in terms of compensation as well as culture perks like onsite food and professional training), is seeing a strong \"yo-yo\" phenomenon—employees who leave often return. So while Google loses a lot of talent, it gets some of it back. The likes of Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb have no trouble luring away [Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon] alums with offers of equity. \nIn fact, Google has more yo-yo'ers than the other digital natives combined, which seems to validate the ROI on those features of its work culture. The rest of the Big Four (Facebook, Apple, and Amazon) also consistently attract talent from other digitally native tech companies, including younger ones. At the same time, though, the likes of Uber, Lyft, and Airbnb have no trouble luring away Big Four alums with offers of equity, which many top tech workers still find appealing. \nThe few firms that have had some success pulling people out of major tech companies have a few things in common: \n1. Proximity to tech hubs. Walmart, whose recent acquisition of Jet.com signals its focus on an omni-channel self-reinvention, leads the way. Opening a San Bruno, California, location has helped the retailer recruit more than 300 workers from the Big Four—including 218 from its biggest rival, Amazon. \n2. Targeting specific firms. Nike has hired several staff recruiters from Apple and used them to recruit leading store personnel who can deliver next-generation retail experiences. In similar fashion, Kimberly-Clark has targeted Amazon, poaching e-commerce leaders who, in turn, have helped the company pull in additional talent. In fact, 6% of Kimberly-Clark's e-commerce team comes from Amazon. And an impressive 46% of the Amazon employees they’ve recruited have arrived with at least 10 years of experience. \n3. Executive access. There's also a pattern of brands successfully recruiting with title inflation and—no surprise here—keys to the executive washroom. L’Oréal, for example, managed to recruit a chief digital officer from Instagram by offering a seat on the executive committee. \nStill, the trend is overwhelming: The youngest digital-native tech companies are vacuuming up their elders' best and brightest. The quarterbacks and prom queens of yesterday find themselves sitting alone at the reunion as people line up to get a selfie with the captain of the chess team, who's just started a SaaS firm. \nAnd while there are tactics the old guard can employ, their still-powerful cache isn't as impressive as it once was. More and more these days, they're pushing a rock uphill. \nMaureen Mullen is chief strategy officer and cofounder of the business intelligence firm L2 . Never miss a story.

      "text": "Privacy policy | More Newsletters AP, File An image of the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 is projected on a screen as Nike CEO Mark Parker speaks during a news conference, Wednesday, March 16, 2016, in New York. Nike's first power-lacing sneaker is finally on sale, but most people hoping to get their hands on the futuristic shoe will need to head to New York City, at least for now. The Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 shoe, which mimics technology from the movie \"Back to the Future II,\" is only on sale so far at two stores in SoHo, for $720. Some Nike Plus app users are also being given offers to purchase the shoe through the app. See It: Woodley Makes Emotional Plea at Pipeline Protest The HyperAdapt allows users to make the fit looser or snugger on the fly by pressing buttons on the side of the shoe. It will be released to more stores in December, as well as to Nike Plus app users, according to a company news release. Nine Injured in Intentional OSU Attack: Officials Ohio State University officials give an update on the car and knife attack that placed nine pedestrians in the hospital after a male suspect rammed into them with a car and slashed at them with a butcher knife early Monday morning on Nov. 25, 2016. (Published Monday, Nov. 28, 2016) Nike has said that the potential for shoes with adaptive lacing is huge because it provides tailored-to-the-moment custom fit. When users step into the shoe, their heel hits a sensor. They can press two buttons on the side to adjust the grip. Nike says in the future, the process won't be manual, and a sensor could sense when the user needs to have the shoe tighter or looser. Evan Rachel Wood Shares 'Confession Letter' of Sex Assault The self-lacing shoes in \"Back to the Future II\" were Nikes as well, and according to an article in Wired magazine in October, Nike designers worked with filmmakers to come up with the idea. It took 28 years for the technology to go from silver screen to city streets. \"I'm more excited about this than any project I've ever been involved with,\" one of those designers, now Nike Vice President of Creative Concepts Tinker Hatfield, told Wired.

      "text": "Toddler who couldn’t walk is now a budding gymnast and fashion designer \nHowever, you may need to sell the DeLorean to afford them. The futuristic kicks retail for $720. \n\"We tested them in running, training and basketball,'' Nike senior innovator Tiffany Beers said on TODAY. \"We want you to use them and abuse them and tell us what you think of them.\" \nThe TODAY anchors tried them out in the studio Tuesday and were impressed. \n\"Why don't you just hire somebody to lace them for you?\" Al Roker joked. \nHere's the rundown: The sneakers are battery-powered and tighten to fit your foot when you stand and your heel hits the back. Nike.com Don't want to worry about tying your shoes? Nike has you covered. \nThey can be loosened or tightened by pressing small buttons, and they make a cool sound while doing so, just like the ones Marty McFly pulled on in the hit 1989 sequel. \nAn LED in the heel lights up when the shoes are tightening and also to signal that the battery is low. \nRELATED: How these parents of 4 ‘disconnect from virtual world and plug into real one’ \nAnd you'll also need to add the sneaks to the list of household gadgets that require charging, like your phone and your tablet. \nThe battery that enables the shoes to tighten takes three hours to fully charge, and each charge lasts for two weeks. \nThe shoes come in two styles, black/white-blue lagoon and metallic silver/black-white. \nThe new Nikes are the latest prescient moment predicted by \"Back to the Future II,\" which also showed the Cubs ending their 100-plus-year World Series title drought, though the movie was off by a year. \nFollow TODAY.com writer Scott Stump on Twitter.",

Customers took to social media to show the aftermath of Black Friday sales, where, evidently, people just starting throwing opened shoe boxes everywhere while looking for the right sizes. \nSeriously, look at these pictures: Black Friday after war at Seattle Nike Outlet pic.twitter.com/eIsabW5RTE — Sneakers Game (@sneakers_game) November 26, 2016 Seattle shoppers don't play. Black Friday did this to the Seattle Nike Outlet. Full Video: https://t.co/yBhpaBKlhd pic.twitter.com/2AYb3TjTCM — Sneaker News (@SneakerNews) November 27, 2016 \nAccording to Washington’s Fox Q13 network , the store didn’t close until midnight, and it was scheduled to reopened at 5 a.m., meaning the Nike employees only had a few hours to clean up the disaster zone. On the bright side, at least some people got some slightly discounted running shoes.",

      "text": "Professionals Start to Pick Up Nike Anti-Clog Boots Tuesday, November 29, 2016 Tuesday, November 29, 2016 When Nike first unveiled its revolutionary Anti-Clog traction system earlier this year, people's reactions where almost unanimously positive. The only criticisms that could perhaps be heard once dust settled was that it looked odd that Nike didn't make Anti-Clog the default soft ground sole plate option instead of the regular 'SG-Pro' and that its professional athletes didn't use it. This appears to have changed now, however, as the most recent Nike football boot collection, the Dark Lightning pack, includes 'SG-Pro Anti-Clog' as the default soft-ground option, at least for the high-tier models such as the Hypervenom Phantom or Tiempo Legend. With it, professionals from the big leagues, such as Southampton midfielder Oriel Romeu, have started to receive Anti-Clog Nike boots as well and should start to wear them shortly. It remains to be seen exactly how many players, and especially Cristiano Ronaldo as the most well-known SG-Pro user, will pick up Nike's Anti-Clog boots from the Dark Lightning pack, but everything indicates that this is a step in the right direction and that Anti-Clog will only get bigger with time. Now if we could just get an Anti-Clog edition of the Mercurial Superfly V. Exciting times ahead, nevertheless. Share your thoughts in the comments below, and check out our post about how Anti-Clog works compared to standard SG-Pro here .",

      "text": "Kyrie Irving reacts brilliantly to self-tying Nike trainer Published 24/7 \nBasketball trainers have come a long way since Wilt Chamberlain dominated the league in his Chuck Taylors. \nAs technology has advanced, so has the footwear worn by the game's best. No way would a player think of wearing a traditional pair of Converse in this day and age. \nThrough the years there have been a number of game-changing shoes; the Nike 'Air Force 1' was revolutionary, as the footwear moved away from the traditional pumps to a thicker, more supporting sole. \nAir Jordan was the catalyst for the hyper-competitive, multi-million dollar market we see today where brands like Nike, Adidas, Jordan and Under Armour are competing to ensure they have the freshest, newest trainer on the market. \nNike have really embraced the modern technological world in recent years with their self-tying 'Flyease' and 'MAG' shoes that have proven to be a big hit. \nCleveland Cavaliers superstar Kyrie Irving recently posted a video on his Twitter account that showed him trying on a pair of Nike's trainers and he appeared blown away when the shoes began to tighten around his foot. \nThe trainer game has come a long way in a short space of time. It's amazing to think where it could head next. Topics: ",

Some Nike Plus app users are also being given offers to buy the shoe through the app, which judging by several Instragram photos (below) is something being taken advantage of quickly. The innovative new shoes are expected to arrive at more stores on Dec. 1.\nNike first showed off its Hyperadapt sneakers in March. The sneakers feature what Nike calls \"adaptive lacing\" technology, which can automatically tweak the snugness of the shoe. There are two buttons on the side to tighten and loosen the laces.

Following the initial release, we have also seen ‘ Triple Black ‘ and ‘ Medium Olive ‘ colourways emerge, but now it’s time for the ladies to receive some Swoosh love with a trio of women’s exclusive colourways that inject some colour into the lifestyle silhouette. Lavender and beige make-ups are a soft-hued treat that substitutes the model’s mini Swooshes for perforated logo designs, while the third colourway, in black and blue, is an aggressive rendition of the hybridised sneaker that features unique colour-blocking unlike we’ve seen on the LunarCharge thus far. \nNo word yet on a release for this trio of LunarCharges, but we’ll keep you informed as soon as official details emerge.",

      "text": "print \nSarah Robb O'Hagan says the risks she's taken have been the most rewarding decisions of her career. Courtesy of Sarah Robb O'Hagan \nYou’d be hard-pressed to find a much more impressive—or diverse—résumé than Sarah Robb O’Hagan’s. \nAt 43, the New Zealander and mom of three has held marketing management positions for industry giants like Virgin Atlantic, Atari, Nike, Gatorade and, most recently, served as president of Equinox Holdings, overseeing brands including SoulCycle and Pure Yoga. \nBut it’s her most latest career move that she considers her biggest challenge of all: In February, Robb O’Hagan left the corporate world to try her hand at entrepreneurship, founding EXTREMEYOU , a content platform dedicated to helping people reach their full, “extreme” potential. \nWe spoke with Robb O’Hagan about lessons learned throughout her 20-year career, the importance of taking risks and her advice for people just starting out. What did you want to be when you were a kid? \nOriginally, I wanted to be a vet. I loved animals and thought it would be so fun to look after them. But the experience of my dog having an operation on his leg—and me nearly barfing at the sight of his stitches—made me realize I probably needed to think of other ideas for my future. What’s the best career advice you ever got, and who gave it to you? \nIt probably came from my old man, who believed “without risk does not come great reward.” It seems so simple, but it’s absolutely the truth. \nSo many times in my career, I have stood at that fork in the road, where I had a very comfortable option and a much riskier one. [Whenever] I made the choice to take a bigger risk and get out of my comfort zone, I found it so much more rewarding. Can you think of a specific time you followed your dad’s advice? \nMy career has involved a wide variety of industries, roles and experiences. People often ask how I got from airlines to music to video games and then ultimately sports and fitness. My answer is that I pushed really hard to get into new industries, even though most recruiters wanted to keep me in the area that my prior experience lay. I realized that waiting for others to open doors for me was not going to get me anywhere. \nI’d subscribe to marketing industry publications to figure out who the key executives were in the companies I wanted to get to, and then figure out how I could meet them. When I realized that the CMO for Virgin Atlantic was attending an upcoming marketing conference, for example, I used my vacation time and my own dollars to attend that conference in hopes I could meet her personally. And it worked! \nNow I want to caution something here: I was not randomly stalking people. I was careful to ensure I had the right experiences that made a relationship possible and meaningful. I often find today that people will approach me in person or over Twitter or LinkedIn and ask to connect. Nine times out of 10, that person has no logical reason for a connection with me, so it doesn’t make sense. In my example, I had a huge amount of mutual interest with the CMO of Virgin Atlantic from my role as a junior executive at another airline. What’s been the biggest surprise along your career path? \nSarah Robb O'Hagan served as president of Equinox Holdings, overseeing brands including SoulCycle and Pure Yoga.. Courtesy of Sarah Robb O'Hagan \nI don’t know if it’s a surprise, so much as something I never knew to be aiming for, but what I have come to love is seeing people I work with take their performance to the next level. \nMy greatest moments at Equinox were seeing my teams totally blow me away with their own innovative ideas—everything from creating a breakthrough indoor cycling class that was inspired by video-gaming, to the launch of Furthermore, the content platform, which was the absolute passion and vision of a small, high-energy team. \nWhen you start your career, you’re so focused on your destination that you don’t realize the most fulfilling part is going to be seeing other people reach theirs. Almost every career has ups and downs. Can you describe some of your downs, and what you learned from them? \nOne that sticks with me so clearly is when I first arrived at Gatorade, the business had stalled. My team and I worked hard to jumpstart the momentum with a big rebranding, and it rolled out to a very mixed reaction in the marketplace—at the exact same time as I gave birth to my third child. \nSo there I was, trying to deal with a newborn, participating full-time in conference calls and work—letting everyone, including myself, down. I wasn’t doing anything well, and I felt overwhelmed by the sheer amount of stuff on my plate. In the end, I had to really dig deep to tap into my sense of resilience. \nI also learned an incredibly important lesson, which was to be willing to ask for help. I remember one of my great mentors, Phil Sanfilippo, who was leading project management at Gatorade, saying to me: “Sarah, individual heroics are not going to turn this business around.” \nHe was spot-on. It was his support and encouragement that helped me realize I needed to ask for help—both personally and professionally. What’s been your gutsiest career move, and would you do it again? \nSarah Robb O'Hagan runs a Tough Mudder race. Courtesy of Sarah Robb O'Hagan \nIt’s definitely the move I just made: starting my own venture with EXTREMEYOU. It’s gutsy because it’s going against the direction my career has been going for more than 20 years now—to lead bigger, broader, scaled businesses and teams. \nBut you know what? As I look around me at the sheer pace and scale of innovation today, I think one of the greatest experiences I can have as a leader is to lead my own startup and to have gone through the entire process of creating something from scratch. I really believe this is the culmination of all of my experiences landing in one place. What’s your definition of success? \nThere’s this wonderful quote from one of my heroes, fellow New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary, who was the first man to summit Everest. He said, “It’s not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves.” \nThis speaks to the fact that the accolades, the trophies, the prizes—none of that is what success is about. What matters is that I got the most out of my own personal potential that I could. That’s what drives me every day. If you could give one piece of advice to someone just starting their career, what would you say? \nExactly what my dad said to me: Without risk does not come great reward. I’d say that you should not be afraid of failure, disappointment and all of those ‘downsides’ of taking risks. Any successful person in the world will tell you that the failures and losses are the moments in their career that they grew the most. More from Grow",

      "text": "The light up, self-lacing sneakers Marty McFly wore in Back to the Future II are finally in stores.\nThe HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes, as they’re formally known, officially went on sale on Monday, CNBC reports. Nike nke describes the sneakers as the “first step into the future of adaptive performance.” A pair of these futuristic sneakers retails for $720.\nThe shoes use cables and pressure sensors to sense how tightly they need to be laced without the wearer having to tighten or loosen them themselves, though there are buttons that allow you to adjust the fit. LED lights on the soles don’t just mimic the look Marty McFly sported in the movie, but they also serve as battery level indicators.\n \nThe HyperAdapt 1.0 shoes are based off of the once-fictional invention imagined in the 1989 movie Back to the Future II . Michael J. Fox, who played Marty McFly, was the first to get a pair. Nike presented them to the actor on Oct. 21, 2015--the date that his character traveled to in the movie.",

      "text": "The Nike Air More Uptempo receives a stealthy update for its next iteration this season, as official imagery of the upcoming pair just released. \nWith this year marking its 20th anniversary, Scottie Pippen’s signature basketball sneaker is essentially defined by the large “AIR” branding across its side panels. That design element is outlined by 3M reflective accents to pronounce the overall profile, while the model’s entire smooth nubuck composition is simply doused in tonal black.\nStriped reflective laces further accentuate the model, as it’s all topped off with a matching rubber sole unit that includes its signature visible air bubble component throughout.\nA release date has not been announced yet, although, stay tuned to KicksOnFire for more updates.\nImages: Nike \nAuthor’s Take I was a big fan of these sneakers when it initially released. I remember it very well on Scottie Pippen. Aside from the favorable colorway, I just like the overall design.\n\nThe post Official Images: Nike Air More Uptempo Black Reflective appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "Visit the original post to see all 10 images from this gallery. \nThis week Nike will be opening the doors to its seventh NikeLab store, NIKELAB MA5. Located in Tokyo, the space uniquely engages the senses through interior and exterior directional sound systems, a scent exclusive to the store, and soft track flooring material made using Nike Grind, a palette of premium recycled and regenerated materials.\nTo further make the store unique to its location, Nike designers worked alongside Arthur Huang, founder of design firm Miniwiz, in means of incorporating Japanese culture and traditions. Thus you will also see Tatami mat floors paired with locally sourced wood walls in the digitally-powered fitting rooms. The same wood then appears on modular display cubes alongside Nike Grind display benches, allowing for seamless restructuring around the store.\nFor an early glimpse at Tokyo’s NIKELAB MA5, scan through the imagery above. The shop opens its doors to the public this week on December 1, featuring a special showcase of the latest NikeLab ACG collection.\nJust months ago we received a peek inside the new NikeLab Milan location. \n",

      "text": "On Tuesday, Nov. 29, Footwear News will host its 2016 Achievement Awards in New York, honoring the best and brightest in the industry, including Marketer of the Year winner Nike. Read on to learn more about the brand’s accomplishments. \nKobe Bryant’s retirement. LeBron James’ hometown championship. USA Basketball wins gold in Rio. The world of sports supplied plenty of noteworthy moments throughout 2016, and Nike capitalized on them all with engaging, inspirational content. But while much of the messaging was star-studded, its most captivating initiative wasn’t focused on the pros. Related How Paul Andrew Grew His Empire in Only Four Years \n“Our greatest successes came when we were able to tell stories that represented both the elite competitor but also the everyday athlete,” said Nike chief marketing officer Greg Hoffman. Enter “Unlimited,” its effort to encourage individuals of all abilities.\nThe most profound visual from the initiative was “Unlimited You,” a film directed by The Daniels and featuring well-known figures such as Kevin Durant, Neymar Jr. and Serena Williams. But regular men, women and kids were the spot’s real stars.\nRyan O’Rourke, global creative director for Nike’s longtime advertising partner Wieden + Kennedy, explained that “Unlimited You” — narrated by actor Oscar Isaac — offered an atypical dynamic. “We normally don’t break the fourth wall and have athletes talk to narrators and have narrators respond,” he said. “The ad became alive. The narrator thinks he knows what these athletes should be doing, but they push beyond what he expects and he wants to restrain them. Usually in advertising, your narrator doesn’t tell everyone to give up.”\nKyle Maynard, subject of Nike’s “Unlimited Will” video. Courtesy of Nike. Another notable spot from the series was “Unlimited Together,” which paired the men’s and women’s Team USA Basketball squads for the first time. And as part of its focus on the everyday athlete, Nike also released “Unlimited Courage,” about the first openly transgender athlete on a U.S. men’s national team, and “Unlimited Will,” about the first quadruple amputee to climb Mount Kilimanjaro without prosthetic limbs.\nThe campaign was remarkable on multiple levels: It showed that everyday individuals were as compelling as high-profile athletes. And it was a hit: As of press time, the “Unlimited” films had roughly 480 million views across social media and more than 1 billion TV impressions, according to the brand.\nBut Nike’s marketing achievements in 2016 went well beyond “Unlimited.” On April 13, “The Conductor” video debuted, delivering an unusual way to celebrate the end of an NBA legend’s 20-year career: with fans and players telling Bryant how much they hate him. “If you look throughout Kobe’s career, he was polarizing, but he had people’s respect because of what he put into the game every single game,” Hoffman said. “‘The Conductor’ brought that to life in a playful way.”\nAdded O’Rourke, “Normally brands [don’t] embrace selling ‘love the hate’ with an athlete’s retirement. But Kobe is fun to work with because he’s so self aware and embraces that stuff.”\nNBA icon Kobe Bryant in Nike’s “The Conductor” clip. Courtesy of Nike. Most recently, Nike has taken a more serious tone with its “Come Out of Nowhere” campaign.\nThe initiative debuted in October, on opening night of the 2016-17 NBA season. It was inspired by James’ epic block in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals that helped in clinching the first title for his Cleveland Cavaliers. The campaign was created to show that extraordinary effort can conquer what is deemed hopeless, and it speaks to the deep relationship between sports stars and their fans.\n“The headlines for each athlete have a basic truth that everybody in a city agrees with,” O’Rourke said. “Fans are so in love with and connected with those athletes. If you can tap into those emotions, you could have something special.”",

At one point, a woman practically wades through a pile of shoes and shoeboxes to make her way down an aisle. \nDowner said the store looked “like an earthquake leveled the place.” \nAt the time he shot the video, the store had only been open about 15 hours. \nHe said the staff looked overwhelmed and tired. \nThe store closed at midnight on Black Friday and re-opened at 5 a.m. Saturday. 48.068429 -122.291809 ",

      "title": "Why Some NYC Locals Aren’t Happy About Nike’s New SoHo Store",
      "text": "After a brief delay due to zoning issues, Nike’s new NYC flagship store in SoHo officially opened its doors to the public on Nov. 18. While many athletes and sneakerheads are enjoying the massive five-story, 55,000 sq.-ft. location, not everyone is thrilled about Nike’s new residency.\nNew York Post spoke with several locals who are less than pleased with the droves of shoppers and excitement generated by the store, with one longtime resident likening the scene in SoHo to a busy nightclub. “I was sitting in my [home] office with the windows closed when all of a sudden I heard all this crazy screaming,” said Pete Davies. “There were big guys like bouncers out front yelling and pushing people.” Related How Regular People Outshined Pros in Nike's Best Ads of 2016 \nDavies says he’s lived in the SoHo neighborhood for 35 years and calls the Nike store opening “one of the most disruptive events of this type I’ve ever seen.”\nThe basketball floor of Nike’s SoHo NYC store. Courtesy of Nike. Nike’s SoHo flagship — located at 529 Broadway — was originally slated to open on Nov. 11, but was delayed due to a dispute over zoning regulations which state new retailers cannot exceed 10,000 sq.-ft. On Nov. 9, protestors gathered at NYC’s Department of Buildings, which says it reviewed the project multiple times before ultimately deciding that it complied with the city’s construction codes.\nSome believe Nike was able to find a loophole in the zoning regulations by labeling the store as a building alteration instead of a new space, but that’s done little to appease locals.\n“We’ve completely lost faith in the Department of Buildings. They’re a fantasy. There is no Department of Buildings,” said SoHo boutique owner Michele Varian. “The old New York we all love is being trampled on and SoHo is on the brink to be the second Times Square.” \nWant more? \nKith And Nike Open Olympic-Themed Pop-Up Shop In NYC \nHow Regular People Outshined Pros in Nike’s Best Ads of 2016 \nNike Is Dropping 12 of Its Most Coveted Basketball Styles in December ",

Furthermore, a glowing blue component on the midsole and a black sole finishes off the sleek design. \nThe Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 will be available at the select Nike retail locations via appointments through Nike‘s website and the NIKE+ APP starting December 1st for $720. \nView more details on how to acquire a pair here . \nImages: Nike \nAuthor’s Take For that price, it’s pretty ridiculous. I like the overall design, but, I’ll wait for the tech to be more refined and mass produced instead. \n\nThe post The Exclusive Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 Releases This Week appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "We all know the power of Instagram. Huge companies like Coca Cola, Starbucks and Nike dominate the space. Companies with established followings seems to have no problems getting engagement and results. But how can you use Instagram for small business?\nYou don’t have to be an enterprise-sized company to get value from Instagram. In fact, the mobile app allows small businesses to compete with the “big guys.” If you’re not using Instagram for small business yet, you’re missing out on a potential gold mine of opportunities.\nWhy Instagram for Small Businesses Is Great Out of all of the newer social networks, Instagram does a lot to set itself apart. With over 500 million monthly active users, Instagram is the fourth-most downloaded app in the US.\nBut here’s the problem. Since Instagram marketing is still fairly new, some small businesses struggle to gain traction. You don’t have clickable links in your posts, it’s a mobile-first app, which relies a lot more on visuals than text. As a result, we’re seeing a lot of small businesses sign up, get confused about how to actually use it and then give up.\nHowever, with social media management tools like Sprout that integrate with Instagram , it’s a lot easier to get started, no matter what size your business is.\nSo how do you cross over from being just another company on the app to achieving the level of success companies like Bon Puf , Simple Green Smoothies ? Here are 12 strategies and tips on how to get the most out of Instagram for small business and build a loyal following:\n1. Get Set Up the Right Way It’s a good idea to connect your company’s social accounts. This is particularly true if you already have social media profiles with a strong following. You can push your followers on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and other sites to your new Instagram account.\nInstagram lets you connect your other profiles so that your new posts can get published to those accounts automatically.\nDon’t forget to add your website and write a bio for your profile that explains what your company is all about without being boring. Fallen Industry’s profile does a great job of letting users know what they do while making it intriguing at the same time.\nAnother good way to use your bio is to add in additional contact information. By default you can only have one clickable URL in your profile. But what you can do to get around that is include URLs in your bio.\nPro tip: Shorten any URLs you use in your bio using a service like Bitly . It’ll take up less characters and make it easier to track your traffic from Instagram. Check out our post on how to write Instagram bios for businesses to learn more about crafting your Instagram bio and putting your best foot forward.\n2. Start Using Instagram Stories Instagram Stories have been a controversial feature to say the least. In case you haven’t heard, Instagram Stories lets you string together multiple pictures and videos into a “story” that disappears after 24 hours, similar to Snapchat stories.\nSmall businesses have been slow to use Instagram Stories while they try to figure out how to best weave the feature into their own strategies. But there’s a lot of potential you shouldn’t pass up. Like with any big change, the companies that adopt and figure it out first tend to reap the biggest benefits.\nFollow in the footsteps of brands like Taco Bell that have gone all-in on Instagram Stories. Start experimenting and get creative to see what you can come up with.\n\n3. Monitor What’s Working Are you paying attention to which Instagram posts get the most engagement? Do you know which hashtags perform the best? Using an Instagram analytics tool can help you see all of this information from a single dashboard and track it over time.\nBy looking through data, you’ll get an idea of what type of content resonates with your audience the best. Whether it’s a certain style of photo, a particular filter or a popular hashtag. The more info you have about the content your audience resonates with, the more you can improve your future posts.\n4. Dive Into Your Comments Do you publish Instagram posts and never look at them again? You’re not alone. A lot of small businesses spend little to no time monitoring their comments , partially because it’s not the easiest thing to do within the Instagram app. It’s also difficult because most brands look for publishing and not Instagram engagement .\nIn order to make responding to Instagram comments easier, use Sprout Social to reply to comments across multiple Instagram accounts and all your other social media profiles.\n5. Use Influencer Marketing Influencer marketing is one of the best ways to quickly build up your Instagram following, particularly when you’re starting from scratch. Through influencer marketing , you can connect with people with an established following and get exposed to their audience.\nIn the past (pre-social media) influencer marketing required huge budgets to get athletes and actors to endorse your products. But social media has changed the game. Now non-celebs can be influencers and have hundreds of thousands or even millions of engaged followers. Not only has this made it easier for brands to connect with influencers, but it also made influencer marketing a lot more affordable.\nYou may not be able to afford to have a Hollywood A-lister post about your products on Instagram. But you can probably link up with a popular Instagram influencer with a nice-sized following.\nCalming therapy with @organique_polska 🌴🙌🏼 #aloe #organiquepolska więcej na blogu: JEMERCED.com \nA photo posted by Jessica Mercedes Kirschner © (@jemerced) on Nov 27, 2016 at 12:09pm PST \n\nStart by making a list of the top influencers in your industry. Look for them on Instagram to make sure they have an engaged audience. It’s not just about how many followers they have, it’s about how much engagement they get. Check out how many Likes and comments they get on their posts and how often they post.\nThen reach out and let them know you’re interested in working together. It’s best to have some ideas for what you’d like to do before approaching them. Two common options are contests and sponsored posts. Also, the influencer might have some ideas on how you can work together as well.\n6. Get Familiar With Hashtags Instagram’s search feature looks for hashtags instead of keywords. On platforms like Twitter or Facebook, you can do a search for “hamburgers” and see all the Tweets and Facebook posts containing that keyword. But with Instagram, you have to search #hamburgers.\nIf you want your posts to show up in the app’s search, you need to start using hashtags for Instagram . It’s a quick way to increase your visibility and reach people who aren’t already aware of your brand.\nThe trick is to use the right hashtags. A common mistake some businesses make is using random hashtags they made up. Unfortunately, nobody is searching for those random hashtags so they’re not helping you grow your following.\nThe real value comes from finding ways to post pictures related to popular or trending hashtags. When you do this, your images have a chance to show up in the Trending Tags section of Instagram.\nWhat’s trending at the moment might not always be relevant to your business or the images you post though. In those cases, you can use Websta to see a huge list of popular hashtags that might not be trending, but are still being used heavily. Websta will show you more generic and broad hashtags that are easier to fit into your non-themed Instagram posts.\nSomething unique to Instagram that you don’t see on many other social networks is using a lot of hashtags can actually get your images more likes. On Twitter, having 10 hashtags in a Tweet would be crazy. But on Instagram it’s pretty much the norm.\nIn a case study from Max Woolf , over 120,000 Instagram photos were analyzed and he found that photos with the maximum allowable hashtags (30) received three times the amount of likes as photos with just a few hashtags.\nThis doesn’t mean every Instagram post needs 30 hashtags. Using hashtags just for the sake of having them isn’t recommended. But the point is photos with hashtags will get a lot more attention than those that don’t.\nOnce you start using hashtags in your post, you can use Sprout to see which of your hashtags are performing the best through our hashtag performance report .\n7. Create More Videos I’m sure we don’t have to tell you about how important video has become for small businesses. Even though photos currently generate more engagement, video is on the rise. Instead of waiting for other brands to dominate while you play catchup, get started right now.\nWith Instagram Stories and live videos, the app is making a clear push toward video content. The great thing about using Instagram videos is they don’t require a ton of production. All you really need is your phone and some creativity. Plus the videos are served in bite-size pieces with a time limit of one minute.\nFollow in the footsteps of small businesses like Wahl , which generated a 4,307% spike in engagement within a year by focusing on more engagement and building a better Instagram strategy.\nMaintenance is 🔑. Follow these simple steps on how to properly clean, disinfect, oil, and store your Finale cutter bars and foils. #wahl #wahlpro #finale #maintenance #foils #cutterbars #shaver #shavermaintenance #barber #video #stylist #🔑 \nA video posted by Wahl Professional (USA) (@wahlpro) on Nov 18, 2016 at 10:02am PST \n\n8. Start Regramming Sharing other people’s content is one of the best ways to start building connections. When you’re just getting started with using Instagram for small business, building up your initial audience should be your top priority. You need to start getting eyes on your profile to get some initial shares and engagement.\nRegramming is a quick and easy way to start getting some momentum. Unlike other networks, Instagram doesn’t have a native way to share other people’s content. You can either Like or comment. But there are third party apps that give you the ability to regram. Check out our guide on how to regram for more info and some different apps you can use.\n#Repost @happymundane with @repostapp ・・・ #ad Had fun creating a spacey little adventure for @tictacusa Hope your weekend is out of this world! 🌌🚀👽 #littleadventures #golittle \nA photo posted by TicTacUSA (@tictacusa) on Sep 9, 2016 at 12:15pm PDT \n\n9. Capitalize on Instagram Ads One of the biggest obstacles that stops small businesses from trying social media advertising is costs. When you don’t have a big budget, it’s a little more difficult to justify spending money on advertising. But Instagram Ads present a great opportunity for small businesses because it’s extremely affordable.\nGetting started is simple, particularly if you already have a Facebook Advertising account because it’s built into the same platform. However, we recommend creating custom image assets specifically for Instagram Ads instead of reusing the same ones you would for Facebook because of how it’s displayed in the feed.\n10. Host An Instagram Contest There’s no denying the fact that people absolutely love free stuff. Instagram contests give your company an interesting way to engage with current and potential fans.\nThere are certain elements that you’ll want to include in your contest to maximize your results:\nMake a theme for your contest instead of the generic “follow us to win a free product” approach. Create a custom hashtag for your contest. Make people tag a friend and comment to enter the contest. This will help your contest spread a lot quicker. Start promoting the contest at least a week before it starts to build anticipation. Consider collaborating with other companies or influencers to get even more reach. Before you start, read through Instagram’s promotion guidelines to make sure you’re doing everything above board. Since the goal is to get loyal followers, whatever you’re giving away should be somewhat related to your industry. That way you’re not just attracting freebie seekers, but people that are legitimately interested in your brand.\nIt's #GIVEAWAY TIME! THANK YOU Team Quest for making this such an awesome year!

Collaborate One of the quickest ways to get a surge of new followers is to get a shout out or mention from someone that already has a large following. The great thing about Instagram is that a lot of popular accounts aren’t owned by huge corporations. They’re owned by regular people and lifestyle entrepreneurs who have done a lot of the leg work to build their own audience already.\nWhen these people give a brand a shout out, their followers instantly go to check out the account and will more than likely give you a follow. This is one of the techniques Neil Patel used in his infamous $57,000 Instagram case study .\nThe two most common ways to get mentioned by established accounts are:\nPay for a sponsored post (this can cost you anywhere from $20-$100+ per post) Establish a relationship or partner up with them Obviously the second method is ideal, but let’s start out with the first option.\nA lot of small businesses aren’t aware that paying for sponsored Instagram posts is even an option, but it’s a very popular way to start get the ball rolling on your account. The male accessory brand Bachelr used sponsored Instagram posts to promote its website when it first launched, and saw great results .\nThe brand generated over 20,000 new visitors in just two weeks.\nBachelr credits a huge chunk of the success to influencer marketing.\nOne of our most successful posts was a model holding one of our products in a natural setting, no logo anywhere. This got 10k likes and 100+ comments.\nMake a list of the top influencers related to your industry on Instagram. Focus on individuals rather than businesses. Most users who accept sponsored posts will have their contact information in their profile so it’s easy to reach them.\nWhen you’re looking for influencers, choose people who are a good match for your brand. Otherwise the new followers you’ll gain won’t be very likely to engage with your content.\nThe second technique is simply good old fashion networking. Start following companies who are complementary to your brand and engage with their content. Leave comments, like their photos and even reach out to them via email. As these relationships start to grow, look for opportunities to promote each other on Instagram . Maybe you can team up on a joint venture or host an event together. Post photos on your Instagram pages and tag each other in them. There are plenty of possibilities.\nOne company putting an interesting twist on both of these techniques is Gym Shark. The active wear company caters to athletes, bodybuilders and people who live all-around active lives. One of Gym Shark’s techniques for growing its following is sponsoring influencers in the fitness niche. Its sponsored athletes post pictures on their own Instagram pages wearing Gym Shark’s products, and Gym Shark posts images of them on its page as well.\nAll black everything.

Engage With Your Competitor’s Followers Two of the most important characteristics of an engaged Instagram follower are:\nThey’re interested in your niche/industry They like the content you post With this strategy, the first part is already taken care of. If a user is following one of your competitors, they’re more than likely already interested in your industry. That makes it easier to win them over and get them to follow you too. From that point, it’s all about keeping them engaged through the content you post.\nMake a list of your top competitors who are active on Instagram. You may want to put them all into a spreadsheet to make it easier to track. Start with the first competitor and follow about 50-100 of their followers. This step alone will get you a few new followers. But we’re not just after followers, we want engaged followers who will help spread the word about our brand. In order to attract those users, you’ll need to communicate with them. On Instagram, there are three basic ways to engage with people:\nFollow them Like their photos Comment on their photos You’ve already followed them, so now you just have to like some of their photos, comment or both. This will increase the likelihood of people following you back, and also reciprocating your engagement. The more you engage with your audience, the bigger your return will be.\n\nAre You on Instagram Yet? Growing a dedicated following on Instagram won’t happen overnight. But the bright side is that Instagram users are very active and love to engage. So once you get the ball rolling, you’ll notice that your brand will start to build organically. Start putting these techniques into action and you’ll see how powerful Instagram can be for your business.\nSign up for a free 30 day trial of Sprout to give our Instagram features a test drive. \nThis post 12 Ways to Use Instagram for Small Business originally appeared on Sprout Social .\n",

      "text": "\nJust last month, Andre Agassi's old Air Tech Challenge II got a winterized makeover from Nike -- with a \"Triple Black\" colorway to boot. This month the rugged take on the '90s kicks is back, this time with a seasonally appropriate \"Hasta\" colorway. Echoing the construction of its all-black predecessor, the release opts for a combination of premium leather, ripstop nylon and texturized water-repellant/scuff-resistant overlays while the color-blocking is reminiscent of the Quickstrikes that were crafted for the Australian Open back in January.\nCapped off with matching green rope lacing and a black sole unit, the Air Tech Challenge II SE \"Hasta\" is available now from the likes of afew and select Nike Sportswear spots worldwide.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

In the time since NikeLab has lived up to that potential and then some, innovating at an accelerated rate and exploring the boundaries of footwear and apparel. \nWith six NikeLab locations in New York, London, Paris, Milan, Shanghai and Hong Kong, they expand their global presence to another critical market in Tokyo with this all-new MA5 shop. \nThe new storefront centers around nature and technology, which also serves as a meeting place for much of the brand’s output. The layout was produced in conjunction with long-term engineering partner, Arthur Huang, founder of design firm Minimiz. Those efforts lend towards Authentic Japanese culture as the store’s foundation, while an interior and exterior directional sound system and exclusive store scent add a uniqueness to the new space. \nNikeLab MA5 is set to open its doors on December 1 with a special display of the new NikeLab ACG collection. Take a look inside the new shop below and stay tuned for more happenings from MA5 Tokyo. NikeLab MA5 Tokyo ",

The Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 shoe, which mimics technology from the movie \"Back to the Future II,\" is only on sale so far at two stores in SoHo, for $720. Some Nike Plus app users are also being given offers to purchase the shoe through the app. Five Questions with 'Hairspray Live!' Star Kristin Chenoweth The HyperAdapt allows users to make the fit looser or snugger on the fly by pressing buttons on the side of the shoe. It will be released to more stores in December, as well as to Nike Plus app users, according to a company news release. Young Cuban-Americans Wonder What Role to Play For the hundreds of thousands of children born to Cuban exiles, some who are two and three generations removed from the island, Fidel Castro's death potentially opens a door to a world previously off-limits. (Published Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2016) Nike has said that the potential for shoes with adaptive lacing is huge because it provides tailored-to-the-moment custom fit. When users step into the shoe, their heel hits a sensor. They can press two buttons on the side to adjust the grip. Nike says in the future, the process won't be manual, and a sensor could sense when the user needs to have the shoe tighter or looser. The Girls Are Back: Graham on ‘Gilmore Girls’ Return The self-lacing shoes in \"Back to the Future II\" were Nikes as well, and according to an article in Wired magazine in October, Nike designers worked with filmmakers to come up with the idea. It took 28 years for the technology to go from silver screen to city streets. \"I'm more excited about this than any project I've ever been involved with,\" one of those designers, now Nike Vice President of Creative Concepts Tinker Hatfield, told Wired. 911 Call Released From Ohio State Campus Stabbing Students at Ohio State University are returning to class, still shaken by a Monday attack that left eleven people wounded and a suspect dead.

      "text": "LeBron James gifts Nike shoes to Fort Myers girls basketball team CORY MULL , CMULL@NEWS-PRESS.COM 5:57 p.m. EST November 29, 2016 The Fort Myers girls basketball team was gifted sneakers and a personal letter by Nike on behalf of LeBron James (Photo: Fort Myers High) \nYou would think winning the first girls state basketball championship in your high school's program history would be reward enough for years of hard work. \nBut then comes an added bonus — a gift from arguably the best basketball player in the world. \nNow the real question: Do you frame them or wear ‘em? \n“It’s a great opportunity to get anything from LeBron,” Fort Myers girls basketball assistant coach Jamie Outten said. “Anytime you get something from a player like that, it’s special. The girls fell in love with the shoes as soon as they saw them.” \nAbout a week ago, the Green Wave received a gift from Nike on behalf of James, the reigning NBA champion and superstar Cleveland Cavaliers forward. \nIn came 12 pairs of new LeBron kicks, retail value $139.99, plus a personalized letter detailing the accomplishments of the Green Wave in winning their first state title the previous season. \n“Never be too big to keep doing the little things,” the letter written by James said. “I’ll be watching.” \nOK, so yeah, James didn’t send the shoes himself. He did not write the letter. The video that accompanied the gift was not addressed to anyone in particular. \nApproximately 61 shipments of Nike shoes were sent to boys and girls programs who are contracted with Nike across the nation. That included Fort Myers. It was part of a wider plan to reward state championship teams who had seized the moment. Much love to @KingJames for the support... hope to see you at a game this season 😉💛❤️👌🏽 #comeoutofnowhere #StriveForGreatness pic.twitter.com/pqBhDsDjB3 — ACXII (@alliecraigcruce) November 29, 2016 \nFor the past week, the teams fortunate enough to receive the special shipment from Nike have tweeted at James with the hashtag #comeoutofnowhere, which speaks not only to the surprise gift but of his legendary block in Game 7 of the NBA Finals, which sealed one of the best comebacks in NBA history and snapped a 52-year championship drought in Cleveland. \nFort Myers had its own legendary moment, too. In February, the Green Wave girls won their first state title in program history by beating Oakland Park Northeast, 60-45, despite starting the first half 1 for 23 from the field. \nLike James and the Cavs, they rebounded, battled back and never stopped believing. \nA few weeks after the win, Terrell said he was contacted by a Nike rep, who interviewed him about the season. He didn't think anything of it. He moved on and readied for another season like usual. He even ordered green Nike LeBron Soldier 10 sneakers as his program's team shoes. . @KingJames Valor Eagles are so excited for their shoes, shirt and letter! 2-time state champs ready to roll this season. #ComeOutOfNowhere pic.twitter.com/5rmK0KWFuc — Valor Christian (@Valoreagles) November 23, 2016 \n“To me, it kind of says the girls came of age during that season,” Fort Myers coach Chad Terrell said of the recognition. “The girls worked hard and battled through a couple years of not reaching their goals. And finally breaking through last year, they got the notoriety of being a really good basketball team. The shoes are a culmination of that.” \nWhich was why the gift was so important. \nThe players were in awe of the recognition, even though most of them knew it was coming. \nHours before practice, Autumn Giles was scrolling on Twitter when she saw a tweet by Fort Myers High, which included a picture of one shoe and a letter. \n@ FortMyersHS : LeBron James recognizing our girls basketball team with a pair of shoes.

Blessed 😇 means a lot from this guys #LackOfWorries 🎈 @KingJames https://t.co/e6rDiua0Qm — alexsis_johnson (@alexsis17221) November 22, 2016 \n“At first we thought we were just getting one shoe,” she said. “Like, what are we going to do with one shoe?” \n“I didn’t believe it,” senior forward Bethany Brunson said. “Because it’s LeBron. Why would he send us shoes?” \nBut soon enough, it all made sense. Terrell sat them down inside the locker room and explained why they were getting the shoes. By then, Brunson softened her stance. \n“That’s my favorite player,” she said, “so of course I’m going to be happy.” \nOne particular line in the letter said, “Even after starting the game 1 for 23, you played enough championship defense to hold them off.”",

      "text": "Nike has been putting the Hasta colorway on a handful of colorways this Fall season. The latest silhouette to rock the look is none other than the Nike Air Tech Challenge 2 . Already available internationally, let’s get a good look at these on-feet images of this upcoming drop.\nThis version of the Nike Air Tech Challenge 2 is constructed out of a premium leather upper as well as some ripstop nylon and texturized water-repellent features placed on the overlays. The color-blocking has the shoe comes in both Black and Hasta where the latter is placed on the upper portion of the base. Tonal Hasta laces and a Black sole unit further solidifies the two-toned look. Stay tuned to find out when these get a stateside release date.\n \nvia: afew \nAuthor’s Take I’m not a big fan of this model, but the colorway definitely looks good on the shoe. I really dig the color-blocking motif.\n\nAvailable Now on Kixify \nThe post The Hasta Colorway Arrives On The Nike Air Tech Challenge 2 appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

This tim around the model opts for a more subtle and minimal aesthetic, let’s get a first look at the upcoming drop.\nThe Nike HyperRev 2017 starts off with a sports mesh construction utilizing a nice intricate pattern seen throughout. It also comes with a padded collar and tongue for additional support. Vertical Nike HyperRev branding also appears on the tongue, and tech-wise the shoe also comes with herringbone traction pattern on the outsole and a Zoom unit on the midsole. Said to be dropping Spring 0f 2017, let us know what your initial thoughts on the shoe are.\n \nvia: US11 \nAuthor’s Take I feel like it lacks something to help make it stand out. Not sure what, but it looks generic to be quite honest.\n\nAvailable Now on Kixify \nThe post Our First Look At The Nike HyperRev 2017 appeared first on KicksOnFire.com .",

      "text": "— Potomac Panthers (@PotomacBlue) November 26, 2016 \n“Last season was special. But it’s time to make more history,” read a personalized and signed note from James. “Only as a team — remember that. That’s the only way you can reach new heights. I’ll be watching.” \nAccording to InsideNoVa , James’ shipment was arranged in October, when Nike emailed Keith Honore, head coach of the Dumfries, Va., team, and asked him to get in touch with a research group. Honore obliged, and Nike later contacted him asking him for the shoe sizes of his players. Still, Honore was skeptical. “I never suspected this,” the coach said. \nThis isn’t the first gift of this kind from Nike and James, either. Last week, they sent sneakers and apparel to other high schools, including the West Linn, Ore., boys and Spotswood, Va., girls teams. @KingJames @TDNike @JillNoe thank you! Very grateful to be part of the @nikebasketball family! Excited for the season ! pic.twitter.com/A3q5ViHRBb \n— West Linn Basketball (@wlboysbball) November 22, 2016 \nWant more?",

      "text": "\nBritish retailer JD Sports and Nike recently released a conceptual promotional film for the new Air Max 2017 which shows a metaphorical exploration of air and the negative space it occupies. Conceptualized, designed and directed by design and motion studio ManvsMachine, the Air Max 2017’s ultralight support and maximum comfort are portrayed through a series of visual metaphors inspired by scenarios encountered on an everyday run.\nWith Nike's latest Air Max silhouette, comfort is paramount as it displays 360-degrees of visible Air within its signature midsole unit. The model also removes its Dynamic Flywire which has been seen in previous silhouettes, while Engineered Mesh makes up the upper. 3M hits are added for an eye-catching touch via its lateral and medial Swooshes as well as heel and tongue branding. Check out the conceptual promotional film above and head over to ManvsMachine for more information on the project.\nRead more at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

In a world where laces needed to be tied and Velcro needed to be strapped, auto laces is the definition of sneaker innovation. Nike's adaptive lacing system automatically tightens down to the foot and self-adjusts if needed as you walk. \nIt might be hard to understand just how the technology works without actually trying it, so starting this week Nike+ members will be able to test the sneakers out at Nike SoHo and the Nike+ Clubhouse at 45 Grand St. If you can't make it to an in-store location, here's the next best thing. \nWatch as Sole Collector's own Rich \"Maze\" Lopez sits down with Nike Innovator Tiffany Beers on Facebook Live to discuss all things Nike HyperAdapt and to show how the technology works. \nNike HyperAdapt 1.0",

      "text": "Could we be about to see a long-anticipated sneaker collaboration between OFF-WHITE x Nike?\nInstagram user @brockymarciano has shared an image of what looks to be brand founder Virgil Abloh sporting an OFF-WHITE x Nike Air Force 1. The shoe comes in a black and white colorway, with the minimalist aesthetic broken up by some matter-of-fact OFF-WHITE text on the midsole and tongue.\nRumors of a collaboration between the two brands on an Air Force 1 first emerged last year when a striped iteration of the sneaker surfaced on Twitter. Abloh, however, was quick to distance himself.\n@Four_Pins false. Please fact check in the future.\n— virgil abloh (@virgilabloh) March 27, 2015 \n\nBut this time around, the images look legit, and would mark another coup for Nike after the heralded NikeLab x VLONE Air Force 1 collaboration. The sneaker celebrates its 35th anniversary next year, and it would seem Nike plans on marking the landmark in style.\nStay posted for more news on the OFF-WHITE x Nike AF1 as it emerges. In the meantime, check out this dope festive update of the famous silhouette.\n",

      "text": "Youngest Goalscorer of All Time: Liverpool's Woodburn is Already Under Contract With Nike Wednesday, November 30, 2016 Wednesday, November 30, 2016 Last night, Liverpool youngster Ben Woodburn became his club's youngest-ever goalscorer at just 17 years and 45 days, 100 days younger than Michael Owen was when he scored his first. Embed from Getty Images In case a brand has had hopes to snap him up before he blows up completely, it has to be observed that Woodburn was already signed by Nike at least a year ago. This once again proves how close the big players in the boot market are watching players in the academies of the top leagues - after all, it's indefinitely cheaper to snap up talent as early as possible. — ben woodburn (@BenWoodburn) 2. Juli 2016 Primarily a winger, Woodburn made his goalscoring debut wearing Nike Mercurial Vapor XI boots, after the started his Nike career with the Superfly IV. This should be a name we'll get to hear a few more times down the line, don't you think? Comment below.",

      "text": "These New SFB 6\" Bombers from Nike Feature a Refined Lifestyle Look By: Riley von Niessen - Nov 30, 2016 References: nike & hypebeast Looking to give an athletic silhouette a more polished appearance, Nike gave the 'SFB 6\" Bomber' an update. This time, the brand uses a beautiful cognac-colored premium leather for the entirety of the upper -- with the quality of the construction evident upon first glance. Artful stitching splits up the upper a bit -- bringing a subtle depth to the design. Nike's Swoosh is shown minimally on the new SFB 6\" Bombers, with the logo ingrained into the side of the heel. The laces are a slightly lighter tone of brown, helping to give the sneakers more variance -- however they do so in a way that doesn't retract from the minimalism of it. Finishing it off is an off-white sole, which is lightly speckled.",

Harkening back to the monochromatic looks that debuted in the Fall of 2015, the latest version of the design opts for the beloved \"Triple Black\" look and takes the shoe's heavy-duty aesthetic a step further with the addition of premium leather construction, an iridescent mudguard and additional reflective 3M applications.\nSwoosh fans can pick up there Huaraches now from END. for $129 USD.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "A first look at Nike's self-lacing HyperAdapt sneakers Not having to tie your own shoe comes at a steep price. Share Save \nMore than eight months after introducing the HyperAdapt 1.0 , Nike is finally making its highly anticipated self-lacing shoes available to the public. The sneaker costs a whopping $720 and is pitched as the consumer version of Nike's 2016 Mag , the model inspired by the film Back to the Future Part II . Obviously, what makes them both stand out are the power laces on each, because who can resist not having to tie their own shoes. I tried on the HyperAdapts at a private event in New York City and, despite wearing the limited edition Mags before, I couldn't help but think \"woah\" when I first put the new pair on. Gallery: A first look at Nike's HyperAdapt 1.0 | 22 Photos 22 +18 \nSince self-lacing sneakers are still a rarity , it's hard not to be impressed immediately. At first I was touching the shoes gently, trying not to break anything as I slid my feet into the shoes, but I was quickly told I didn't have to treat them any different than my traditional kicks. Tiffany Beers, senior innovator and engineer at Nike, says HyperAdapt 1.0 was designed to be a full-on performance shoe and not simply a collector's item. What makes everything tick here is a system dubbed E.A.R.L , short for Electro Adaptive Reactive Lacing, which activates itself as soon as your heel hits the insole. \nIf you need to adjust the laces, there are two buttons on the shoe's upper, one for tightness and the other for looseness. I found the auto levels to be comfortable every time I put the HyperAdapts on, but that may vary depending on the shape of your foot. Either way, Nike says E.A.R.L is smart enough to know the amount of tightness it should provide when you lace up for the first time. The E.A.R.L mechanism does make a loud sound once it's triggered, but it is oddly satisfying to hear. That sensation is reminiscent of that scene when Marty McFly says \" power laces, all right \" in BTTF Part II . \nAs you would hope, the HyperAdapts are comfortable during wear and true to size. So, if like me you wear a 10.5, there's no need to go up or down from your preferred fit. They're shaped similar to other performance shoes, meaning they won't feel much different than what you're used to walking or running in already. The power laces are what make it a low-top on steroids, though. \nYou'll also notice that blue block on the bottom of the HyperAdapt. That's used to indicate how much power you have on your shoe; a blue light means you're charged up, yellow is halfway and red signals that you're running low. To charge it, you use a white magnetic puck that's included in the box. Nike says the sneaker can last up to two weeks on a full battery, though that could be longer if you don't activate the power laces too often. Beers, for example, claims she's worn them for 8 to 10 weeks with a single charge. There are LEDs on the back too, which light up everytime E.A.R.L is doing its job. \nUnfortunately, getting the HyperAdapt 1.0 isn't as easy as walking into a Nike store and purchasing a pair , at least not right now. While they're definitely not as rare as the 2016 Mag ( 89 pairs ), the sportswear giant is only giving a \"small group\" of Nike+ app users the chance to buy them . That said, Nike says a wider release is expected later in December, along with a new silver color -- there's also a white one available, but that's limited to athletes and celebrities who are part of the Nike family . \nWe'll have more on the HyperAdapt 1.0 in the coming weeks. For now, you need to ask yourself whether you're willing to pay $720 to own a piece of the future of footwear.",
