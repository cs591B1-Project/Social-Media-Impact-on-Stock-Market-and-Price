      "text": "Twitter When can I watch the next episode of The Grand Tour on Amazon? The new Amazon series is being streamed weekly; find out where and when the next episode will be available to watch on Amazon, and watch the trailer ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW \nBy Radio Times staff Friday 25 November 2016 at 9:00AM \nAmazon's new series The Grand Tour will air every Friday throughout its 12-episode run. For binge watchers used to watching an entire series on demand, that could get a little... irritating. Deal with it. \nThe series will air weekly on Amazon rather than landing all at once, with the first series running for a whopping three months. Here's all the info you need for episode 3. When can I watch The Grand Tour episode three – and where is it set? \nEpisode 3 is available on Amazon from Friday 2nd December. The studio tent pops up in the English seaside town of Whitby. After previous weeks in California and Joburg, it's pretty... quaint. \nCheck out the official synopsis for the episode below. \nThe Grand Tour travelling tent pitches up on the quayside in the English coastal town of Whitby from where Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May introduce a modern take on the traditional gentleman’s tour of Italy. With Jeremy in an Aston Martin DB11 and James in a Rolls-Royce Dawn, the pair are set for a leisurely trip of culture and fine dining until a noisy and unwelcome guest arrives.",

      "text": "How to choose the right Amazon Fire tablet for you Published by Business Insider on Fri, 25 Nov 2016 The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase.When most people hear the word tablet, they almost immediately think of the iPad.Apple has dominated the tablet space, but Amazon's line of Fire tablets give the iPad a run for its money.There are a few different models of Fire tablet, each one with some specific pros and cons.Whether you're looking for a bigger or smaller screen, or value pixel density over stereo speakers, this guide breaks it down.Fire tablets are the best values in the business, and for most people they're a great tablet option.DON'T MISS:How to choose the right MacBook for youSEE ALSO:How to choose the right Kindle for you7\" Fire TabletThe 7-inch Fire tablet is Amazon's base model, and while it's less powerful than its older siblings, it does share some common features with them.It runs the same operating system (Fire OS 5 \"Bellini\"), has front- and rear-facing cameras, and access to Amazon's large library of content, be it Kindle books or Prime Video streaming. The Amazon app store was also pretty robust when I used it last month, with many popular apps like Netflix and Angry Birds available.It only has one speaker, though, so don't expect to be kicking out the jams without connecting it to a Bluetooth speaker.In that same vein, this tablet's less-than-HD screen means it won't be the best for watching TV or movies, but at 7 inches, it's bigger than your phone.When we reviewed this tablet last year, we said it was the new standard for a $50 tablet, and that's still the case. If you want to casually browse the web, stream Netflix, or play games on a flight, the standard Fire tablet is the perfect solution.Fire Tablet, $49.99, available from AmazonFire HD 6If you'restill looking for a good deal on a tablet, but want one that's a little more capable, the Fire HD 6 is a good compromise.For an additional $20, you're getting a higher-resolution screen and the most pixel-dense tablet in Amazon's entire line. That means text will be more crisp, and the user interface in general will look cleaner on the HD 6 than any of Amazon's other tablets.It's one inch shorter than the base Kindle Fire, meaning if you're rocking a large phone like the Galaxy S7 Edgeor iPhone 6S Plus, having a device with a screen this size might be redundant.The Fire HD 6 shares the same camera system with the standard Fire tablet, but has Dolby audio built-in. It still only has one speaker, but the sound quality should be better. It also picks up an extra hour of battery life, taking it up to a respectable 8 hours. Because of its pixel-dense screen and small size, the Fire HD 6 is ideal for people who don't mind reading on a smaller tablet screen. It's also a good choice for those who want a small tablet that's under $100 with an HD screen.Fire HD 6, $69.99, available at AmazonFire HD 8The Fire HD 8 might have the same screen resolution as the Fire HD 6,but its larger screen size and better internals make it a more capable tablet.With a higher-resolution front- and back-facing camera, the Fire HD 8 is a better choice if you choseto be a tablet-wielding photographer. That also means your conversations over Skype, or any other video-messaging service, will also be cleaner. The Fire HD 8 alsosupports the wireless AC standard, currently the fastest form of WiFi out there. Finally, along with the bigger screen size comes duel stereo speakers, making this tablet much more multimedia friendly.This is the tablet to buy if you're looking for a big-but-not-huge travel tablet. It's the iPad Mini's size, but at less than half the price; and even better, you can expand its internal storage with a MicroSD card.Fire HD 8, $149.99, available on AmazonSee the rest of the story at Business Insider",

      "text": "Election 2016 Amazon Reviewers Have A Field Day With Trump “Make America Great Again” Christmas Ornament \"It called Mary a nasty woman, told Joseph to go back where he came from [and] built a wall around the manger.\" by Dan Avery 36m ago \nSome Amazon users are not thrilled about Donald Trump’s official Christmas tree ornament. \nAfter the bauble—a brass-and-gold red cap emblazoned with “Make America Great Again”—popped up on the site with a $150 price tag, thousands wrote scathing “reviews” lampooning the president-elect. \nHere are just a sample of the more than 3,500 reviews currently available for the item: “It tried to put my nativity figures into an internment camp. Would not buy again.” \n“It came with an entire crate of white hood ornaments. Great bargain! Downside: My tree is now on fire.” \n“I put it in my Nativity scene but it kept demanding Jesus’ birth certificate and threatening to deport the three wise men.” \n“My tree decided to organize a hostile takeover of the neighbor’s house, called my 3-year-old a loser because he can’t tie his shoes yet, and just fired the couch.” \nAnd our favorite: “My office puts up a tree every year and we pool resources to get a really nice ornament, usually on the pricey side. \nFor example, 8 years ago we got a really nice, hand crafted ornament from Hawaii. We liked it so much, we decided to get another one just like it 4 years later. Well, this year we all got together and chose a sedate, classy ornament from a shop in New York. My New York friends swore by their work and so we voted and chose it. \nBut then this red and gold POS showed up in the mail and we can’t figure out why! We went through the vote hat again and we definitely voted for the New York piece with overwhelming numbers. I’m a bit worried that our manager, who thinks he’s special and soooo sELECTIVE, might have gone over our heads and ordered this one instead.” \nRead more reviews of the ornament (which is currently, ahem, sold out) here .",

This $75 savings makes it even more affordable to easily tell who is at the door without even having to get up from your couch. Using its app, the Ring doorbell can show you video and let you interact with the people at your door from your phone or even computer. You'll be able to see who is at your door, regardless of where you are in the world.\n\nOdds are this deal won't last long, so be sure to place your order now if you are interested in one of these. There are a few different colors available so you can pick the one that matches your exterior the best.\nSee at Amazon \n",

      "text": "The president-elect is here to help make your Christmas tree great again. Amazon critics are letting him have it.\nDonald Trump’s signature ball caps are now available as ornaments. For $149 you can hang one on your tree.\n“Get in the Christmas spirit with your very own Make America Great Again Red Cap Collectible Ornament,” the promo text reads. “Made of brass and finished in 24 karat gold, this ornament is sure to make any tree stand out.”\nHere’s the link to order. \nThe item also is available via Amazon, where critics are merrily listing negative reviews with creative commentary.\nA sample:\n“ It tried to put my nativity figures into an internment camp. Would not buy again.” \n“ The angel on top of my tree just hired a lawyer.” \n“ It declared bankruptcy four times and I just got it yesterday. Would not recommend.” \nThere are a handful of positive reviews:\n“ Excellent gift your for liberal idiot family and friends.” \n“ An amazing gift for those looking to trigger the snowflakes. Make with the finest craftsmanship and best materials, including salty liberal tears. Comes with an electoral college pamphlet you can hand out to your wacky friends and family still crying about how the illegal and buried voters should’ve won.” \n“ It was a beautiful ornament! Very special!” \nSee the Amazon link to order (and comments) here .\nOn the other hand, if “Hamilton” tickets are on your Christmas list this year, an Atlanta arts organization can help make it happen. \nPAST COVERAGE\nDonald Trump lashes out after Mike Pence booed at “Hamilton” \nTrump: “Hamilton” is highly overrated \nMike Pence says he enjoyed “Hamilton” and was not offended \nAfter “Hamilton” flap, Pence seeks to calm as Trump rants on Twitter ",

      "text": "Putting Google Express and Amazon Prime to the test By Kelly Reinke, WATE Published: November 25, 2016, 7:05 am Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) \nKNOXVILLE (WATE) — Amazon Prime has a new competitor in the online shopping market: Google Express. Google Express allows shoppers to purchase items from a variety of retailers, like Walgreens, Whole Foods and Bed Bath & Beyond, in one place online. Media General affiliate WATE ordered the same items on both sites on the same day to see how the prices and delivery time compared. \nBefore ordering, shoppers can decide to order as a member or non-member. Membership on both Amazon Prime and Google Express free shipping on eligible orders. It costs $95 dollars a year on Google Express for free shipping. However, for an order to be eligible for free delivery, it has to reach the store minimums before taxes or fees in select delivery areas. Most store minimums are $15. If you are not a member of Google Express, delivery of eligible orders starts at $4.99 from each store you shop. In comparison, a membership on Amazon Prime costs $99 per year. If shoppers do not order as a member, shipping can cost $8.99 for same-day delivery. \nFor this test, WATE ordered the same three items on both sites as a member – hairspray, headphones and dog treats. The total on Google Express was $37.10 after shipping costs and taxes were included. The total on Amazon Prime was $43.26 after shipping costs and taxes were included. \nTwo days after the order, all three items from Google Express arrived. However, only one order from Amazon Prime came. We still had to wait for the hairspray and dog treats from Amazon Prime. Those items came a day later, which was three days after the order was placed. \nFor the three items we purchased, we found Google Express was cheaper and faster than Amazon Prime as a member. 5 online shopping tips to save you money Shop on the right day : Several studies show that Sunday is the best day to shop for plane tickets. A study released by Airlines Reporting Coporation found the average plane ticket price on Sunday was more than $70 cheaper than the prices on Monday, the most expensive day. Leave items in your cart: Retailers do not like unclosed deals. Stores that will send coupons or deals the next day include JC Penny, Office Max and Bed Bath & Beyond, Find a coupon: Online promo codes and paper coupons are a great way to save money. You can find most promo codes on aggregation sites which include Coupons.com, CouponFollow and DealsPlus. Get more coupons by creating more email addresses: Stores love to send coupons and deals to your email. Imagine how much money you would save if you got several newsletter copies from multiple email accounts. Compare prices: To prevent overpaying, get the PriceBlink browser add-on. It is available for Chrome, Mozilla, and Safari. The browser saves you time by pulling prices for the same product from a number of retailers.

      "text": "According to a new survey conducted by Signal, the Amazon threat is real for retailers this holiday season, with 42% of US consumers reporting that the big online retailer will be their primary holiday gift destination. While total 2016 retail holiday season sales are predicted to increase just 1.8% over last year, ecommerce sales are anticipated to increase 13.3%, meaning that retailers must up the digital ante when planning for this critical time of year, says the report.\nThe primary way holiday shoppers browse for gifts is on a desktop/laptop (36%), but:\nThe most frequent way consumers purchase gifts is in-stores (33%) 1 in 5 consumers primarily browse via mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) 8% use smartphones 7% use tablets as their primary way to make holiday purchases Of those surveyed 42% say that Amazon is the main retailer where they purchase gifts, but 40% say it’s not. Consumers like Amazon…\nBecause it is easy (50%) Because they are Prime members (36%) Because they like the product reviews and recommendations (29%) 43% of the respondents say that digital advertising on a website or in a mobile app somewhat influences their holiday gift buying. Consumers appreciate the information that can be found in digital ads. One-third of respondents said that ads help them get discounts or deals, and 27% said that ads provide them with new gift ideas. But, 48% of people surveyed said that digital ads are annoying, says the report.\nMike Sands, CEO, Signal, says “…the retail environment is complicated with mega-competitors like Amazon and demanding consumers… but retailers don’t have to be Amazon… as 40% of consumers say they primarily shop elsewhere for holiday gifts… (retailers can) use the wealth of knowledge available in first-party data to understand their customers… gaining the edge… to design personalized experiences… (for) shoppers… “\nTo provide the best holiday shopping experiences the report recommends retailers consider the following steps in their holiday strategies:\nConsumers don’t think in channels, says the report. Findings show that people consistently shop across desktop, mobile, and in stores as it suits their needs. Consumers want the convenience of buying from home and the assurance of handling the product in a store. Buying online/pick up in store, free shipping and easy returns addresses these needs 46% of consumers surveyed said that relevant deals and discounts will motivate them to buy this holiday season. First-party data will help retailers understand what actions are appropriate to provide relevant assistance to a shopper in real-time Concluding, the report emphasizes that Amazon is not unbeatable, as consumers are split on whether or not it’s their primary destination for holiday shopping. Retailers can raise the stakes by leveraging their extensive customer data from all channels and touchpoints to best Amazon with more intelligent and relevant suggestions, including using their locations as distributed, flexible warehouses for pick up and returns, both of which offer cross-sell and upsell opportunities.\nFor additional information from Signal, please visit here.",

      "text": "Earlier this week, Donald Trump launched a Christmas ornament modeled after the president-elect’s signature “Make America Great Again” hat. Its cost? $149. The profit goes to a joint fundraising committee for Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n“Friend, I’ve got just the gift for you and every President-Elect Trump fan on your Christmas list,” Trump’s campaign wrote to supporters. “We’ve created a collectible Make America Great Again Christmas ornament in the shape of the classic red MAGA hat, finished with 14k gold.”\nThe message continued: “President-elect Trump loves Christmas and makes a point of proudly saying ‘Merry Christmas’ every chance he gets. This collectible ornament commemorates Trump’s commitment to the Christmas spirit and will be a great addition to your family’s tree this year.”\nBut many of the reviewers on the product’s Amazon page disagreed, and came up with some biting satire to pan the celebrity businessman’s campaign:\n—  One Star. “It tried to put my nativity figures into an internment camp. Would not buy again.”\n— A Real Bigly Item. “It called Mary a nasty woman, told Joseph to go back where he came from, built a wall around the manger, and then when you press it it sings ‘I’m Dreaming Of A Totally White Christmas.’”\n— Not What I Wanted. “Every autumn my family chooses a new ornament to go onto our holiday tree. This year it was between this ornament and another one that is less flashy, less gaudy, and just overall nicer. During our family meeting we overwhelmingly chose the other ornament but somehow we still ended up with this one. We’re not sure what happened.”\n— This isn’t what we ordered. WTH? “My office puts up a tree every year and we pool resources to get a really nice ornament, usually on the pricey side. For example, 8 years ago we got a really nice, hand crafted ornament from Hawaii. We liked it so much, we decided to get another one just like it 4 years later. Well, this year we all got together and chose a sedate, classy ornament from a shop in New York. My New York friends swore by their work and so we voted and chose it.\nBut then this red and gold POS showed up in the mail and we can’t figure out why! We went through the vote hat again and we definitely voted for the New York piece with overwhelming numbers. I’m a bit worried that our manager, who thinks he’s special and soooo sELECTIVE, might have gone over our heads and ordered this one instead.\nIt turns out we can’t get a refund and now we’re stuck with the ugly thing. We put it on the side of the tree facing the wall, but it must be bewitched or something because it keeps reappearing at the top of the tree every morning! We found our angel topper in the corner crying. We don’t know what happened and she says she’s afraid to tell us.\n— Yuge ornament. “Despite ordering a more reasonable ornament, this one arrived. It. Is. Yuge. It’s absolutely yuge. It’s the biggest ornament. Yuge.\nI hung it on my tree, but it is so yuge that it has totally unbalanced my whole tree. No matter where I hang it, the tree leans w y over to the far right.”\n— One Star. “The angel on top of my tree just hired a lawyer.”",

      "text": "People are mad at Amazon over how it handled Nintendo’s $99 3DS Black Friday sale People are pretty disappointed share Nintendo of America One of the most anticipated Black Friday sales was the limited edition Super Mario 3DS , that came in either black or white, for $99. It was the first time that Nintendo was selling its handheld console for under $100 and it was a Black Friday exclusive deal. Customers noticed, however, that the 3DS was available for pre-order on Amazon for a period of about an hour on Nov. 23, two days before the sale was supposed to kick off. The 3DS then officially went on sale on the 24th, and while some customers were able to snag it, most were left in the dark when it went on sale a day earlier than expected. “Like so many others I am disappointed with the random release and was penalized for actually thinking I could buy one when I was supposed too,” one Amazon commenter wrote. Another disappointed customer wrote that he was excited to see a version of the 3DS that he could get for his son at a price he could afford, but when he logged onto the site today, he noticed that it was already sold out and had been since yesterday. He added that he noticed that multiple versions of the 3DS were available through third-party accounts on Amazon for almost double the price. The 3DS deal also went live at retailers like Toys R Us, Walmart and Best Buy on Thursday, but the majority of complaints Amazon customers have is regarding the pre-order and the scalpers that managed to cop more than one or two consoles. “Awesome product so cheap bought two for my kids and five for resale so happy right now,” one Amazon customer wrote. On Nintendo forums and subreddits, players complained that they weren’t aware Amazon was going to push a pre-order for the product and by the time they discovered it — thanks to posts online — it was already gone. “It is absolutely absurd that it went on sale when it did,” one Reddit commenter wrote. “There was no indication that it would be available before tomorrow, and I didn't get any email despite the fact that I requested one to be sent when they became available. I get that they're a business with profit in mind, but this is absurd.” It appears that stock was replenished between yesterday and today, but much like Nintendo’s recent sale of the NES Classic , it sold out within minutes. The deal also applied in-store, with customers reporting that their local Best Buy, GameStop, Walmart or Toys R Us locations had anywhere from 10 to 50 in stock. Polygon has reached out to both Nintendo and Amazon about the sale and will update if more information becomes available. More From Polygon",

      "text": "We were questioning how long Black Friday really was going to be today and yesterday and the past week and for all of eternity. Amazon was and is one of the culprits perpetrating the perpetuation of a dark day in American commerce. But past the weekend, it will keep its website tendencies to where it belongs: on Cyber Monday … week.\nThe e-marketplace is announcing more than 75,000 deals over the next seven days. A lot of the deals on Amazon devices remain as they were since a week ago — that includes 99 cent Dash Buttons with $4.99 credit for whatever product you’re getting, at least 20 percent off Alexa devices and Fire tablets starting at $33.33. And don’t forget, if you have an Alexa device, ask around for some elusive, exclusive deals .\nOf our interest are only a couple of deals such as the Sonos PLAY:1 Compact Wireless Smart Speaker for $149 (though it’s already $50 off direct from Sonos), up to 30 percent off some HP laptops and a Nest Cam for $163.98, even though it’s $149 today.\nYou know what, the more we look into these deals, the more we find ourselves a little bummed — it’s more Black Friday. But keep watch on specific Deals of the Day — that’s where the real, unannounced magic happens.\nThe post Black Friday? Time for Amazon’s Cyber Monday deals! appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Actually we can take benefit from the disk sharing feature of mstsc. Here is how it works: \nGo to find the RDP file amazon asked you to downloaded onto your local PC. right-click --> Edit \nGo to \"Local Resources\" tab --> \"Local devices and resources\" --> \"More\" button \nExpand the \"Drives\" and check the disks you want to share when you TS to the remote box. \nafter connect, you will see the new drives in My Computer already mounted for you. \nIf you want to keep things organized and get better results, create a folder named \"c:\\publish\" (or something else), and then run \"SUBST s: c:\\publish\" in dos prompt. Now you will have a s letter that points to your folder. This way you can map only the folder with files to transfer to the server (the s) with no need to sync the entire c driver. \nFor me, copy speed is 200-300kB/Second. Enjoy!",

      "text": "  08:26 AM EST Report: Amazon Nearing $1 Billion Acquisition Of Dubai Retailer \nRetail giant Amazon.com, Inc. ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) is reportedly set to acquire Dubai-based online retailer Souq.com for up to $1 billion. \nSources close to the matter said that Amazon is getting close to acquiring the entire company: \nSeattle-based Amazon is considering a bid for all of the site, which had initially planned to sell a stake of at least 30 percent, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. No final agreements have been reached and negotiations could still falter, the people said. \nThe move would give Amazon an instant and commanding presence in the Middle East, where it has yet to have any impact. Souq.com sells over 1.5 million different products online to customers in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Like India, the Middle East is seen as an area of explosive ecommerce growth, since the vast majority of shoppers in those densely populated areas still aren’t shopping online. \nThe company has tapped a familiar Wall Street banker to help it complete a sale: \nSouq.com appointed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to find buyers for a share of the company, people familiar with the matter said in September. The company’s existing investors — Tiger Global Management and South Africa’s Naspers Ltd. — were also weighing selling their holdings, the people had said. \nAmazon shares rose $5.18 (+0.66%) to $785.30 in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, AMZN has gained 15.42%, easily surpassing the benchmark S&P 500 index’s 8.25% return during the same period. You are viewing an abbreviated republication of ETF Daily News content.

      "text": "on Nov 25, 2016, 3:15 PM TechSpot \nAmazon quietly acquired a San Francisco-based startup called Biba Systems last year, and according to TechCruch , it plans to use the technology and team behind it to launch a video conferencing product to complement its existing own-brand, cloud-based services for businesses. One source told the publication that “they’re going to launch it at their re:Invent event after Thanksgiving.” \nBiba develops and operates video messaging apps aimed at business users, which offers things like scheduling and management, contacts and presence management, messaging services, screen sharing, and administration features for IT managers. It also holds patents related to video conferencing and audio streaming which have recently been transferred to Amazon Technologies. \nAmazon has been building out Amazon Web Services as marketplace for third-parties to build their services on, but they’ve also developed some of their own, including an email and calendar service called WorkMail and a a desktop virtualization service called WorkSpaces. Adding a workplace collaboration and conferencing product to that mix would be one way to become more competitive against the likes of Microsoft, which rivals AWS with Azure and its own extensive range of enterprise software. \nTechCrunch speculates another area where Amazon might end up using some of Biba’s technology is to expand Twitch — which it acquired in August this year — into a B2B platform.

      "text": "How to stream ‘The Grand Tour’ without giving Amazon money Chris Mills Pin it Share The real ‘new Top Gear ‘ is here, and this one’s actually worth watching. Amazon paid Clarkson & co big bucks to make their new automotive show, and now it’s torturing us by drip-feeding one episode per week. I know that’s how TV has traditionally been delivered, but this is the 21st century, and when an internet company makes a hit TV show, I’m accustomed to calling in sick and binging for two days straight. DON’T MISS: Amazon announces Cyber Monday 2016 sale – here’s everything you need to know More importantly, streaming The Grand Tour requires a Prime subscription . Access to Prime Video comes along with the $99-a-year subscription that also gets you free 2-day shipping, but considering that the TV selection is seriously lacking compared to Netflix, it’s still a lot to pay to see Top Gear. The $99-a-year is a bit much, but there are a few cheaper options. There’s a monthly subscription for $10.49, which you can cancel at any time. If you don’t mind waiting a little, you can get a subscription after a few episodes are up, and watch all those episodes, plus those that are released later on in the month, for the equivalent of one movie ticket. This is also a good time to mention Amazon’s one-month free Prime trial . Provided you have a valid credit card and an Amazon account, you can sign up for a free month of Prime, including benefits like Prime Video. Considering the whack of deals Amazon has going on for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, this probably isn’t a bad time of year to have a Prime membership, either. Just remember to set a reminder (I normally make a calendar event) to cancel before the month is up, and you should be good to go. Worst case Ontario, you’ll get charged for a month of Prime before you forget to cancel. Trending right now:",

What Is the Reality of Amazon’s Growth Runway? 2 words – prime and grocery – sum up company’s growth potential in the US November 26, 2016 | About: AMZN +0% WMT +0% \nAmazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) single-handedly rewrote the way retailers go about their business. \nThe ecommerce giant has spread its wings over more than 10 countries, and there is every reason to believe it will keep adding more regions in the next few decades because, at its core, Amazon is essentially a technology company with layers of regular retail operations such as procurement, warehousing and transportation on top. It has tasted success in a few markets, and the company definitely will try to repeat that model in as many regions as it can. It may not be successful in all the regions, like China, for example, but all Amazon needs is a few successful markets and to keep chipping away at markets where things aren’t that favorable to its model. \nHow much can Amazon grow from here? \nAmazon can be divided into three parts: its North American retail operations, International Retail operations and its amazingly successful cloud business, Amazon Web Services. In terms of retail sales, North America is its biggest market, with revenue already nearing $20 billion every quarter. However, that’s still many years away from the $74.55 billion Walmart ( NYSE:WMT ) recorded in sales in the third quarter from the U.S. alone. Peter Lynch Chart of AMZN \nThe U.S. retail industry is expected to hit $5 trillion by 2018, and Amazon’s hold is less than 2% of the market. Clearly, there is plenty of room to grow for a company that wants everybody to use its platform to buy and sell its goods – both consumers and businesses. And it is now targeting a big segment of that market – groceries. \nThe grocery market is one area in which Amazon wants desperately to win, not just because this market is worth in excess of $600 billion in sales annually but also because that’s the Achilles' heel for any ecommerce company due to the time-bound logistics involved. Brick-and-mortar stores with established networks will always have a huge edge over new competitors, and Amazon’s lack of physical presence is a huge roadblock to its success in grocery operations. Nevertheless, Amazon has been slowly building its presence in that area, and there is always the possibility of Amazon adding Walmart-style “neighborhood” stores to expand its grocery network’s reach. \nThe entire retail market, along with the subset of groceries, is Amazon’s runway over the next few years in its home market alone. But the company will have to continue to take away customers from its competitors, just as it has done in the past. And Amazon Prime is its secret weapon. In an effort to get customers signed up to the Prime program, the company is incentivizing it from every angle – even adding a monthly option for people interested in seasonal deals. \nAs such, the growth of Amazon Prime’s user base within the country will make sure sales keep ticking up steadily over time until they are comparable to Walmart’s – and then exceed them. \nDisclosure: I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours. \nStart a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.

      "text": "print Michael Seto/Business Insider \nMotorola used to be one of those giant corporate conglomerates that employed 150,000 people, many at a massive campus in Schaumburg, Illinois. But it hit hard times, and over the last several years it sold off chunks of itself and became Motorola Solutions. \nMotorola Solutions is still a huge company. It employs around 14,000 and generated $5.8 billion in revenue over the last four quarters. But it has sold the huge campus and moved to new headquarters in Chicago. \nAs part of its move and cost cutting, Motorola is unplugging its data centers and going all-in in the cloud. \nIts cloud of choice is Amazon Web Services, Leo Wang, head of cloud computing, told Business Insider. \n\"When we first we started, we were moving just one data center, our Schaumburg data center,\" he said. \"Within 6 to 7 months, we moved more than 200,000 servers, and 150 applications, and we had more than $2 million in computer yearly spend moved over to AWS.\" \nAnd they liked AWS so much, they decided to move everything else into it, worldwide, over the course of the next two years, Wang said. \n\"We save millions per year. We invested millions initially but the long range savings will be significant, and we have a more aggressive plan next year and the year after.\" \nChoosing Amazon wasn't automatic. In fact, Motorola already had a smaller contract with Microsoft to use its competing cloud, Azure. But Microsoft wasn't able to turn that into a bigger sale. Why Microsoft didn't win \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella Business Insider \nMotorola Solutions sells radios and communications equipment to government agencies like police, fire, other emergency services. \nThey chose Azure because Azure had a crucial government security certification known as Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) and Amazon didn't. \nSo when Motorola opted to move everything to the cloud, the IT folks looked at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. \n\"Amazon had better technologies in almost all areas. It is much more mature in terms of functionality. They excelled in every aspect that we needed from the cloud perspective and from the customer service perspective, but they didn’t have the CIJS compliance,\" Wang said. \nBut CIJS certification was a deal breaker, they told Amazon. \n\"Initially, they were hesitating. They were not interested in having this certification because they were so big in the market,\" Wang says. \nBut they agreed to look into it and decided to get CIJS, realizing it could open up new government markets for its cloud. Amazon is already making a name for itself pursuing government cloud business with its \"GovCloud,\" a highly secured section of the AWS's services reserved for government use. \n\"Once they realized the importance of this certification in this industry, they invested. In a few months they were certified, and they created a Gov Cloud for us,\" Wang said. \nMotorola Solutions head of cloud computing Leo Wang Leo Wang \nBy doing this, Motorola was able to launch a brand new app for its law enforcement customers on AWS that lets them store camera footage on AWS. This app has the potential to be huge for Motorola and AWS, Wang believes. \nAmazon isn't known for its customer service, but Wang can't sing AWS's support praises any louder. \n\"Andy Jassy personally came to our office and had a detailed look at what we had. They put a lot of attention to us,\" Wang said. \nIn comparing AWS's support to that from Microsoft, he called it \"very different,\" saying, \"With AWS we are very tightly engaged with them in almost all efforts. We have meetings, we share our concerns, we have follow up, and a consultant works closely with us, and works closely with the product team.\" Amazon's big gotcha \nThere is one big downside to choosing Amazon: it's harder to keep track of costs. \nLike all cloud providers Amazon charges for the actual time each machine (known as an instance) is used. That's a benefit over buying servers, which a company pays for if they use them or not. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy WSJ D.Live/screen capture \nBut if a company is not carefully watching its Amazon usage, it could run up a huge bill. \n\"In the cloud, it’s so easy to create resources, but the right governance over the usage is needed for you to get the price benefits. You need to be able to start and stop that instance only when the app is running.\" Wang said. \"If you simply spin up the servers without proper governance, you could end up paying more.\" \nAWS doesn't make this task easy. \n\"AWS, their pricing model is very complicated, that is a drawback,\" Wang says. He has complained to AWS about it and believes \"they are improving in that area.\" \nThere are hoards of apps that will monitor Amazon usage. Motorola doesn't use them. Instead, it hired a cloud consultant, 2nd Watch, to help it move to AWS, size everything properly, train the IT staff and set up its own internal systems for watching usage, Wang says. Downsizing Oracle \nLarry Ellison Business Insider \nOne bonus for moving to the cloud is that Motorola has a chance to look at its big expensive apps, like Oracle's database, and ditch them. \n\"In some of the instances, if we can use AWS [databases] instead of Oracle, we are doing that,\" he said, though he's not ready to dump Oracle completely. \"Oracle is still our big partner.\" \nThis is a huge concern for Oracle these days, as Amazon rolls out more database alternatives and has created a tool that helps a company move its database from Oracle to Amazon's homegrown one. Avoiding hard feelings \nMotorola Solutions Chicago cloud team Leo Wang \nOne last thing Motorola needed to work on was getting the IT staff on board. No one lost their jobs because of this move, Wang says. That's because Motorola had an outsourcer called CSC managing its infrastructure. With AWS, it won't need CSC. \nBut there's still some jealousy among the staff. \n\"My team is very excited because they are the core cloud computing team, doing the work. Some other IT teams are feeling left out. I can sense that kind of feeling,\" he said. \nSo, Wang says, he's working on eventually getting the other IT folks trained on the cloud. And people are excited to learn all the latest, greatest cloud tech. It's good for their careers. \"I will help them and they will help me, too.\" Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

      "text": "Earlier this week, Donald Trump launched a Christmas ornament modeled after the president-elect’s signature “Make America Great Again” hat. Its cost? $149. The profit goes to a joint fundraising committee for Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee.\n“Friend, I’ve got just the gift for you and every President-Elect Trump fan on your Christmas list,” Trump’s campaign wrote to supporters. “We’ve created a collectible Make America Great Again Christmas ornament in the shape of the classic red MAGA hat, finished with 14k gold.”\nThe message continued: “President-elect Trump loves Christmas and makes a point of proudly saying ‘Merry Christmas’ every chance he gets. This collectible ornament commemorates Trump’s commitment to the Christmas spirit and will be a great addition to your family’s tree this year.”\nBut many of the reviewers on the product’s Amazon page disagreed, and came up with some biting satire to pan the celebrity businessman’s campaign:\n— One Star. “It tried to put my nativity figures into an internment camp. Would not buy again.”\n— A Real Bigly Item. “It called Mary a nasty woman, told Joseph to go back where he came from, built a wall around the manger, and then when you press it it sings ‘I’m Dreaming Of A Totally White Christmas.’”\n— Not What I Wanted. “Every autumn my family chooses a new ornament to go onto our holiday tree. This year it was between this ornament and another one that is less flashy, less gaudy, and just overall nicer. During our family meeting we overwhelmingly chose the other ornament but somehow we still ended up with this one. We’re not sure what happened.”\n— This isn’t what we ordered. WTH? “My office puts up a tree every year and we pool resources to get a really nice ornament, usually on the pricey side. For example, 8 years ago we got a really nice, hand crafted ornament from Hawaii. We liked it so much, we decided to get another one just like it 4 years later. Well, this year we all got together and chose a sedate, classy ornament from a shop in New York. My New York friends swore by their work and so we voted and chose it.\nBut then this red and gold POS showed up in the mail and we can’t figure out why! We went through the vote hat again and we definitely voted for the New York piece with overwhelming numbers. I’m a bit worried that our manager, who thinks he’s special and soooo sELECTIVE, might have gone over our heads and ordered this one instead.\nIt turns out we can’t get a refund and now we’re stuck with the ugly thing. We put it on the side of the tree facing the wall, but it must be bewitched or something because it keeps reappearing at the top of the tree every morning! We found our angel topper in the corner crying. We don’t know what happened and she says she’s afraid to tell us.\n— Yuge ornament. “Despite ordering a more reasonable ornament, this one arrived. It. Is. Yuge. It’s absolutely yuge. It’s the biggest ornament. Yuge.\nI hung it on my tree, but it is so yuge that it has totally unbalanced my whole tree. No matter where I hang it, the tree leans w y over to the far right.”\n— One Star. “The angel on top of my tree just hired a lawyer.”",

      "text": "The real ‘new Top Gear ‘ is here, and this one’s actually worth watching. Amazon paid Clarkson & co big bucks to make their new automotive show, and now it’s torturing us by drip-feeding one episode per week.\nI know that’s how TV has traditionally been delivered, but this is the 21st century, and when an internet company makes a hit TV show, I’m accustomed to calling in sick and binging for two days straight.\nDON’T MISS: Amazon announces Cyber Monday 2016 sale – here’s everything you need to know\nMore importantly, streaming The Grand Tour requires a Prime subscription . Access to Prime Video comes along with the $99-a-year subscription that also gets you free 2-day shipping, but considering that the TV selection is seriously lacking compared to Netflix, it’s still a lot to pay to see Top Gear.\nThe $99-a-year is a bit much, but there are a few cheaper options. There’s a monthly subscription for $10.49, which you can cancel at any time. If you don’t mind waiting a little, you can get a subscription after a few episodes are up, and watch all those episodes, plus those that are released later on in the month, for the equivalent of one movie ticket.\nThis is also a good time to mention Amazon’s one-month free Prime trial . Provided you have a valid credit card and an Amazon account, you can sign up for a free month of Prime, including benefits like Prime Video. Considering the whack of deals Amazon has going on for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, this probably isn’t a bad time of year to have a Prime membership, either.\nJust remember to set a reminder (I normally make a calendar event) to cancel before the month is up, and you should be good to go. Worst case Ontario, you’ll get charged for a month of Prime before you forget to cancel.\nTrending right now:\nApple’s Black Friday sale is awful, so here are all the best iPhone deals Amazon announces Cyber Monday 2016 sale – here’s everything you need to know Galaxy S8 will supposedly steal another big feature from the iPhone 7 See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Share This Tweet This \nAmazon is having plans to start its own streaming service, and held talks with NBA, NLF and MLB in a bed to challenge cable networks for live game rights. \nAccording to dailymail , Amazon have already inquired about getting the gaming live rights for basketball, football and baseball to give the customers an exclusive sports package with a Amazon Prime membership. However the details regarding this is still not clear. \nAmazon's prime loyalty program offers original TV programming with access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Video and Prime Music. Along with this, it offers one-hour delivery of purchase for an annual fee of USD 99 as reported by reuters . Advertisement \nThe company is now in touch with smaller leagues such as the Atlantic coast conference, MLS, college sports network campus, National Lacrosse League, 120 Sports, Major League Lacrosse and the World Surf League for game rights. They are enthusiastic about showing live sport soon and thus contact traditional TV networks for the game rights they are not using. \nUnivision for Mexican soccer league games, ESPN and ONE World Sports are among the network thought to approached. \nAs for the comment Amazon, the NLF, the NBA and MLB were not available to give any of their opinion yet. World Surf League spokesman said that, they don not comment on any partnership, potential or otherwise until it is appropriate. \nNone of the networks could reach for a comment immediately after talks with Amazon. The whole idea came when the company realize that sports fans comes on the internet to watch video at the expense of traditional cable and satellite connections. And, it looks like it's not just Amazon who's having talks but other tech giant social networking sites like Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc are also signing up deals to start their video services Advertisement ",

      "text": "Amazon snaps up Rolling Stone executive editor to head editorial for Amazon Unlimited Music By Staff Writer - 27 November 2016 11:59am Amazon snaps up Rolling Stone executive editor as head of editorial for Amazon Music . \nAmazon has poached Rolling Stone’s executive editor Nathan Brackett to head editorial for its recently launched music service. \nThe hire was reported by Music Business Worldwide and comes just weeks after the online behemoth unveiled its Amazon Unlimited Music offer . \nBrackett joined Rolling Stone in 1996 as associate editor before he became senior editor in 2001. He stayed in the role until for six years and then became editor of the title’s site and then deputy managing director of Rolling Stone itself. In 2013, he became executive editor. \nLittle is known about the hire but it chimes with recent moves by other streaming services to make editorial a core part of what they offer listeners. Essentially, editorial for streaming services like Amazon Unlimited Music and Spotify refers to how they curate the tens of millions of songs they offer into playlists. With many streaming services having similar music rights, there’s more focus on how tunes are organised into specific selections for users to keep them coming back. \nOne Direction’s manager Will Bloomfield spoke about the trend recently: “Our greatest challenge is breaking artists,” he explained at an event hosted by media consultancy ID Comms. “We’re currently breaking songs in our business world and that’s much harder and it takes much longer [for a potential fan] to buy into the artists proposition, which means we have to look at the trajectory of an artist. It used to be two to three years, whereas now it’s more like four to five years.” \nIt's such a key trend for streaming services that many of them have splashed the cash this year to get high-profile music media executives. Zane Lowe was among the first this year, when he quit BBC Radio 1 to join Bears 1 radio at Apple Music in California. He was quickly followed by four BBC Radio 1 producers. \nSpotify has also raided the BBC when it hired former head of music George Ergatoudis as head of content programmatic for the UK. \nThis article is about: World , Amazon , music streaming , Media , Digital , Technology , Brand Staff Writer \nThe Drum is all about modern marketing and media. In addition this website and The Drum magazine, the company is also responsible for the Recommended Agency Register - which aims to match the right agencies with the rights clients - and MiNetwork, an organisation which aims to make independently minded agencies more successful.",
