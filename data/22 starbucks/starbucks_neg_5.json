(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year’s more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10. \nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening. \n\nContact Joseph Pisani at http://twitter.com/josephpisani . \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "SEATTLE — Red cups are back at Starbucks — and they’re looking a lot more like Christmas this year.\nThe coffee company introduced its new holiday cups in stores Thursday morning. They feature 13 seasonal illustrations created by customers from six countries.\nAmong them are classic holiday images like reindeer, ornaments and snow-covered landscapes, marking a return to a more traditional and overtly Christmas-inspired promotion. Last year’s red cups drew controversy for abandoning seasonal designs in favor of a simple, two-toned red cup.\nStarbucks said at the time that it wanted a “purity of design that welcomes all of our stories.” Critics called it a declaration of war on Christmas.\nThe new designs were culled from more than 1,000 submissions Starbucks received last December when it asked customers to share designs on Instagram.\nStarbucks says it asked a small group of customers to mail in their cup so they could be reviewed for potential production.\nThe return of the red cup has been rumored for more than a week, after fans began noticing boxes at Starbucks stores labeled “no peeking” until Thursday.\nStarbucks didn’t comment on its red cup plans at the time, and instead unveiled a pre-election, limited edition green “unity” cup that CEO Howard Schultz called “a reminder of our shared values” during a “divisive time in our country.”\nCheck out all 13 new designs below: \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n \n(Starbucks)\n",

      "text": "Amendment 71: Coloradans approve making constitution harder to amend The Associated Press In this Tuesday, November 8, 2016 photo, Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York. \nNEW YORK — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who’ve made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks’ return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n“It’s just a cup,” he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.

Even though Starbucks hasn't printed those words on the cups for several years, the two-toned, minimalist red coffee cup instead of the usual designs of snowflakes and ornaments led to some expressing their anger on social media. (Published Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2015) Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. On Nov. 10, the coffee chain will use 13 different designs created by customers on their red cups. In a prepared statement, the company noted that the designs were chosen from 1,200 submissions they received from around the world. Shkreli Shares Wu-Tang Album to Celebrate Trump Win “We were surprised and inspired by the amount of incredible art submitted by our customers. The designs were beautiful, expressive and engaging,” said Dena Blevins, creative director, Starbucks Global Creative Studio. “We quickly realized there was potential to use the customer-created art for our holiday cups.” The chain is marking the launch with a buy-one-get-one-free deal on holiday beverages from 2-5 p.m. Thursday-Sunday at certain locations. Wildest Food Crazes: Girl Scout Cookies Cereal General Mills “We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks' global chief marketing officer, said in the same prepared statement. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. Last week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10.

      "text": "Someone from Toronto designed new Starbucks holiday cup Posted by Amy Grief / November 10, 2016 \nThe red cups are here! That's right, it's officially the holiday season in Toronto because the Starbucks red cups have landed at cafes all across the city . Instead of the much-maligned simple design from last year, Starbucks has introduced 13 different cups designed by loyal customers from around the world, including two artists from the Toronto area. \nStarbucks asked customers to share their cup designs on Instagram . The global coffee chain chose 13 from the 1,200 entries it received. \nAnna, from Toronto, created the so-called \"Love and Joy\" cup. It features a snow-covered village and leaping reindeer. According to Starbucks, Ann \"was trained in petrykivka , an ancient Ukrainian decorative folk art, which influenced her design's intricate line work and details.\" \nErica, a new paralegal graduate from Markham, made the \"Graphic Swirls\" cup. She got started on it while helping her sister recover from knee surgery. \"My sister was stuck on the couch for a month, so we spent a lot of time colouring together,\" she told Starbucks. \"When I wanted to change it up, I switched to doodling on Starbucks cups!\" \nAnna and Erica's cups join 11 other festive creations by coffee drinkers from various countries, including Russia, Indonesia and the United States. \nPhotos via Starbucks.",

      "text": "Email \nStarbucks is giving a sneak preview of the 13 new designs set to adorn their red holiday cups, starting Thursday. \nThe designs include Christmas lights, candy canes, snowflakes and a reindeer, to name a few. Starbucks chose the winning designs from an Instagram contest that included submissions from more than a dozen countries. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nIt’s been a year since Starbucks rolled out solid red holiday cups with a minimalist logo, unwittingly sparking a backlash on Twitter as people accusing the Seattle company of waging a “war on Christmas.” \nLed by American evangelist Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them. \nStarbucks is sweetening the rollout of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between Nov. 10 to 14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. See the full rules here . \nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday: (Starbucks) ",

Last year, Starbucks had plain red holiday cups, with some customers using their cups as canvasses for creative art designs.\"The artists behind the work hail from all over the world - a college student studying in Germany, a hairstylist near Philadelphia, an aspiring artist in New York,\" Starbucks said on Wednesday. \"Their inspiration came from nature and seasonal traditions. Some are bold and graphic while others evoke the feeling of an old-fashioned storybook.

Get ready @Starbucks pic.twitter.com/8Id9YW5kAl \n— (((tramosUSA))) (@voteblue16) September 7, 2016 \nLed by “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them. \nStarbucks is sweetening the roll-out of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between November 10-14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. See the full rules here . \nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday: (Starbucks) ",

Last year, Starbucks had plain red holiday cups, with some customers using their cups as canvasses for creative art designs.\"The artists behind the work hail from all over the world - a college student studying in Germany, a hairstylist near Philadelphia, an aspiring artist in New York,\" Starbucks said on Wednesday. \"Their inspiration came from nature and seasonal traditions. Some are bold and graphic while others evoke the feeling of an old-fashioned storybook. Together the collection expresses the shared spirit of the season.\"The coffee chain faced controversy last year year for their plain red cups, with some social media users criticizing Starbucks for removing their holiday-themed designs. Last week, the chain also released a green cup ahead of Election Day, calling it a \"symbol of unity.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report. Related Topics:",

      "text": "\nStarbucks\nToday is the day we’ve all been waiting for. The day that Starbucks, the most venerated purveyor of holiday goods and arbiter of things that are right in the world finally releases their real holiday cups . And it’s not just one cup, either. There are 13 cups in all. And they’re all designed by you, the enthusiastic consumer who knows that no six-hour holiday shopping trip (good luck out there!) is complete without a gingerbread latter ensconced in a container that lets everyone know that the holidays are your favorite time of year (and not just because Bath&BodyWorks has so many crazy sales that it’s almost impossible to walk by that store without dropping $200 on sprays and lotions).\nSo what do the holiday cups look like? Well, they’re very, very festive. In fact, E ater goes so far as to refer to them as “festive AF,” which isn’t incorrect, but also makes them sound just a bit edgier than they are. Check ’em out:\n\nStarbucks\nLook at them, they’ve got everything: Reindeer and snowflakes and Christmas trees and even a peaceful barren landscape that suggests the nuclear winter that we will all one day face! So exciting! So festive! Cups that Eater reports even our president elect will be all over ! \nAre the cups a response to the completely manufactured outrage that took over the internet for a few days last November? Actually, yes! Because Starbucks — being a media-savvy company that understands their audience — took some time and decided that, hey, if people care about these cups so much, why not have the public design them?\nFrom Starbucks’ official press release :\nFor years Starbucks customers have been decorating their white cups (Starbucks even held a contest to support this creativity). Taking a cue from customers who had been using their red holiday cups as a canvas, last December Starbucks invited customers to share their designs on Instagram.\nFrom Illinois to Indonesia, Pennsylvania to Korea, Dubai to Ontario, in just eight days, Starbucks received more than 1,200 individual submissions from 13 countries. Many of the images were featured in an online cup collection .\n“We were surprised and inspired by the amount of incredible art submitted by our customers. The designs were beautiful, expressive and engaging,” said Dena Blevins, creative director, Starbucks Global Creative Studio. “We quickly realized there was potential to use the customer-created art for our holiday cups.”\nStarbucks commissioned 13 of the most impressive designs and now they’re here, and they’re beautiful, and — just like the green cups that have already kicked off the holiday season — they’re meant to inspire unity and togetherness and remind the world that the holidays (and it’s not just Christmas) are all about us putting aside our differences and drinking peppermint-based coffee concoctions until we literally can’t even anymore. \n(Via Eater )\n",

      "text": "share \nIn a world filled with many items, there is none more divisive right now than the 2015 Red Starbucks Cup™. On the surface, it might look like a simple crimson container sized to hold either 8, 12, 16, 20, or 30 fluid ounces of the life-giving dark nectar we know as coffee. \nBut it's much more than that. \nIn certain pockets of the US, it speaks to something larger than the vessel from which we drink our hot, caffeinated beverages. To some, the naked red cup, unadorned with symbols like holly or snowflakes, is an affront against the Christian faith, a cut against Christianity. For others, it's a chance to beat their chests and scream about Christian and conservative stupidity into the faceless void of the internet. \nThe culture wars have come to disposable paper Starbucks cups. \nAmericans fighting over what is printed on a coffee cup designed by a billion-dollar company to promote conformity sounds like cold German satire: While the world rages on and problems like starvation, a massive refugee crisis , and homelessness remain unfixed, people in America — including an American presidential candidate — are arguing over a red beverage container. \nBut there's nothing satirical about this. The conflict over this dumb cup is so passionate that the original version of a viral \"Starbucks' War on Christmas\" video has more than 14 million views . It's also an unflinchingly real slice of American internet culture and the outrage machine that fuels it. Here's what the Starbucks red cup looks like now and what it looked like in 2014 \nAccording to Starbucks , the holiday cup began in 1997 with a \"jazz-themed design in jewel tones of deeper reds, greens and blues.\" Each year since then, the coffee giant's holiday cups return, and have become a corporate tradition in the process. The cups make the transition from plain white to holiday-themed in November; this year they changed over on November 3 . \nSo here it is. Here is the source of all this pain, anger, and outrage: The 2015 cup on the left; the 2014 cup on the right. (KAREN BLEIER/AFP/Getty Images) \nThe 2015 cup (left) is obviously different from the 2014 cup (right). The shade of red is different (brighter!), and the cup doesn't have the pine tree print. Sear this image into your brain. Why some Christians are mad about Starbucks's 2015 red cup \nThe fight over Starbucks's cup actually begins with a man named Joshua Feuerstein and a viral video in which he claims Starbucks can't celebrate Christmas. \nFeuerstein, who looks a bit like Kevin James and whose voice bears an uncanny resemblance to Seth Rogen's, describes himself as an \"American evangelist, internet, and social media personality\"; his personal website touts his \"Facebook fame\" and internet success: \nFeuerstein’s social media success led him to be the subject of a recent BBC Trending episode. In addition, he has hosted or been the guest on television and syndicated radio talk shows, such as TBN. \nFeuerstein has a big Christian, conservative following, and as he'll probably tell you himself, he's good at making things that are popular on the internet. He frequently does thisby harnessing the power of polarizing religious topics. In one of his videos, he attempts to dispel evolution , saying that it isn't a science. \nDear Mr. Atheist ... allow me to destroy evolution in 3 minutes! #SHAREifyouCARE #WOW Posted by Joshua Feuerstein on Friday, May 23, 2014 \nThat piece was shared more than 201,000 times and received more than 1.8 million \"likes\" on Facebook. But it's not just people who agree with Feuerstein's views who watched the video. The reason Feuerstein's videos are so popular is that many people disagree with him. One of the most \"liked\" comments in the meandering thread of responses to the evolution video comes from a guy who calls Feuerstein ignorant: \nFeuerstein's new Starbucks outrage video might be the biggest of his social media career. It's a rant stemming from a conservative Christian belief that there is a \"war on Christmas,\" and that each year during the holidays, Christians are persecuted by companies . The video, which Feuerstein posted on November 5, has amassed more than 14 million views. \nStarbucks REMOVED CHRISTMAS from their cups because they hate Jesus ... SO I PRANKED THEM ... and they HATE IT!!!! #shareUse #MERRYCHRISTMASSTARBUCKSFollow --> Joshua Feuerstein Posted by Joshua Feuerstein on Thursday, November 5, 2015 \nOver the course of nearly one and a half minutes, Feuerstein talks about how Starbucks has caved to political correctness. \n\"Do you realize that Starbucks wanted to take Christ and Christmas off of their brand new cups?\" he asks. \"In fact, do you know that Starbucks isn't allowed to say merry Christmas to their customers?\" \nBut what Feuerstein's saying is a lie. \nIt's doubtful that Feuerstein had any input, insider knowledge, or consultation with the design team responsible for Starbucks's 2015 red cup or the coffee company's rationale for making the cup plain red. But he's wrong about Starbucks refusing to celebrate Christian holidays. If you peruse the Starbucks website, you'll find several pieces of merchandise that prove otherwise, including Christmas ornaments , an advent calendar , and \"Christmas blend\" coffee: \nThere's also a Starbucks \"Christmas\" gift card: (Starbucks) \nBut Feuerstein's most blatant untruth, and the reason for all the current furor about the 2015 red cup, is the implication that Starbucks at one time printed the word \"Christmas\" on its holiday cups and is now being stifled or stifling itself from doing so. In the past six years, Starbucks, which doesn't identify itself as a Christian company, has never put the words \"Merry Christmas\" on its holiday cups — instead, it's used wintry and vaguely holiday-esque imagery and language, including ornaments that say things like \"joy\" or \"hope,\" snowmen, and holly. Here are the cups dating back from 2009: \nHowever, the fact that Feuerstein's assertion is false doesn't seem to matter to his followers, who've rallied around the video and helped it gain prevalence. The company has been a target of right-wing and Christian criticism in the past because of its support for same-sex marriage and its opposition to open carry firearms in its stores, even in states where it is legal . Meanwhile, conservative media outlets like Breitbart have weighed in, too, echoing Feuerstein's message. \n\"The Red Cups are now an anti-Christmas symbol, with Starbucks declaring their formerly Christmassy cups to be 'holiday beverages' and shedding any sign of Christmas from them,\" Breitbart's Raheem Kassam wrote in his provocatively titled column \"Starbucks Red Cups Are Emblematic of the Christian Culture Cleansing of the West.\" \nThe protest eventually trickled its way up to American presidential candidate Donald Trump, who couldn't resist the opportunity to comment. \"Maybe we should boycott Starbucks? I don't know. Seriously, I don't care,\" Trump told supporters in Springfield, Illinois , on November 9. \"If I become president, we're all going to be saying Merry Christmas again, that I can tell you.\" The design of Starbucks's red cups wouldn't be as big of a news story if the internet wasn't so predisposed to outrage \nAt any given minute, millions of stories are being shared online by millions of people. Those stories are as diverse as the people reading them, but there's one common reason we pass them around: They help define us. Sharing stories allows us a low-effort way to tell people what we care about, what we find funny, what makes us angry, and how smart we are. And plenty of Feuerstein's followers undoubtedly feel the same way he does. \nBut there are just as many people who hate-share his videos. If you search for \"MerryChristmasStarbucks\" (one of the primary hashtags for the red cup \"controversy\"), you'll find myriad posts by self-identified Christians about how dumb the protest is. \n\"I do have issues with #MerryChristmasStarbucks, though. Most of American Christianity’s blatant problems are exposed in this one excruciatingly real social campaign,\" Nate Lake, a Christian college student and soon-to-be Starbucks employee wrote in a blog post that's gone viral in the wake of the red cup kerfuffle. He continues: \nAnother reason #MerryChristmasStarbucks is everything wrong with American Christianity is its improper, miscalculated expectation of Christian values from a non-Christian entity. Simply put, Starbucks is not a Christ-centered company. That doesn’t make Starbucks bad. \nThere are also counter hashtags like #itsjustacup, and viral Instagram posts like this one denouncing Starbucks protesters: A photo posted by Christian Watson (@1924us) on Nov 8, 2015 at 3:13pm PST \nActress, Aries, and devout Christian Candace Cameron Bure has also weighed in, saying that the controversy is a non-issue. \"Until Starbucks puts a baby Jesus or nativity scene on the cup while saying Merry Christmas, then pulls it because they say it’s offensive, let’s talk,\" she wrote in a wildly popular Instagram post: A photo posted by Candace Cameron Bure (@candacecbure) on Nov 9, 2015 at 8:28am PST \nJournalists have helped this backlash gain steam. \"The phony ‘War on Christmas’ is back, fueled by those alleged Jesus haters at Starbucks,\" the Washington Post asserted; while Us Weekly opted for \"Starbucks' Plain Red Holiday Cups Are Causing Outrage Among Christians,\" and Jezebel went with \"Christians Angry Over Starbucks' Minimalist Holiday Cup Design.\" These are good headlines that compel you to click and make you a little angry, whether it's at the publication for being glib (\"Jesus Haters\") or at the Christians for overreacting. The Starbucks controversy flattened Christianity into something easy to hate \nPortraying the red cup protest as something that all Christians (as opposed to some Christians) are participating in makes the movement seem bigger and more connected to our personal lives than it is. The protest began in evangelical and fundamentalist Christian circles — a world that is foreign to a lot of Americans. But painting it as something that mainstream Christianity is actively involved in — even if this is not the case — suddenly makes it more immediate, urgent, and outrage-worthy. \nThe way news is shared on the internet has an indomitable way of flattening complex ideas into simplistic, easily digestible things. With this protest, the complex idea of Christianity has been compressed into a simple matter of people who are irrationally angry at a red cup. It's easy to see why people who identify as Christians would quickly share this story to announce that they're not like the people protesting. Meanwhile, for people who don't believe in organized religion, the story marks yet another instance of people acting dumb in the name of religion. \nOn social media, yelling about what we don't like defines us as much as the things we do like. The wicked irony of Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram is that this backlash makes more people aware of the protest's existence. And as we saw during a recent racist Star Wars protest , the anger against the movement can amplify the original message to the point where it becomes a vast echo chamber of backlash. It actually doesn't matter what Starbucks says about its red cups — we've already decided \nOn November 8, three days after Feuerstein's initial outrage video was posted, Starbucks explained why it chose a plain cup this year. The company explained that it went with an ombré design — the red is brighter on top and darkens into a shade of cranberry — as a nod to simplicity. \n\"Starbucks has become a place of sanctuary during the holidays,\" Jeffrey Fields, Starbucks vice president of design and content, said in a statement. \"We’re embracing the simplicity and the quietness of it. It’s a more open way to usher in the holiday.\" \nThough the company didn't cite Feuerstein's video, it did make a mention of how the company wants to be respectful of customers' religious beliefs: \nCreating a culture of belonging, inclusion and diversity is one of the core values of Starbucks, and each year during the holidays the company aims to bring customers an experience that inspires the spirit of the season. Starbucks will continue to embrace and welcome customers from all backgrounds and religions in our stores around the world. \nAnd in perhaps a great moment of self-awareness, Starbucks invited its customers to imbue the red cups with their own stories (as many already have): \nTaking a cue from customers who have been doodling designs on cups for years (Starbucks held a contest to support this creativity), this year’s design is another way Starbucks is inviting customers to create their own stories with a red cup that mimics a blank canvas. \nBut in reality, Starbucks was never in control of the situation. Once Feuerstein's video took hold, we all made up our minds about both the protest and the coffee company, bolstered by our own opinions (or lack thereof) on Christianity and political correctness. Starbucks says it wanted us to \"create our own stories\" — and we did. Was this article helpful?",

      "text": "Copycat Starbucks Bistro Boxes More Most people think of Starbucks as a place to get coffee, not a meal or a snack. Truthfully, most of the Starbucks food items clock in with outrageously high numbers of calories and fat. Still, Starbucks can be quite the temptation if you enter the store with an empty stomach. Their new bistro boxes , however, stand apart from their crumb cakes and cake pops. They're lower in calories and a great option for healthy, on-the-go snacking or a light lunch or dinner. [tiImage is_image=\"1\" image_id=\"228983\" image_style=\"1200x900\" align=\"center\"] We know several frequent fliers who rely on them for a consistent meal when they're hopping between flights. After all, most airports, no matter how small, have at least one Starbucks. We visited our nearest full-service Starbucks and picked up one of each bistro box. We liked them so much that we decided to take matters into our own hands and create these nifty snack boxes to take to work and school. A sturdy square container or bento box of your choice is all you need to make these clutch mini-meals in the comfort of your own home. For dips or items that need to be separated, invest in a bento box that has built-in separators and compartments, or use muffin cups for dips and spreads. Paper liners will work if you're eating the box that day. If you're prepping snack packs ahead, look for silicone muffin liners. [tiImage is_trip_dek=\"1\" trip_deck_left=\"228995\" trip_deck_center=\"228992\" trip_deck_right=\"228989\"] Build Your Own Snack Boxes Cheese and Fruit Snack Box: apple slices; brie, gouda, and cheddar cheeses; whole-grain crackers; dried cranberries; roasted unsalted aslmonds PB&J Snack Box: half peanut butter and fruit preserve sandwich on whole-wheat bread; apple slices; Greek yogurt ranch dressing; baby carrots; cucumber slices; low-moisture, part-skim mozzarella cheese stick; raisins Protein Snack Box: no-sugar added peanut butter; hard-boiled egg; apple slices; grapes; cheddar cheese; 100% whole-grain pita Play around with different combinations of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats for a balanced and satisfying snack or meal. Try a hard-boiled egg with veggies, peanut butter and jelly on whole-wheat bread, or cheese and whole-wheat crackers. Toss in something sweet too, like craisins and almonds, dark chocolate, or a piece of fruit. Stick to smaller portions of cheese and nut butters to keep calories in check. Pack these snack boxes at the beginning of the week, and keep a stash for days when you just don't get around to sitting down for lunch. They're an easy way to guarantee you still eat but don't blow your daily goals. Reblog",

      "text": "Getty Images Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz. \n\"Washington has been broken for quite some time,\" Howard Schultz , chairman and CEO of Starbucks , said on Thursday. \n\"The rules of engagement for a public company today are very different as a result of Washington not doing its job,\" he said. \nSchultz spoke from the DealBook Conference in New York, hosted by CNBC anchor and New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and the editors of the Times . The conference focuses on \"playing for the long term\" in a business environment that's shackled to quarterly returns and compressed news cycles. \nLast month, Starbucks announced plans to nearly double its China locations to 5,000 by 2021, after growing locations in the Asian nation from 400 stores in 2011 to more than 2,300 locations today. \nStarbucks has operated in China for nearly two decades amid drastic changes in the region. China is mounting an uneasy transition to a consumer-oriented economy after years of focus on manufacturing by state-owned enterprises. \nSchultz's bullishness on China comes amid an uncertain future for trade there. President-elect Donald Trump has campaigned to raise tariffs on Chinese imports. Schultz endorsed Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton , earlier this year. \nThis is developing news. Please check back for updates. \n— CNBC's Christing Wang contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Starbucks Holiday Cups 2016: Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Debuts 13 Different Designs This Year The cups were designed by customers Nov 10, 2016, 1:14 pm EST | By William White , InvestorPlace Writer \nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) is giving customers a lot of options with its 2016 Starbucks holiday cups. Source: Starbucks Corporation \nThere are 13 different Starbucks holiday cups that customers can get when ordering their drinks. This marks the first time that the coffee chain has offered this many different designs for its holiday cups. \nThe reason for the increase in Starbucks holiday cups this year is an interesting one. The company released a plain red holiday cup last year so that customers could draw what they wanted on it. There was some controversy around these cups, but many fans showed off their designs online. \nThe submissions from customers that had decorated their Starbucks holiday cups made the company realize that it could use them as official designs. Starbucks Corporation contacted 13 customers that had submitted designs and asked them for their cups. It redesigned the cups while making as little change as possible to prepare them for this year’s holiday season. \n“People will be walking around the street in Shanghai, New York and London carrying these cups,”Dena Blevins, Creative Director at Starbucks Global Creative Studio, said in a statement. “We love that this year our customers’ artistry can play a part in brightening someone’s day.” \nStarbucks Corporation also caused some controversy earlier this month when it released its green “Unity” cups . Some customers thought the new cups were the 2016 Starbucks holiday cups and weren’t happy with the color change. This resulted in many SBUX customers taking to social media to complain about the green Unity cups. More From InvestorPlace",

Starbucks has made sure it won’t happen again, debuting 13 winter- and holiday-themed red cups Thursday.\nWe crafted coffee. You made it art. Cups warm a hand, beauty warms the heart. #RedCups pic.twitter.com/3QmdvoNM0S \n— Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 10, 2016 \n\nThe 13 designs were created by customers from across the world and include images of holiday lights, snowflakes and snow-covered trees, as well as Christmas scenes featuring reindeer and sleighs.\nRed paper cups, for hot drinks, are stacked next to plastic cups at a Starbucks coffee shop in the Pike Place Market, Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2015, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) Last year, Starbucks’ two-tone ombre red cups caused quite a stir on social media because they weren’t decorated for the holiday as they had been in previous years.\nSome critics called the cups another example of the ongoing “war on Christmas.”\nJoshua Feuerstein, an American evangelist and former pastor, claimed Starbucks “removed Christmas” from their cups. His video rant was viewed more than 17 million times on Facebook.\n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer, said in a release .\nThe 13 distinct cups are now in more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries for the 2016 holiday season.",

      "text": "Starbucks CEO's Statement About 2016 Election Starbucks's Encouraging Response to the Election Reminds Us to Be Inclusive and Optimistic November 10, 2016 by Erin Cullum 0 Shares \nLike many Americans, Starbucks's CEO Howard Schultz is left feeling disheartened by the 2016 election results . But he wants to send a message of optimism and kindness to all of his employees, partners, and customers. On Nov. 9, he sent an email to all US Starbucks employees (over 120,000) with the subject \"Onward Together.\" \n\"Last night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans — both Democrats and Republicans — I am stunned,\" he wrote. Schultz endorsed Hillary Clinton in September , saying, \"We've seen such vitriolic display of bigotry and hate and divisiveness, and that is not the leadership we need for the future of the country.\" Schultz's compassion is further emphasized by Starbucks's new green holiday cups , which feature a drawing of over a hundred people made with one continuous line. \"During a divisive time in our country, Starbucks wanted to create a symbol of unity as a reminder of our shared values, and the need to be good to each other,\" Schultz said of the cups. \nYou can read Schultz's full email following the election , below. \nDear Partners, \nLast night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans – both Democrats and Republicans – I am stunned. \nWe cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season. \nAs Americans, we must honor the democratic process. We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together. \nWhether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice. Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores. \nWe can choose to answer the challenges of the day with kindness and compassion. We can choose to listen, to understand and to act with respect. We can choose to live by the values that reside in each of us, and honor our commitment to nurture the human spirit with love, and offer everyone in our stores and communities a place of inclusion and optimism. \nToday, I trust you, and I trust all that is good in our country. Let's take care of each other and the people in our lives. I believe we will each find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve. Together is where our collective power lies, as partners, and as Americans. \nI am so very proud to be your partner. \nOnward,",

      "text": "Starbucks’ launch of its annual red holiday cups was met in downtown Seattle Thursday with a demonstration by an environmental group calling for the coffee company to make its cups 100 percent recyclable.\nThe group, called Stand.earth, held its demonstration outside the Starbucks location at Westlake Center.\nStarbucks’ paper cups are coated with plastic on the inside, which the company says allows the beverage quality to hold up. The cup is not recyclable in many areas, although it is in Seattle and some other major cities.\n“What is recyclable varies significantly by municipality and sometimes even by store, and we pay local private haulers across the country to collect and recycle hot cups along with our other recyclable products, compost and trash – and our cup is recyclable in many locations across the country including major cities like Seattle, New York, San Francisco, Washington D.C., and Boston,” according to a company spokesperson.\n  The company has struggled with some of its recycling goals . But it remains committed to cup recycling and gives customers a discount for bringing their own reusable cups, the spokesperson said.\nSeattle Times staff Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.\nEmail address By signing up you are agreeing to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service . \nThanks for signing up!",

      "text": "Starbucks debuted its annual holiday cup on Thursday.\nBut instead of offering customers one festive cup, the coffee company released 13 cups with different designs. All the cups are red with white designs and the company's green and white logo. Some designs feature hand-drawn snowflakes, reindeer, Christmas lights, candy canes, ornaments and Santa Claus riding his sleigh.\nAccording to Starbucks, the cup designs were created by customers from around the world. The designs were submitted to the company via its #RedCupContest last year.\n\"We crafted coffee. You made it art,\" Starbucks wrote in a promotional video with the hashtag #RedCups.\nCustomers complained last year that Starbucks' plain red cups were not festive enough and criticized the company for attempting to be politically correct by taking the Christmas theme off the cups.\nThe coffee giant's vice president of design and content, Jeffrey Fields, told Us Weekly that the plain cups were meant to embrace \"the simplicity and the quietness\" of the holiday season.\nMore recently, Starbucks debuted a green cup that features a mosaic of dozens of people drawn in one continuous stroke. The cup, meant to encourage unity and symbolize \"shared values and the need to be good to each other,\" was criticized when customers believed that the cup was replacing the company's usual red cups.\n\" All these faces on my green cup and not a one of them looks like Santa or Jesus. Why do you still hate Christmas?\" one Twitter user asked the company. Another said the design was \"political brainwashing,\" saying: \"I want snowflakes.\"",

      "text": "After just recently introducing its first-ever iced holiday season drink , Starbucks is back with a new reveal this week. As expected, Starbucks’ consumer-favorite red cups have made a return for Holiday 2016\nStarbucks has been utilizing the festive red cups since 1977 in order to celebrate the spirit of the season. Throughout the years, the designs on the cups have of course evolved, ranging from the modern, using whimsical brushstrokes in bold colors, to the nostalgic, featuring mistletoe and ornaments. For 2016, however, the famed red cups feature designs created by customers, with 13 distinct cups in stores.\n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer.\nBeginning last December, Starbucks encouraged individuals to share their cup decorations on Instagram. After receiving more than 1,200 submissions from 13 countries, the company settled on 13 eye-catching designs. These creations will in turn be showcased on the holiday cups served in more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries.\nStarbucks began utilizing the new Holiday 2016 red cups today.\n\n",

Starbucks rolls out holiday cups 1 / 16 Back to Gallery \nFor some people, the holiday season doesn't officially start until the day after Thanksgiving. For Seattleites, it starts when Starbucks rolls out their red holiday cups. \nThe company began rolling out the festive holiday cups in 1997, and the cups have since developed a cult following of pumpkin-spice proportions. In the past the designs have featured a variety of holiday patterns and characters, but the company caught some flack from those last year who said the solid reds cups weren't festive enough. \nThis year, Starbucks allowed customers to submit their own designs for the cups. According to a news release from the company, they received more than 1,200 individual submissions from 13 countries in just eight days. From the mountain of submissions, the Starbucks team chose 13 designs that will be featured on the holiday cups served in more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries. \nScroll through the slideshow above to preview all 13 designs. They will appear in stores today. Today's Deals",

After last year's controversy, Starbucks is putting Christmas images back on their holiday cups. \nThe coffee giant released its newest line of holiday cups on Wednesday. \nStarbucks says they feature designs created by customers that include snow flakes, reindeer, Christmas lights and ornaments. \nLast year, the not-so-festive simple red design of the cups drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nStarbucks said the simple design was meant to be a \"blank canvas.\" \nThis year's 13 festive designs were created by 13 women from six countries. \nCopyright 2016 CNN.

Photo: Starbucks Corporation Red cup season starts today! Starbucks rolls out holiday cups 1 / 16 Back to Gallery \nFor some people, the holiday season doesn't officially start until the day after Thanksgiving. For others, it starts when Starbucks rolls out their red holiday cups. \nThe company began rolling out the festive holiday cups in 1997, and the cups have since developed a cult following of pumpkin-spice proportions. In the past the designs have featured a variety of holiday patterns and characters, but the company caught some flack from those last year who said the solid reds cups weren't festive enough. \nThis year, Starbucks allowed customers to submit their own designs for the cups. According to a news release from the company, they received more than 1,200 individual submissions from 13 countries in just eight days. From the mountain of submissions, the Starbucks team chose 13 designs that will be featured on the holiday cups served in more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries. \nScroll through the slideshow above to preview all 13 designs. They will appear in stores today. Today's Deals",

Starbucks has made sure it won’t happen again, debuting 13 winter- and holiday-themed red cups Thursday.\nWe crafted coffee. You made it art. Cups warm a hand, beauty warms the heart. #RedCups pic.twitter.com/3QmdvoNM0S \n— Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 10, 2016 \n\nThe 13 designs were created by customers from across the world and include images of holiday lights, snowflakes and snow-covered trees, as well as Christmas scenes featuring reindeer and sleighs.\nRed paper cups, for hot drinks, are stacked next to plastic cups at a Starbucks coffee shop in the Pike Place Market, Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2015, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) Last year, Starbucks’ two-tone ombre red cups caused quite a stir on social media because they weren’t decorated for the holiday as they had been in previous years.\nSome critics called the cups another example of the ongoing “war on Christmas.”\nJoshua Feuerstein, an American evangelist and former pastor, claimed Starbucks “removed Christmas” from their cups. His video rant was viewed more than 17 million times on Facebook.\n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer, said in a release .\nThe 13 distinct cups are now in more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries for the 2016 holiday season.",

      "text": "× Starbucks red holiday cups return – check out the 13 new designs \nStarbucks is giving a sneak preview of the 13 new designs set to adorn their red holiday cups, starting Thursday. \nThe designs include Christmas lights, candy canes, snowflakes and a reindeer, to name a few. Starbucks chose the winning designs from an Instagram contest that included submissions from more than a dozen countries. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nIt’s been a year since Starbucks rolled out solid red holiday cups with a minimalist logo, unwittingly sparking a backlash on Twitter as people accusing the Seattle company of waging a “war on Christmas.” It's September, when does the War on Christmas start? Get ready @Starbucks pic.twitter.com/8Id9YW5kAl \n— (((tramosUSA))) (@voteblue16) September 7, 2016 \nLed by “American evangelist” Joshua Feuerstein, some customers told baristas their names were “Merry Christmas” so they could tweet photos of the cups with the holiday message written on them. \nStarbucks is sweetening the rollout of the new holiday cups in 2016 by offering a free drink of equal or lesser value between November 10-14, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. See the full rules here . \nCheck out the 13 new designs Starbucks is rolling out on Thursday: (Starbucks) ",

      "text": "in Trending \nFor some reason, Starbucks cups are a thing people care about desperately . \nEveryone lost their collective sh*t when a green holiday cup was announced, and people were equally perplexed when it seemed like Starbucks was going to release (*gasp*) MULTIPLE red holiday cups. \nWell, fortunately, everyone’s heart palpitations can finally cease, because Starbucks has unveiled their dastardly plan for the 2016 holiday season : they are releasing thirteen different holiday-themed red cups. \nWhich is the Starbucks marketing equivalent of saying, “ARE YOU HAPPY NOW, AMERICA??” \n(For the record, I would like to point out that I correctly predicted this turn of events in a previous article , and I would like everyone to give me a dollar.) \nThe new cups were directly inspired by Starbucks’#RedCupContest in 2015, which encouraged customers to design their own cups after the intense public backlash following the infamous plain red cup design. The winning designs will now be featured on 12 different hot beverage cups, and one cold beverage cup. \nWhile I appreciate the intense effort to cater to every possible demographic, I think Starbucks has perhaps gone a bit off the rails. They have bent to the will of psychotic coffee-drinkers who somehow think cup designs matter, and I feel like this whole situation has spiraled out of control. Will people get to choose cups, or will the cups be randomly dispensed? Either way, won’t customers find a way to whine about not getting the cup they wanted? \nSee, Starbucks, this is is a lose-lose situation. Perhaps, instead of desperately negotiating, it’s time you told all of these whiney coffee-drinkers to pour some scalding hot java down their pants. \nRegardless, the 2016 holiday cups are here, whether you wanted them or not. Here are the designs you’ll be getting: This valiant stag. A trippy, LSD-fueled version of Santa’s sleigh. Some dangling ornaments. Some … poinsettias? Snowflakes? Piles of leaves? This gingerbread house ANARCHY. This chill, non-denominational winter scene. These irreparably-tangled Christmas lights. An entire wreath of candy canes. Some more boring trees. And this bird, sitting on a branch, surrounding by vaguely vaginal flowers. This cold beverage cup will feature a more subtle design, which appears to be a pile of sticks, arranged in some wreath-like fashion. \nI personally don’t understand any of this, but if the thought of cute, holiday-themed cups makes you giddy, then more power to you. Please enjoy the wintry pastoral scenes while you sip your Peppermint Mocha or Pumpkin Spice Latte. \nAs for me, I’m just going to sit back and wait for everyone to find a reason to complain about this!",

      "text": "Starbucks Doesn't Just Have 1 Red Cup This Year - It Has 13 PopSugar 22 hrs ago Hedy Phillips © POPSUGAR Photography / Hedy Phillips Starbucks Holiday Red Cup 2016 Starbucks today announced that this year's traditional red cup will be something completely different from anything it has done in the past. Instead of releasing one red cup for the season, Starbucks will instead have 13 different cups. What is perhaps the most exciting part of this new idea this year, though, is that each cup was designed by customers from around the world. The artists hail from six different countries and all walks of life, but the collection of cups \"expresses the shared spirit of the season,\" Starbucks said in a statement.\nAt an event today in New York to announce the new cups, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz acknowledged the backlash the brand received last year over the holiday red cup and said, \"Unbeknownst to us, there were a number of people who decided that Starbucks perhaps was not in the Christmas spirit. That created quite a storm.\" But what those plain red cups allowed was for the world to use them as a blank canvas to share their stories, which they did in droves. In eight days, Starbucks received 1,200 submissions under the hashtag #RedCupArt, with beautiful drawings done in white.\n\"Their inspiration came from nature or seasonal traditions. Some are bold and graphic, while others evoke the feeling of an old-fashioned storybook,\" Starbucks said in a statement.\nGet a sneak peek of the cups in the photo above, and find them all in your local Starbucks starting tomorrow.\nGo to MSN Home",

Advertisement Rockefeller Center Christmas tree cut in upstate NY \nSnowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer are returning to Starbucks' holiday cups this year, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nIn all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday. \nStarbucks has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. Loading more articles... ",

      "title": "Starbucks' Holiday 'Red Cups' Are Back, Designed by Customers Around World | Gospelherald.com",
      "text": "Comment After being accused of removing Christ out of Christmas in 2015, Starbucks launched a baker's dozen of new \"red cup\" designs on Nov. 10, 2016. The designs were chosen from among submissions of customers around the globe. Starbucks \nTwelve different designs created by customers around the world adorn this season's Starbucks new \"red cups\" launched today (Nov. 10). Last November, Starbucks was accused of dropping Christmas from the company's red cups , which started a boycott of the coffee mogul. It was the first time a minimalist style was placed on the company's iconic, red holiday cups. Last December, Starbucks managers then invited customers to share designs on Instagram , receiving more than 1,200 individual submissions from 13 countries . \nUltimately, 13 designs from six countries were chosen to be featured on Starbucks cups for the 2016 holiday season -- one design sports a wooden wreath and was printed on a clear cup. \nStarbucks also just launched a new \"unity cup on Nov. 1. See The Gospel Herald article: Starbucks' New 'Unity Cup' Accused of Taking Jesus Out of Christmas \nThe artists behind the red cup designs hail from all over the world, including a college student studying in Germany, a hair stylist near Philadelphia and an aspiring artist in New York. Their inspirations came from nature and seasonal traditions. Some are bold and graphic art, while others evoke the feeling of an old-fashioned storybook. \nWhen Starbucks told the artists their work would be featured on this year's red cups, emotions ranged from shock to pure joy. \"You just made my life,\" said one. \nA summary of the designs and countries follows: Florencia, Bandung, Indonesia with Birds and Flowers -- Florencia's nature-inspired design depicts a bird in a field of magnolia flowers and berries. \"The magnolia symbolizes friends and love and the hedge sparrow represents faith and creativity. I hope that my design inspires people to joyfully love life and be creative, even when faced with tough times.\" Maria Lauren, New York City with Holiday Lights -- New York-based aspiring artistMarialoves creating bold, graphic patterns. \"I was looking around my home for inspirationand when I looked at my tree I thought about how beautiful the lights were,\" she said. Chloe, Plainfield, Illinois with Birch Forest -- Chloe, a nurse aide in a Chicago suburb, created a wintery design using acrylic paint. \"It is such a beautiful sight seeing the bare trees covered up in snow,\" she said. \"The first thing that comes to mind is home.\" Jennifer, Seattle with Candy Canes -- Jennifer, a professional artist who has also illustrated several coloring books, wanted to create a holiday design that people could identify with. \"My goal was to merge the whimsical candy cane elements with the botanical patterns in a cohesive, symmetrical design that would not only capture the spirit of the holiday season but also work with the red ombré, which is why I chose white ink. It was a great deal of fun to make, and I thank Starbucks for giving artists such a lovely canvas to work with.\" Anz Soza, Dubai, United Arab Emirates with Ornaments -- When Anzmoved from her home in the Philippines to Dubai, she made a hobby of drawingon Starbucks cups, collecting more than 75 cup creations. When her husband brought home a red cup last holiday, she was excited to try her first holiday design, with hanging ornaments and feathers reminiscent of dreamcatchers. \"I love the Christmas season so I was really inspired. To me, the color red symbolizes the celebration of love and life,\" she said. Samantha, Broomall, Pennsylvania with Woodland Deer -- Samantha is a hair stylist who was on maternity leave when she created her wintery design, which features the silhouette of a deer against an evergreen wreath and snowflakes. When Starbucks put out a call for cup designs, \"My daughter was three weeks old and I was doodling during nap times,\" she said. Now she's looking forward to creating new holiday traditions with her daughter, who will soon be celebrating her first birthday. Anna, Toronto, Canada with Love and Joy -- Santa's sleigh and reindeer take flight above a snow-covered village in this design from Anna, who lives in the heart of Toronto -one of Canada's most vibrant cities known for its rich cultural heritage. Born in the Soviet Union, Anna was trained in petrykivka , an ancient Ukrainian decorative folk art, which influenced her design's intricate line work and details. Christina, Bakersfield, California with Poinsettias -- A student of landscape architecture, Christina created a design that features the festive poinsettia plant. Sheis currently working on a public art installation in Bonn, Germany, and said, \"Part of the job of a landscape architect is to connect people to the environment by creating a sense of place. I decided to evoke the Christmas spirit by creating a design with a plant that is symbolic of the season.\" Erica, Markham, Ontario, Canada with Graphic Swirls -- Erica, a recent paralegal graduate from Markham, Canada, was helping her sister recover from knee surgery when she decorated her holiday cup with playful swirls. \"My sister was stuck on the couch for a month, so we spent a lot of time coloring together,\" she said. \"When I wanted to change it up, I switched to doodling on Starbucks cups!\" Alisa, St. Petersburg, Russia with Snowflake Sweater -- For Alisa, inspiration for her design came while drinking a gingerbread latte. \"The holiday mood made me try to draw on the Starbucks cup for the first time,\" she said. Her design features snowflakes and reindeer patterned after a cozy sweater. Bronwyn, Moscow, Idaho with Evergreen Forest -- A December hike along a favorite mountain trail was the inspiration for Bronwyn, a college student from Moscow, Idaho.\"Everything was still and snow-covered. The contrast was beautiful - it was almost like a black and white photo all around us,\" she said. \"The simplicity of the image transferred easily into a wintery design.\" Eun Joo, Daejeon, South Korea with Sleigh Ride -- For her whimsical design, Eun Joodepicted Santa's sleigh on a starry night. Tiny snowmen adornoverlapping circles. \"There are many people - like different patterns of overlapping circles - but everyone can have happy memories with a cup of coffee at Starbucks.\" Tracy, Los Angeles, California with Wooden Wreath -- Tracy, a professional artist from Los Angeles, crafted a wreath that encircled the Starbucks logo - a design on Starbucks cold beverage cups. \"I love the nature and the woods, so I decided to illustrate a wooden wreath with ornaments of various shapes and patterns. Topping it all off is some snow, a bow and a dash of holiday spirit.\" \n",

She writes about film and television, and edits the Weekend section. Molly was born and raised in Philadelphia, where she spent a lot of time sitting too close to the television screen. More by Molly Eichel Arrow icon \nBroomall hair dresser Samantha was one of 13 artists who had their design chosen to be one of Starbucks holiday cups this year. \nStarbucks put out a call for designs last December, asking coffee drinkers from around the world to submit potential designs via Instagram. \nSamantha's was chosen out of 1,200 designs submitted. From Starbucks' site: \nSamantha is a hair stylist who was on maternity leave when she created her wintery design, which features the silhouette of a deer against an evergreen wreath and snowflakes. When Starbucks put out a call for cup designs, “My daughter was three weeks old and I was doodling during nap times,” she said. \nNow she’s looking forward to creating new holiday traditions with her daughter, who will soon be celebrating her first birthday. \nStarbucks would not release more information about Samantha.

This is a far cry from last year's plain red that caused outrage among customers who, bah humbug, claimed it was a War on Christmas. Starbucks, it seems, made Santa's nice list this year.

      "text": "For Some Reason Starbucks Released 13 Different Holiday Red Cups This Year Presented By Email Starbucks \nIt's time to calm down with this red cup nonsense. Somehow, some way, Starbucks has managed to hook the entire world into this holiday cup drama and the latest news is no less extra. This all started last year when they released plain red holiday cups. Any stable individual might have admired the cup, sipped their drink and moved on with their life, but, sadly, we all know the internet is far from sane. As you might recall, social media went wild over the fact that the red cups had supposedly been stripped of all Christmas symbolism . \nFast forward to 2016. A Redditor leaked the supposed red cup design in late October, throwing the internet into another frenzy. This year, the cups were not plain, but rather a white illustration with flowers, leaves and a bird. Then, a day after the leak, Starbucks officially released a seasonal green drinking cup. Photos \nCelebs With Starbucks Holiday Red Cups \nWhy? Because apparently, they're competing for world's biggest internet troll. Seriously, Starbucks, the world doesn't need this much drama around a paper cup! That's not even all of it, you guys. Right when everyone thought we were going green this year, another red cup leak happened . In case you lost count, that's a total of three possible Starbucks holiday cups. Who needs that many cups? C'mon, Starbucks. \nOH WAIT. That's not all. If you thought three were excessive, you haven't lived. \nStarbucks officially revealed their 2016 red cup on their website, and it's out (for real) in stores starting today. Did we say cup? We meant cups. Actually, we meant 13 cups . THIRTEEN CUPS, YOU GUYS. On the one hand, we can all calm the eff down now that we know the official designs. On the flip side, everyone (including Starbucks) could benefit from realizing that all of this hype is literally just about a paper cup and that we don't need 13 to motivate us to drink their coffee. Just saying. \nAll 13 of them were designed by customers from all over the world. Designs, including holiday lights, snowflakes, trees and more, were taken from contestants from six countries. Okay, fine. Maybe they are kind of cool after all. TAGS/ Food , Holidays , E! Loves  ",

Learn more... \nThu, Nov 10, 2016, 22:10 GMT - UK Markets closed PepsiCo, Starbucks CEOs call for inclusion after Trump win By John Biers | AFP – 9 minutes ago View Photo \n\nChief (Taiwan OTC: 3345.TWO - news ) executives from PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP - news ) and Starbucks (Swiss: SBUX.SW - news ) on Thursday called for a renewed commitment to inclusion following a presidential campaign that exposed racial and ethnic fault lines in the US. \nPepsiCo chief executive Indra Nooyi, who backed Democrat Hillary Clinton, said she hoped President-elect Donald Trump's controversial statements on immigrants and minorities during the election battle were \"just campaign rhetoric.\" \n\"Our employees, especially our employees who are non-white or who are LGBT, are asking, 'Are we safe?'\" said Nooyi, who was born in India. \n\"The first thing we have to do is assure everyone in the US that everyone is safe.\" \nStarbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, who also backed Clinton, bemoaned the \"vitriolic\" nature of the campaign and said he was disturbed by some of the after-effects. \n\"One has to be concerned with what's happened over the last few months and even over the last 24 hours,\" he said. \"We've seen things that are very disturbing. I saw a picture today of a swastika. It's difficult to understand.\" \nThe remarks came at the New York Times Dealbook conference, held less than 48 hours after Trump's shock win in the battle for the White House. Election returns showed Trump won large majorities with white voters, but badly lagged Clinton with minority groups. \nSocial media on Wednesday and Thursday recounted cases of immigrants and minorities facing bigotry in schools and stores. Thousands of anti-Trump protesters took to about 10 cities, some carrying signs declaiming \"Not our President\" and \"Love trumps hate.\" \nNooyi congratulated Trump, but suggested he needs to set a much more inclusive tone. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) also expressed disgust with Trump's excuses following a leaked 2005 video in which the president-elect spoke lewdly about women. \nIn the clip, Trump described groping and forcing himself on women in vulgar, predatory language. \n\"How dare we talk about women that way?\" Nooyi said. \n\"I don't think there's a place for that kind of talk, not in a locker room, not anywhere,\" she said. \"If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to take over our society.\" \nSchultz said he was shocked by the election result and that it reflects \"years and years of a great many people in America feeling they've been left behind.\" \nStarbucks briefly got into a tiff with Trump in late 2015 after the Republican mogul suggested the coffee chain should be boycotted over bright red holiday cups that contained no explicit Christmas imagery. Some evangelicals viewed the cups as anti-Christian. \nSchultz said he was baffled by the flap. \n\"Every now and then you wake up and you say, 'What?'\" Schultz said. \"The irony is we had our best Christmas ever and our business went up, so I thank him.\" \nThe Starbucks chief did not rule out a run for public office, but said he has no interest in serving in the Trump administration. \n\"I don't think that's for me,\" he said.

      "text": "Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups.\nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades.\nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer.\nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs.\nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.\nStarbucks holiday cups Joseph Pisani / AP Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York on Nov. 8, 2016.\nStarbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York on Nov. 8, 2016.\n(Joseph Pisani / AP) Thousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain.\nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed.\n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked.\nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista.\nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.\nAssociated Press",

      "text": "For Some Reason Starbucks Released 13 Different Holiday Red Cups This Year Presented By Email Starbucks \nIt's time to calm down with this red cup nonsense. Somehow, some way, Starbucks has managed to hook the entire world into this holiday cup drama and the latest news is no less extra. This all started last year when they released plain red holiday cups. Any stable individual might have admired the cup, sipped their drink and moved on with their life, but, sadly, we all know the internet is far from sane. As you might recall, social media went wild over the fact that the red cups had supposedly been stripped of all Christmas symbolism . \nFast forward to 2016. A Redditor leaked the supposed red cup design in late October, throwing the internet into another frenzy. This year, the cups were not plain, but rather a white illustration with flowers, leaves and a bird. Then, a day after the leak, Starbucks officially released a seasonal green drinking cup. Photos \nCelebs With Starbucks Holiday Red Cups \nWhy? Because apparently, they're competing for world's biggest internet troll. Seriously, Starbucks, the world doesn't need this much drama around a paper cup! That's not even all of it, you guys. Right when everyone thought we were going green this year, another red cup leak happened . In case you lost count, that's a total of three possible Starbucks holiday cups. Who needs that many cups? C'mon, Starbucks. \nOH WAIT. That's not all. If you thought three were excessive, you haven't lived. \nStarbucks officially revealed their 2016 red cup on their website, and it's out (for real) in stores starting today. Did we say cup? We meant cups. Actually, we meant 13 cups . THIRTEEN CUPS, YOU GUYS. On the one hand, we can all calm the eff down now that we know the official designs. On the flip side, everyone (including Starbucks) could benefit from realizing that all of this hype is literally just about a paper cup and that we don't need 13 to motivate us to drink their coffee. Just saying. \nAll 13 of them were designed by customers from all over the world. Designs, including holiday lights, snowflakes, trees and more, were taken from contestants from six countries. Okay, fine. Maybe they are kind of cool after all. TAGS/ Food , Holidays , E! Loves  ",

      "text": "International Business PepsiCo, Starbucks CEOs call for inclusion after Trump win PepsiCo chief executive Indra Nooyi on Thursday said minorities in the United States need to be reassured of their safety after Donald Trump's surprise victory in the US presidential election. Posted 11 Nov 2016 06:16 Updated 11 Nov 2016 06:19 Pepsico CEO Indra Nooyi, pictured in 2014, hopes Donald Trump's controversial statements on immigrants and minorities during the election battle were \"just campaign rhetoric\". (Photo: AFP/Nicholas Kamm) A \nNEW YORK: Chief executives from PepsiCo and Starbucks on Thursday (Nov 10) called for a renewed commitment to inclusion following a presidential campaign that exposed racial and ethnic fault lines in the US. \nPepsiCo chief executive Indra Nooyi, who backed Democrat Hillary Clinton, said she hoped President-elect Donald Trump's controversial statements on immigrants and minorities during the election battle were \"just campaign rhetoric.\" \n\"Our employees, especially our employees who are non-white or who are LGBT, are asking, 'Are we safe?'\" said Nooyi, who was born in India. \"The first thing we have to do is assure everyone in the US that everyone is safe.\" \nStarbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, who also backed Clinton, bemoaned the \"vitriolic\" nature of the campaign and said he was disturbed by some of the after-effects. \n\"One has to be concerned with what's happened over the last few months and even over the last 24 hours,\" he said. \"We've seen things that are very disturbing. I saw a picture today of a swastika. It's difficult to understand.\" \nThe remarks came at the New York Times Dealbook conference, held less than 48 hours after Trump's shock win in the battle for the White House. Election returns showed Trump won large majorities with white voters, but badly lagged Clinton with minority groups. \nSocial media on Wednesday and Thursday recounted cases of immigrants and minorities facing bigotry in schools and stores. Thousands of anti-Trump protesters took to about 10 cities, some carrying signs declaiming \"Not our President\" and \"Love trumps hate.\" \nNooyi congratulated Trump, but suggested he needs to set a much more inclusive tone. She also expressed disgust with Trump's excuses following a leaked 2005 video in which the president-elect spoke lewdly about women. \nIn the clip, Trump described groping and forcing himself on women in vulgar, predatory language. \n\"How dare we talk about women that way?\" Nooyi said. \"I don't think there's a place for that kind of talk, not in a locker room, not anywhere,\" she said. \"If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to take over our society.\" \nSchultz said he was shocked by the election result and that it reflects \"years and years of a great many people in America feeling they've been left behind.\" \nStarbucks briefly got into a tiff with Trump in late 2015 after the Republican mogul suggested the coffee chain should be boycotted over bright red holiday cups that contained no explicit Christmas imagery. Some evangelicals viewed the cups as anti-Christian. \nSchultz said he was baffled by the flap. \"Every now and then you wake up and you say, 'What?'\" Schultz said. \"The irony is we had our best Christmas ever and our business went up, so I thank him.\" \nThe Starbucks chief did not rule out a run for public office, but said he has no interest in serving in the Trump administration. \"I don't think that's for me,\" he said. - AFP/ec",

      "text": "Starbucks debuts not 1, but 13 holiday cups \nby: Brianna Chambers, Cox Media Group National Content Desk Updated: Nov 10, 2016 - 12:10 PM Starbucks debuted its annual holiday cup on Thursday. But instead of offering customers one festive cup, the coffee company released 13 cups with different designs. All the cups are red with white designs and the company's green and white logo. Some designs feature hand-drawn snowflakes, reindeer, Christmas lights, candy canes, ornaments and Santa Claus riding his sleigh. STARBUCKS HOLIDAY CUPS ARE BACK 😍❤️💚❄️⛄️🎄 pic.twitter.com/BUkqu7UlsA — life of a blonde (@lifeofablondee) November 10, 2016 According to Starbucks, the cup designs were created by customers from around the world. The designs were submitted to the company via its #RedCupContest last year. \"We crafted coffee. You made it art,\" Starbucks wrote in a promotional video with the hashtag #RedCups. We crafted coffee. You made it art. Cups warm a hand, beauty warms the heart. #RedCups pic.twitter.com/3QmdvoNM0S — Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 10, 2016 Customers complained last year that Starbucks' plain red cups were not festive enough and criticized the company for attempting to be politically correct by taking the Christmas theme off the cups. The coffee giant's vice president of design and content, Jeffrey Fields, told Us Weekly that the plain cups were meant to embrace \"the simplicity and the quietness\" of the holiday season. >> Read more trending stories More recently, Starbucks debuted a green cup that features a mosaic of dozens of people drawn in one continuous stroke. The cup, meant to encourage unity and symbolize \"shared values and the need to be good to each other,\" was criticized when customers believed that the cup was replacing the company's usual red cups. \"All these faces on my green cup and not a one of them looks like Santa or Jesus. Why do you still hate Christmas?\" one Twitter user asked the company. Another said the design was \"political brainwashing,\" saying: \"I want snowflakes.\" Meet the artist behind the Starbucks green cup design https://t.co/HEADQZENUj via @starbucks pic.twitter.com/drpn6de8Xv — Starbucks UB Commons (@SbuxUBCommons) November 1, 2016 ",

      "text": "Starbucks’ Pumpkin Spice Latte made pumpkin spice famous more than ten years ago. Now you’ll find it added to everything from soup to nuts! But do those products actually taste good? Consumer Reports put several to the test.\n\nConsumer Reports’ expert food panel started with 20 products to find the tastiest. Some are not so great. Putting “pumpkin” on the label didn’t make Blue Diamond almonds irresistible. The candy-like brown-spice coating masked the taste of the nuts.\nBut there were some standouts. Noosa Finest Yoghurt Pumpkin is full and creamy, with real pumpkin and a hint of pumpkin pie spices. It’s made with whole milk and is pretty rich, so watch your portion. Or you can start your day with Pumpkin Spice Cheerios. They taste mostly of cloves but also have hints of cinnamon and nutmeg.\nSnack on Pumpkin Spice Flax Crunchy Granola Bars from Kashi, with 4 grams of fiber. They have pumpkin and flax seeds, and taste of honey and brown spice. The tasters agreed on Imagine Organic Creamy Pumpkin Soup; it is thick, smooth, and slightly sweet, with some pumpkin spices.\nAnd last, have a glass of water ready for Trader Joe’s Fall Harvest Salsa. Testers said the heat overpowered the flavors of pumpkin, apples, and squash, but the salsa was still tasty. While pumpkin snacks can be yummy, not all are healthy. Take a look at the label to make sure those traditional spices don’t also come with a load of added sugars.\n\nComplete Ratings and recommendations on all kinds of products, including appliances, cars & trucks, and electronic gear, are available on Consumer Reports’ website.

      "text": "Fri, Nov 11, 2016, 9:56 AM AEDT - Australia Markets open in 4 mins. PepsiCo, Starbucks CEOs call for inclusion after Trump win By John Biers | AFP – 10 hours ago Recommend View Photo \nPepsico CEO Indra Nooyi, pictured in 2014, hopes Donald Trump's controversial statements on immigrants and minorities during the election battle were \"just campaign rhetoric\" \nChief executives from PepsiCo and Starbucks on Thursday called for a renewed commitment to inclusion following a presidential campaign that exposed racial and ethnic fault lines in the US. \nPepsiCo chief executive Indra Nooyi, who backed Democrat Hillary Clinton, said she hoped President-elect Donald Trump's controversial statements on immigrants and minorities during the election battle were \"just campaign rhetoric.\" \n\"Our employees, especially our employees who are non-white or who are LGBT, are asking, 'Are we safe?'\" said Nooyi, who was born in India. \n\"The first thing we have to do is assure everyone in the US that everyone is safe.\" \nStarbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, who also backed Clinton, bemoaned the \"vitriolic\" nature of the campaign and said he was disturbed by some of the after-effects. \n\"One has to be concerned with what's happened over the last few months and even over the last 24 hours,\" he said. \"We've seen things that are very disturbing. I saw a picture today of a swastika. It's difficult to understand.\" \nThe remarks came at the New York Times Dealbook conference, held less than 48 hours after Trump's shock win in the battle for the White House. Election returns showed Trump won large majorities with white voters, but badly lagged Clinton with minority groups. \nSocial media on Wednesday and Thursday recounted cases of immigrants and minorities facing bigotry in schools and stores. Thousands of anti-Trump protesters took to about 10 cities, some carrying signs declaiming \"Not our President\" and \"Love trumps hate.\" \nNooyi congratulated Trump, but suggested he needs to set a much more inclusive tone. She also expressed disgust with Trump's excuses following a leaked 2005 video in which the president-elect spoke lewdly about women. \nIn the clip, Trump described groping and forcing himself on women in vulgar, predatory language. \n\"How dare we talk about women that way?\" Nooyi said. \n\"I don't think there's a place for that kind of talk, not in a locker room, not anywhere,\" she said. \"If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to take over our society.\" \nSchultz said he was shocked by the election result and that it reflects \"years and years of a great many people in America feeling they've been left behind.\" \nStarbucks briefly got into a tiff with Trump in late 2015 after the Republican mogul suggested the coffee chain should be boycotted over bright red holiday cups that contained no explicit Christmas imagery. Some evangelicals viewed the cups as anti-Christian. \nSchultz said he was baffled by the flap. \n\"Every now and then you wake up and you say, 'What?'\" Schultz said. \"The irony is we had our best Christmas ever and our business went up, so I thank him.\" \nThe Starbucks chief did not rule out a run for public office, but said he has no interest in serving in the Trump administration. \n\"I don't think that's for me,\" he said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Russia upholds LinkedIn ban on data fears AAP \nA Russian court has upheld a decision to block the website of social networking company LinkedIn, Interfax news …",

      "text": "NEW YORK: Chief executives from PepsiCo and Starbucks on Thursday (Nov 10) called for a renewed commitment to inclusion following a presidential campaign that exposed racial and ethnic fault lines in the US.\nPepsiCo chief executive Indra Nooyi, who backed Democrat Hillary Clinton, said she hoped President-elect Donald Trump's controversial statements on immigrants and minorities during the election battle were \"just campaign rhetoric.\"\n\"Our employees, especially our employees who are non-white or who are LGBT, are asking, 'Are we safe?'\" said Nooyi, who was born in India. \"The first thing we have to do is assure everyone in the US that everyone is safe.\"\nStarbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, who also backed Clinton, bemoaned the \"vitriolic\" nature of the campaign and said he was disturbed by some of the after-effects.\n\"One has to be concerned with what's happened over the last few months and even over the last 24 hours,\" he said. \"We've seen things that are very disturbing. I saw a picture today of a swastika. It's difficult to understand.\"\nThe remarks came at the New York Times Dealbook conference, held less than 48 hours after Trump's shock win in the battle for the White House. Election returns showed Trump won large majorities with white voters, but badly lagged Clinton with minority groups.\nSocial media on Wednesday and Thursday recounted cases of immigrants and minorities facing bigotry in schools and stores. Thousands of anti-Trump protesters took to about 10 cities, some carrying signs declaiming \"Not our President\" and \"Love trumps hate.\"\nNooyi congratulated Trump, but suggested he needs to set a much more inclusive tone. She also expressed disgust with Trump's excuses following a leaked 2005 video in which the president-elect spoke lewdly about women.\nIn the clip, Trump described groping and forcing himself on women in vulgar, predatory language.\n\"How dare we talk about women that way?\" Nooyi said. \"I don't think there's a place for that kind of talk, not in a locker room, not anywhere,\" she said. \"If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to take over our society.\"\nSchultz said he was shocked by the election result and that it reflects \"years and years of a great many people in America feeling they've been left behind.\"\nStarbucks briefly got into a tiff with Trump in late 2015 after the Republican mogul suggested the coffee chain should be boycotted over bright red holiday cups that contained no explicit Christmas imagery. Some evangelicals viewed the cups as anti-Christian.\nSchultz said he was baffled by the flap. \"Every now and then you wake up and you say, 'What?'\" Schultz said. \"The irony is we had our best Christmas ever and our business went up, so I thank him.\"\nThe Starbucks chief did not rule out a run for public office, but said he has no interest in serving in the Trump administration. \"I don't think that's for me,\" he said.\n- AFP/ec\nEmail More",

But unlike last year when the cups were just plain red, and people freaked out about it, this year they are much more festive! The 2016 festive cups are all different and designed by customers from around the world. Very cute! Pour some peppermint hot chocolate into that cup and we are 100 percent feeling the holiday spirit! We crafted coffee. You made it art. Cups warm a hand, beauty warms the heart. #RedCups pic.twitter.com/x418dfjFeu — Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 10, 2016 Contact ",

      "text": "CNBC.com SHARES \nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz told Jim Cramer that he wants to raise the national awareness of what it means to serve by hiring veterans to recruit veterans within his company. \n\"What we need inside Starbucks in the HR group is we need veterans recruiting veterans who understand their language, their challenges, their issues. So the people who are recruiting veterans at Starbucks are the people who have worn the cloth of the nation,\" Schultz told the \" Mad Money \" host. \nIn 2013, Starbucks took on the commitment to hire at least 10,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2018. It has now hired more than 8,000 since making that commitment. The company has also shipped 60 pallets of whole bean coffee and more than 175,000 sticks of VIA instant coffee to troops serving overseas. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Howard Schultz on Mad Money. \"We should not be acknowledging veterans who have served the country only on Veteran's Day. We should be doing it every single day. We owe them a great, great debt of gratitude\" -Howard Schultz, Starbucks Chairman & CEO \n\"What I would say is simply we should not be acknowledging veterans who have served the country only on Veteran's Day. We should be doing it every single day. We owe them a great, great debt of gratitude,\" Schultz said. \nAdditionally, the Schultz Family Foundation has committed $30 million to help veterans with the challenges associated with transitioning successfully into the civilian workforce. \nSchultz said that when former Defense Secretary Robert Gates joined the Starbucks board four years ago, he educated the company about the people coming home from Afghanistan and Iraq that not only did not receive a parade on their return, but were received by Americans that had no skin in the game for the war. This inspired Schultz to have a better understanding of how to help, and what to do to hire veterans. \n\"What we have learned is that the level of attrition rate among veterans is lower. The level of performance is higher, and these are great, great young men and women,\" Schultz said. \nQuestions for Cramer?",

Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops.

      "text": "World | Agence France-Presse  18 IST EMAIL COMMENTS Indra Nooyi said she hoped Trump's statements on immigrants were \"just campaign rhetoric.\" NEW YORK: Chief executives from PepsiCo and Starbucks on Thursday called for a renewed commitment to inclusion following a presidential campaign that exposed racial and ethnic fault lines in the US.PepsiCo chief executive Indra Nooyi, who backed Democrat Hillary Clinton, said she hoped President-elect Donald Trump's controversial statements on immigrants and minorities during the election battle were \"just campaign rhetoric.\"\"Our employees, especially our employees who are non-white or who are LGBT, are asking, 'Are we safe?'\" said Nooyi, who was born in India. \"The first thing we have to do is assure everyone in the US that everyone is safe.\"Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, who also backed Clinton, bemoaned the \"vitriolic\" nature of the campaign and said he was disturbed by some of the after-effects.\"One has to be concerned with what's happened over the last few months and even over the last 24 hours,\" he said. \"We've seen things that are very disturbing. I saw a picture today of a swastika. It's difficult to understand.\"The remarks came at the New York Times Dealbook conference, held less than 48 hours after Trump's shock win in the battle for the White House. Election returns showed Trump won large majorities with white voters, but badly lagged Clinton with minority groups.Social media on Wednesday and Thursday recounted cases of immigrants and minorities facing bigotry in schools and stores. Thousands of anti-Trump protesters took to about 10 cities, some carrying signs declaiming \"Not our President\" and \"Love trumps hate.\"Nooyi congratulated Trump, but suggested he needs to set a much more inclusive tone. She also expressed disgust with Trump's excuses following a leaked 2005 video in which the president-elect spoke lewdly about women.In the clip, Trump described groping and forcing himself on women in vulgar, predatory language.\"How dare we talk about women that way?\" Nooyi said.\"I don't think there's a place for that kind of talk, not in a locker room, not anywhere,\" she said. \"If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to take over our society.\"Schultz said he was shocked by the election result and that it reflects \"years and years of a great many people in America feeling they've been left behind.\"Starbucks briefly got into a tiff with Trump in late 2015 after the Republican mogul suggested the coffee chain should be boycotted over bright red holiday cups that contained no explicit Christmas imagery. Some evangelicals viewed the cups as anti-Christian.Schultz said he was baffled by the flap.\"Every now and then you wake up and you say, 'What?'\" Schultz said. \"The irony is we had our best Christmas ever and our business went up, so I thank him.\"The Starbucks chief did not rule out a run for public office, but said he has no interest in serving in the Trump administration.\"I don't think that's for me,\" he said.

      "text": "multicultural Share this article \nThe last couple of days have been hard, not going to lie, but it seems like Starbucks knows exactly what to do to cheer people up: bring some holiday cheer. So, that is exactly what they did when releasing their new 2016 Holiday red cups, only one thing is different... There are 13 different designs. \nBut that is not all that is special. According to Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer, “We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” so instead of having the cups designed by members of the Starbucks team, 13 customer designs were selected from six countries to \"represent the collective spirit of the holidays around the world\", the Starbucks press release states . \nHere are all of the different customers and that created these beautiful designs. \nNow, if that doesn't give you holiday cheer then I don't know what will.

Join the Conversation Jessica Saggio , FLORIDA TODAY 4:43 p.m. EST November 10, 2016 6 Shares x Share It's just a cup, but following controversy from last year's subdued red cups, Santa Claus, reindeer, and Snowflakes are returning to Starbucks' holiday cups. In total, 13 different cups will be in stores worldwide. USA TODAY \nStarbucks red holiday cups feature 13 designs from six countries. (Photo: Joshua Trujillo, Starbucks) \nI'll admit it. I was a \" basic \" this morning. I got up, threw on a pair of Lularoe leggings, jumped in my Honda and drove to Starbucks. Between all the doom and gloom Facebook posts I scrolled through this morning, I was pleasantly surprised to see a flurry of fancy paper cup photos scattered in between election rants that in their own special way cheered up my newsfeed. \nStarbucks launched their new holiday cups this morning and by 9 a.m. social media was buzzing, at least on my end. And like I said, I got basic. I drove through, ordered myself a $4.53 \"tall\" praline chestnut latte and snapped a picture of my cup on Snapchat. Some days you just need to be mainstream and today I relished it. I needed to see for myself what all the hubbub was about, and honestly, I wasn't disappointed. Buy Photo \nMy $4.53 praline chestnut latte from Starbucks came in a very festive cup today. (Photo: Jessica Saggio, FLORIDA TODAY) \nThursday, 13 intricately designed cups were distributed to Starbucks customers across the nation. Some have candy canes, others have cozy winter scenes and festive holiday lights — and they're all stunning. Starbucks unveils 2016 holiday red cups https://t.co/ZVy32ZUCHI Meet the designers too https://t.co/fo4rBYYiOR #RedCups pic.twitter.com/oMgV510Hr3 — Starbucks News (@Starbucksnews) November 9, 2016 \nThe cups were designed by artists across the world following a global call last year from the popular coffee company. Following their rather controversial plain-jane, red-ombre cup statement in 2015, the company invited customers to share their designs on Instagram, according to a release from Starbucks. More than 12,000 submissions poured in from 13 countries. The United States, Canada, South Korea, Russia, United Arab Emirates and Indonesia all have designs represented in this year's cup collection. \n\"The artists behind the work hail from all over the world – a college student studying in Germany, a hair stylist near Philadelphia, an aspiring artist in New York,\" a release from Starbucks states. \"Their inspiration came from nature and seasonal traditions. Some are bold and graphic while others evoke the feeling of an old-fashioned storybook. Together the collection expresses the shared spirit of the season.\" How to Adult: Lack of baby stores in Brevard is pathetic \nTalk about a total 180 from last year. The outrage of the plain red cups last year led to a massive debate nationwide. Were they making a statement? Were they taking the Christ out of overpriced holiday coffee?! And just last week, when the company released a pre-season green cup, the Internet had a meltdown. Plain green cups?! THE NERVE. \nIt turns out it was a tease, which we should have known because Reddit leaked a photo of a new holiday cup long before the green conspiracy. \nThe good news is all is well in the land of Starbucks and if you were looking for something to complain about, this probably isn't it. There's nothing but good cheer to see here... and ridiculously expensive coffee. \nThat being said, it's back to Dunkin Donuts I go. This $5 for a coffee business is no joke. What do I look like?! Mr. Krabs? I'm on a journalist salary, people! The cups are pretty, but my bank account is not. \nHappy holidays, everyone! Consider this the kick-off of the season.

They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks’ return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n“It’s just a cup,” he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups.",

Learn more... \nFri, Nov 11, 2016, 02:35 GMT - UK Markets open in 5 hrs 25 mins Starbucks CEO Schultz digs into the answer to hiring veterans By Abigail Stevenson | CNBC – 2 hours 46 minutes ago 53.57 -1.01 Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told Jim Cramer that he wants to raise the national awareness of what it means to serve by hiring veterans to recruit veterans within his company. \n\"What we need inside Starbucks in the HR group is we need veterans recruiting veterans who understand their language, their challenges, their issues. So the people who are recruiting veterans at Starbucks are the people who have worn the cloth of the nation,\" Schultz told the \" Mad Money \" host. \nIn 2013, Starbucks took on the commitment to hire at least 10,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2018. It has now hired more than 8,000 since making that commitment. The company has also shipped 60 pallets of whole bean coffee and more than 175,000 sticks of VIA instant coffee to troops serving overseas. \n\"What I would say is simply we should not be acknowledging veterans who have served the country only on Veteran's Day. We should be doing it every single day. We owe them a great, great debt of gratitude,\" Schultz said. \nAdditionally, the Schultz Family Foundation has committed $30 million to help veterans with the challenges associated with transitioning successfully into the civilian workforce. \nSchultz said that when former Defense Secretary Robert Gates joined the Starbucks board four years ago, he educated the company about the people coming home from Afghanistan and Iraq that not only did not receive a parade on their return, but were received by Americans that had no skin in the game for the war. This inspired Schultz to have a better understanding of how to help, and what to do to hire veterans. \n\"What we have learned is that the level of attrition rate among veterans is lower. The level of performance is higher, and these are great, great young men and women,\" Schultz said. \nQuestions for Cramer?

Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. (AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who’ve made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. \nStarbucks’ return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n“It’s just a cup,” he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups. \n",

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) \nNEW YORK (AP) – Starbucks will be unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year with what look to be snowflakes and reindeer, after last year’s more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. \nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. Share this: ",
