Anker is one of the most respected brands in consumer electronics, and the idea of getting one of their very popular speakers for just $27 is bonkers.

The 66-foot range is pretty incredible and the 24-hour battery life is one of the longest I've seen. It has a built-in microphone, stereo dual drivers and a spiral bass port. This is the lowest price according to CCC. Seems to be a product of quality. Less than 1% total harmonic distortion.\n\nBlack version: Link [ amazon.com ] \n",

      "text": "Amazon flooded with negative reviews of Megyn Kelly's memoir Posted: Updated: By The Associated Press\nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports ( http://lat.ms/2fop8fn ) over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  ",

      "text": "Toy of the Year Finalists Featured on Amazon and Toys\"R\"Us News provided by Nov 23, 2016, 10:02 ET Share this article NEW YORK , Nov. 23, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The Toy Industry Foundation (TIF) has announced that the 2017 Toy of the Year (TOTY) Award finalists are being featured on amazon.com/toty and toysrus.com through February 2017 , providing shoppers with unprecedented access to a comprehensive \"toy hotlist\" selected by toy and play experts. For the first time, TOTY finalists are identifiable on the Amazon and Toys\"R\"Us websites, letting shoppers know that the toys have been vetted by the esteemed industry awards program. Many companies with nominated products opted to take advantage of an additional opportunity, allowing them to gain more prominent visibility for their toys on the retailers' websites before, during and after the holiday season. These companies' toys and games are being highlighted on the retailers' homepages, across their websites, via social media/email channels, and in two Toys\"R\"Us inserts with a total circulation of 24 million. Frequently referred to as the \"Oscars\" of the toy industry, the TOTY awards program annually recognizes the top toys of the year. This year's nominees were reviewed and ranked by 25 judges, including toy and play experts, retailers, academics, and journalists, who considered each product's creativity, design and promotion; excellence; and marketplace acceptance before narrowing the field of 700 submissions to a slate of 100 finalists. Winners will be announced in February 2017 . The TOTY awards program supports the work of the Toy Industry Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the North American toy industry. As such, many TOTY finalist companies have donated funds to the Foundation in support of a new research program that will explore the role of play in trauma-informed care for pediatric hospital patients and their families. \"The holidays are the perfect time of year to celebrate the many joys of toys and play, as exemplified by this year's wonderful TOTY finalists,\" said Jean Butler , TIF executive director. \"We are very thankful for the generosity of so many companies, whose contributions will allow TIF to fund the first phase of a new research initiative with Nemours Children's Health System, leading to the development of a new hospital program that will support and comfort sick children.\" Voting for TOTY 2017 is now open; winners will be announced during a celebration in New York City on February 17 , 2017. To view the full slate of finalists, vote and learn more, visit www.ToyAwards.org . To reserve tickets for the TOTY gala, or to purchase a sponsorship package, click here . Proceeds from both tickets and sponsorships will benefit the Toy Industry Foundation.

While other organizations provide food, shelter and support services to children and their families, TIF sees to it that these children have toys and opportunities to play in an attempt to restore both fun and a sense of normalcy to their lives. To date, TIF's signature program, The Toy Bank, has provided more than $130 million in toys to nearly 20 million children in need around the globe, thanks to its generous toy donors.

(Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File) \nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports ( http://lat.ms/2fop8fn ) over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Tags",

      "text": "Amazon may bring its ticket sales to the US Job listings suggest the unusually honest service will expand beyond the UK. Save C Brandon/Redferns via Getty Images \nAmazon introduced online concert and theater ticket sales in the UK back in 2015, and it now looks like you should have that option elsewhere in the world -- possibly including the US. Recode has spotted job listings that point to an \"international expansion strategy\" for Asia and Europe, while multiple recent openings at Amazon's Seattle headquarters hint at American operations. There's even talk of a Prime Tickets feature, although it's not clear what that would entail beyond some added value for your yearly Prime membership. \nThe company isn't commenting on the scope of its plans. However, worldwide expansion seems likely. Amazon Tickets' main selling point is its unusually candid pricing, which lists everything up front -- unlike many rivals, it isn't burying service fees. Pair that with Amazon's established online shopping tech and it promises to be much more straightforward than rivals. \nThe challenge, as Recode explains, is finding enough tickets to sell in the US. Heavyweights like Live Nation tend to secure exclusive deals with major artists and venues in the country. Amazon may have to offer strong incentives to get performers dropping their exclusives, or else accept that its early business will focus on artists and shows that don't always get top billing.",

      "text": "By: Boomerang Commerce via Business Wire News Releases   09:54 AM EST Amazon’s Lead Narrows, Says Annual Boomerang Commerce Report on Holiday Pricing and Assortment of Toys and Games Boomerang Commerce, the leading Retail Performance Management solution, today releases its annual “Boomerang Insights: Toys Category” report comparing top retailers' pricing, promotion and assortment of this holiday season's popular toys and games. This year’s results reveal that Walmart is making big strides to challenge Amazon’s dominance. The retailer has more than doubled its online product assortment between Q1 and Q3 2016 and is leveraging its recent Jet.com acquisition for competitive pricing. Toys“R”Us is also pursuing a strategy of increased assortment, as well as offering exclusive product lines. Meanwhile, Target is eschewing assortment expansion in favor of special pricing promotions. \nBoomerang Commerce, the leading Retail Performance Management solution , today releases its annual “ Boomerang Insights: Toys Category ” report comparing top retailers' pricing, promotion and assortment of this holiday season's popular toys and games. This year’s results reveal that Walmart is making big strides to challenge Amazon’s dominance. The retailer has more than doubled its online product assortment between Q1 and Q3 2016 and is leveraging its recent Jet.com acquisition for competitive pricing. Toys“R”Us is also pursuing a strategy of increased assortment, as well as offering exclusive product lines. Meanwhile, Target is eschewing assortment expansion in favor of special pricing promotions. \nKey findings across data from Amazon, Walmart, Jet.com, Target, GameStop, and Toys“R”Us show: Amazon is still, by far, the leading retailer for toys and games with over 5 million items in the category — compared with less than 100,000 for other retailers — and with a pricing strategy that optimizes based on external market and internal data signals. Jet.com has the lowest prices , meeting or beating the usual leader Amazon by an average of 64 percent — up from 55 percent in 2015 — on its overlap of most popular items. Walmart is a close second to Jet by pricing 55 percent of popular items the same or lower than Amazon, but this represents a 9 percentage point decrease YOY.Meanwhile, Target increased its price competitiveness with Amazon by 8 percentage points YOY to meet or beat Amazon’s price on 42 percent of popular overlapping toys and games. Walmart and Jet offer the most aggressive price discounts . Compared to list prices on Amazon, Walmart discounted 54 percent of popular items, followed by Jet with 47 percent, and Target with 41 percent. Concurrently, Target is seeking to win customers through promotions , such as 20 percent discounts for select toys, “buy two, get one free” games and its current “10 Days of Deals” campaign. Walmart is becoming increasingly more competitive in assortment with a 66 percent overlap with Amazon’s most popular items; this represents approximately 1.8 times the nearest competitor. After Walmart, Toys“R”Us has the highest assortment overlap (40 percent) with a sampling of Amazon’s popular items , representing a 5 percent improvement over last year. Although toys and games specialty retailers struggle to compete on price, their wide assortments within specific sub-categories like video games at GameStop and exclusive LEGO products at Toys“R”Us keep them relevant. \n“Today’s always-on, mobile-enabled consumers force retailers to be much more responsive to higher consumer expectations and competitive changes,” says Boomerang Commerce CEO Guru Hariharan. “During this year’s holiday season — where retailer fortunes are won or lost — the toys category is a spectacular example of which retailers are up for the challenge and which fall short. Winners will be those retailers that are high tech and high touch — executing their strategies through a combination of data-driven decisions, ongoing measurement, and operational excellence.” \nBoomerang Commerce Insights reports are produced annually for different product categories. In this report on toys and games, Boomerang analyzed 1,800 items throughout the online stores of six leading toy retailers: Amazon, GameStop, Jet.com, Target, Toys“R”Us and Walmart. The analysis is based on 600 randomly selected items from each of three tiers: best-sellers, moderately popular items and less-popular (specialty) products. More details and examples for specific products are in the full report from Boomerang Commerce. The data used was compiled during October 2016. \nAbout Boomerang Commerce \nFounded in 2012, Boomerang Commerce is a leading retail technology company led by veterans from Amazonand McKinsey.

Associated Press \nSupporters of   have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. About Us",

      "text": "Share \nAstound Commerce just released a Holiday Report infographic based on a survey that reveals key insights into consumers’ shopping behavior, in-store preferences and social commerce actions. \nPrice and free shipping are the top two influencers of purchasing decisions among consumers, with 79 percent and 68 percent responding as such, respectively. Other top factors are the product’s availability, past retailer experience and guaranteed on-time delivery. \nThe survey also found that social media is key for online customers: 75 percent seek customer service from Facebook, 37 percent use Pinterest to stay on top of trends and 59 percent watch video reviews on YouTube. \nMillennials are projected to be a massive driver of revenue, with a combined purchasing power of over $200 billion. Millennials valued same-day delivery options over older consumers. Thirty-five percent of millennials said that retailers offering a same-day delivery option would cause them to make a purchase over another, versus 27 percent of other customers. \nMillennials were also more likely to be swayed by retailers that offered in-store pickup, live chat customer service and fewer shipping cutoff dates. Millennials were also more likely to order on a mobile device, 46 percent versus 36 percent. \nThe survey found that 46 percent of consumers will shop on Amazon this holiday shopping season, and 43 percent are set to buy at least half of their gifts from Amazon. Sixty-five percent of consumers will buy from a retailer that isn’t Amazon when prices are better (65 percent) or when the competitor has faster delivery times or has special offers. \nThe survey also found that 55 percent of consumers prefer to interact with technology than sales associates when shopping for tech in-store. \nThis year’s holiday shopping season is projected to generate almost $92 billion in revenue. Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are expected to bring in $8.4 billion alone.",

Associated Press \nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. About Us",

Associated Press \nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. About Us",

      "text": "PR Newswire Nov23,201610:02AMEST NEW YORK , Nov. 23, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The Toy Industry Foundation (TIF) has announced that the 2017 Toy of the Year (TOTY) Award finalists are being featured on amazon.com/toty and toysrus.com through February 2017 , providing shoppers with unprecedented access to a comprehensive \"toy hotlist\" selected by toy and play experts. For the first time, TOTY finalists are identifiable on the Amazon and Toys\"R\"Us websites, letting shoppers know that the toys have been vetted by the esteemed industry awards program. Many companies with nominated products opted to take advantage of an additional opportunity, allowing them to gain more prominent visibility for their toys on the retailers' websites before, during and after the holiday season. These companies' toys and games are being highlighted on the retailers' homepages, across their websites, via social media/email channels, and in two Toys\"R\"Us inserts with a total circulation of 24 million. Frequently referred to as the \"Oscars\" of the toy industry, the TOTY awards program annually recognizes the top toys of the year. This year's nominees were reviewed and ranked by 25 judges, including toy and play experts, retailers, academics, and journalists, who considered each product's creativity, design and promotion; excellence; and marketplace acceptance before narrowing the field of 700 submissions to a slate of 100 finalists. Winners will be announced in February 2017 . The TOTY awards program supports the work of the Toy Industry Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the North American toy industry. As such, many TOTY finalist companies have donated funds to the Foundation in support of a new research program that will explore the role of play in trauma-informed care for pediatric hospital patients and their families.

      "text": " 24  24 am Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump participates in the first prime-time presidential debate hosted by FOX News and Facebook at the Quicken Loans Arena August 6, 2015 (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) (L-R): Megyn Kelly, FOX News Channel Anchor speaks onstage during Cosmopolitan Magazine's Fun Fearless Life Conference powered by WME Live at The David Koch Theatre at Lincoln Center on November 8, 2014 in New York City. (Photo by Craig Barritt/Getty Images for Cosmopolitan Magazine and WME Live) \nAmazon apparently removed hundreds of one-star ratings for Fox News host Megyn Kelly’s new book. \nThe Los Angeles Times reported that more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly’s “Settle For More ” appeared on the online retail giant’s site within hours of its release Tuesday. \nThe newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Donald Trump Reddit forum, The_Donald. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book’s publisher, HarperCollins, told the Los Angeles Times the reviews have the “hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book” and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon hasn’t responded to the incident. \n“Over 120 1 star reviews have been deleted. Are we living in a free country anymore?” wrote one Amazon commenter, reported USA Today. \n“Trump is president, but she wrote the book certain Clinton would win,” one one-star reviewer, Tim from Maryland, wrote. “Now the book and her shows advertisers are getting boycotted. So apparently her attorneys have called to get negative reviews deleted. And they succeeded. I’m shocked.” \nAnother Amazon commenter Brianna wrote, “I have written many thoughtful reviews as to why this book is horrible! They have all been removed even though I am a reputable Amazon customer/reviewer which is why originally Megyn had the true rating of one and a half stars and now four and a half FIXED STARS!” \nAs of Wednesday, the book was rated two-and-a-half out of five stars with about 700 reviews. \nSome people complained that the book wasn’t very good. “Choppy, yawn fest, breaks no new ground, depth that a college-bound 10th grader can exceed,” wrote DPN II. \nThere were a few five-star ratings sprinkled throughout, with most of them deriding President-elect Trump. \nDuring the campaign, Kelly and Trump had a contentious relationship. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

      "text": "Share \nAmazon’s Internet of Things endeavor continues to pick up speed. \nThe online retail giant announced yesterday (Nov. 22) that a new set of device makers recently joined onto the Amazon Dash Replenishment Program (DRS) — GeniCan, Honeywell, Nestle and WePlenish. Amazon’s DRS allows participating connected devices to utilize Amazon’s retail platform to automatically reorder physical goods from Amazon when supplies are running low. \nGeniCan is a digital device that sits on the brim of a customer’s garbage can. Users scan barcodes on items being disposed to automatically send them to their shopping lists. Consumer product giant Honeywell will produce connected air filtration devices that will calculate when a new air filter is required and automatically order them. \nNestle’s BabyNes system, once integrated with Dash Replenishment, will automatically replenish baby formula capsules when supplies are running low. WePlenish’s additions to Amazon’s DRS include Java and Fetch, which will automatically order coffee capsules and pet food for users, respectively, when needed. \nDaniel Rausch, director of Amazon Dash, was quoted as saying: “More and more customers are experiencing the magic of automatic reordering with Dash Replenishment. They avoid the hassle of tracking their household stock of essentials, like dishwasher detergent, printer ink and water filters. When they’re about to run out, Amazon automatically delivers a package to their doorstep. Dash Replenishment is simple to integrate and brings an innovative new customer benefit and business model to their connected devices.” \nGE, Samsung, PUR, Whirlpool and GOJO Industries, the makers of Purell hand sanitizer, are just a few of the now over 200 brands that have integrated an Amazon Dash button or used Amazon’s API to create automatic reordering products. \nAmazon’s DRS officially went live in late January of this year, and its Dash order button debuted in March 2015. The replenishment and instant ordering services are available to Amazon Prime members for a one-time fee of $50.",

Associated Press \nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. About Us",

Associated Press \nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. About Us",

Associated Press \nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. About Us",

      "text": "Amazon acquired patents, employees from Biba, reportedly plans new video chat service Posted UK wants to censor ‘non-conventional’ sex videos \nAmazon’s purchases of Twitch and Elemental Technologies appear to be only two parts of a bigger strategy at the company to move deeper into video services through acquisition. Last year, the marketplace and cloud computing giant also quietly acquired a startup out of San Francisco called Biba Systems , which develops and operates video messaging apps aimed at business users. Sources say that Amazon has been working on its own video messaging service, which it plans to unveil during its re:Invent AWS conference later this month. \nNews of Amazon’s possible purchase of Biba Systems first surfaced last week, when GeekWire found some Delaware filings that spoke of a merger with an entity called “Justin Acquisition” in September 2015. There was no direct mention of Amazon in the Justin Acquisition document, but the filing included the name of a paralegal employed at the time by Amazon. \nAmazon never responded to our request (or GeekWire’s, it seems) for comment on the story. So we decided to do some digging of our own. We discovered some direct links between Biba and Amazon that point to both Biba’s technology and employees now being part of Amazon. \nWe found that Biba had filed and received two patents, one related to video conferencing , and another related to audio streaming . Both of these patents transferred their ownership to Amazon Technologies in the last two months. \nFurthermore, we’ve been able to trace active Amazon work email addresses to current Biba employees. (We are not publishing those here.) Make way for ‘Justin Biba’? \nIt’s not completely clear how and where Amazon might use Biba’s technology, but our sources say that Amazon has lately been showing select people demos of a video conferencing product. \n“They’re going to launch it at their re:Invent event after Thanksgiving,” said one. \nWhether that video product (if it indeed launches next week) is built using Biba is not clear. But, by coincidence, we noticed that Biba — which went silent on Twitter and with its own marketing efforts by September 2015 — suddenly and quietly updated its Android and iOS apps in August and September of this year. \nThere is some logic to Amazon expanding apps and software that it offers over AWS. \nToday, AWS already sells some products on top of its could-based infrastructure. They include WorkMail , a cloud-based managed email and calendar service for businesses; and WorkSpaces , a desktop virtualization service that competes with products from VMware, Parallels, Microsoft and more. \nAdding a workplace collaboration and conferencing product to that mix would be an obvious extension of Amazon’s existing own-brand, cloud-based services. Among the features that Biba currently offers are video and audio conference calls, including scheduling and management; contacts and presence management; messaging services; screen sharing; and administration features for IT managers. \nPeople have wondered before if Amazon would get deeper into enterprise software; now, it seems, it could be. Such a move might make it more competitive against the likes of Microsoft, which rivals AWS with Azure and its own extensive range of enterprise software. It has updated its own video conferencing product, Skype, to make it more business-friendly. \nIn any case, however, for now it looks like whatever Amazon brings to the table in terms of its own software is there to complement, not cannibalise, services that work over AWS, which the company has been building out as an extensive marketplace for third-party business software providers, the enterprise equivalent of Amazon’s consumer e-commerce marketplace. \nThere are other areas where Amazon might end up using some of Biba’s technology. As we noted above, Amazon ran its M&A through an entity called Justin Acquisition, which GeekWire speculates could be in reference to another Amazon purchase, video platform Twitch. (Its founders also founded video service Justin.tv, which was shut down to focus on Twitch.) \nToday, the vast majority of Twitch’s 45 million-user audience is made up of gamers, who broadcast themselves or watch others playing games and comment on them. But there have been other efforts to expand that into other areas like food and art . Amazon could integrate Biba’s functionality into Twitch, or vice versa, either to add more interactive elements, or expand Twitch’s functionality as a B2B platform. \nAnd last but not least, there is an opportunity also for Amazon to use Biba for internal purposes. \nLooking around Amazon’s job boards, we found only one reference to Biba on there: in an ad for a training specialist for AWS Support, helping AWS customers with questions about AWS products, where Biba is named along with Webex and Adobe Connect as one of the software platforms that applicants need to have used in the past. Amazon could build its own proprietary internal support network on Biba’s platform; potentially, it could subsequently offer this out as a service on AWS. \nBiba had raised just over $15 million , according to CrunchBase, with investors including Benchmark, Trinity and InterWest Partners. 0",

      "text": "Amazon to Expand in Nevada with Third Fulfillment Center by Zacks Equity Research Published on November 23, 2016 Trades from $ 3 In a bid to meet increasing demand for online shopping in the upcoming holiday season, Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN - Free Report ) announced its plan to build its third Nevada fulfillment center in North Las Vegas. The other two existing Nevada fulfillment centers are located in Reno and North Las Vegas. These employ more than 1,500 full-time hourly associates. According to Amazon, the new facility spanning 800,000 square feet will create more than 1,000 full-time jobs. It will focus primarily on larger consumer items such as big screen televisions, kayaks and patio furniture. Amazon stated that it pays competitive wages and gives healthcare and other full-time benefits. In addition, the company offers programs like Career Choice to help employees pursue courses related to fields that are in demand. Fulfillment centers are giant warehouses that help online retailers store and ship products and handle returns quickly. These are important for providing the level of service that customers have come to expect from Amazon. Over the past few years, Amazon has invested heavily in setting up fulfillment centers across the country to cut shipping costs and speed up delivery. The need to expand fulfillment centers has been fuelled by growing demand for online shopping. Prompt and accurate delivery of products is crucial to the success of online retail companies. In our view, Amazon must maintain its U.S. market share while expanding globally to retain its leading position. For this, the company needs to invest more in fulfillment as well as technology and content, especially in international markets with less penetration and higher growth rates. Though increased expenses could hurt the company’s bottom line in the near term, we believe these are necessary to maintain its dominance in this highly competitive market. \nAMAZON.COM INC Price ",

By The Associated Press\nSupporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports ( http://lat.ms/2fop8fn ) over 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nTina Andreadis, an executive with the book's publisher, HarperCollins, tells the L.A. Times the reviews have the \"hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book\" and brought them to the attention of Amazon. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nAmazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "title": "Jeremy Clarkson: Amazon show is ''Top Gear' in witness protection'",
      "text": "Jeremy Clarkson is on top once again with his new Amazon show, \"The Grand Tour.\" Clarkson, the former co-host of the globally popular and long running BBC show, \"Top Gear,\" told CNN's \"Quest Means Business\" that the new series is \"'Top Gear' in witness protection.\" \n\"That's what a friend of mine said the other day, a reviewer. [This show] is different because it moves around the world, that's really it,\" Clarkson told CNNMoney reporter Maggie Lake. \"But it's still James [May], Richard [Hammond], and I. So it's like if you have a glass of champagne and you have it in a bucket or in a glass, it's still champagne, and that's really what it is. It's a different vessel, but the show is, with different elements, basically about the same.\" \nAccording to Amazon, the premiere episode of \"The Grand Tour\" was the subscription service's most-watched premiere since \"The Man in The High Castle.\" \nClarkson and his co-hosts are on Amazon instead of the BBC because Clarkson was fired by the BBC for punching a producer, Oisin Tymon. It was the last straw for the BBC, which had weathered a number of controversies involving Clarkson, including racist and homophobic comments he made over the years. But it doesn't sound like Clarkson is planning on reining himself in. \n\"The BBC always let us do what we wanted to do and Amazon is exactly the same,\" he said. \"It says say what you want to say, do what you want to do. We always were self-policed, and sometimes you tread on a landmine and sometimes you don't, move on.\" \nRelated Link: Ex-'Top Gear' host Jeremy Clarkson settles assault claim, law firm says \nBut, Clarkson said, \"I never want to be controversial, it just happens. I say stuff sometimes and think, 'Oh, no.\" \n\"I try to present a TV show in the way that I hear people talking,\" Clarkson said. \"Not in city centers, not at agreeable dinner parties with editors and media people, but actual people talking. There was just two doors down here ... there's some people loading trucks and truck drivers and they've all got hoodies, visibility jackets, and hard hats on. I was just staring at them, sitting in traffic, thinking, 'I want to hear what they talk about when they're out and about,' because that's what I would like to reflect in the show. ... [W]e're not making the show for what we call in the UK 'the sneering media elite,' of which I am a part. I'm not making a show for my friends, my colleagues, I'm making a show for everyone else, and it turns out, as we've seen in recent events, that there's millions and millions of them.\" \nIt's clear Clarkson is still not shy when it comes to speaking his mind. Asked his thoughts on President-elect Donald Trump suggesting in a tweet that UK far-right politician Nigel Farage should be named the country's ambassador to the US, he quipped, \"If he is, we'll go back to England.\" \nFor now, though, Clarkson is focused not on the success of this season of \"The Grand Tour,\" but the next one. \n\"You've still got to concentrate,\" he said. \"You can't rejoice, you concentrate on the next one and next one and next one. They've all got to be good, otherwise no point in doing it.\" \nCNNMoney (New York)   12:44 PM ET",

USA TODAY Amazon (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) \nIt's increasingly becoming Amazon and company CEO Jeff Bezos' world and we are just spending in it. \nThe No. 2 richest man in the U.S. Bezos owns The Washington Post and is building space ships . The online retailer he founded in 1994 has grown beyond book sales to groceries, electronics, clothing and more and Amazon now streams video, makes movies and provides cloud computing services ... and may be looking to build its own live sports network . Jeff Bezos through the years \nSomeday the company may even sell tickets to those events it's broadcasting if its reach continues to expand. Several recent job postings -- first noted by tech news site Recode -- suggest that Amazon is looking to grow its Amazon Tickets business beyond the U.K., which it started last year, here in the U.S. and Europe. \nFor now, the enterprise is focusing on music and entertainment. \"Amazon Tickets is a start-up business with a vision of becoming Earth’s most customer-centric ticketing company, a place where event-goers can come to find and discover any ticket they might want to buy online,\" reads a description of the initiative in a job listing posted earlier this mont for an Amazon Tickets, Music principal business development manager.\" Amazon could be a lot bigger than we think \nAmazon's U.K. tickets business currently offers tickets for music, theater, and comedy. \"As we grow our team to support our rapid expansion we are looking for talented individuals to join us in delighting customers and having some fun along the way,\" the job listing reads. \nOther Amazon Tickets jobs posted include software engineers and entertainment business developers. \"The purpose of the role is to help the Tickets team grow its business relationships in the entertainment industry to expand tickets selection across existing and new categories and territories by working with ticket rights-holders to reach agreements on distribution for sale to end customers,\" reads the listing for a music business development manager. \nHow challenging will an Amazon liftoff be in a marketplace with an entrenched giant such as Live Nation Ticketmaster? Maybe Alexa knows. \nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "Thanksgiving Here are 5 shows on Netflix, Amazon you should binge watch after Thanksgiving Looking for something to binge watch after your Thanksgiving dinner? Try out The CW's \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\" Photo: Eddy Chen/The CW By Shannon O’Connor, Los Angeles Daily News Posted: # Comments \nThe dishes have been licked clean, the football games have ended and the turkey coma is finally setting in, so what is there to do now? It’s simple: binge-watch some TV. There is no better day to indulge in the cultural phenomenon than the day after Thanksgiving. So jump in (or stay in) your pajamas, find a comfy position on the couch and boot up your Netflix or Amazon que to one (or, if you are feeling adventurous, all) of these shows. \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the the Life \nIt’s back! After months of hype and promotion, the four new 90-minute installments of “Gilmore Girls” are finally here . Take a trip back to Stars Hollow, Connecticut and revisit Lorelai, Rory, Emily, Luke and all the other colorful townsfolk fans have come to adore. Whether you have been a long-time Gilmore fan or are just discovering the series (in this case, bonus you get to binge more!) these installments should provide some laughs, tears and nostalgia (in whatever order you prefer). To accompany this binge, I would suggest copious amounts of coffee, pop tarts and tater tots. Also keep pizza and tacos nearby, you know, just in case. All seasons are currently streaming on Netflix and the new episodes arrive on Nov. 25 at 12:01am. \nGood Girls Revolt \nIn the past few weeks journalism has been an issue of much discussion, so there is no better time to dive into Amazon’s new series “Good Girls Revolt.” The series is loosely based on Lynn Povich’s book of the same name and is a fictionalized account of Povich and her female co-worker’s 1969 struggle with a sexual discrimination case against Newsweek magazine over pay and gender equality. Though the show is set a few decades in the past, it brings to light many issues still plaguing women in the workforce today (noticeably the pay gap). So, don’t be afraid to get inspired while watching. All episodes of the series first season are available on Amazon. \nCrazy Ex-Girlfriend \nMusical lovers and people who love a good Southern California joke or reference , do I have a show for you. Rachel Bloom’s “ Crazy Ex-Girlfriend ” is the musical-comedy extravaganza about a young New York hotshot lawyer who uproots her high-powered life to follow her old high school boyfriend back to West Covina only to find that he is in a serious relationship. Laughs, heartbreak and big (paradoxical) musical numbers ensue, but it is the heart in the show that will keep you coming back (the music is pretty catchy too, though). All episodes of the first season are available for streaming on Netflix. Season 2 is currently airing on The CW (So catch-up!). \nBlack Mirror \nIf you are in the mood for some more serious TV fare, try the bizarre but captivating anthology series “Black Mirror.” The series, which returned for a 6-episode third season late last month, tackles complex, yet engaging storylines that contribute to society’s greatest fears such as blackmail, technology and social media; but be ready for some twists and surprises.The show may make you paranoid (especially with events of late), but just remember it is fiction (for now). All episodes are streaming on Netflix. Advertisement \n“The Crown” \nThough at this point you may be a bit tired of politics and government, Netflix’s latest series “ The Crown ” about Queen Elizabeth II should not be missed. Though we have seen versions of the Queen’s life on screen before, this 10-part series not only focuses on the life of Elizabeth herself but the lives of those around her. Fans of series like “The Tudors” or “Reign” will undoubtedly be drawn to this British monarchy tale that has critics raving. All episodes of the first season are streaming on Netflix.",

      "title": "Tableau Cozies Up to Amazon Cloud",
      "text": "It’s not a huge surprise that business software maker Tableau, now led by former Amazon executive Adam Selipsky, is putting the online version of its data visualization tool on Amazon Web Services. Selipsky, after all, had spent more than a decade helping build Amazon Web Services into the public cloud juggernaut it now is.\nBut if you dig deeper, an interesting narrative emerges--but back to that in a moment.\nThe news, to be formally announced next week at the annual AWS Re:Invent conference in Las Vegas is that Tableau Online will run on Amazon’s massive public cloud and that customers will be able to buy it through the AWS Marketplace .\nAll a prospective user will have to do is click on a few on-screen boxes to get started, Selipsky told Fortune in an interview. Until now, Tableau data Online data visualization service was only available on Tableau’s own infrastructure.\nTableau sells a version of the same softare that runs on a company’s own data center gear, called Tableau Server but Tableau Online is the company’s fastest growing product.\nThirteen-year-old Tableau data , fueled the rise of what is called “self-serve analytics” which enables mere mortals, not business analysts, to show off their important data. Previously, workers had to submit requests to business analysts for data reports and then wait hours or even days, for the result.\nIt was hardly an optimal process in a fast changing business world.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nTableau competes with products from old-school companies like MicroStrategy mstr , IBM ibm , SAS, and Microsoft , but also with newer entrants like Qlik ( acquired by private equity firm Thoma Bravo last summer), Domo , and Zoomdata .\nBut more to the point here is that AWS itself is adding more of its own products, including data analytics to its product roster. Last week, it made QuickSite , its in-house analytics tool (announced at AWS Re:invent last year) broadly available.\nActually, AWS which started ten years ago by renting basic storage, networking, and computing power to customers has added a steady stream of higher level business software to its menu. So while customers can run Oracle orcl , Microsoft, or SAP sap databases on AWS, they can also forego all of those and use Amazon’s Aurora database instead.\nThis is very reminiscent of the Microsoft msft of two decades ago that wooed third parties to build software to run on its Windows operating system while also building its own software applications.\nJust as Microsoft courted Lotus, Borland, and WordPerfect to build Windows versions of their once category-leading software packages, Amazon woos data analytics companies like Domo, Qlik, and Tableau to AWS while building its own in-house products that compete with them.\nNot to put too fine a point on this, but has anyone heard much from Lotus, Borland, or WordPerfect lately?\nOther companies are also navigating this tricky relationship. Snowflake Computing, which hosts its own data warehouse software on AWS also competes with AWS RedShift data warehouse, for example. But Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia, formerly a top Microsoft and Juniper Networks exec, told Fortune recently that AWS has good checks in place internally to guard the interests of third-party software partners. “I’m sure the RedShift team hates me, but the AWS infrastructure guys do not,” he said.\nFor more on AWS watch: \nAsked about competitive issues with Amazon, Selipsky said the potential opportunities that open up because Tableau and AWS work together far outweigh any threat. Customers can already run their Tableau Server software on Amazon amzn and the two companies built links between Amazon RedShift data warehouse and other data sources to Tableau; and they conduct joint marketing and sales efforts.\n“Business intelligence and analytics are very large market segments. Customers will choose different offerings for different use cases,” he said.",

      "text": "The certainty behind video games on Black Friday (and the lead-up to it) is that it'll be the year's biggest titles that are on sale. It's expected that the likes of Titanfall , Battlefield , and Gears of War  will all be discounted, usually heavily.\nMaybe it's the calm before the storm, but some of the more interesting Wednesday sales are from some of the more unexpected places. Games like Steamworld Collection  and Assault Suit Leynos  are featured. Of course, plenty of stuff that started yesterday  is also here, so it isn't like it's only lesser-known titles that are the gems.\nAlso worth noting is that some Steam hardware went on sale too. The wacky Steam controller and the Steam link both have their prices slashed, making this the perfect opportunity to finally see what those are all about.\nThat's about it for Wednesday, a/k/a The Last Day Before Thanksgiving, a/k/a The Day Before Shit Gets Bananas. And, hear you me, it's gonna get bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S.\n\nRead more... ",

      "text": "Amazon's Lead Narrows, Says Annual Boomerang Commerce Report on Holiday Pricing and Assortment of Toys and Games [November 23, 2016] Amazon's Lead Narrows, Says Annual Boomerang Commerce Report on Holiday Pricing and Assortment of Toys and Games Tweet \nBoomerang Commerce, the leading Retail Performance Management solution , today releases its annual \" Boomerang Insights: Toys Category \" report comparing top retailers' pricing, promotion and assortment of this holiday season's popular toys and games. This year's results reveal that Walmart is making big strides to challenge Amazon's dominance. The retailer has more than doubled its online product assortment between Q1 and Q3 2016 and is leveraging its recent Jet.com acquisition for competitive pricing. Toys\"R\"Us is also pursuing a strategy of increased assortment, as well as offering exclusive product lines. Meanwhile, Target ( News - Alert ) is eschewing assortment expansion in favor of special pricing promotions. \nKey findings across data from Amazon, Walmart, Jet.com, Target, GameStop, and Toys\"R\"Us show: Amazon is still, by far, the leading retailer for toys and games with over 5 million items in the category - compared with less than 100,000 for other retailers - and with a pricing strategy that optimizes based on external market and internal data signals. Jet.com has the lowest prices , meeting or beating the usual leader Amazon by an average of 64 percent - up from 55 percent in 2015 - on its overlap of most popular items. Walmart is a close second to Jet by pricing 55 percent of popular items the same or lower than Amazon, but this represents a 9 percentage point decrease YOY.Meanwhile, Target increased its price competitiveness with Amazon by 8 percentage ponts YOY to meet or beat Amazon's price on 42 percent of popular overlapping toys and games. Walmart and Jet offer the most aggressive price discounts . Compared to list prices on Amazon, Walmart discounted 54 percent of popular items, followed by Jet with 47 percent, and Target with 41 percent. Concurrently, Target is seeking to win customers through promotions , such as 20 percent discounts for select toys, \"buy two, get one free\" games and its current \"10 Days of Deals\" campaign. Walmart is becoming increasingly more competitive in assortment with a 66 percent overlap with Amazon's most popular items; this represents approximately 1.8 times the nearest competitor. After Walmart, Toys\"R\"Us has the highest assortment overlap (40 percent) with a sampling of Amazon's popular items , representing a 5 percent improvement over last year. Although toys and games specialty retailers struggle to compete on price, their wide assortments within specific sub-categories like video games at GameStop and exclusive LEGO products at Toys\"R\"Us keep them relevant. \"Today's always-on, mobile-enabled consumers force retailers to be much more responsive to higher consumer expectations and competitive changes,\" says Boomerang Commerce CEO Guru Hariharan. \"During this year's holiday season - where retailer fortunes are won or lost - the toys category is a spectacular example of which retailers are up for the challenge and which fall short. Winners will be those retailers that are high tech and high touch - executing their strategies through a combination of data-driven decisions, ongoing measurement, and operational excellence.\" \nBoomerang Commerce Insights reports are produced annually for different product categories. In this report on toys and games, Boomerang analyzed 1,800 items throughout the online stores of six leading toy retailers: Amazon, GameStop, Jet.com, Target, Toys\"R\"Us and Walmart. The analysis is based on 600 randomly selected items from each of three tiers: best-sellers, moderately popular items and less-popular (specialty) products. More details and examples for specific products are in the full report from Boomerang Commerce. The data used was compiled during October 2016. \nAbout Boomerang Commerce \nFounded in 2012, Boomerang Commerce is a leading retail technology company led by veterans from Amazonand McKinsey.

The Alexa skill then analyzes data from TrackR, a mobile app that can deliver location information and responds with where it is. Alexa can also ring the phone to help the owner find it. Control Lights with the Philips Hue Skill Once the Philips Hue skill is enabled, users have the ability to control their lights with whatever vocal commands they wish. For instance, Alexa can be told to turn the lights on or off, or flick on a pre-defined \"scene\" in rooms throughout the house. The skill effectively gives users most of the features they'd find in the Philips Hue app, but allows them to issue commands with their voice rather than rely on the mobile software. Get a Secure Password Random Password Generator is one of the simpler skills in this roundup, but it's still quite useful. Users simply tell Alexa to ask Random Password Generator for a password with the number of characters they wish. Alexa then works with the skill to spit out a completely random and hard-to-crack password. Users can request passwords up to 100 characters in length. Work Time Tracker Counts the Hours Work Time Tracker lets users ask Alexa to time how long they've been working. First, the skill requires users ask Alexa to start a timer. Then, when they're done, they can tell Alexa to stop tracking their time. Alexa then can be asked to tally their total time across all the periods in which they've worked. It doesn't come with timecard integration, however. Remember the Milk Is All About To-Do Lists Remember the Milk is a simple to-do list app that has found its way to the Amazon Echo. With Alexa's help, users can set to-dos and ask that the virtual assistant alert them to their task at a later time. For instance, users can request Alexa keep remind them of a meeting they'll be attending at lunchtime next Thursday. Alexa will then wait until then and, at the right time, issue a reminder through the Echo. The Remember the Milk skill also lets users query Alexa to find out all the things they need to do that day. Get Travel Ideas from Kayak Kayak's Alexa skill comes with several features, including the ability for users to track flights, get prices on hotels and even share a budget with the service and ask what it would get them for a vacation. The feature is essentially a way for users to get travel information, check prices and plan a vacation, all from Amazon's Echo. Get a Car with Uber The Uber skill for Alexa and the Amazon Echo is one of the most popular. The feature lets users request a car at a particular location and time and even set which kind of car they'd prefer for their ride. The skill also comes with ride status information, the option to change a pickup location and multi-user account support. It works with several Uber programs, including UberX and UberBlack. Nest Lets You Control the Smart Home With the Nest skill, thermostat controls are just a command away. Users can ask Alexa to turn down the thermostat a few degrees, find out what their temperature settings are throughout the house, and set a target temperature. Better yet, the skill can respond to subjective commands such as \"Alexa, cool down the living room.\" It'll then set the air to cool and bring the temperature to a more comfortable level. Airport Security Wait Times Saves Users Time No one likes to wait in line at the airport security check. That's why Airport Security Wait Times might come in handy. The skill lets users find out how long security line wait times are at airports across the United States by using the Transportation Security Agency's public API, which feeds that data to developers. Users can ask about an airport by city or by its three-letter code. Send a Post to Slack Channels Chat Bot for Slack is a way to send messages to other Slack users in channels. Users first need to attach their Slack accounts to the skill, and thus. From there, they can ask Alexa to start the chat bot and post a message to the channel of their choosing. The command requires users to dictate the message and then choose the channel to which it should be published. Chat Bot for Slack doesn't tell users what others are saying in the channel.",

Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new memoir. The Los Angeles Times reports over 100 negative reviews of Kelly’s “Settle For More” appeared on the online retail giant’s site within hours of its release Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. (Photo by Victoria Will/Invision/AP, File) The Associated Press SEATTLE — \nAmazon has suppressed a number of negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.\" Copyright The Associated Press \nThere are no comments yet.

      "text": "Thanksgiving Here are 5 shows on Netflix, Amazon you should binge watch after Thanksgiving Looking for something to binge watch after your Thanksgiving dinner? Try out The CW's \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\" Photo: Eddy Chen/The CW By Shannon O’Connor, Los Angeles Daily News Posted: # Comments \nThe dishes have been licked clean, the football games have ended and the turkey coma is finally setting in, so what is there to do now? It’s simple: binge-watch some TV. There is no better day to indulge in the cultural phenomenon than the day after Thanksgiving. So jump in (or stay in) your pajamas, find a comfy position on the couch and boot up your Netflix or Amazon que to one (or, if you are feeling adventurous, all) of these shows. \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the the Life \nIt’s back! After months of hype and promotion, the four new 90-minute installments of “Gilmore Girls” are finally here . Take a trip back to Stars Hollow, Connecticut and revisit Lorelai, Rory, Emily, Luke and all the other colorful townsfolk fans have come to adore. Whether you have been a long-time Gilmore fan or are just discovering the series (in this case, bonus you get to binge more!) these installments should provide some laughs, tears and nostalgia (in whatever order you prefer). To accompany this binge, I would suggest copious amounts of coffee, pop tarts and tater tots. Also keep pizza and tacos nearby, you know, just in case. All seasons are currently streaming on Netflix and the new episodes arrive on Nov. 25 at 12:01am. \nGood Girls Revolt \nIn the past few weeks journalism has been an issue of much discussion, so there is no better time to dive into Amazon’s new series “Good Girls Revolt.” The series is loosely based on Lynn Povich’s book of the same name and is a fictionalized account of Povich and her female co-worker’s 1969 struggle with a sexual discrimination case against Newsweek magazine over pay and gender equality. Though the show is set a few decades in the past, it brings to light many issues still plaguing women in the workforce today (noticeably the pay gap). So, don’t be afraid to get inspired while watching. All episodes of the series first season are available on Amazon. \nCrazy Ex-Girlfriend \nMusical lovers and people who love a good Southern California joke or reference , do I have a show for you. Rachel Bloom’s “ Crazy Ex-Girlfriend ” is the musical-comedy extravaganza about a young New York hotshot lawyer who uproots her high-powered life to follow her old high school boyfriend back to West Covina only to find that he is in a serious relationship. Laughs, heartbreak and big (paradoxical) musical numbers ensue, but it is the heart in the show that will keep you coming back (the music is pretty catchy too, though). All episodes of the first season are available for streaming on Netflix. Season 2 is currently airing on The CW (So catch-up!). \nBlack Mirror \nIf you are in the mood for some more serious TV fare, try the bizarre but captivating anthology series “Black Mirror.” The series, which returned for a 6-episode third season late last month, tackles complex, yet engaging storylines that contribute to society’s greatest fears such as blackmail, technology and social media; but be ready for some twists and surprises.The show may make you paranoid (especially with events of late), but just remember it is fiction (for now). All episodes are streaming on Netflix. Advertisement \n“The Crown” \nThough at this point you may be a bit tired of politics and government, Netflix’s latest series “ The Crown ” about Queen Elizabeth II should not be missed. Though we have seen versions of the Queen’s life on screen before, this 10-part series not only focuses on the life of Elizabeth herself but the lives of those around her. Fans of series like “The Tudors” or “Reign” will undoubtedly be drawn to this British monarchy tale that has critics raving. All episodes of the first season are streaming on Netflix.",

      "text": "\nIt’s now easier to buy products on Amazon.com with Bitcoin.\niPayYou CEO and founder Gene Kavner. Seattle-based bitcoin payment platform iPayYou this week announced a new feature called “Amazon Direct” that lets consumers transfer any dollar amount of bitcoin to use for purchases on Amazon.\n“This is the only direct way to purchase on Amazon with bitcoin today,” said iPayYou CEO Gene Kavner. “iPayYou.io also sells gift cards to many merchants, which includes Amazon, that may be purchased with bitcoin as well. Gift cards have advantages that they may be sent to friends/family but they are not a straightforward path for purchasing at Amazon as iPayYou’s Amazon Direct.”\nHere’s a how-to video that shows the integration:\nBefore launching iPayYou last year, Kavner was previously the worldwide director of the Amazon Associates program and principal architect for display advertising at Microsoft.\nHe started iPayYou to help make it easy to store bitcoin and use it to pay for products. The software also lets you send and receive bitcoin with friends, who don’t need a bitcoin wallet themselves. In July, the company rolled out a new service that allows anyone with a Twitter account to send and receive bitcoin payments, without providing any private information.\niPayYou employs five people in Seattle and has raised investment from Roger Ver , a Bitcoin Foundation member and early Bitcoin evangelist.",

      "text": "barnes and noble nook news More Barnes & Noble’s Nook division might not be in the best financial standing it could be, but the company’s new Nook tablet hopes to go toe to toe with Amazon’s budget offering and revitalize the struggling division.\nAs far as looks are concerned, the Nook’s mission is to be a very basic, yet practical, tablet. To that end, the front features a 7-inch, 1,024 x 600 resolution IPS display and VGA selfie camera, while the rear features a 2-megapixel sensor. The Nook branding on the back is the only thing keeping the Nook from looking like generic Android tablets you might find at a Walmart or gas station, but, again, it aims to fill basic tablet needs and nothing more.\nMore: New $250 Verizon Ellipsis 8 HD tablet boasts Snapdragon 617 and 3GB RAM\nThat theme continues under the hood, where you will find an unnamed quad-core processor and 8GB of storage, though the MicroSD card slot lets you add up to an additional 128GB of memory. As a small bonus, you can save most Nook books to your MicroSD card. Since the Nook is an Android tablet, the tablet runs a seemingly stock version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow. More specifically, even though there are plenty of pre-loaded Nook-related apps, the Nook also has access to Google Play and Google’s slew of Android apps.\nThere are a few key features Barnes & Noble points out with the Nook, the first being Readouts. The feature lets users read brief excerpts from new books, as well as a number of articles from different magazines. Furthermore, anyone who buys the Nook can get free support from physical Barnes & Noble locations. Finally, the Nook will be sold for just $50, putting the tablet in direct competition with Amazon’s own cheap Fire tablet.\nThe two tablets are very similar to each other, down to the amount of storage, so buyers will need to weigh whether Barnes & Noble or Amazon will best fulfill their needs. If you find that the Nook is the tablet for you, it is currently available for pre-order online, with in-store availability slated for Black Friday, November 25.\nTCL’s kitchen-ready tablet adds Amazon Alexa integration Joy is a $500 tablet that’s a curated digital frame for your photos Want the new S Pen without the exploding phone?

Amazon flooded with negative reviews of Megyn Kelly’s memoir Associated Press Twitter \nSEATTLE – Amazon has suppressed a number of negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reported more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly’s “Settle For More” appeared on the online retail giant’s site within hours of its release Tuesday. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn’t verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that “there are many other forums available across the internet to discuss topics of interest which are not product reviews.”   10:11 a.m.",
