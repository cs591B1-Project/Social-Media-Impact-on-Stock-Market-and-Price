      "text": "In News by Jordan Freiman   Follow @jordanfreiman \nIt’s that magical time of year again when Starbucks finds itself embroiled in an incomprehensibly stupid scandal revolving around their cups. Sadly, like everything else, this proud tradition has been tainted by the presence of Donald Trump, so rather than people complaining about a lack of Jesusness on the new holiday cups or whatever it is people like to complain about, now we have Trump supporters telling Starbucks employees their name is Trump . I don’t get it either. \n1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump \n2) If they refuse take video \nPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY \n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 \nNow I know what you’re thinking. This is the dumbest protest ever because it actually requires you to give your money to the institution you’re protesting. You would be right, but our friend Baked Alaska has been very clear that Operation Trump Cup is not a protest. It’s a statement. Baked Alaska even admitted that Starbucks was probably too big to even be hurt by a boycott. \n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 \nApparently the whole point is to “trigger SJW’s” who work at Starbucks, according to a video Baked Alaska streamed on Periscope. \n“If someone is getting so triggered, they can’t write Trump on a coffee cup at Starbucks and they’re crying liberal tears and they’re calling the cops, that’s insane,” he said. \nThe calling the cops bit is a reference to this incident from before the election. this is what happens when we go to a store that has liberal employees! @Starbucks this is against y'alls policies! pic.twitter.com/yyH4GCgOJc \n— FLPrincessSJK♛ (@lollicakesFL) November 8, 2016 \nThen of course there was the recent incident where a guy was convinced he wasn’t being served in a Starbucks due to anti-white discrimination or something . He decided to start yelling that he voted for Trump and calling the employees “garbage.” \nFor what it’s worth, refusing to write a name on a cup isn’t actually against Starbucks policy. A spokesperson told Business Insider employees aren’t required to write or call out customer names at all \n“Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores,” Starbucks explained in a statement. “Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition.” \nIt’s still somewhat unclear what the whole point of this is. If it’s just to get the word out that there are Donald Trump supporters I think that was made pretty clear on November 8. If all they’re shooting for is to annoy people who work at Starbucks, well, those people work in the service industry. They’re pretty used to dealing with annoying people and requests. Not sure it’s gonna make a huge impact on their lives. They might call the cops, but mostly because you’re blocking the line and refusing to let anybody else order. \nCan’t we please just go one year without people making political/religious/social statements via Starbucks cups? Obviously it’s already too late for 2016, but let’s see if we can pull off this seemingly impossible feat in 2017. \n[h/t CNN | Photo: Getty]",

      "text": "Semi-News/Semi-Satire ^ | 20 Nov 2016 | John Semmens \nPosted on 11/18/2016 8:57:08 PM PST by John Semmens \nCustomers and staff at a Portland, Oregon Starbuck's coffee shop endured a moment of pure terror when another customer asked for the name \"Trump\" to be written on his order. \n\"This used to be a safe space,\" said a weepy barista while whipping up a Latte Venti for a cowering customer in an \"I'm with her\" t-shirt. \"That our grief over the election results could be so disrespected so soon reaffirms our fears that a new dark age is upon us.\" \nCustomer, Marcus Child admitted to \"trembling in horror at the insensitivity of some people. The greatest woman in human history has just seen her dreams shattered by a wave of bigotry from the deplorable voters who backed a fascist takeover of this country.\" \nWeeping and trembling weren't the only activities underway during this terrifying incident. One of the victims covertly called the police on the 911 line. Ten minutes later police arrived to confront the man who inspired the widespread angst. He seemed oddly calm and unaware as he drank his coffee and fiddled with his cell phone. \nAs it turned out, the man's name is John Trump. He, like most of his fellow Portlandians, voted for Hillary Clinton. Nevertheless, he was apologetic for his inadvertent aggression. \"I'm disappointed too, but its just an election,\" he said. \"There'll be another one in a few years. I guess in hindsight I should've used my first name. It's just that 'John' is so common. I was afraid my order might get mixed up with another customer's.\" \nPolice advised John Trump to consider bearing the risk of order mix-ups for a while, \"at least until the terror stemming from Donald Trump's being elected president subsides a bit.\" \nIn related news, anti-Trump protesters outside the Trump Hotel in Washington, DC called for Donald's wife Melania to be raped. How this fits with the the protesters' contention that Trump is the advocate of hate remains a mystery. \nif you missed any of this week's other semi-news/semi-satire posts you can find them at... \nhttps://www.freedomsphoenix.com/Opinion/207359-2016-11-18-semi-news-semi-satire-november-20-2016-edition.htm",

Is he trolling?  Is he being antagonistic and trying to provoke trouble?\n \nIt would never enter my mind to go someplace and have someone elses name written on my purchase, no matter how much I like anyone else.  It's juvenile, but look at the picture.  That there is a bigot and a troublemaker, and like Trump, seems to have the mind of a child",

      "text": "Jew Starbucks Tries to Pay-Off Mark Dice to Silence His Fight for Christmas \nAndrew Anglin November 19, 2016 \nHA! \nJew Starbucks contacted Mark Dice to try and get him to remove a video complaining about the fact that Starbucks is refusing to endorse Christmas (specifically they are doing that in America – in Eastern Europe, where people don’t tolerate this nonsense, they have continued to print “Merry Christmas” on cups and release “Christmas Blend” coffee, proving that Jews can only Jew you to the extent that you’re willing to tolerate it). \nDice of course refused their offer. Christ-killing Jew Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz \nThe fact that Starbucks is trying to bury the fact that they attacked Christmas last year is evidence that they are aware that the tides have turned – that society is once again going in the correct direction. \nA pro-White, pro-Christian, pro-civilization, pro-heritage direction. \nThe Republican direction. \nWe’re going to be saying “Merry Christmas” again, I can tell you that. \nThe war on Christmas would in itself have been reason enough to vote for Trump. \nSeriously, this is the gayest thing of all. \nReally shows the nerve of these kikes –“oh yes, goyim, your thousands year old celebration – we have to cancel it because it offends immigrants and other people who hate your society and civilization but live in it to get money from you.” \nWe’re going to be doing a big pro-Christmas thing this year here at Daily Stormer. We’re going to endorse only companies that say Merry Christmas, and boycott any faggots who refuse.",

Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is an adamant supporter of the Democratic Party and endorsed Hillary Clinton’s White House bid. \nThe situation got so bad, actually, Trump suggested a boycott of the popular coffee chain after the company announced it would discontinue producing Christmas-themed cups. \nInstead of boycotting the company, supporters of the president-elect are going to Starbucks and telling the employees that their name is “Trump.” These cup protesters are taking selfies of their Trump-named cups and going to Twitter. The trending hashtag #TrumpCup is blowing up. \nHere are a few of the best. Trump supporters launch #TrumpCup as a protest against Starbucks https://t.co/mSGihN2bIM pic.twitter.com/vB2uOb0d8J",

      "text": "It seems like every holiday season, there's some sort of controversy surrounding Starbucks. Usually it involves the red holiday cups and whether they're Christmassy enough. But this year, it seems like Starbucks controversies have all had something to do with President-elect Donald Trump. First, on Wednesday , a Miami man was captured yelling, \"Trump!\" at a barista because he felt his latte wasn't made quickly enough.\nAnd now, Trump supporters are rallying behind the #TrumpCup hashtag to make a statement about discrimination against Republicans. Throughout Trump's campaign, supporters have occasionally asked Starbucks baristas to write \"Trump\" on their cups. Scott Baio has taken credit for starting the trend:\n Check out this! @realDonaldTrump I've started the \"give the Trump name\" #TrumpMovement pic.twitter.com/7cGSgCSaTH\n— Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) April 4, 2016 But before the election, a video started circulating of a Trump supporter asking a Starbucks employee to write \"Trump.\" In the video, the barista is seen refusing, and a coworker is seen apparently calling the police. This video caused outrage among conservatives online, who saw it as discrimination against their political beliefs.\nthis is what happens when we go to a store that has liberal employees! @Starbucks this is against y'alls policies! pic.twitter.com/yyH4GCgOJc\n— FLPrincessSJK♛ (@lollicakesFL) November 8, 2016 Joe Biggs, who works at the website Infowars, came up with the #TrumpCup idea Thursday in response to the video.\npic.twitter.com/4wsLESrFNk\n— Joe Biggs (@Rambobiggs) November 18, 2016 Every time you go into @Starbucks ask them to write TRUMP on your cup!!! :)\n— Joe Biggs (@Rambobiggs) November 17, 2016 Yes we can #BoycottStarbucks but first lets Trigger them on the way out by asking for Trump lattes and having Trump written on the cup :)\n— Joe Biggs (@Rambobiggs) November 17, 2016 Tim Treadstone, who goes by the social-media handle Baked Alaska, posted about \"Operation #TrumpCup\" on Twitter, encouraging his followers to try it and take a video if baristas refuse to comply. \"All these businesses are discriminating against Trump supporters,\" he said on Periscope. \"We're not taking this anymore.\"\nOperation #TrumpCup\n1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump\n2) If they refuse take video\nPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY\n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 LIVE on #Periscope : Operation #TrumpCup EMERGENCY BROADCAST https://t.co/4Tf3JavOTA\n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 Treadstone made it clear that this wasn't a \"protest\" exactly, but a statement about Trump and the future of the U.S. in general. It's also meant as a reminder that there are lots of Trump supporters out there in general, and they shouldn't be ignored. (Plus, a lot of people just wanted to annoy liberals while they get their coffee.)\nMy official letter to @Starbucks : pic.twitter.com/i5XpJrj1ys\n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 The concept went viral, with other Trump supporters chiming in with their own #TrumpCups.\nIf we want Trump written on our cups don't call the cops! Feel free to boycott Starbucks after this. Even Kanye wants to #MAGA ! #TrumpCup pic.twitter.com/YyFv96dhz0\n— Irma Hinojosa 🇺🇸 (@latinaafortrump) November 18, 2016 On Primary #ElectionDay I got a #TrumpCup\nThen when I tried to #BoycottStarbucks & they wouldn't refund my $100 credit I did it @bakedalaska pic.twitter.com/78Alp8Q9fX\n— PRESIDENT TRUMP🇺🇸 (@BarbieKeleigh) November 18, 2016 But not everyone was on board. Some thought it was pointless, since by buying coffee these people were supporting Starbucks with their wallets, and the company's CEO, Howard Schultz, endorsed Hillary Clinton.\n Operation #TrumpCup Phase 2: Write Starbucks a check for your savings, with \"TRUMP\" on the memo line & send it to corporate HQ. Owned, Libs\n— Patrick Monahan (@pattymo) November 18, 2016 Wow, the irony of millions of Trump supporters going to Starbucks and buying coffee to punish Starbucks. Unbelievable. #TrumpCup Go get 'em!\n— Kelly Challis (@kechallis) November 18, 2016 #TrumpCup\nDon't go and buy @Starbucks out of anger! Your revenge will make these corporate freaks more money! Simply boycott Starbucks!\n— @GenXRise (@GenXRise) November 18, 2016 Why even go to Starbucks? Stop giving them your business! #TrumpCup\n— Patrick Henry (@FightNowAmerica) November 18, 2016 As a former Starbucks partner, I promise that the dopes doing this #TrumpCup nonsense are getting unknowingly decaffed. What I would do.\n— Joey Esposito (@joeyesposito) November 18, 2016 A representative for Starbucks gave the following statement:\n\"Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores. Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition. We don't require our partners to write or call out names.\" From: Delish\n ",

Therefore, a study should commence to learn where both parties, have deviated from the morals of our culture, into a culture that resembles the Wild-Wild-West, where law and order did not favor the average citizen, but catered to the criminal element, using the Black and Muslim communities as perfect examples, globally. Just think how peaceful planet would be, if the Blacks and Muslims were no longer a conundrum? It is something to think about.

      "text": "From Delish It seems like every holiday season, there's some sort of controversy surrounding Starbucks. Usually it involves the red holiday cups and whether they're Christmassy enough. But this year, it seems like Starbucks controversies have all had something to do with President-elect Donald Trump. First, on Wednesday , a Miami man was captured yelling, \"Trump!\" at a barista because he felt his latte wasn't made quickly enough.\nAnd now, Trump supporters are rallying behind the #TrumpCup hashtag to make a statement about discrimination against Republicans. Throughout Trump's campaign, supporters have occasionally asked Starbucks baristas to write \"Trump\" on their cups. Scott Baio has taken credit for starting the trend:\nCheck out this! @realDonaldTrump I've started the \"give the Trump name\" #TrumpMovement pic.twitter.com/7cGSgCSaTH\n- Scott Baio (@ScottBaio) April 4, 2016 But before the election, a video started circulating of a Trump supporter asking a Starbucks employee to write \"Trump.\" In the video, the barista is seen refusing, and a coworker is seen apparently calling the police. This video caused outrage among conservatives online, who saw it as discrimination against their political beliefs.\nthis is what happens when we go to a store that has liberal employees! @Starbucks this is against y'alls policies! pic.twitter.com/yyH4GCgOJc\n- FLPrincessSJK♛ (@lollicakesFL) November 8, 2016 Joe Biggs, who works at the website Infowars, came up with the #TrumpCup idea Thursday in response to the video.\npic.twitter.com/4wsLESrFNk\n- Joe Biggs (@Rambobiggs) November 18, 2016 Every time you go into @Starbucks ask them to write TRUMP on your cup!!! :)\n- Joe Biggs (@Rambobiggs) November 17, 2016 Yes we can #BoycottStarbucks but first lets Trigger them on the way out by asking for Trump lattes and having Trump written on the cup :)\n- Joe Biggs (@Rambobiggs) November 17, 2016 Tim Treadstone, who goes by the social-media handle Baked Alaska, posted about \"Operation #TrumpCup\" on Twitter, encouraging his followers to try it and take a video if baristas refuse to comply. \"All these businesses are discriminating against Trump supporters,\" he said on Periscope. \"We're not taking this anymore.\"\nOperation #TrumpCup\n1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump\n2) If they refuse take video\nPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY\n- Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 LIVE on #Periscope : Operation #TrumpCup EMERGENCY BROADCAST https://t.co/4Tf3JavOTA\n- Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 Treadstone made it clear that this wasn't a \"protest\" exactly, but a statement about Trump and the future of the U.S. in general. It's also meant as a reminder that there are lots of Trump supporters out there in general, and they shouldn't be ignored. (Plus, a lot of people just wanted to annoy liberals while they get their coffee.)\nMy official letter to @Starbucks : pic.twitter.com/i5XpJrj1ys\n- Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 The concept went viral, with other Trump supporters chiming in with their own #TrumpCups.\nIf we want Trump written on our cups don't call the cops! Feel free to boycott Starbucks after this. Even Kanye wants to #MAGA ! #TrumpCup pic.twitter.com/YyFv96dhz0\n- Irma Hinojosa 🇺🇸 (@latinaafortrump) November 18, 2016 On Primary #ElectionDay I got a #TrumpCup\nThen when I tried to #BoycottStarbucks & they wouldn't refund my $100 credit I did it @bakedalaska pic.twitter.com/78Alp8Q9fX\n- PRESIDENT TRUMP🇺🇸 (@BarbieKeleigh) November 18, 2016 But not everyone was on board. Some thought it was pointless, since by buying coffee these people were supporting Starbucks with their wallets, and the company's CEO, Howard Schultz, endorsed Hillary Clinton.\nOperation #TrumpCup Phase 2: Write Starbucks a check for your savings, with \"TRUMP\" on the memo line & send it to corporate HQ. Owned, Libs\n- Patrick Monahan (@pattymo) November 18, 2016 Wow, the irony of millions of Trump supporters going to Starbucks and buying coffee to punish Starbucks. Unbelievable. #TrumpCup Go get 'em!\n- Kelly Challis (@kechallis) November 18, 2016 #TrumpCup\nDon't go and buy @Starbucks out of anger! Your revenge will make these corporate freaks more money! Simply boycott Starbucks!\n- @GenXRise (@GenXRise) November 18, 2016 Why even go to Starbucks? Stop giving them your business! #TrumpCup\n- Patrick Henry (@FightNowAmerica) November 18, 2016 As a former Starbucks partner, I promise that the dopes doing this #TrumpCup nonsense are getting unknowingly decaffed. What I would do.\n- Joey Esposito (@joeyesposito) November 18, 2016 A representative for Starbucks gave the following statement:\n\"Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores. Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition. We don't require our partners to write or call out names.\"\nFor more news videos visit Yahoo View , available now on iOS .\nYou Might Also Like\n52 Cheap and Easy Dinner Recipes For Every Week This Year 42 Easy Pumpkin Desserts To Celebrate Fall 18 Apple Cakes You Need To Bake This Season",

      "text": "Photo via Flickr user Jerry Luo Trump Supporters Head to Starbucks to Protest—Something By Follow @munchies \nThis time last year, Donald Trump was just one of approximately 472 Republican presidential candidates, standing behind signs with his name in a gigantic font and rambling about whatever came into his head that day. He suggested that, because Starbucks released a plain, non-denominational red holiday cup, his supporters should boycott the coffee giant. Fast forward 12 months, and Trump’s supporters are protesting… something by insisting that Starbucks baristas write the president-elect’s name on their pumpkin spice lattes. \nOn Friday afternoon, a political consultant named Timothy Treadstone posted the instructions for what he called “Operation #TrumpCup” on Twitter, ordering members of Team MAGA to go to Starbucks, tell the barista that their name is Trump and, if the barista chooses not to Sharpie those particular letters on the cup, to take video. “We have a culture war to win,” Treadstone said in a Periscope video . “If someone is getting so triggered they can’t write Trump on a coffee cup at Starbucks and they’re crying liberal tears and they’re calling the cops, that’s insane.” \n1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump \n2) If they refuse take video \nPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY \n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 \nAnd since Treadstone posted the instructions, people are really doing this. If we want Trump written on our cups don’t call the cops! Feel free to boycott Starbucks after this. Even Kanye wants to #MAGA ! #TrumpCup pic.twitter.com/YyFv96dhz0 \n— Irma Hinojosa  (@latinaafortrump) November 18, 2016 I got my Starbucks with Trump name.  he yelled Trump get your drink #TrumpCup pic.twitter.com/X8FK2b962D \n— Aran  Trump (@ArantheGreat) November 18, 2016 \nEven before #TrumpCup trended and grown adults started feeling smug about making an hourly employee shout “Trump” every time they’ve finished making a cafe mocha, it was quite a week for Starbucks. On Thursday, David Sanguesa accused a Miami-area barista of discriminating against him and being too slow with his order. Sanguesa, who is white, repeatedly called the barista, who is black, “trash” and “garbage,” before chanting “TRUMP. TRUMP. YOU LOST.” He also threatened to “punch [her] out.” READ MORE: Trump Supporter Allegedly Left Hate Speech on Receipt for Waiter at TGI Friday’s \nSanguesa told NBC Miami that he was sorry, but that he and his female companion both believed it was racism and discrimination. Unsurprisingly, Sanguesa has two DUI arrests, a charge of domestic violence (that was later dropped), and a history of writing to the Miami Herald to complain about “Cubans, women, immigrants, the gay and lesbian community as well as both President Obama and Hillary Clinton.” Sanguesa will probably be a member of Trump’s cabinet by Monday. \nBut back to those Trump Cups. Many people have questioned the logic of supposedly trying to “punish” a company by continuing to spend money there, while others just don’t see what this is supposed to accomplish. If you can afford to buy @Starbucks every day & claim to be the “struggling” working class, look up the word struggling:) #trumpcup",

      "text": "Costa's festive drink has been axed for an equivalent with 40 per cent less Public Health England is pushing for sugar to go from hundreds of others Starbucks has also reduced the sugar in its festive drink by 19 per cent Meanwhile that figure was 26 per cent at market rival Caffe Nero \nBy Sean Poulter Consumer Affairs Editor For The Daily Mail \nPublished: 19:41 EST, 18 November 2016 | Updated: 03:54 EST, 19 November 2016 \nCoffee shop chains are cutting down on sugar, including in their super-sweet Christmas drinks, following a health backlash. \nCosta’s caramel fudge hot chocolate, which contained the equivalent of almost 27 teaspoons of sugar, has been axed. \nThe drink was sold last year with a belt-busting 107.2grams of sugar in a massimo (large) serving, but it has been replaced by the mint hot chocolate, which contains 64.4g – a 40 per cent reduction. \nCaffe Nero, Costa and Starbucks are all cutting the sugar levels in their festive drinks by quite drastic amounts \nAnd the chain will slash the sugar in its super-sweet chai latte by 44 per cent after the level was highlighted by the Daily Mail. \nThe drink currently has 79.7g – almost 20 teaspoons – in a massimo serving, but next spring this will come down to 45g, which is a reduction of 8.7 teaspoons, with the introduction of reduced sugar chai powder and sweetener. Costa has also switched to reduced-sugar hot chocolate powder. \nThe moves are part of a drive to reduce the amount of added sugar in popular hot drinks by 25 per cent before 2020. \nAt the same time, the government watchdog Public Health England is pushing for sugar to be taken out of hundreds of other popular products, such as breakfast cereals, confectionery, ice cream and cakes. \nThe sugar in hot drinks served by chains such as Costa, Starbucks, Caffe Nero and Pret a Manger is made up of two elements. \nA small amount of natural sugar – lactose – is found in milk, while other sugar is added for taste. \nStarbucks has cut the added sugar in its fudge hot chocolate this year by 19 per cent \nBoth Costa, which is the biggest UK chain, and Starbucks are making significant sugar reductions in their festive drinks and in others sold throughout the year. \nDespite these changes, many of their products remain high in sugar, and health watchdogs are likely to demand they do more. \nStarbucks has cut the added sugar in its fudge hot chocolate this year by 19 per cent. This reduces the figure in a grande serving from 48.5g to 39.4g – a cut of around two teaspoons. \nThere is 4 per cent less sugar in its gingerbread latte and a small reduction in sugar in its toffee nut latte. \nStarbucks has removed the largest venti size from its menu boards for some sugary hot drinks and added the short (small) size. It has also cut sugar in various syrup flavourings. \nCaffe Nero said the amount of sugar in its regular festive latte without cream has come down from 30.4g to 22.4g this year – a 26 per cent reduction. \nPret a Manger did not respond to requests for information on its plans for sugar reduction.",

      "text": "Nov 19 2016, 5:05 pm ET #TrumpCup Protest Against Starbucks Latest Controversy for Coffee Giant by Dakshayani Shankar advertisement \nStarbucks wants its stores to put a lid on the latest controversy brewing over their cups. \nThe coffee giant on Friday reminded outlets that they don't have to write or call out names when a customer orders a cup of joe. The advisory comes after supporters of Donald Trump said employees at a Miami Starbucks refused to write \"Trump\" on a man's coffee cup after telling them that was his name. \nRelated: Starbucks' New 'Unity' Cup Draws Fire Ahead of Election \n\"Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores. Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of,\" Starbucks said in a statement. \"We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition. We don't require our partners to write or call out names.\" \nA customer later identified as David Sanguesa said he had an argument Thursday with a barista who wouldn't write \"Trump\" on his cup, and resorted calling the action anti-white \"discrimination.\" The incident was shared on social media, and picked up by Twitter user Baked Alaska, who encouraged the hashtag #TrumpCup. #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy — jorge dc (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \n\"All these businesses are discriminating against Trump supporters when we won the election. ... We're not some minority here,\" Baked Alaska said on Periscope . \nHundreds of Trump supporters have since posted photos of themselves on Twitter with \"Trump\" cups in a show of solidarity. My baristas in Virginia Beach love me. I don't even ask them to write Trump, & they do it. #TrumpCup pic.twitter.com/J2Owg8FTCD — Scott Presler VA (@ScottPresler) November 18, 2016 \nThis isn't the first Starbucks controversy with Trump supporters. In November, some of them admonished the company for their new green cups meant to promote unity, saying it was a \"liberal bias\" and \"political brainwashing.\" \nThe coffee chain also received backlash last December after releasing red cups devoid of Christmas imagery.

      "text": "(Before It's News) The bizarre nationwide in-your-face Starbucks “Trumpcup” protest isn’t just petty, but it’s another mindless distraction that tells you all you need to know about Trump supporters and the conservative movement in general.\nI also recognized this one during the campaign; Republicans wanted Trump to win so they could shove it in our faces. Period. These bad winners are everywhere; from standing on top of school lunch room tables declaring “we won” (my kids school), to calling up their life long friends saying Trump won and that they don’t count anymore (that’s what happened to me).\nWatch the Starbucks “Trumpcup” campaign in action below, instigated by some of the biggest “victimized” as**oles the world will ever see:\nJust hearing these Trumpian “victims” demand the names of Starbucks employees and managers like they would be added to some kind of database is frightening enough, but the fact that Trump himself has done nothing to tamp down these attacks is par for the course.\nHere’s one of the Starbucks “Trumpcup” instigators from Twitter, victimized “Baked Alaska,” promoting the maniacal plan that includes posting more breathtakingly stupid videos like the ones above.\nBaked Alaska : “They’re going to freak out. They can’t even write the name Trump on a Starbucks cup. How insane is this? Fascist scum, exactly. What’s up fam.”\nBaked Alaska: “Come on, we have to stand up. The more people that do this, you know the more it normalizes people supporting Trump.”\nGee, I hope we can normalize those people supporting Trump.\nBaked Alaska got a few things wrong. Trump won the election (we know, we know) but not the popular vote and did not win in a landslide:\nHillary Clinton’s popular vote lead over president-elect Donald Trump has grown to more than 1.67 million votes , and it’s smashing records … number 3 in all-time presidential popular vote totals in United States history , and her tally is still growing…\n“Over half of the population?” That’s if everybody old enough in America voted, which has never happened:\nBaked Alaska said “They keep trying to call us white supremacists…!” Here’s the picture on his Twitter page featuring the Alaskan landscape and…oh, look there’s Pepe the Frog….:\nBaked Alaska said “they have to write Trump on the cup.” Nope:\nStarbucks has responded to the protest by clarifying that it doesn’t require its partners to write or call out names. “Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores,” a Starbucks spokesperson said. “Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition.”\n And what is it about Starbucks cups anyway?\nThis all comes after the controversy that plagued Starbucks last year as it introduced a plain red holiday cup that was markedly different from Christmas cups in the past. Joshua Feuerstein, a former pastor, called the new cups a “war on Christmas” in a video posted to Facebook .\nAnd this goes without saying :\nStarbucks’ CEO Howard Schultz was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton , but the #TrumpCup campaign against Starbucks is unusual in that it requires Trump supporters to go into the establishment they are protesting—and make a purchase .\nConservatives apparently found their voice in the “Trumpcup” protest, after unsuccessfully stirring up outrage over the green unity cup celebrating diversity :\nA former liberal radio talk host who likes to ask the “follow-up question” at Democurmudgeon.blogspot.com",

NBC10's Drew Smith has the details. (Published 21 minutes ago) A Bucks County man who pleaded guilty to cyber stalking a teen girl was arrested again after he allegedly continued to harass her on social media and tried to meet with her at Starbucks. Shane Holderer, 55, of Pipersville, Pennsylvania, was arrested Thursday and charged with harassment. Man, Boy Die in Head-On Crash in the Poconos Holderer was convicted of stalking and harassing in a sexual manner a 13-year-old girl on social media between 2012 and 2013 and was sentenced to five years of probation with conditions that included no longer contacting her. On September 25, 2016, the same girl reported to police that she was once again being stalked and harassed on Twitter. The teen said she noticed three days earlier that a user she did not recognize had retweeted one of her tweets. The girl checked the account and discovered it contained several thousand tweets about her, according to investigators. She also said several of the tweets were sexual in nature and many mentioned explicit sexual acts that the user wanted to do with her. Man Kills Ex-Girlfriend and Son, Takes His Own Life: Police Investigators say they determined Holderer was the man behind the account based on the fact that many of the tweets were similar to the ones he made about the same girl back in 2012 and 2013 as well as the fact that the tweets referenced his personal life and family members. Officials also say Holderer had an Instagram account that mentioned the girl, her younger sister and some of her friends. Many of the posts on his Instagram were sexual as well, according to investigators. Investigators also believe Holderer created the account in October, 2013, shortly after he was charged in the initial cyber stalking case. Officials say Holderer made one Instagram post that included the cropped and zoomed in photo of the girl’s buttocks with the caption, “God d*** that’s a nice a**…Admittedly I use the whole package for workout motivation.” After determining Holderer was behind both the Twitter and Instagram accounts, a police officer took over the girl’s Twitter account and assumed her identity. Investigators say the officer and Holderer messaged each other back and forth for several days until they set up a meeting at the Starbucks Cafe on North Main Street in Doylestown. On Thursday around 6:45 p.m., Holderer arrived at the Starbucks where he was met by the officer. Holderer allegedly admitted to using his Twitter and Instagram accounts for “things he shouldn’t be using them for.” He was then arrested and taken into custody. Holderer’s bail was set at $250,000. He’s currently in jail awaiting his next hearing. Published 8 minutes ago",

It just looks that way! 21 mins ago Starbucks Requests No Guns in Their Stores Starbucks Requests No Guns in Their Stores: In response to the “open carry” movement popular in some areas, Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz is asking customers of the coffee chain to honor his request to refrain from bringing loaded firearms into its stores. I see his point — it could get downright confusing for the baristas if someone requests an “extra shot” in their cappuccino. http://www.johnnyrobish.com Mike Huckabee Claims He Was Offered Cabinet Post: While appearing on “The O’Reilly Factor,” former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said President-elect Donald Trump offered him a Cabinet position but he declined because it wasn’t “the right fit.” A Trump spokesperson says the story is only half correct, pointing out that what actually happened was that Trump offered Huckabee one of the cabinets in his waiting room, but Huckabee didn’t think it would fit in his office. http://www.johnnyrobish.com A&E Announces Duck Dynasty Will End After This Season: A&E announced that after five years, 130 episodes, the Robertson family and A&E have jointly decided that the reality series “Duck Dynasty” will come to an end after this season. Wow, no more “Duck Dynasty?” That just gives me goosebumps! To be honest, I’ve never really understood the show’s appeal, but then again, I’ve never been attracted to ducks.",

      "text": "Trump supporters are posting pictures of Starbucks coffer with the hashtag #TrumpCup to protest discrimination against Republicans The hashtag was started by Scott Baio and has since gone viral Trump supporters have been telling baristas their name is 'Trump' The baristas then must write it on the cup and shout it out loud when ready Some have noted that the protest is only giving Starbucks more money However, those behind the protest say the point is to cause a statement \nBy Dailymail.com Reporter \nPublished: 22:09 EST, 19 November 2016 | Updated: 22:09 EST, 19 November 2016 \nThe latest controversy to go down with Starbucks might just cause a spike in sales across the country. \nProtesters are ordering their coffee using the name 'Trump' so baristas will have to shout the last name of the president-elect when their drink is ready. \nThe protest is allegedly against people 'discriminating against Republicans' and was started by Trump supporter and actor Scott Baio, according to Yahoo News. \nProtesters are ordering their coffee from Starbucks using the name 'Trump' so baristas will have to shout the last name of the president-elect when their drink is ready \nThe protest is allegedly against people 'discriminating against Republicans' and was started by Trump supporter and actor Scott Baio \nNow, dozens of people are taking pictures of their Starbucks drink with the name 'Trump' written on it in protest of the alleged discrimination \nA hashtag #TrumpCup began to circulate on Twitter and a video of a barista calling the police after a man asked for Trump's name to be written on his cup went viral, causing the phenomenon to increase. \nAnother video of a man shouting 'Trump' at a barista when he felt his drink order was taking too long added fuel to the fire. \nNow, dozens of people are taking pictures of their Starbucks drink with the name 'Trump' written on it in protest of the alleged discrimination. \nBut many have pointed out the protest is actually just padding the wallets of Starbucks and their CEO Howard Schultz, who openly backed Hillary Clinton. \nSome have said the act is less of a protest and more of a statement - but either way, it's a controversy that hasn't seemed to hurt the coffee giant financially. \nMany have pointed out the protest is actually just padding the wallets of Starbucks and their CEO Howard Schultz, who openly backed Hillary Clinton Read more:",

I don't even ask them to write Trump, & they do it. #TrumpCup pic.twitter.com/J2Owg8FTCD — Scott Presler VA (@ScottPresler) November 18, 2016 If we want Trump written on our cups don't call the cops! Feel free to boycott Starbucks after this. Even Kanye wants to #MAGA ! #TrumpCup pic.twitter.com/YyFv96dhz0 — Irma Hinojosa 🇺🇸 (@latinaafortrump) November 18, 2016 \nParticipants say the purpose of the movement is to force Starbucks employees to yell out Trump’s name when his supporters’ drinks are ready. They appear unconcerned that doing so requires them to give more money to the company they’re protesting.",

      "text": "Share Posted on 11/18/2016 8:01 PM by vibha There are lot of people who come to Starbucks for meeting people (could be personal or professional meeting), doing their work and for their peace of mind. The ambiance, gentry and the taste of coffee attracted more people. So my idea: 1. To have some movable cubicles and rent it on hourly basis for people who want to work with discounted menu chart. 2. An open informal shared working space at shops which have two floors. With the rise of independent freelance specialist, this could be useful. The rates can be hourly/weekly/or monthly. For emerging markets and emerging cities like Bangalore, this could be really attractive. 3. The shared working space can be used on weekends for organizing some events like plays or some workshops partnering with locals. Thanks,",

      "text": "CNN \n(CNN) — Trump supporters have started asking for their Starbucks drinks under Trump’s name as a movement against the coffee giant. \nAfter a viral video showing a Trump supporter yelling at a barista gained traction on Wednesday, other supporters have banded together to protest what they view as political and anti-white discrimination. \nThe man in the video told the Miami Herald that he was racially discriminated against and that the barista wouldn’t serve him because she knew he was a Trump supporter. #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n— jorge de cardenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 \nThe hashtag #TrumpCup isn’t new, but blew up after a Twitter user posted instructions to followers Friday morning. The hashtag had over 12,000 tweets as of 10 a.m. Friday. \nThe protest is an attempt to make Starbucks baristas yell Trump’s name and write it on their coffee cups, as is the company’s mandate. \nSome supporters claim to have been refused a #TrumpCup and see it as a breach of their rights. \nBut others find the protest counterintuitive, as the plan relies on giving Starbucks money in the first place. \nThis all comes after the controversy that plagued Starbucks last year as they introduced a plain red holiday cup that was markedly different from Christmas cups in the past. Joshua Feuerstein, a former pastor, called the new cups a “war on Christmas” in a video posted to Facebook. \nBut many social media users find the Starbucks protests old and tiresome. \nSome even call out the logic of the movement with a good-natured slight at Starbucks. \nCNN’s calls to Starbucks were not immediately returned. \nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "Days after a Florida man claimed a Starbucks barista refused him service because he’d supported President-elect Donald Trump , Trump lovers nationwide have launched a campaign to show Starbucks they won’t stand for that sort of discrimination.\nBizarrely, they’re showing their disdain by purchasing drinks at Starbucks.\nThe idea behind the #TrumpCup movement is for customers to tell Starbucks baristas their name is “Trump” so that employees are obligated to write the word on the cup and then shout out “Trump!” when the drink is ready.\nCNN notes that the idea isn’t anything new , but the hashtag blew up on social media on Friday after Twitter user “Baked Alaska” posted instructions that went viral. He said to “take video” if the barista refuses to accept that your name is Trump.\nOperation #TrumpCup\n1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump\n2) If they refuse take video\nPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY\n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 Some discerning social media users noted that it seemed odd to protest Starbucks by encouraging people to purchase drinks there.\n@ItsTonyNow @bakedalaska this guy is going to show those libs at starbucks, by giving them his money\n— leslie down (@jaubert_moniker) November 18, 2016 Others responded that the purpose wasn’t to boycott Starbucks, just to annoy workers who presumably don’t want to comply.\nWhile it’s true that Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz expressed disappointment in Trump’s victory , it’s unclear why people are assuming every employee of a major national chain shares his views.\nIf you absolutely can’t restrain yourself from telling your barista that your name is “Trump,” at least tip well.\nAlso on HuffPost Here Is The 2016 Starbucks Holiday Cup Collection Here Is The 2016 Starbucks Holiday Cup Collection 1 of 13 Share this slide:\nStarbucks More: Donald Trump Starbucks Suggest a correction 1,140 Comments Close SUBSCRIBE AND FOLLOW Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day.

      "text": "Twitterjorge de cardenas A man identified as David Sanguesa was filmed calling a black Starbucks barista \"trash\" and \"garbage\" while vocalizing his support for Donald Trump. A South Florida man was filmed ranting at a Starbucks barista after he claims he was denied service for supporting Donald Trump .\nIn a video posted to Twitter on Wednesday , David Sanguesa, who is white, can be heard calling an African-American barista “trash” and “garbage” while accusing her of discriminating against him at the Miami cafe.\n“Because I voted for Trump. Trump. You lost,” he tells the unidentified employee before asking for his money back. “You’re garbage. You’re complete trash.”\nStarbucks customer Jorge de Cárdenas, who caught the explosive scene on his cell phone, told The Huffington Post that Sanguesa claimed “white discrimination” shortly before he started filming.\nSanguesa didn’t deny that claim in an interview with the Miami Herald.\n“I was racially discriminated against,” he insisted, vowing to sue the coffee company.\n#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy\n— jorge de cárdenas (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 Sanguesa, speaking to HuffPost, apologized for his actions but accused the barista of holding a grudge against him after he began holding Trump campaign meets at the Coral Gables location that he’s visited for 12 years.\n“Her face was the face of death yesterday. It was evil,” he said of the barista’s supposed attitude toward him.\nAsked whether she had said anything that would support his beliefs that she’s anti-Trump, he said: “It’s just from personal experience. She’s never been kind to me or my group.”\nSanguesa said he finally exploded after he and a real estate broker waited 25 minutes Wednesday for coffee that he said never came.\n“I paid for the coffee and I never was served,” he insisted. “She said, ‘I’ll get to you when I feel like it.’”\nIn the near two-minute video, below, Sanguesa verbally attacks the woman and nearly comes to blows with another man who stands up to defend the barista. That man tells Sanguesa that he doesn’t know what happened, but that no one should be spoken to that way.\n“I want to punch you out,” Sanguesa is heard calling to the man after the man turns his back to him.\nA manager at the Starbucks where the incident took place declined to comment when reached by HuffPost. A spokesman for the company said they are working to understand what transpired.\n“Embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing,” he said in a statement. “We are committed to providing an inclusive, supportive and safe work environment for everyone.”\nTwitter/Jorge de Cardenas The customer accused the barista of refusing to serve him because he is a white Trump supporter. According to the Miami Herald’s report, Sanguesa is a frequent writer to the paper, and over the years has voiced anger against President Barack Obama , women and Cuban-Americans.\n“I hate Cubans ... all pieces of s*** ... including Jose Fernandez,” he reportedly said in one email to the paper, responding to a story on the death of the Cuban-born Miami Marlins pitcher.\nSanguesa reportedly has also had run-ins with South Miami police, and in 2014 was arrested for a domestic dispute. The case was later dropped, the Herald reported.\nThough Sanguesa’s opinions appear clear, whether he received his coffee at an unusually slow pace is not. De Cárdenas, who filmed the spectacle and said he initially thought Sanguesa was being facetious, declined to say whether he believed the barista deliberately took her time serving Sanguesa.\n“I can confirm he was there before I was and I received my coffee before him,” he told HuffPost. “I received an espresso pretty quickly.”\nHe added that the barista “was entirely polite, all things considered.”\nAlso on HuffPost 6 Mexicans Defy Hateful Stereotypes In Powerful Photo Series 6 Mexicans Defy Hateful Stereotypes In Powerful Photo Series 1 of 7 Pedro Ramírez Pedro Ramírez, 34, works at Casa Mezcal in New York City. He works to send money home to his mother in Mexico and dreams of being a boxing trainer. He told Muñoz Boullosa:\n\"When I hear the things Trump says it makes me laugh. I find it funny although I admit it's wrong. The scary thing is that there are many people who have the same mindset as him. Of course I'm scared. He is sick [with] power. I know that people who have the same thoughts as he does have always existed, but until now there was nobody who would stand up for their ideals.\nWe Mexicans are workers, not drug traffickers. We do not come to have children here, we come to help our families and follow our dreams.

      "text": "After a video of a Donald Trump supporter yelling at a Starbucks barista went viral last week, fans of the president-elect have started asking for their coffees under Trump’s name in retaliation, calling it a statement against political and \"anti-white discrimination.\"\nThe man in the video claimed that he was being racially discriminated against because his coffee took too long, then accused the barista of refusing to serve him because she knew he was a Trump supporter.\n>> Trump supporter blames slow Starbucks service on 'anti-white discrimination'\nBy Friday afternoon, the hashtag #TrumpCup had nearly 30,000 tweets, many of which were accompanied by pictures of Starbucks cups with “Trump” written on them.\nParticipants say the purpose of the movement is to force Starbucks employees to yell out Trump’s name when his supporters’ drinks are ready. They appear unconcerned that doing so requires them to give more money to the company they’re protesting.\nStarbucks issued the following response:\n“Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores. Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition.”",

      "text": "View All Posts \nStarbucks Corporation ( SBUX ) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee worldwide. The company initiated its dividend in 2010 and has been growing distributions rapidly since then. \nWhile the company has only managed to increase dividends for four years in a row, I believe that it has the potential to reach dividend achiever status, and has the growth story to become as successful for its dividend growth investors. \nThe most recent dividend increase was in November 2016, when the Board of Directors approved a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend to 25 cents per share. The company’s competitors include McDonald’s Corporation ( MCD ), Nestle SA (ADR) ( NSRGY ) and Dunkin Brands Group Inc ( DNKN ). \nSince the company initiated a dividend payment in 2010, the stock has returned 315%. Future investment returns will be dependent on growth in earnings and dividend yields obtained by shareholders, as well as the initial valuation locked in at the time of investment. \nStarbucks has managed to deliver a 17.80% average increase in annual EPS over the past decade. Starbucks is expected to earn $2.16 per share in 2017 and $2.48 per share in 2018. In comparison, the company earned $1.90 per share in 2016. \nStarbucks has a strong brand name , synonymous with quality, customer service and a unique atmosphere at its stores. The company also gains from benefits of scale as it expands its retail store footprint globally. Future growth for Starbucks will be delivered by expanding the number of stores globally. While the US market is close to being saturated in terms of store count, there is plenty of room for growth in countries like China, India, Brazil. \nThe company can also squeeze in more growth from existing US stores by adding drive-through windows and extending store hours. The international expansion can be aided by replicating the best practices of stores in the US and then replicating success abroad, one store at a time. \nThe benefits to scale relative to other coffee shops is adding to the company’s bottom line. \nIn addition, the strong brand and unique customer experience have translated into pricing power for Starbucks.",

      "text": "TrumpCup: Donald Trump supporters launch protest against Starbucks   7:02   \nAs a way of protesting against American coffee giant Starbucks, Donald Trump’s supporters are buying Starbucks products and asking the baristas to give them their products by announcing the US President-elect’s name. \nAs a ritual in Starbucks, customers give their names to the baristas while giving their order and when their order is ready, the servers shout out the names of the customers as an indication of their order being ready. Now, Trump supporters are asking the servers to announce their order by shouting out “Trump!” \nAccording to CNN, this protest against Starbucks was initiated after a viral video of a Trump supporter yelling at a barista in a Starbucks outlet gained traction on Wednesday. The Trump protesters view the message in the video as political and of anti-white discrimination. \nThe man in the video accused the barista of discriminating against him and said that she would not serve him because he was a Trump supporter, according to the Miami Herald. However, in the video, the man is heard using foul language and calls the barista “trash.”",

      "text": "Email \nDonald Trump supporters have started asking for their Starbucks drinks under Trump’s name as a movement against the coffee giant. \nAfter a viral video showing a Trump supporter yelling at a barista gained traction on Wednesday, other supporters have banded together to protest what they view as political and anti-white discrimination. \nThe man in the video told the Miami Herald that he was racially discriminated against and that the barista wouldn’t serve him because she knew he was a Trump supporter. \nThe hashtag #TrumpCup isn’t new, but blew up after a Twitter user posted instructions to followers Friday morning. The hashtag had more than 27,000 tweets as of Friday afternoon. \nThe protest is an attempt to make Starbucks baristas yell Trump’s name and write it on their coffee cups, as is the company’s regular practice. \nSome supporters claim to have been refused a #TrumpCup and see it as a breach of their rights. \nBut others find the protest counterintuitive, as the plan relies on giving Starbucks money in the first place. \nThis all comes after the controversy that plagued Starbucks last year as it introduced a plain red holiday cup that was markedly different from Christmas cups in the past. Joshua Feuerstein, a former pastor, called the new cups a “war on Christmas” in a video posted to Facebook. \nBut many social media users find the Starbucks protests old and tiresome. \nSome even call out the logic of the movement with a good-natured slight at Starbucks. \nStarbucks has responded to the protest by clarifying that it doesn’t require its partners to write or call out names. \n“Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores,” a Starbucks spokesperson said. “Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition.” Trump supporters launch #TrumpCup as a protest against Starbucks https://t.co/mSGihN2bIM pic.twitter.com/vB2uOb0d8J ",

      "text": "Close #TrumpCup campaign hits Starbucks, draws questions Don't be surprised if you hear 'Trump' shouted from behind the counter at your local Starbucks. USA TODAY Melanie Eversley, USA TODAY , WXIA 7:15 PM. EST November 19, 2016 Starbucks has 13 holiday red cups this year. (Photo: Starbucks) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nDonald Trump supporters are nudging Starbucks servers to announce the name of their candidate by ordering coffee under Trump's name. \nIt is a tradition at Starbucks that servers ask customers for their names, and when an order is ready, shout out those customers' names. Trump supporters are ordering food and drink and telling Starbucks employees their name is Trump, compelling servers to call them to the counter for their orders by shouting out \"Trump!\" \nThe campaign dubbed #TrumpCup on social media is the latest wave in what has been a contentious campaign and post-election cycle. Some media reports questioned whether the Starbucks effort was motivated by the fact that CEO Howard Schultz endorsed Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, for president. But creator Timothy Treadstone said the idea was actually a social experiment in First Amendment rights. \nTreadstone, a 29-year-old political consultant and social media strategist from Los Angeles, told USA TODAY that he was motivated to start the campaign after seeing video on social media in which a Trump supporter attempts to give his name as Trump at a Starbucks. The audio is muffled, but it appears as if the Starbucks employee is not responding to the repeated request and that the employee then asks a coworker to call the police. \nAfter seeing the video, Treadstone posted to his Twitter account, @bakedalaska, on Thursday night: \"Operation #TrumpCup 1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump 2) If they refuse take video Pls share & spread the word.\" \n\"This is not a protest; it's not a boycott,\" Treadstone said by telephone. \"This is a social experiment ... This is just something we’re doing to keep Starbucks accountable. We want to help out our economy, keep people accountable and have a little fun.\" \nTreadmill's comments were in part a response to questions that have emerged on social media in which members of the public asked about the effectiveness of a campaign that would bring more, not less, business to Starbucks. \nTwitter user @tarzdan_ wrote: \"So let me get this straight, you're going to protest against a company by giving them money?\" \nTweeted @CaptainsLog2016: \"I don't think Trumpkins have thought this whole #TrumpCup through. If you have to buy a product form the place you're boycotting... #FAIL.\" \nStarbucks released a statement regarding #TrumpCup: \"Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores. Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition. We don't require our partners to write or call out names.\" ",

      "text": "By Kayleigh Roberts Nov 20, 2016 Some Trump supporters are unhappy with Starbucks and they're letting the company know by...buying Starbucks. If that sounds counterintuitive, it's because it kind of is. According to CNN , customers are asking baristas to write Trump's name on their cups as a form of protest after an incident they interrupt as discrimination against the President-elect's supporters went viral. #trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy \n— jorge dc (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below On Friday morning, Twitter user @bakedalaska posted the instructions for \"Operation #TrumpCup,\" which went viral with more than 6,500 retweets and 10,000 likes. 1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump2) If they refuse take videoPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY \n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 Most Popular Some Trump supporters claim that they've been refused service while participating in #TrumpCup, but a lot of the response to the movement comes from skeptics. As they point out, usually when groups are dissatisfied with a company, they call for others not to shop there. But, in order to participate in #TrumpCup at all, you have to give Starbucks money. God it's so funny that people are going to Starbucks for #trumpcup in defiance and Starbucks is like \"Thanks for your $4.50 \" \n— Chris D'Elia (@chrisdelia) November 19, 2016 #TrumpCup - a protest against Starbucks by buying Starbucks. #BoycottHamilton - a protest against Hamilton by not buying sold out tickets. \n— Em Harriss (@EmHarriss) November 19, 2016 Instead of asking for a #TrumpCup just boycott #Starbucks . Companies ONLY get the message when it hurts their wallet$. \n—♥Pink Lady♥ (@pink_lady56) November 18, 2016 Ultimately, according to Starbucks, baristas aren't required to write customers names on cups or call them out when the order is ready. \"Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores,\" a Starbucks spokesperson said . \"Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition.\" Read Next:",

      "title": "The story behind that viral video of a man yelling 'Trump!' at a Florida Starbucks | News update, news roundup",
      "text": "A Florida real estate remodeler said he has been \"harassed by people all over the country\" since a video went viral showing him berating a Starbucks barista.\nHe was incensed, he said, that the woman refused to serve him because he's a white man who supports President-elect Donald Trump.\nA witness said the man simply got angry that his coffee order took too long.\nDavid Sanguesa told ABC affiliate WPLG that he and a colleague met Wednesday for coffee at a Starbucks in Coral Gables, near Miami. Sanguesa said he paid for a drink but claims the barista would not serve it to him. His colleague suggested that was because Sanguesa had a Trump sign on his vehicle.\nSanguesa said he viewed it as \"anti-white discrimination\" - then got upset and lashed out.\nThe barista was later asked whether she denied service to Sanguesa. \"No, I didn't,\" she responded, according to the Miami Herald.\nStarbucks said in a statement Friday to The Washington Post that \"embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing. We are committed to providing an inclusive, supportive and safe work environment for everyone.\"\nJorge de Cárdenas said in an interview with the Miami New Times that he was telecommuting Wednesday from a Starbucks near the University of Miami when a customer became impatient while waiting for his drink and began screaming that he had been denied service because of \"anti-white discrimination.\"\nAnother customer told Sanguesa he was an \"a--hole\" and Sanguesa said, \"F-- you, b---,\" Cárdenas told the New Times.\nCárdenas then grabbed his cellphone and started filming the scene.\nThe video does not capture the moments leading up to the confrontation. But it does show Sanguesa demanding a refund.\n\"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\"\n\"So what?\" she replied.\n\"Because I voted for Trump! Trump! You lost! Now give me my money back,\" Sanguesa said, moving toward the register. \"What is your name? I want your name. I want your card. You're garbage. You're complete trash.\"\nNo, the video was not staged. You cannot \"stage\" a sweater vest.\nAnother employee or a customer attempted to intervene.\n\"Don't talk like that to her,\" a man told him. \"You want to talk like that, take it outside. But don't talk to other people like that.\"\n\"Don't tell me what to do,\" Sanguesa replied. \"She did discrimination against whites.\"\nThe two men continued to argue and others chimed in.\nSanguesa quieted down for a moment, asking an employee whether he had heard how the barista had talked to him. \"No, I didn't see that; I missed it,\" the employee said. \"All I could hear was you.\"\n\"OK, fine!\" Sanguesa shouted. \"I'm going to punch you out.\"\n\"Want to step out?\" the employee said. \"Fine, I'll be happy to.\"\nSanguesa again demanded a refund. Then he walked toward the door, muttering that the situation was \"absolutely ridiculous.\"\nThe Miami Herald reported that Sanguesa has a criminal history: In 2008, he was charged twice - one week apart - with DUIs. In 2014, he was charged with domestic violence, though that charge was later dropped, the Herald reported.\nAnd for years, the Miami Herald said, Sanguesa has been emailing the newspaper \"with rants against Cubans, women, immigrants, gays and lesbians, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\"\nThe newspaper reported:\n- - -\nIn one email sent this month, he said Obama has caused 95 million people to lose their jobs by \"pushing a sick, left wing agenda of not working . . . living off the government . . . trying to get rid of Jesus Christ, abortion, homosexuality, lesbians, transgender . . . Hollywood trash . . . we are Miami destroyed . . . by people who hate the USA.\"\nFour days earlier he had sent an email about the coverage of the death of former Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez in a boating accident. \"I hate Cubans . . . all pieces of s- including Jose Fernandez.\"\nHe ended the email: \"Viva Fidel Castro!!\"\n- - -\nSanguesa told several news organizations that he has a mental illness, which he did not disclose, and that he had not taken his medication Wednesday - though he did not seem to blame the outburst on his condition.\n\"I had a bad day,\" he told the Herald on Thursday. \"I was wrong for screaming at her. I have since apologized.\"\nHe has been adamant that his rant was not racist but was simply a response to discrimination from the barista.\nIn an interview with the New Times, Sanguesa said he was discriminated against because he supports Trump and worked on the president-elect's campaign - and is white.\n\"I was racially discriminated against,\" Sanguesa told the New Times. \"This is bull---. I'm a business owner. I didn't deserve this. That woman refused to serve us coffee.\"\nSanguesa added that he was \"wrong for getting upset\" and that he had apologized to the barista, \"but I'm not going to respond anymore. This is out of control. I'm being harassed by people all over the country.\"\nSince Trump's election, a wave of racially and religiously motivated acts of intimidation, violence and harassment has swept the country.\nStudents at a Michigan middle school began chanting \"build the wall!\" during lunch on the day after Trump's election.\nA black student at Baylor said she was shoved by a white male while walking to class on the morning after the election. Her assailant, a fellow student, told her \"no n---s allowed on the sidewalk,\" she said - then echoed Trump's campaign slogan, declaring: \"I'm just trying to make America great again.\"\nDays later, a University of Michigan student was approached by a stranger who threatened to set her on fire if she didn't remove her hijab, campus police said.\nAt a high school in Pennsylvania, two students paraded through the hallways with a Trump sign as one student shouted, \"White power!\" - a moment that was captured on video.\nOn Saturday, an Episcopal church in Maryland was vandalized with a chilling message: \"Trump nation. Whites only.\"\nThe following morning, in central Indiana, the organist at an Episcopal church discovered a swastika, an anti-gay slur and \"HEIL TRUMP\" spray-painted on the outside walls.\nIn an interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes\" broadcast Sunday night, Trump said that he was \"so saddened to hear\" that people were harassing others in his name. \"And I say, 'Stop it,' \" the president-elect said. \"If it - if it helps, I will say this, and I will say it right to the cameras: 'Stop it.' \"\nThree days later, a Maryland high school student wearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat was injured and taken to the hospital after he scuffled with a group of anti-Trump protesters who punched and kicked him.\nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz - a longtime donor to Democratic candidates, according to Federal Election Commission filings - endorsed Clinton for president in September.\nSanguesa told the Herald that he was considering suing Starbucks for discrimination and for causing him to lose business over the incident.\n\"My attorneys want to file a lawsuit,\" he told the newspaper. \"No one saw the first part of the video. I was completely done wrong. I was racially discriminated against. I was refused service. I was wrong to get upset, but I was racially discriminated against.\"\n\"She wouldn't serve me,\" he added. \"She knew I was a Trump supporter and wouldn't give me my coffee.\"\nThe barista, identified by WPLG as Jennifer Santos, told the station that Sanguesa's claims were false.\n\"He must have been having a bad day,\" Santos said. \"I felt disrespected. Very disrespected. It was very insulting and very discriminating. Things happen.\"\nCárdenas, the man who filmed the incident, told the New Times that the outburst made no sense to him.\n\"The funny thing, besides just the concept of 'anti-white discrimination,' is just yelling 'Trump!' for no reason,\" he told the alt-weekly. \"Like, dude, you won.\"\n- - -\nThe story behind that viral video of a man yelling 'Trump!' at a Florida Starbucks 5:05pm]\n© 2016 Tampa Bay Times\n ",

      "text": "A North Carolina jury decided not to make Starbucks pay damages to a Raleigh, North Carolina, police officer who spilled a cup of the chain's coffee on his lap.\nLt. Matthew Kohr and his wife, Melanie Kohr, sued Starbucks for $750,000 to reimburse for medical expenses that included surgery to remove part of Kohr’s intestine. Kohr had third-degree burns after the lid of his to-go cup popped off and the paper cup reportedly collapsed.\nIn accordance with the coffee company’s policy, Kohr received around 50 cups of free coffee over the course of two months for being a police officer before he received a faulty cup. To accept the drinks, Kohr paid for the coffee in tips, which he was required to do per his department's policy.\nAccording to Kohr, who has Crohn's disease, the accident caused a massive flare-up. He was reportedly in and out of work and the hospital as a result of the burns. Kohr’s doctors also testified about the depression he suffered after the incident.\nA manager from the coffee shop stated that all hot beverages served in the company's Venti cups were supposed to be presented with a protective sleeve or a secondary cup. Although neither of those protective actions were taken in Kohr’s case, the jury concluded that the mistake was not enough to make Starbucks pay damages. \n“We are pleased with the jury's decision as we believe our [employees] did nothing wrong,” Starbucks wrote in an email to WRAL. “The safety of our customers and partners will continue to be our top priority.\"\nThe verdict was reached after both sides agreed that a decision could be made by a majority of the jurors rather than all, reports ABC News. \nSources:  ABC News ,  WRAL  / Photo credit:  WRAL \n",

      "text": "The Miami New Times reports on a man who yelled at a Starbucks employee because... well, nobody can figure out e xactly why, but it has something to do with Donald J Trump. Of course.\nAt around 4:30 p.m. on Thursday, Miami real-estate remodeler David Sanguesa claims that a Miami Starbucks employee said she would not serve him coffee because he voted for Trump. (The barista denied this claim, and here claims were corroborated by the man who filmed the interaction and uploaded it to Twitter.)\nIn retaliation, the white man started yelling at a black woman employee — calling her \"garbage\" and \"trash,\" and scream \"I voted for Trump! Trump! You lost, now give me my money back.\" When a patron stood up for the employee, Sanguesa threatens to fight him. Seriously.\n The whole thing was caught on Twitter by Jorge de Cárdenas and it's disturbing:\n#trump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks & threatens patrons & staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" pic.twitter.com/HRj9EahrMy\n— jorge dc (@Jbdcl) November 16, 2016\nCárdenas said that he was working at a nearby table when Sanguesa became impatient while waiting for his drink and began screaming that he had been denied service because of “anti-white discrimination.”\nAnother customer told Sanguesa he was an “a–hole” and Sanguesa said, “F— you, b—-,” Cárdenas told the New Times .\nUnsurprisingly, Sanguesa has a criminal history: In 2008, he was charged twice with DUIs, and he was was charged with domestic violence in 2014, though that charge was later dropped.\nAdditionally, the Miami Herald reported that Sanguesa has been emailing the newspaper for years “with rants against Cubans, women, immigrants, gays and lesbians, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.”\nStarbucks said in a statement to The Washington Post that “embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing. We are committed to providing an inclusive, supportive and safe work environment for everyone.\"\nFollow Laura on Twitter .\n ",

      "text": "— John Wylie (@johnwylie) Fri, Nov 13 2015 03:15:47 While Starbucks maintained that the inspiration behind the minimalist 2015 holiday cup design was to encourage customers to draw their own designs on the cups , the controversy gave the company new leverage that would come into play during the next holiday season. As a way to foreshadow the company's response to the controversy while considering future cup designs, CEO Howard Schultz simply noted \"I wonder what color they will be this year?\" after being addressed during the 2016 Annual Shareholder's Meeting in Seattle, WA. In 2016, as we found ourselves amidst a hugely controversial election, no one would have guessed that the Red Cup Controversy would live on and take on a political voice during elections. This year, during the first two weeks of the Starbucks holiday season surrounding Election Day 2016 , Starbucks would reveal this design to their customers. People getting mad about this really and truly need to sort out their priorities. This is not a war on Christmas or a political statement (but we can make it one). It's a war on hate and a message we all could use. Well, actually, it's a coffee cup. #strongertogether #imwithher #starbucks #greencup #lovetrumpshate",

Some critics of the #TrumpCup movement have pointed out that its a bit weird to protest against Starbucks by buying more Starbucks. \nHowever, Tim Treadstone  one of the movements founders who goes by the name @bakedalaska on Twitter  said this is not a protest but, rather, a statement of support for the President-elect.

      "text": "November 21 at 6:00 It’s customary for some Starbucks baristas to write the names of customers on cups and shout their names once their orders are ready.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s supporters seemed to have seized on that tradition, as they have started telling Starbucks employees that their name is Trump, prompting baristas to shout out “Trump!”\nMany took selfies with their cups with the president-elect’s name on them and posted the pictures to social media with the hashtag #TrumpCup. It is the latest in a social media war between Trump supporters and the anti-Trump crowd.\nAs the hashtag gains traction on Facebook and Twitter, so did #boycottHamilton, which was the Internet’s response to the Broadway musical cast’s decision to address Vice President-elect Mike Pence after one of its shows .\n#TrumpCup’s creator, Tim Treadstone, a social media strategist and political consultant from Los Angeles, told The Washington Post that he started the campaign after watching a video of a Starbucks barista who refused to write Trump’s name on a customer’s coffee cup.\n[ ‘I will fall on the sword & take your tickets’: Calls to #BoycottHamilton met with mockery ]\nOn Friday, Treadstone, who goes by @bakedalaska on Twitter, tweeted “Operation #TrumpCup” followed by a two-step instruction urging his more-than 120,000 followers to go to a Starbucks store, tell baristas that their name is Trump and take a video if employees refuse to write the name.\nOperation #TrumpCup\n1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump\n2) If they refuse take video\nPls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY\n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016\nTreadstone called it a First Amendment exercise.\n“We have a culture war to win. I’m a Trump supporter. I thought when Trump won, I might just wake up and America would be great again. Guess what, it wasn’t,” Treadstone said. “We have a lot of work to do. We have hearts and minds to win. Obviously, a lot of people aren’t happy with us, and we need to stand up for our freedom and our First Amendment.”\nCritics have taken to Twitter to question, with some humor, the logic behind the campaign.\nGod it's so funny that people are going to Starbucks for #trumpcup in defiance and Starbucks is like \"Thanks for your $4.50 \"\n— Chris D'Elia (@chrisdelia) November 19, 2016\nSo let me get this straight, you're going to protest against a company by giving them money? #TrumpCup\n— Da5n (@tarzdan_) November 18, 2016\nIf all the Trumpsters use the same name at Starbucks they'll get their orders mixed up. They did not think this through #TrumpCup\n— Seth Pajak Ⓥ (@SethP23) November 18, 2016\nTreadstone said that calling the campaign a “protest” is a mischaracterization of what he’s trying to do.\n“This was never meant to be a boycott. I love Starbucks. I have no intention to stray any business from Starbucks at all,” he said, adding that he encouraged his Twitter followers to give baristas an extra tip if they were enthusiastic about writing Trump’s name on the cups.\nIn response to #TrumpCup, Starbucks released a statement saying that writing customers’ names on cups has been a “fun ritual” at its stores, according to media reports.\n“Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition,” the coffee giant said. “We don’t require our partners to write or call out names.”\nTreadstone said he recognizes the frustration from the coffee giant’s statement.\n“We did troll them, let’s be honest,” he said. “If you’re so afraid to write your president’s name on a coffee cup, that is sad, that’s insane.”\nThis isn’t the first time that Starbucks, whose chief executive, Howard Schultz, endorsed Hillary Clinton, has been involved in a controversy with Trump supporters. Campaign records also show that the company contributed $65,741 to Clinton this past election cycle . About $1,400 went to Trump.\n[ ‘I voted for Trump! You lost!’: White Starbucks customer accuses barista of ‘discrimination’ ]\nLast week, a video showing a Florida man berating a Starbucks barista went viral. David Sanguesa, a real estate remodeler, told ABC affiliate WPLG that the barista refused to serve him even though he already paid because he’s a white man and a Trump supporter.\n“Because I voted Trump! Trump! You lost! Now give me my money back,” Sanguesa said, moving toward the register. “What is your name? I want your name. I want your card. You’re garbage. You’re complete trash.”\nIn a statement about that incident, Starbucks said that “embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing.”\nLast year, Starbucks came under fire for introducing a plain red holiday cup instead of the traditional Christmas cups. Last November, Trump, then a Republican presidential candidate, suggested boycotting Starbucks and said that if he won, “we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again.”\nREAD MORE:\nWhat\n New York a ‘refuge’ for minorities, immigrants",

      "text": "Trump supporters take aim at Starbucks with #TrumpCup protest \nby: Carlin Becker, Rare.us Updated: Nov 20, 2016 - 3:33 AM Via @bakedalaska / Twitter \nAfter a video of a Donald Trump supporter yelling at a Starbucks barista went viral last week, fans of the president-elect have started asking for their coffees under Trump’s name in retaliation, calling it a statement against political and \"anti-white discrimination.\" \nThe man in the video claimed that he was being racially discriminated against because his coffee took too long, then accused the barista of refusing to serve him because she knew he was a Trump supporter. \nBy Friday afternoon, the hashtag #TrumpCup had nearly 30,000 tweets, many of which were accompanied by pictures of Starbucks cups with “Trump” written on them. \n1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump 2) If they refuse take video Pls share & spread the word pic.twitter.com/huPj4g6cqY — Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 18, 2016 \nMy baristas in Virginia Beach love me. I don't even ask them to write Trump, & they do it. #TrumpCup pic.twitter.com/J2Owg8FTCD — Scott Presler VA (@ScottPresler) November 18, 2016 \n\nIf we want Trump written on our cups don't call the cops! Feel free to boycott Starbucks after this. Even Kanye wants to #MAGA ! #TrumpCup pic.twitter.com/YyFv96dhz0 — Irma Hinojosa 🇺🇸 (@latinaafortrump) November 18, 2016 \n\n\nParticipants say the purpose of the movement is to force Starbucks employees to yell out Trump’s name when his supporters’ drinks are ready. They appear unconcerned that doing so requires them to give more money to the company they’re protesting. \n>> Read more trending stories \n#TrumpCup - a protest against Starbucks by buying Starbucks. #BoycottHamilton - a protest against Hamilton by not buying sold out tickets. — Em Harriss (@EmHarriss) November 19, 2016 \n— Bae Grylls (@TheAuracl3) November 18, 2016 \n",

The “movement” was inspired by a racist Trump voter who threw a fit in a Starbucks earlier this week when he accused Starbucks of engaging in “anti-white discrimination” because he did not get his coffee as fast as he wanted, reports Brad Reed of Raw Story .\nNow Trump fans are posting their #TrumpCups on Twitter in what they believe is an act of rebellion against Starbucks, but what is actually giving the company more of their money.\nView image on Twitter",

      "text": "A Florida real estate remodeler said he has been \"harassed by people all over the country\" since a video went viral showing him berating a Starbucks barista. He was incensed, he said, that the woman refused to serve him because he's a white man who supports President-elect Donald Trump.\nA witness said the man simply got angry that his coffee order took too long.\nDavid Sanguesa told ABC affiliate WPLG that he and a colleague met Wednesday for coffee at a Starbucks in Coral Gables, near Miami. Sanguesa said he paid for a drink but claims the barista would not serve it to him. His colleague suggested that was because Sanguesa had a Trump sign on his vehicle.\nSanguesa said he viewed it as \"anti-white discrimination\" - then got upset and lashed out.\nThe barista was later asked whether she denied service to Sanguesa. \"No, I didn't,\" she responded, according to the Miami Herald.\nStarbucks said in a statement Friday to The Washington Post that \"embracing diversity and treating each other with respect and dignity is core to Starbucks values and something our partners take great pride in showing. We are committed to providing an inclusive, supportive and safe work environment for everyone.\"\nJorge de Cárdenas said in an interview with the Miami New Times that he was telecommuting Wednesday from a Starbucks near the University of Miami when a customer became impatient while waiting for his drink and began screaming that he had been denied service because of \"anti-white discrimination.\"\nAnother customer told Sanguesa he was an \"a—hole\" and Sanguesa said, \"F—you, b---,\" Cárdenas told the New Times.\nCárdenas then grabbed his cellphone and started filming the scene.\nThe video does not capture the moments leading up to the confrontation. But it does show Sanguesa demanding a refund.\n\"We want nothing to do with you,\" he told the barista, who appears to be a person of color. \"You're trash.\"\n\"So what?\" she replied.\n\"Because I voted for Trump! Trump! You lost! Now give me my money back,\" Sanguesa said, moving toward the register. \"What is your name? I want your name. I want your card. You're garbage. You're complete trash.\"\nNo, the video was not staged. You cannot \"stage\" a sweater vest.\nAnother employee or a customer attempted to intervene.\n\"Don't talk like that to her,\" a man told him. \"You want to talk like that, take it outside. But don't talk to other people like that.\"\n\"Don't tell me what to do,\" Sanguesa replied. \"She did discrimination against whites.\"\nThe two men continued to argue and others chimed in.\nSanguesa quieted down for a moment, asking an employee whether he had heard how the barista had talked to him. \"No, I didn't see that; I missed it,\" the employee said. \"All I could hear was you.\"\n\"OK, fine!\" Sanguesa shouted. \"I'm going to punch you out.\"\n\"Want to step out?\" the employee said. \"Fine, I'll be happy to.\"\nSanguesa again demanded a refund. Then he walked toward the door, muttering that the situation was \"absolutely ridiculous.\"\nThe Miami Herald reported that Sanguesa has a criminal history: In 2008, he was charged twice - one week apart - with DUIs. In 2014, he was charged with domestic violence, though that charge was later dropped, the Herald reported.\nAnd for years, the Miami Herald said, Sanguesa has been emailing the newspaper \"with rants against Cubans, women, immigrants, gays and lesbians, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\"\nThe newspaper reported:\nIn one email sent this month, he said Obama has caused 95 million people to lose their jobs by \"pushing a sick, left wing agenda of not working . . . living off the government . . . trying to get rid of Jesus Christ, abortion, homosexuality, lesbians, transgender . . . Hollywood trash . . . we are Miami destroyed . . . by people who hate the USA.\"\nFour days earlier he had sent an email about the coverage of the death of former Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez in a boating accident. \"I hate Cubans . . . all pieces of s- including Jose Fernandez.\"\nHe ended the email: \"Viva Fidel Castro!!\"\nSanguesa told several news organizations that he has a mental illness, which he did not disclose, and that he had not taken his medication Wednesday - though he did not seem to blame the outburst on his condition.\n\"I had a bad day,\" he told the Herald on Thursday. \"I was wrong for screaming at her. I have since apologized.\"\nHe has been adamant that his rant was not racist but was simply a response to discrimination from the barista.\nIn an interview with the New Times, Sanguesa said he was discriminated against because he supports Trump and worked on the president-elect's campaign - and is white.\n\"I was racially discriminated against,\" Sanguesa told the New Times. \"This is bull---. I'm a business owner. I didn't deserve this. That woman refused to serve us coffee.\"\nSanguesa added that he was \"wrong for getting upset\" and that he had apologized to the barista, \"but I'm not going to respond anymore. This is out of control. I'm being harassed by people all over the country.\"\nSince Trump's election, a wave of racially and religiously motivated acts of intimidation, violence and harassment has swept the country.\nStudents at a Michigan middle school began chanting \"build the wall!\" during lunch on the day after Trump's election.\nA black student at Baylor said she was shoved by a white male while walking to class on the morning after the election. Her assailant, a fellow student, told her \"no n---s allowed on the sidewalk,\" she said - then echoed Trump's campaign slogan, declaring: \"I'm just trying to make America great again.\"\nDays later, a University of Michigan student was approached by a stranger who threatened to set her on fire if she didn't remove her hijab, campus police said.\nAt a high school in Pennsylvania, two students paraded through the hallways with a Trump sign as one student shouted, \"White power!\" - a moment that was captured on video.\nOn Saturday, an Episcopal church in Maryland was vandalized with a chilling message: \"Trump nation. Whites only.\"\nThe following morning, in central Indiana, the organist at an Episcopal church discovered a swastika, an anti-gay slur and \"HEIL TRUMP\" spray-painted on the outside walls.\nIn an interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes\" broadcast Sunday night, Trump said that he was \"so saddened to hear\" that people were harassing others in his name. \"And I say, 'Stop it,' \" the president-elect said. \"If it - if it helps, I will say this, and I will say it right to the cameras: 'Stop it.' \"\nThree days later, a Maryland high school student wearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat was injured and taken to the hospital after he scuffled with a group of anti-Trump protesters who punched and kicked him.\nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz - a longtime donor to Democratic candidates, according to Federal Election Commission filings - endorsed Clinton for president in September.\nSanguesa told the Herald that he was considering suing Starbucks for discrimination and for causing him to lose business over the incident.\n\"My attorneys want to file a lawsuit,\" he told the newspaper. \"No one saw the first part of the video. I was completely done wrong. I was racially discriminated against. I was refused service. I was wrong to get upset, but I was racially discriminated against.\"\n\"She wouldn't serve me,\" he added. \"She knew I was a Trump supporter and wouldn't give me my coffee.\"\nThe barista, identified by WPLG as Jennifer Santos, told the station that Sanguesa's claims were false.\n\"He must have been having a bad day,\" Santos said. \"I felt disrespected. Very disrespected. It was very insulting and very discriminating. Things happen.\"\nCárdenas, the man who filmed the incident, told the New Times that the outburst made no sense to him.\n\"The funny thing, besides just the concept of 'anti-white discrimination,' is just yelling 'Trump!' for no reason,\" he told the alt-weekly. \"Like, dude, you won.\"",

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock \n\nEquity markets seem as though they normalized after the massive post-election rally of the last two weeks. The markets were indicated up marginally on Monday morning ahead of the shortened work week. Investors are looking for new ideas to generate gains or income. It has been proven now for over five years that investors will buy selloffs and market dips.\n24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning of the week to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, and other analyst calls cover stocks to sell or stocks to avoid.\nThe headwinds that should have mattered just haven’t really mattered — rising bond yields, coming Fed rate hikes, high valuations, and a huge political upset. This bull market is now also closer to 8 years old than 7 years old.\nSome of the key stocks that have been considered beneficiaries of the election have risen 15% to 20% in the last 10 days. That is not normal at all and it might mean that more selective selling or profit-taking can be seen. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen from this Monday morning:\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co. (NYSE: ANF) was downgraded to Underperform from Sector Perform and the price target was cut to $12 from $20 (versus $14.60 close on Friday, after a 13% drop) at RBC Capital Markets. Abercrombie & Fitch has a 52-week range of $14.00 to $32.83 and it has a consensus analyst price target of $18.41.\nKBR, Inc. (NYSE: KBR) was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $21 price target (versus $16.25 close) at MKM Partners. KBR was recently pointed out among the many Trump infrastructure stock winners as well. KR has a 52-week range of $11.61 to $19.94 and it has a consensus analyst price target of $18.15.\n3M Co. (NYSE: MMM) was downgraded to Sell from Neutral with a $159 price target (versus $172.96 close) at Goldman Sachs. 3M shares were indicated down 1.2% at $170.90 on Monday, versus a 52-week range of $134.64 to $182.27 and it has a consensus analyst price target of $179.20.\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) was started with a Buy rating and was assigned a $145 price target (versus $115.21 close) at Brean Capital. Netflix has a 52-week range of $79.95 to $133.27 and it has a consensus analyst price target of $123.13.\nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) was started as Neutral at Buckingham Research. Starbucks closed at $55.77, with a 52-week range of $50.84 to $63.19 and has a consensus analyst price target of $64.54.\nYou can follow @ Jonogg on Twitter if you want the daily analyst calls and research updates directly on your Twitter feed.\nOther key analyst upgrades and downgrades seen on Monday were in shares of the following companies:\nAon Corp. (NYSE: AON) was raised to Outperform from Market Perform with a $130 price target (versus $111.96 close) at Keefe Bruyette & Woods.\nCirrus Logic Inc. (NASDAQ: CRUS) was started with a Hold rating and was assigned a $60 price target (versus $57.79 close) at Craig-Hallum.\nFinish Line Inc. (NASDAQ: FINL) was downgraded to Neutral from Positive with a $23 price target (versus $23.67 close) at Susquehanna Financial.\nGreif Inc. (NYSE: GEF) was downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform at Wells Fargo. Greif was downgraded from Neutral to Underperform at D.A. Davidson & Company.\nHeadwaters Inc. (NYSE: HW) is being acquired by Boral in Australia for $24.25 per share in cash. It was downgraded to Hold from Buy with a $23.50 price target (versus $20.09 close) at Canaccord Genuity. Wedbush also has a Neutral rating and says to take the cash at $24.25 per share in its offer.\nHSBC Holdings PLC (NYSE: HSBC) was raised to Market Perform from Underperform at Bernstein. HSBC closed down 0.7% at $39.02 on Friday and its ADSs have a 52-week trading range of $28.62 to $40.74.\nInvestment Technology Group (NYSE: ITG) was started as Outperform and was assigned a $20 price target (versus $19.43 close) at Credit Suisse.\nMelco Crown Entertainment Limited (NASDAQ: MPEL) was raised to Outperform from Neutral at Credit Suisse.\nSymentec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC) has emerged as the winner in the buyout rumors regarding LifeLock. Oppenheimer reiterated its Outperform rating and $28 price target in a flash research note, noting that Symantec is reinvigorating its consumer division.\nTata Motors (NYSE: TTM) was raised to Outperform from Market Perform at Bernstein.\nFriday’s top analyst upgrades and downgrades were in shares of AmEx, Citigroup, First Solar, Gap, HP Enterprise, UPS, Wells Fargo and over a dozen more companies.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "text": "TWEET So much for those green Starbucks \"unity\" cups . Thirsty Donald Trump supporters flocked to Starbucks on Friday to order drinks under the name \"Trump,\" making it so that baristas had to yell out his name when the drink was ready. The motive: catching Starbucks employees denying Trump supporters service at the ubiquitous coffee shop. \nWhat allegedly ignited the fire: A video that went viral Wednesday of a man in Miami blaming slow service on the fact that employees knew he voted for Trump. \ntrump supporter in #miami @Starbucks attacks &amp; threatens patrons &amp; staff bc coffee took too long, blames anti-white \"discrimination\" https://t.co/HRj9EahrMy While #TrumpCup was already in existence, a recent call-to-action allegedly brought attention to the hashtag. Early Friday morning, Twitter user @bakedalaska posted instructions for \"Operation #TrumpCup,\" telling followers to order drinks with the name \"Trump\" and document if the barista refused. Over 3,600 people retweeted @bakedalaska's tweet as of Friday afternoon. \nOperation #TrumpCup 1) Go to Starbucks &amp; tell them your name is Trump 2) If they refuse take video Pls share &amp; spread the word https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxhZSc0WQAAbPbj.jpg:large The people of the internet went off and tried to order the #TrumpCup, with varying levels of success. \nTold barista to write \"Trump\", got this instead. I'm gonna boycott Starbucks &amp; go back every day &amp; try this again til they stop! #TrumpCup https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxjUKdnWIAAdFbd.jpg:large \nStarbucks employee refuses to write Trump on this mans cup and even calls the police. #TrumpCup https://t.co/2VnSiyjyzs \nIf we want Trump written on our cups don't call the cops! Feel free to boycott Starbucks after this. Even Kanye wants to #MAGA! #TrumpCup https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cxjx6AwUQAAxBOh.jpg:large The #TrumpCup campaign is a \"statement,\" not a protest, Baked Alaska tweeted around 3 p.m. Friday. In a Periscope video , he complained about Twitter banning alt-right accounts and said #TrumpCup was about winning a \"culture war.\" Others on Twitter pointed out the \"statement\" was illogical because Trump supporters were giving Starbucks, a company whose CEO endorsed Hillary Clinton in September, their business. \nBuying Starbucks drinks to 'protest' the company checks out about as well as electing a billionaire to represent the working class \nWhy even go to Starbucks? Stop giving them your business! #TrumpCup \nTfw you want to protest but you are a thirsty boy whom needs his Java Chip Frappuccino with whipped cream https://t.co/fuRqGI1dKt https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxkS4PQUsAAMu76.jpg:large \nThey cry over #TrumpCup while we cry over racism, sexism, and bigotry. Must be nice to cry over something so meaningless. #WhitePrivilege But is the customer always right when it comes to their Starbucks order? Actually, Starbucks does not require baristas to write names and call them out, Starbucks told Business Insider . \"Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores,\" Starbucks said in a statement to Business Insider . \"Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition.\" If Trump supporters caused Starbucks to abolish the time-honored tradition of Starbucks baristas misspelling our names , now that'd be a real national tragedy.

      "text": "#TrumpCup campaign hits Starbucks, draws questions Lawyers answer questions about the legality behind some baristas refusing to write Trump on a Starbucks cup. Melanie Eversley, USA TODAY , WXIA 10:33 AM. EST November 21, 2016 Starbucks has 13 holiday red cups this year. (Photo: Starbucks) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nDonald Trump supporters are nudging Starbucks servers to announce the name of their candidate by ordering coffee under Trump's name. \nIt is a tradition at Starbucks that servers ask customers for their names, and when an order is ready, shout out those customers' names. Trump supporters are ordering food and drink and telling Starbucks employees their name is Trump, compelling servers to call them to the counter for their orders by shouting out \"Trump!\" \nThe campaign dubbed #TrumpCup on social media is the latest wave in what has been a contentious campaign and post-election cycle. Some media reports questioned whether the Starbucks effort was motivated by the fact that CEO Howard Schultz endorsed Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, for president. But creator Timothy Treadstone said the idea was actually a social experiment in First Amendment rights. \nTreadstone, a 29-year-old political consultant and social media strategist from Los Angeles, told USA TODAY that he was motivated to start the campaign after seeing video on social media in which a Trump supporter attempts to give his name as Trump at a Starbucks. The audio is muffled, but it appears as if the Starbucks employee is not responding to the repeated request and that the employee then asks a coworker to call the police. \nAfter seeing the video, Treadstone posted to his Twitter account, @bakedalaska, on Thursday night: \"Operation #TrumpCup 1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump 2) If they refuse take video Pls share & spread the word.\" \n\"This is not a protest; it's not a boycott,\" Treadstone said by telephone. \"This is a social experiment ... This is just something we’re doing to keep Starbucks accountable. We want to help out our economy, keep people accountable and have a little fun.\" \nTreadmill's comments were in part a response to questions that have emerged on social media in which members of the public asked about the effectiveness of a campaign that would bring more, not less, business to Starbucks. \nTwitter user @tarzdan_ wrote: \"So let me get this straight, you're going to protest against a company by giving them money?\" \nTweeted @CaptainsLog2016: \"I don't think Trumpkins have thought this whole #TrumpCup through. If you have to buy a product form the place you're boycotting... #FAIL.\" \nStarbucks released a statement regarding #TrumpCup: \"Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores. Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition. We don't require our partners to write or call out names.\"",

      "text": "Instagram Downloads \nFifty cities and states. Fifty unique perspectives. The Starbucks® Local Collection is a celebration of U.S. places – from the palm trees of Waikiki to the shores of Cape Cod. \nWhen designing mugs for Starbucks Local Collection, in-house artists chose locations where they had a heartfelt connection. Each ceramic travel mug celebrates a hometown or favorite place to visit. Hidden Gems in Dallas \nStarbucks designer Jordan Kay grew up loving John Wayne western films, and was inspired by vintage cowboy boots for the Dallas Double Wall Travele r. She elevated the boots to art with quirky patterns and details that include the city’s skyscrapers, blooming azaleas, the Ferris wheel at Fair Park and even tacos. “There are so many hidden references to the city buried amongst these boots,” Kay said. \"It’s the mystery and hidden landmarks and different flavors of the city that I find really interesting.” \nCalifornia Cool \nDesigner Trista Sydloski-Tesch, who was inspired by friends in California, used softer, pastel tones to capture the atmospheric colors of the coast. The Los Angeles Double Wall Traveler features a closeup of a girl's face, with mirror lenses in her blue-frame sunglasses, sipping a Starbucks beverage. “It’s a bit of a tongue-in-cheek nod to Cali lifestyle but captured with a fashion approach in the illustration style – it’s an image I can fully relate to,” Sydloski-Tesch said. “The coolest part is I really wanted a special type effect on it mimicking real sunglasses – her aviators reflect palm trees and L.A. signage.” \nAlong for the Ride \nFor designer Nina Painter, designing the Seattle Double Wall Traveler was a chance to revisit a childhood memory. “Growing up in Seattle, the ferries have always held a place in my heart. I have such good memories of taking a ferry,” Painter said. “I love standing on the deck with my dog and a warm cup of coffee, of course, and seeing a new view of our city.” Her design features an iconic Washington ferry boat that transports people, cars and even the Painter’s dog, Beau, across the blue water. Local Ornament Collection \nThis holiday, Starbucks is also offering a Local Ornament Collectio n, with red holiday cup ornaments from all 50 U.S. states. Customers in the United States can shop and ship within the U.S. at store.starbucks.com . \nFor more information on this news release, contact Related News",

      "text": "Advertisement \nThe last sip of your gingerbread spice latte will never be lukewarm again. \nThe Internet-connected Ember mug is designed to precisely control the temperature of the liquid inside. Inc . wrote about the futuristic mug and and its inventor, Clay Alexander, back in April. Alexander wants to revolutionize the way people eat their food, letting them monitor their intake while keeping their food at a constant temperature. \nThe mug is the company's flagship product, and it launches Monday with a somewhat surprising distributor: Starbucks. Ember is one of the first third-party tech companies to sell products in the coffee company's stores. The mug will be available at 100 Starbucks throughout the U.S., as well as on the Ember's site. \nStarbucks , Alexander says, has pretty strict testing standards in place: Before the company signed off, it ran the mugs through months of safety inspections as well as taste tests to make sure the mug didn't change the flavor of its coffee. \nCreating a temperature-controlling mug is not as straightforward as it might sound. Alexander first filed the patent for the mug in 2010 and spent years refining the design and technology. It works by letting you set the desired temperature, then uses a series of sensors and heating rings to warm the liquid or waxy heat-absorbing substance in the walls to cool it. The temperature can be set between 120 and 150 degrees--Alexander says most people's preferences fall near the middle of that range--by rotating a dial on the bottom. \nAmmunition Group, the designers behind Beats by Dre, helped create the minimalist aesthetic, which includes no buttons and completely hides the LED display when the temperature isn't being adjusted. \n\"No one wants to feel like they're drinking their coffee from a piece of technology,\" Alexander says. Ember hired engineers from Amazon and Nokia to build the hardware inside, which they had to continually shrink down so the mug wouldn't be any bulkier than a standard insulated mug. \nFor not looking like a piece of technology, the mug sure has a high-tech price: $150. \nEmber has $8 million in funding from business moguls and celebrities including StubHub CEO Scott Cutler, RocNation CEO Jay Brown, the NFL's Ndamukong Suh, Demi Lovato, and two-thirds of the Brothers Jonas (Joe and Nick, if these kinds of things concern you). \nAlexander says this is just the beginning. While the problem the coffee mug solves might not seem necessarily urgent, he says the technology can be applied in other, useful ways. Ember has also created a working prototype of a baby bottle that brings milk or formula to body temperature. The bottle itself contains no electronics--instead, it rests on a warming station that alerts the parent when it's ready and tracks the infant's intake to fractions of an ounce. \nAlexander's several-year road map for the company includes plates that keep foods at desired temperatures. Sensors and temperature controllers within the plate can, for example, keep steak on one part of the plate warm while keeping potato salad on another portion cool. The entrepreneur plans to try to crack into the restaurant industry first and then market to the general consumer. \nAnd further down the line: steins that keep your beer consistently cold. Alexander has already received patents for all these ideas, so it's probably just a matter of time before warm beer is a thing of the past, too. Bottoms up.  ",

It'll cost you a bit more.\nThe company told CNBC that on Nov. 10 select cold beverages and bakery items saw a price increase of between 10 cents and 30 cents. \n\"We expect the average customer ticket to increase by about 0.5 percent as a result of these beverage adjustments,\" a Starbucks spokeswoman told CNBC. \"Approximately 90 percent of beverages have not changed price. For example hot brewed coffee, espresso, tea or prepared items were not impacted.\" \nTwitter users have taken to the social media platform to complain about increased prices for their favorite drinks. \nTweet 1 \nTweet 2 \nTweet 3 \nThis isn't the first price hike of the year. The company bumped the cost of its beverages by as much as 30 cents back in July. \n\"We continually evaluate pricing on a product-by-product and market-by-market basis in our stores in order to balance our business needs while continuing to provide value to our loyal customers and to attract new customers,\" Starbucks said.",

      "text": "Starbucks Is Selling a $150 Smart Mug That Lets You Control the Temperature of Your Coffee Device is already buzzy By Christopher Heine November 21, 2016, 1:51 PM EST The main question is: Will people feel like they need the technology? Ember Mug Watch out, folks, your coffee may soon be getting hacked—in a good way. A hundred Starbucks stores are selling smart coffee mugs made by Ember. The internet-connected mug lets users adjust the temperature of the liquid inside via the brand's smartphone app. The device has been in the making for several months, but it's going to be fascinating to see whether it takes off. The Ember mug costs $150, which is more than the $140 Snap Inc. is charging for its video-recording sunglasses, Spectacles. Starbucks is the exclusive distributor of the mug. So, if there is a precise temperature you prefer your beverages to be, this technology may be your solution. It can rapidly cool your coffee to a Farenheit degree and then hold the temperature right there for as long as the mug is powered. Ember has an interesting list of investors, including Demi Lovato, Nick Jonas and Ndamukong Suh. Lovato posted the above picture on Instagram before the weekend, and the image has garnered more than 900,000 likes. A photo posted by Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) on Nov 16, 2016 at 11:57am PST Here's an online ad for the product: Get the Technology Today newsletter: \nCheck out our other newsletters: Daily Digest",

      "text": "This year's holiday food line up at Starbucks brings back a number of favorites like the Cranberry Bliss Bar but also sees some new faces, including the All the Trimming Breakfast Sandwich, which lists maple-glazed ham and apple-sage stuffing among its ingredients.\n\nHere's a list of limited-time edibles you can find at Starbucks stores in the US and Canada for the 2016 holiday season:\n\n- New All the Trimmings Breakfast Sandwich - Maple-glazed ham, an apple sausage patty, apple-sage stuffing, and savory maple glaze on a buttery bun. It's only available in Seattle, Florida, and select stores in California.\n\n- New Carved Ham, Egg, and Swiss Breakfast Sandwich - Carved maple-glazed ham, Swiss cheese and egg on a croissant bun. The sandwich is available across the U.S. and Canada with the exception of Seattle, Florida, and select stores in California (basically stores will only have one or the other).\n\n- Cranberry Bliss Bar - A blondie bar with cream cheese icing, dried cranberries, and a sweet drizzle tinged with orange zest (you can find my review of it here ).\n\n- Frosted Snowman Cookie ( my review ) - A snowman-shaped shortbread cookie topped with white chocolate icing and decorated to look the part.\n\n- Holiday Ugly Sweater Cookie - A soft, chewy gingerbread man cookie decorated in icing with a ugly holiday sweater.\n\n- Gingerbread Loaf - Spice cake with candied ginger sugar, topped with vanilla icing.\n\n- Peppermint Brownie Cake Pop ( review ) - A sphere of peppermint chocolate cake mixed with buttercream and  candy cane pieces, dipped in white chocolate and sprinkled with candy cane bits.\n\n- Snowman Cake Pop - Vanilla cake and icing, dipped in a white chocolaty coating with a friendly snowman face.\n\n- Holiday Turkey and Stuffing Panini ( review ) - Sliced turkey breast, cranberry-herb stuffing, and turkey gravy toasted on focaccia bread.\n\nPhotos via Starbucks.

      "text": "What your favorite holiday Starbucks drink says about your personality The holidays are here, and that means, of course, it’s Starbucks holiday drinks season. We wait all year for that wonderful taste of wintertime. This year, Starbucks even added iced holidays drinks , which sound delicious. Luckily, we have over a month to try all of the delicious concoctions. We can’t wait. Of course, everyone has a favorite Starbucks holiday special. From the all-time classic, the pumpkin spice latte to some of the newer concoctions, like the eggnog frappuccino, we think that our Starbucks orders say a lot about our personalities . We’ve broken down what your favorite coffee-based holiday drink says about your personality.\nPumpkin Spice Latte A photo posted by Barrie Bohemia (@bohemiabarrie) on Nov 21, 2016 at 6:18am PST \nPumpkin spice latte drinkers started as trendsetters, and now they’re loyal customers. Pumpkin spice lovers started in the fast lane, jumping onto every trend, but now you’re comfortable with where you are. You’re confident in yourself, and that’s pretty awesome.\nPeppermint Mocha A photo posted by Jess (@j.ess.edge) on Nov 21, 2016 at 11:26am PST \nPeppermint adds a fresh, holiday flavor to your mocha, and you love that the minty taste accentuates your fresh, unique outlook on life. You keep your ear to the ground, and are always first to hear about a new great restaurant or a great new app you need right now. Your friends rely on your good taste and forward focus, and you need your daily peppermint fix to get through your day.\nGingerbread Latte A photo posted by Bath SU (@bathsu) on Nov 21, 2016 at 2:54am PST \nGingerbread evokes a lot of wonderful holiday images — gingerbread men, gingerbread houses, gingerbread ornaments. It’s the sense of fun that draws you to the delicious, gingery latte. You live your life constantly in search of fun. You try to make the office fun. You have so many exciting commitments each weekend, you barely have time to relax. Your bright, bubbly sense of fun is exactly what makes you a fan of gingerbread.\nCaramel Brulée Latte A photo posted by Sarah Dawn (@sarahdawn.xo) on Nov 8, 2016 at 6:21pm PST \nYou consider yourself smooth as caramel, so that’s why you love to drink a caramel brulée latte as your holiday drink of choice. You are cool and collected no matter how hectic the holidays get. You are the cool chick, and everyone wants a chance to bask in the aura of your awesomeness. You were the one who leans against the wall and makes it look effortlessly awesome. You make everything you wear look amazing, and you make everything you drink look amazing too!\nEggnog Frappuccino A photo posted by Sarah Joy (@sarahjjoyful) on Nov 19, 2015 at 4:56pm PST \nEggnog is the type of beverage that you cozy up with after a full, winter day. And this eggnog frappuccino keeps you chill during a day full of winter shopping. And that’s what you’re looking for in your life, even during the winter months — relaxation and chill. You’re on a constant search for your zen. You go to yoga daily, and you rely on a delicious eggnog frap to keep you on an even keel the rest of the way.\nWhatever your coffee of choice, we can all celebrate. Get to Starbucks now to pick up your favorite holiday drink! \nThe post What your favorite holiday Starbucks drink says about your personality appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "A pair of market experts recently joined PreMarket Prep to share some favorite trading ideas. Ron Bienvenu is a managing member of Spear Point Capital Management LLC and an activist investor. First NBC And GSE Systems \nBienvenu discussed the incredible recent volatility in First NBC Bank Holding Company (NASDAQ: FNBC ). \n“It has been a wild ride. The backstory on this is the company was very successful in growing using some fairly innovative accounting methods for tax credits and building a highly-specialized business around that. The problem is, on the Basel III, those accounting methods will probably no longer be sufficient to rate as capital on their balance sheet, so they’ve got a fundamental problem,” he explained. \n“From where I sit, it looks like you’re going to have to restructure this business through the FDIC, so our bet is the equity is probably worth zero.\" \nOn the other hand, Bienvenu is extremely bullish on nuclear energy play GSE Systems, Inc. (NYSE: GVP ). \n“We think they have the best small-cap management team possibly in the country [...] They have the biggest backlog in their history, and they signed a $75 million deal earlier this year.” \nBienvenu said he wouldn’t be surprised to see the stock double within two years. Starbucks \nPreMarket Prep was also joined by Motley Fool writer Daniel Kline , who gave his take on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) and mortgage giants Federal National Mortgage Assctn Fnni Me (OTC: FNMA ) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (OTC: FMCC ). \nKline started off by pointing out that Starbucks is facing some negative political headwinds, but it doesn’t have any real long-term competition. \n“Starbucks really dominates the upscale café coffee market [...] long term, they’re improving their technology and they have a huge amount of people in their app. That’s a big advantage,” he explained. \nKline compared Starbucks to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) in that it has a loyal, entrenched customer base of app users. That setup should provide the company with long-term pricing power. Mortgage Giants \nTurning to the mortgage market, Kline believes that fear of rising interest rates could trigger a short-term bump in the mortgage market, but rising interest rates are bad news for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the long term. \n“I don’t see great things for the housing market because coming off historic lows for mortgage rates , you might get a short-term bump of people buying because they see the gravy train ending, but if mortgages go higher, it's going to be harder to sell and harder to buy,” he concluded. \nListen to the full discussion at 18:07 in the clip below. \nPreMarket Prep is a daily trading ideas show that focuses on technical analysis and actionable short term trades.

      "text": "#TrumpCup campaign hits Starbucks, draws questions Melanie Eversley, USA Today , KING 5:04 AM. PST November 21, 2016 Starbucks has 13 holiday red cups this year. (Photo: Starbucks.) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nDonald Trump supporters are nudging Starbucks servers to announce the name of their candidate by ordering coffee under Trump's name. \nIt is a tradition at Starbucks that servers ask customers for their names, and when an order is ready, shout out those customers' names. Trump supporters are ordering food and drink and telling Starbucks employees their name is Trump, compelling servers to call them to the counter for their orders by shouting out \"Trump!\" \nThe campaign dubbed #TrumpCup on social media is the latest wave in what has been a contentious campaign and post-election cycle. Some media reports questioned whether the Starbucks effort was motivated by the fact that CEO Howard Schultz endorsed Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, for president. But creator Timothy Treadstone said the idea was actually a social experiment in First Amendment rights. \nTreadstone, a 29-year-old political consultant and social media strategist from Los Angeles, told USA TODAY that he was motivated to start the campaign after seeing video on social media in which a Trump supporter attempts to give his name as Trump at a Starbucks. The audio is muffled, but it appears as if the Starbucks employee is not responding to the repeated request and that the employee then asks a coworker to call the police. \nAfter seeing the video, Treadstone posted to his Twitter account, @bakedalaska, on Thursday night: \"Operation #TrumpCup 1) Go to Starbucks & tell them your name is Trump 2) If they refuse take video Pls share & spread the word.\" \n\"This is not a protest; it's not a boycott,\" Treadstone said by telephone. \"This is a social experiment ... This is just something we’re doing to keep Starbucks accountable. We want to help out our economy, keep people accountable and have a little fun.\" \nTreadmill's comments were in part a response to questions that have emerged on social media in which members of the public asked about the effectiveness of a campaign that would bring more, not less, business to Starbucks. \nTwitter user @tarzdan_ wrote: \"So let me get this straight, you're going to protest against a company by giving them money?\" \nTweeted @CaptainsLog2016: \"I don't think Trumpkins have thought this whole #TrumpCup through. If you have to buy a product from the place you're boycotting... #FAIL.\" \nStarbucks released a statement regarding #TrumpCup: \"Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores. Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition. We don't require our partners to write or call out names.\" \nCopyright 2016 KING ",
