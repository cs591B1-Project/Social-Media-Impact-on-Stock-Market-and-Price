      "text": "Toyota to revamp America’s top-selling car amid SUV boom \nSaturday, December 03, 2016 Tweet \nDETROIT, United States (AP) — Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America’s top-selling sedan next month at a time when US buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. \nThe Japanese automaker said yesterday that it will show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit’s North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. \nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which was last redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. \nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. \nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 per cent of US sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. \nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 per cent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota’s RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. \nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn’t a pickup truck. \n“It’s possible that Camry would be the number one sedan, but the number one Toyota could be a RAV4,” said Bob Carter, Toyota’s senior vice-president of auto operations. \nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it may not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice-president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm. \n“They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,” Schuster said. “Unless there’s some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it’s going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.” \nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in US sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won’t return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said. ADVERTISEMENT",

The good news is, there are cars that will ease the anxiety of their owners with infrequent trips to the shop. According to Consumer Reports , using data from its annual survey of subscribers, the following ten vehicles are the most reliable in the country, and are ordered from most to least reliable. \nAny of these vehicles should be a solid choice if the most important consideration in your car-buying decision is predicted reliability. That said, they aren't all vehicles that Autoblog's editors would recommend as fun to drive. We've provided links to our own driving impressions on these vehicles where possible. \nInterestingly, five of the slots are taken up by Toyota brands. In total six cars come from Japan, three from Germany, and only one from the States. Also, brands from only five automakers made the list. Click on to see what cars are the most trouble-free.

      "text": "Toyota output worry Anasuya Basu \nJaipur, Dec. 3: Toyota Kirloskar India Ltd (TKIL) is bracing for a drop in production and capacity utilisation at its second plant in Bidari, Karnataka, following the government's demonetisation drive. \n\"The capacity at the first plant, which manufactures the Innova Crysta and the Fortuner, is fully utilised at 1 lakh units per annum. I don't think we will see any drop in production there as we have two months' waiting for these vehicles. But the second plant that makes the Etios Liva and the Etios may see a drop in production in December,\" said N. Raja, senior vice-president, director, marketing, TKIL. \nThe second plant, which has an installed capacity of 2,10, 000 units per annum, sees a capacity utilisation of 55 per cent in normal times. Raja's prediction is based on the drop in enquiries after demonetisation. \n\"Though we work on a 15 day inventory that will see us through November, we will feel the heat in December. We have seen a 30 per cent drop in walk-ins and a 15-20 per cent drop in enquiries at our dealerships,\" he said. \nHe was speaking at an environment seminar organised by the company in Jaipur recently. \nThe company showcased the new fourth generation Prius at the event.

      "text": "Toyota to unveil revamped Camry in January December 3, 2016 11:43 AM By The Associated Press \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nDETROIT - Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks. \nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer. Search cars \nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions. \nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years. \nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end. Cars 46 new cars coming for 2017 and beyond \nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future. \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck. \n\"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations. \nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm. \n\"They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,\" Schuster said. \"Unless there's some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it's going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.\" Cars 30 most popular vehicle brands on LI \nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won't return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said. ",

      "text": "QR Code Link to This Post '97 Toyota Rav4 AWD Manual Transmission We bought this vehicle in November of last year, and we've loved it. However, we were given the opportunity to buy a new car. So, we no longer need this one. It is a great little car, handles wonderfully in the snow, but it could still use some work. It is currently on an emissions waiver, which means it doesn't pass emissions, which also means that you should either register the vehicle in a county that doesn't do emissions or be prepared to fix the emissions problem or spend $750 attempting to do so at which point you qualify yourself for an emissions waiver. A Brief History (As we know it): The woman we purchased the vehicle from claimed to have replaced the radiator, rear wheel bearings, spark plugs, fronts struts, and the rear differential bushing (all 6 months prior). We purchased the vehicle at 186,427 miles. A week after the purchase, we replaced all four tires. A week after that, we replaced an oxygen sensor, the valve cover gaskets, and the oil pressure switch. A week after that, we replaced the distributor cap and rotor, got an alignment, replaced the air filter, replaced the spark plug wires, and flushed the transmission fluid. Shortly after the beginning of the year (January 2016), attempting to solve the emissions problem, we replaced the timing belt, water pump, drive belts, catalytic converter, and another oxygen sensor. We also had the oil pump seal, oil pump gasket, and the cam shaft seal replaced. Approximately a month later, we replaced both front calipers and pads. Oil changes approximately every 1500-3000 miles while we've had. do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 5904510545",

      "text": "Toyota Yaris isn't ﬂashy, but it gets the job done   Warren Brown, Special To The Washington Post \nI am not a socialist who believes everyone should drive small, unadorned economy cars.\nI am a realist who understands that most of us cannot comfortably afford automobiles marketed as luxury or high-performance machines.\nAlso increasingly evident is that our national and global environments cannot forever support bigger, faster, high-horsepower automobiles. That is reality, which in no way means I am against driving or the pursuit of the \"fun to drive.\"\nI am in and out of hundreds of cars and trucks annually - products priced at myriad levels, from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, to several million dollars in some cases. The experience is revealing: Regardless of price, all cars get stuck in traffic jams; and there are always traffic jams somewhere.\n\"Prestige\" does not help you move any faster. Nothing is more humbling than being stuck behind a Hyundai Elantra in an Aston Martin on the Pacific Coast Highway, or shuffling behind a Volkswagen Beetle in a high-performance Porsche on a London street or some segment of the Washington area's Beltway.\nNo law enforcement officer anywhere ever served me a traffic citation with the words: \"Wow! That's a prestigious car!\"\nSpeeding from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds impresses some automotive journalists or other proudly self-avowed \"gearheads.\" But try doing that in a quiet neighborhood - especially with a loud exhaust note - on a late night or early morning. How to make friends and influence people? That is definitely not the way.\nDo I like luxury and high-performance cars? Yes. But rapid technological advances, available in what we once called \"economy\" cars, makes some luxury metal seem vapidly foolish; and a super-high-horsepower car on an otherwise calm local street seems particularly out of place. High-performance on a racetrack or other designated space is fine, assuming you have the money or are lucky enough to get an invitation to share that venue.\nAll of this helps to explain the many Toyota, Ford, General Motors, Nissan, Honda, Chrysler, Volkswagen, Fiat, Hyundai and Kia vehicles you see in daily traffic on the Beltway and worldwide. They are vehicles that make sense, cars and trucks that real people really can afford.\nReality: I regretted having to return the 2017 compact Toyota Yaris LE hatchback I drove last week. It was such a worry-free drive. Fast? Not particularly. Equipped with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine, it stubbornly moved from 0 to 60 miles per hour in nearly 10 seconds. But it was a solid, reliable, reasonably safe and comfortable little car that could be parked almost anywhere and that got me and mine everywhere we wanted to go without necessitating a stop by bankruptcy court.\nAnd there was this about the Yaris: Toyota is to be congratulated for standardizing advanced electronic safety items through its Safety Sense package. That gives the motorist needed items such as forward-collision and lane-departure warning systems. I like this. I will look for this in all vehicles regardless of price or performance boasting.\nBottom line: Prestige vastly is overrated. Think safety, need, cost when buying a car. Impressing a neighbor will not impress your credit rating, doctor or police officer.\nRide, acceleration and handling: This is a get-about car that serves that purpose well. It's not a racer and does not move like one.\nHead-turning quotient: It's not about that. Most heads will miss it and you won't care.\nBody style and layout: It is a front engine, front-wheel-drive compact car available with two or four doors, manual or automatic transmission, or hatchback or sedan format. There are three trim levels - L, LE and SE.\nEngine/transmission: It comes with a 1.5-liter, 16-valve four-cylinder gasoline engine with variable valve timing. A five-speed manual transmission is standard. An antiquated four-speed automatic is optional. Hint: Buy the much more enjoyable manual transmission.\nCapacities: Seating is for five people. Cargo capacity is 15.3 cubic feet with all seats in place. The fuel tank holds 11.1 gallons of regular grade gasoline.\nMileage: I averaged 34 miles per gallon on the highway.\nSafety: Standard equipment includes ventilated front disc and rear drum brakes; four-wheel anti-lock brake system; Safety Sense package; stability and traction control; pre-collision safety system; and side and head air bags.\nPricing: The 2017 Toyota Yaris LE with automatic transmission starts at $18,000 with a dealer's invoice price of $17,278. Price as tested is $19,104 including $239 in options and an $865 factory-to-dealer shipment charge.",

He now faces criminal charges and Toyota is facing a lawsuit for an undisclosed amount. \n\nThe pastor said that he is making the story public to stop others from becoming victims of car salespeople. \n\n",

      "text": "Published on December 4th, 2016 | by James Ayre 0 \nDecember 4th, 2016 by James Ayre While many of us were tempted to postulate that Toyota’s recent creation of an electric vehicle division perhaps wasn’t a serious move, the recent appointment of company president Akio Toyoda as head of the division seems to contradict that line of thought. Notably, Akio Toyoda is actually the grandson of founder Kiichiro Toyoda, and is apparently intent on speeding up electric vehicle development plans. He’s been at the head of the company since 2009, though, so presumably was integral to the company’s initial decision to pursue hydrogen fuel cell vehicles over battery-electrics (whether out of actual hope for the technology or simply for PR purposes). Toyoda will apparently be heading the electric vehicle planning department along with Executive Vice Presidents Mitsuhisa Kato and Shigeki Terashi. A spokesperson for the company by the name of Kayo Doi stated: “By putting the president and vice presidents in charge of the department, we plan to speed up development of electric cars. … The president will directly oversee the department’s operations to enable decisions to be made quickly and nimbly.” Automotive News provides more: “The department comprises a new in-house unit to plan Toyota’s strategy to develop and market electric cars as part of the company’s efforts to keep pace with the tightening global emissions regulations.” Continuing: “Toyota is also shifting the chief engineer of its Prius gasoline-hybrid to its EV efforts, appointing Koji Toyoshima to head the division’s engineering team. Toyoshima will also join the four-member EV strategy unit, which will include representatives from group suppliers — Denso Corp, Aisin Seiki Co, and Toyota Industries Corp.” This news, along with some earlier announcements, should put to rest the idea that Toyota is still refusing to take the rapidly growing electric vehicle market seriously. I’m guessing that company execs have decided that they don’t want to lose market share any further, and may even be aiming to steal market share if they bring compelling electric vehicles to market before their rivals do (Honda, I’m looking at you).

      "text": "The Basics: Toyota is recalling 744,437 Sienna minivans from models years 2011 through 2016 in the United States because their sliding doors may not close properly. There are currently over 1,200 new Sienna minivans on dealer lots that cannot be sold until a fix has been found.\n\nThe Problem: According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, if the power sliding door is unable to be opened when commanded, such as if the door is frozen shut, the door may subsequently open unexpectedly, possibly while the vehicle is moving. Obviously, an open sliding door could be a safety hazard.\n\nInjuries/Deaths: None reported.\n\nThe fix: So far unknown. According to NHTSA, \"the remedy for this recall is still under development.\"\n\nIf you own one: Notices are expected to be mailed to owners by January 21, 2017. Owners may contact Toyota customer service at 1-800-331-4331. Toyota's number for this recall is G04.",

      "text": "IBM opens 'cyber-range' to practice security battles \nHave you ever handed your phone over to someone you didn’t know so that he or she could verify data you have saved in an app? A minister and his wife did and their story is a disturbing cautionary tale as to why you shouldn’t hand your phone over to anyone. \nThe following information comes from a lawsuit ( pdf ) against Toyota and a specific dealership as well as a Dallas Morning News report. \nPastor Tim Gautreaux and his wife, Claire, were interested in buying a Prius from Texas Toyota of Grapevine. They had taken the dealership’s advice and used an app to get pre-approved for financing via Capital One Financial Corporation. An internet car salesman claimed he needed to show the pre-approved financing information in the app to his manager. The pastor unlocked his phone and handed it over. \nGautreaux claimed the phone was out of his sight for about five minutes before it was returned. When the finance manager had questions, the pastor checked his phone; instead of the pre-approved info in the app being open, a photo of his wife “in a compromising stage of undress appeared on the screen.” \nThe pastor checked an app “that tracks and saves deleted emails” and discovered that a screenshot of the pre-approved financing had been emailed to the work email address as well as the personal email address of Grapevine Toyota’s new car sales director Matthew Thomas. Additionally, the pastor claimed there were two more emails containing “two different compromising photographs” of his wife sent to an email address “associated with a swingers’ website.” \nBeing a pastor, Gautreaux was “greatly concerned about the personal and professional ramifications of the dissemination of this personal information.” He took his concerns to a different Grapevine Toyota sales director who promised to investigate and fire the person responsible. Yet six hours later, the dealership had not found the person responsible “for the gross invasions of their privacy.” \nThe Grapevine police were told by the dealership’s owner that Thomas had the phone during the time the emails were sent. Eventually, Thomas was arrested and charged with a breaching a computer’s security, a class B misdemeanor. The lawsuit alleges that the Toyota dealership knew of “Thomas’ past improprieties” at the workplace and still employed him. \nThe lawsuit also claims that the pastor “had a reasonable expectation of privacy” – it didn’t occur to him that the private photos of his wife getting into and out of the bathtub would be accessed and made public on a swinger site. The intrusion was called something that “would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.” \nTheir attorney is Gloria Allred ; Dallas Morning News reported that “her past clients include women who accused celebrities such as Bill Cosby and Donald Trump of sexual assault.” \nThe lawsuit, which claims Toyota Motor North America and Texas Toyota of Grapevine are guilty of breach of contract, deceptive trade practices, negligence and public disclosure of private facts – seeks more than $1 million in damages. \nTexas Toyota told the Dallas Observer that it didn’t know about the lawsuit until December 1, the day it was filed. \nToyota North America told CBS 11: \nWhile we cannot comment on the allegations in the suit, it is important to note that Toyota of Grapevine is an independently owned dealership. Toyota Motor North America does not own, operate or manage Toyota of Grapevine; it does not hire, fire or direct the day-to-day activities of the dealership’s personnel; and it is not involved in matters concerning employees of independent dealers. \nBefore you hand your phone over to anyone, keep in mind that some police have the ability to suck all the data out of a phone in their possession in less than two minutes, which seems like a valid reason not to have your car insurance via an app that would require you to hand over your phone if you were ever pulled over. Some sketchy cops were stealing nude photos from female DUI suspects’ phones and making a “game” of it by forwarding the nude snaps in text messages to other cops. Potential snooping is one of the reasons why I didn’t want a Walmart employee to walk off with my smartphone while checking a price. \nIt remains to be seen what will happen with this lawsuit, but this case does serve as a sad reminder that you shouldn’t hand your phone over to anyone for any reason and believe your privacy will remain intact.

      "text": "Toyota Yaris isn't ﬂashy, but it gets the job done Sunday Dec 4, 2016 at 6:00 AM \nBy Warren Brown, Special To The Washington Post \nI am not a socialist who believes everyone should drive small, unadorned economy cars.\nI am a realist who understands that most of us cannot comfortably afford automobiles marketed as luxury or high-performance machines.\nAlso increasingly evident is that our national and global environments cannot forever support bigger, faster, high-horsepower automobiles. That is reality, which in no way means I am against driving or the pursuit of the \"fun to drive.\"\nI am in and out of hundreds of cars and trucks annually - products priced at myriad levels, from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, to several million dollars in some cases. The experience is revealing: Regardless of price, all cars get stuck in traffic jams; and there are always traffic jams somewhere.\n\"Prestige\" does not help you move any faster. Nothing is more humbling than being stuck behind a Hyundai Elantra in an Aston Martin on the Pacific Coast Highway, or shuffling behind a Volkswagen Beetle in a high-performance Porsche on a London street or some segment of the Washington area's Beltway.\nNo law enforcement officer anywhere ever served me a traffic citation with the words: \"Wow! That's a prestigious car!\"\nSpeeding from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds impresses some automotive journalists or other proudly self-avowed \"gearheads.\" But try doing that in a quiet neighborhood - especially with a loud exhaust note - on a late night or early morning. How to make friends and influence people? That is definitely not the way.\nDo I like luxury and high-performance cars? Yes. But rapid technological advances, available in what we once called \"economy\" cars, makes some luxury metal seem vapidly foolish; and a super-high-horsepower car on an otherwise calm local street seems particularly out of place. High-performance on a racetrack or other designated space is fine, assuming you have the money or are lucky enough to get an invitation to share that venue.\nAll of this helps to explain the many Toyota, Ford, General Motors, Nissan, Honda, Chrysler, Volkswagen, Fiat, Hyundai and Kia vehicles you see in daily traffic on the Beltway and worldwide. They are vehicles that make sense, cars and trucks that real people really can afford.\nReality: I regretted having to return the 2017 compact Toyota Yaris LE hatchback I drove last week. It was such a worry-free drive. Fast? Not particularly. Equipped with a 1.5-liter four-cylinder gasoline engine, it stubbornly moved from 0 to 60 miles per hour in nearly 10 seconds. But it was a solid, reliable, reasonably safe and comfortable little car that could be parked almost anywhere and that got me and mine everywhere we wanted to go without necessitating a stop by bankruptcy court.\nAnd there was this about the Yaris: Toyota is to be congratulated for standardizing advanced electronic safety items through its Safety Sense package. That gives the motorist needed items such as forward-collision and lane-departure warning systems. I like this. I will look for this in all vehicles regardless of price or performance boasting.\nBottom line: Prestige vastly is overrated. Think safety, need, cost when buying a car. Impressing a neighbor will not impress your credit rating, doctor or police officer.\nRide, acceleration and handling: This is a get-about car that serves that purpose well. It's not a racer and does not move like one.\nHead-turning quotient: It's not about that. Most heads will miss it and you won't care.\nBody style and layout: It is a front engine, front-wheel-drive compact car available with two or four doors, manual or automatic transmission, or hatchback or sedan format. There are three trim levels - L, LE and SE.\nEngine/transmission: It comes with a 1.5-liter, 16-valve four-cylinder gasoline engine with variable valve timing. A five-speed manual transmission is standard. An antiquated four-speed automatic is optional. Hint: Buy the much more enjoyable manual transmission.\nCapacities: Seating is for five people. Cargo capacity is 15.3 cubic feet with all seats in place. The fuel tank holds 11.1 gallons of regular grade gasoline.\nMileage: I averaged 34 miles per gallon on the highway.\nSafety: Standard equipment includes ventilated front disc and rear drum brakes; four-wheel anti-lock brake system; Safety Sense package; stability and traction control; pre-collision safety system; and side and head air bags.\nPricing: The 2017 Toyota Yaris LE with automatic transmission starts at $18,000 with a dealer's invoice price of $17,278. Price as tested is $19,104 including $239 in options and an $865 factory-to-dealer shipment charge.",

      "text": "Toyota To Increase Prices Of Its Model Range By Upto 3 Per Cent Toyota To Increase Prices Of Its Model Range By Upto 3 Per Cent The new prices will come into effect from January, 2017 Increase in input costs and foreign exchange rates are the reason Toyota has announced various schemes on the Innova Crysta In a move to tackle the increasing manufacturing cost of vehicles and constant upward movement of foreign exchange rates, Toyota Kirloskar Motor has announced that it will increase prices of its entire product portfolio by up to 3 per cent from January, 2017. A similar price hike was also announced in December, 2015. \nExpressing his views on the price hike, N. Raja, Director & Sr. Vice President, Marketing and Sales, Toyota Kirloskar Motor said, \"There has been an increase in prices of raw material commodities like steel, aluminum, copper and rubber over a period of the last six months and this puts a lot of pressure on us as all this has been leading to a higher input cost on our end. Another factor leading to higher input cost in our case is the appreciation of yen in the international market which has increased the cost of parts that we import from Japan.\" Prius (Toyota has sold over 50,000 units of the Innova Crysta till date) \nToyota has also announced a new 'Remember December' campaign which will offer benefits such as 100 per cent financing on the on-road prices of the cars and attractive EMI options such as 'Buy now, pay in March, 2017' and EMIs as low as ₹ 22,999 on particular variants of Innova Crysta. \nExpressing concerns on a higher foreign exchange rate, N.Raja added: \n\"We do a periodic review of the prices of our products basis the above factors and take necessary actions. We have been absorbing all the additional costs till now thereby protecting our customers from the price increase. However, owing to continued pressure of high costs and foreign exchange rates remaining at high levels of above ₹ 68 for every USD, we had to increase the cost of our products\" (Toyota has also garnered over 6,200 bookings for the new Fortuner) \nThe company reported a growth of over 10 per cent in the domestic sales last month. Toyota has managed to sell over 50,000 units of its Innova Crysta and it also claims that the Fortuner has received over 6,200 booking since its launch. We do expect other car manufacturers also to increase its car prices with the start of new calendar year.",

Another factor leading to higher input cost in our case is the appreciation of yen in the international market which has increased the cost of parts that we import from Japan,\" said N Raja, Director & Sr. Vice President, Marketing and Sales, Toyota Kirloskar Motor. \nIn addition, Toyota also announced the 'Remember December Campaign, which will provide product offerings and benefits of 100% on road financing, EMI Holidays like- buy now and pay in March 2017- on all its models and a special EMI package of Rs 22,999 in select models of Innova Crysta. \n\"The Remember December campaign is not just about offering benefits on our products but it is also an effort from our side to meet the needs of the customers to help them overcome difficulties caused due to demonetization. Not just that, we are also accepting cashless payments through various channels of e-transfers to ensure smooth & hassle free buying experiences for our customers thus adding more value to the customer experience and meeting their expectations,\" added N Raja. \nIn November, Toyota Kirloskar Motor sold a total of 11,309 units in the domestic market, registering a growth of 10 percent as opposed to the same period last year. The company also exported 1284 units of the Etios series in November 2016 clocking a total of 12,593 units.

      "text": "Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) will bring in a price hike of three per cent across all models in their range. This will be effective from January 2017.\nThe upward revision in vehicle prices is due to the rising input costs coupled with high prices of raw materials. The Dollar and Yen have seen an appreciation in the last few months adding pressure on the company. In addition, the automaker's profit has been hit by the rising costs of commodities like steel, aluminum, copper and rubber. Also, Toyota imports many components from Japan and the inflation in foreign exchange rates in addition has affected their overall cost of production.\nN. Raja, Director and Senior Vice President, Marketing and Sales, Toyota Kirloskar Motor said, \"There has been an increase in pricing of raw material commodities like steel, aluminum, copper and rubber over a period of the last six months and this puts a lot of pressure on us as all this has been leading to a higher input cost on our end. Another factor leading to higher input cost in our case is the appreciation of yen in the international market which has increased the cost of parts that we import from Japan.\nWe do a periodic review of the prices of our products basis the above factors and take necessary actions. We have been absorbing all the additional costs till now thereby protecting our customers from the price increase. However, owing to continued pressure of high costs and foreign exchange rates remaining at high levels of above Rs 68 USD, we have been pressured to increase the cost of our products.”\nThough the automaker has not specified the product-wise revision in prices, this upward trend in ex-showroom prices will be applicable right from the carmaker's entry-level Liva to their flagship Land Cruiser.",

      "text": "By Denis Flierl G+ 2016-12-05 07:33 Why New Subaru BRZ Gets Drastic Price Cut in Australia; What About the Toyota 86? Exterior enhancements The 2017 Subaru BRZ gets huge price cuts in Australia. What about the Toyota 86? \nAs the 2017 Subaru BRZ arrives in Australia, the updated BRZ sports coupe is a better bargain compared to the outgoing model. Subaru Australia announced big price cuts for the newly-upgraded manual and automatic sports coupe. The two-door rear-drive sports cars are priced from $32,990 for the 6-speed manual, a saving of $1230 over the previous model year, while the automatic variant is $34,990, $1735 less than the 2016 model year. \nWhy the big price drop? \nSubaru Australia Managing Director, Colin Christie, said: “Despite exchange rate pressures, our strong relationship with the factory has produced a great result for BRZ fans.” The price cuts are likely a result of slow sales for the aging BRZ sports coupe. Interest has wained and sales are down in Australia and around the globe. \nSales of the two-door Subaru BRZ have continued to slide backward all year in Australia, with registrations down by 50.5 per cent to 246 units compared with the 497 in same period last year. In the U.S., sales of the sports coupe are also down with a 19.6 percent drop over the previous year. In Canada, BRZ sales are up a surprising 83.3 percent in November. \nSales of the Toyota 86, are also down, with a 27.7 percent drop over the first nine months of 2016. Sales of its twin, the Toyota 86, have been much more robust than the BRZ with the two-door 86 recording 1713 registrations so far this year down under. Toyota hasn’t announced any price cuts when the new model arrives. The Toyota 86 is the second-best selling sports car under 80,000 behind the wildly popular Ford Mustang. \nIt’s a great time to buy a new BRZ if you live down under. The newly-upgraded 2017 Subaru BRZ sports coupe is at dealers now in Australia, and driving enthusiasts can get one at a reduced price. \nPhoto credit: Subaru AU",

      "text": "Toyota cars to cost more from January Dec 5, 2016, 08.18PM IST Nandini Sen Gupta ] CHENNAI: Toyota Kirloskar Motor on Monday announced it will increase prices of its vehicles by up to 3% effective from January 01, 2017. \"The decision is in line with the general industry trend prompted by increasing cost of manufacturing vehicles and a consistent upward trend in foreign exchange rates,\" the company said in a statement.Added N. Raja, director and senior vice president, Marketing and Sales, Toyota Kirloskar Motor, \"There has been an increase in pricing of raw material commodities like steel, aluminum, copper and rubber over a period of the last six months and this puts a lot of pressure on us as all this has been leading to a higher input cost on our end. Another factor leading to higher input cost in our case is the appreciation of yen in the international market which has increased the cost of parts that we import from Japan.\"\"We do a periodic review of the prices of our products basis the above factors and take necessary actions. We have been absorbing all the additional costs till now thereby protecting our customers from the price increase. However, owing to continued pressure of high costs and foreign exchange rates remaining at high levels of above Rs. 68 USD, we have been pressured to increase the cost of our products,\" he added. The company saw a growth of over 10% in domestic sales in the month of November owing to a 'positive response' to the recently launched all-new Fortuner. The other new launches of 2016 - Innova Crysta and the new Platinum Etios - have also received a very good response from the market, said the company.",

Post to Facebook Toyota employee returns car to disabled Tenn. woman during fires Gatlinburg woman's car had been at dealership in Knoxville when employee, 22, took car to her.  //usat.ly/2h6CluW   Join the Nation's Conversation   Toyota employee returns car to disabled Tenn. woman during fires USA Today Network Travis Dorman, Knoxville (Tenn.) News Sentinel 11:03 a.m. EST December 5, 2016 A building at the Westgate Smoky Mountain Resort goes up in flames Tuesday, Nov. 29, 2016, during the middle of the wildfire that hit Gatlinburg, Tenn. (Photo: Brandon Reese, The Tennessean) \nGATLINBURG, Tenn. — If the Gatlinburg firestorm had come at another time, Claire Brandau believes she may have perished in the flames. If it had come in the morning, she may have been blind. If it had come on another day, she may not have been able to walk , a result of her battle with Lyme disease. \nWhen fires propelled by hurricane-force winds ripped through the town Nov. 28, killing at least 14 people and damaging or destroying more than 1,600 buildings, Brandau could see, and she could walk. As far as her health, she was having a relatively good day. But she didn’t have her car — her Prius was being worked on at Toyota in Knoxville. \nWhile most people were driving away from the flames, a 22-year-old Toyota employee drove toward them, determined to deliver Brandau's vehicle to her in the midst of one of Tennessee's worst natural disasters in recorded history. \nBrandau, a 49-year-old woman, believes she was infected with Lyme disease, caused by bacteria spread by ticks, nearly 15 years before she began treatment. As a result, the disease made its way into her brain and now “affects everything.” Every day is different, and she said she never knows what the future will hold. \n“It’s totally unpredictable,” she said in a phone interview Saturday as she stood outside the evacuee shelter at Rocky Top Sports World. Since the disaster, she's stopped taking her many medications, which she said make her feeble, in order to be more able-bodied. Cat alerts Tennessee man to Gatlinburg fires \n“Some days I can’t walk. Some days I can’t even crawl. It’s hard to explain, but I can be on my hands and knees, but I can’t place them properly on the floor. They just go where they want, and I do a face plant. It’d probably be pretty funny to watch,” she said, laughing. \nIn 2012, Lyme disease patient Claire Brandau is shown in her office with four months' worth of empty pill bottles at her Gatlinburg, Tenn., home. During the wildfires that hit Gatlinburg on Monday, Nov. 28, 2016, a Toyota employee returned her car that was at the dealer in Knoxville, Tenn. (Photo: Kristi Nelson, Knoxville (Tenn.) News Sentinel) \nSome days she wakes up and can’t see. Other days, she wakes up and can see normally for an hour or two, but then her eyes start “jumping” and shaking uncontrollably and she sees double; or dark spots form on the sides of her vision and gradually grow, swallowing her up until she feels like she’s trapped “inside a black tunnel,” her caretaker Stephanie Ball said. \n“Sometimes I’m her eyes. Sometimes I’m her crutch,” said Ball, who has taken care of Brandau for more than three years, cooking for her, cleaning her house, doing her laundry and giving her rides to weekly therapy sessions. “… I drive her everywhere because you don’t know when her vision’s going to go. She’s not really supposed to be driving.” \nOn Monday night, Brandau didn’t receive a mobile alert notifying her of the mandatory evacuations in place for Gatlinburg and parts of Pigeon Forge. No one did, officials confirmed Saturday, citing interrupted communications because of “disabled phone, Internet and electrical services.\" \nEven if authorities had sent out a mobile alert, Brandau said, she and many others in the area probably wouldn't have received it — she never gets cellphone service at her house. \nIt was the sky that served as Brandau's warning. As night fell, the sky turned orange, and her brain, she said, turned to mush. Rain aids Smoky Mountains wildfire battle; death toll rises to 14 \nOnce she had collected herself, she called Toyota. She said she told the man who answered the phone to search \"Gatlinburg\" on Google. \n\"I heard him tappity tappity tap, and I heard him say, 'Oh my God.' They're in Knoxville. They had no idea what was going on up here. I said, 'You guys were supposed to deliver my car last week.' That's when he said, 'I'm getting in the car and I'm coming, I'm bringing your car.' \" “I had to do something.” Connor Reis, Toyota employee who drove into Gatlinburg fires to return car \nConnor Reis, a service writer at Toyota, drove Brandau's car to her, buffeting by winds at speeds topping 90 mph. He said he persuaded his roommate to follow him in his truck so he could get a ride back to Knoxville. \nReis knew he didn't have to do it, he said. \n\"But knowing what was going on, knowing that she had a very real risk of losing everything she had, even her not being able to make it out of there, I couldn't in good consciousness let it be,\" he said. \"I had to do something. \n\"When we got down to the areas that were being evacuated, as we got closer and closer to the fires, we noticed a whole bunch of fire trucks and workers. The winds were just awful, like I was almost getting blown off the road while I was driving down there. It was crazy what was going on. When we got to that point, I was scared.\" \nReis said he became \"truly terrified\" when a tree fell and blocked the road about a quarter-mile from Brandau's house. Dolly Parton to host telethon for Gatlinburg wildfire victims \n\"I was thinking, 'I can't drag this out, my friend's truck can't drag this out.' But some guy who lived nearby showed up with a chainsaw, asked us if we needed help and started cutting down the tree. We dragged the pieces out of the road and eventually got to her house.\" \nOnce in her car, Brandau, who took classes on wildfire ecology at the University of Tennessee and has had training in crisis debriefing, turned on the radio, sang along and didn't look back.

      "text": "by Mark McNabb + \nToyota is making plans to restructure the balance of its car and truck production in the coming years. Reports suggest Toyota’s current 50/50 mix of cars to truck sales will soon swing toward the truck side, perhaps as much as 60/40. Toyota’s trucks, which include the Tacoma, Tundra, and the handful of SUVs and crossovers, have seen a dramatic rise in popularity over recent years. This plan will supposedly reallocate production volumes to favor these hot-selling vehicles. \nThe news comes from Automotive News who interviewed Bill Fay, the general manager of the Toyota division. \"It’s not always that Toyota has a product that will stand out in the market,\" Fay said. “But we’re optimistic based on the feedback we’ve gotten so far.\" Fay is referring to Toyota’s all-new C-HR crossover that launched at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show in November. \nThe C-HR’s debut comes on the heels of big sales gains for Toyota’s RAV4 and Highlander. To help meet demand, Toyota is increasing the volume of RAV4s from Japan, while a newly opened assembly line in Indiana now rolls out Highlanders. \n\"I’m very optimistic for 2017 because we’ll have a better supply of RAV and Highlander,\" he said. \"We’ll launch this beautiful C-HR and will be in a much better position to meet customer demand on the sport-utility side of things.\" \nAs far as Toyota’s trucks are concerned, the situation could be better. Both the Tijuana, Mexico and San Antonio, Texas assembly plants that produce the Tacoma are already at full capacity. An expansion project is already happening in Tijuana, but it won’t be operational for another year or so. That leaves a big void in supply. \nThings will get even more hectic whenever Toyota launches its next-generation Tundra. The current Tundra is showing its age, but a new model with more modern and competitive features would surely see an increase in sales. Thankfully for Toyota’s production arm, the new Tundra isn’t expected until 2018 or 2019, giving time for Tijuana to complete its growth. \nFay voiced his thankfulness over production line workers not having to be laid off on the car side due to slowing sales of sedans and other small cars. \"We’ve been able to move the production around in a way that we haven’t needed to lay anyone off, which is good,\" Fay told AN . General Motors workers weren’t so lucky as some 2,000 worker were sent home due to slumping car sales. \nContinue reading for more information. Source: Automotive News Why It Matters \nThe industry is certainly seeing a huge up-tick in truck, SUV, and crossover sales as fuel prices continue to fall and the economy continues to recover from the recession. Families are buying bigger, thirstier vehicles while leaving models like the Toyota Prius and Corolla sitting on dealer lots. \nToyota is definitely wise in following market demands, though we hope fuel prices stay stable. A dramatic increase in oil prices would send customers shopping for hybrids and smaller cars, while dealerships would have stockpiles of trucks and SUVs. The industry has already experienced a very similar circumstance before, just as fuel prices spiked in the late 2000s. \nWhile moving production towards SUVs, crossovers, and pickups is a risk, the potential for reward is great. These vehicles typically have a higher MSRP, which leads to higher profits for automakers. Vehicle production is important, but the main reason automakers are in business is to make money. Profits will always be the main goal. \nRead our full review on the 2017 Toyota C-HR here. What is your take?",

      "text": "36 mins ago by Mark Kane 0 Comments Toyota Levin HEV/Corolla HEV – from the 16th Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition (2015) \nToyota continues to moves towards the introduction of new plug-in hybrids for the Chinese market over the next few years. \nThe Japanese company announced the expansion of its R&D facility in China, to handle not only internal battery evaluation and testing, but also test tracks for its upcoming EVs. Toyota Prius Prime \n“Specifically, the plan includes improvements to the existing laboratory facility, construction of a new laboratory, creation of a battery evaluation and test facility, as well as improvements to test tracks on the premises. These are scheduled to be completed from late 2018 onwards.” \nOriginally, TMEC ( Toyota Motor Engineering & Manufacturing (China) Co., Ltd.) was established in 2010 to develop and produce cars locally in China – for the Chinese market. And as such, locally made hybrids are now already on the market, while plug-in hybrids – under Corolla Levin lineup – are expected around 2018. \nBeside the Toyota Corolla PHEV, Toyota intends to begin demonstration tests for fuel cell vehicles in China…but for now, that is all that is planned on the hydrogen front – no mass production plans. New plug-in hybrids, locally made in China, appear to be on the horizon for Toyota \n“Toyota has been using each of the distinct characteristics of hybrid, plug-in hybrids, electric, and fuel cell vehicles to develop and promote the full range of eco-cars. The Chinese government is currently promoting eco-cars under its Energy-Saving and New Energy Automotive Industry Development Plan. In line with this plan, Toyota is planning the introduction of plug-in hybrids under its Corolla Levin lineup, in addition to its current effort to promote the wider use of hybrid vehicles. \nAdditionally, preparations are underway to begin demonstration tests for fuel cell vehicles in China, and to conduct research for the introduction of electric vehicles into the China market. Amid the growing intensity of competition in the Chinese market and the increasingly stringent regulations in relation to motor vehicles, Toyota intends to continue with the emphasis on the making of ever-better cars through the further expansion of TMEC’s R&D facilities, and the reinforcement of its technological development capability.” \nMr. Hiroji Onishi, Senior Managing Officer and CEO for the China Region, said at a press conference held at the ongoing Guangzhou Motor Show: \n“Efforts are being directed toward the reinforcement of local R&D capability for the long term. We hope to train as many local engineers as possible, and to develop more cars that would satisfy the needs of our customers in China.”",

      "text": "NextEV SUV to offer Model X performance for Toyota price, says founder   Enlarge Photo \nChinese electric car startup NextEV in November launched the new brand Nio whose first model, the 1,360-horsepower EP9 supercar , is already one of the fastest production cars in the world, having lapped the Nürburgring in just 7:05.12. \nBut the EP9 is a limited edition model for multimillionaires, which NextEV admits was primarily built to help draw attention to its new brand Nio and highlight the link with the company’s successful Formula E team. It will be sold exclusively in China. \nIn contrast, future models from Nio will compete in high-volume segments, and they will be sold in the United States. \nSpeaking with Automotive News (subscription required), NextEV co-founder Jack Cheng said the U.S. will be the first market outside of China that Nio cars will be sold in. And the first volume model due will be an electric SUV to rival the Tesla [NSDQ:TSLA] Model X and similar offerings due soon from Audi and Mercedes-Benz . \nNextEV electric motor plant Enlarge Photo \nThe ace up NextEV’s sleeve will be sharp pricing, Cheng said. \n“It'll be positioned at Audi and BMW but with a Toyota price,” Cheng said of the SUV. He also described its performance as being “as good as or better than the Tesla [Model X].” \nThe SUV is said to be launching with a 70-kilowatt-hour battery. The closest comparison is Tesla’s Model X 75D which has a 75-kwh battery and 237-mile EPA-rated range. \nNextEV is hoping to start sales in the U.S. by late 2018 or early the following year. Production will take place in China.",

More Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota could have competition in the NASCAR Cup Series in the near future.\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne has hinted Dodge is on the verge of a full-time return to NASCAR's top series.\nSpeaking at Ferrari’s World Finals event at Daytona on Sunday, Marchionne said he's talked with NASCAR’s executive vice president Jim France during a gala dinner at the track on Saturday, according to Motorsport.com.\n“Yes, I’d love to [return to NASCAR]. I’m the one who pulled Dodge out, so I’m the guilty party at the table,\" Marchionne said.\n“But for those of you with short memories, in 2009 we came out of bankruptcy, so to race in NASCAR when I was trying to pay bills and pay payroll would have been a bit of a stretch. I think we’re in a different place now. I think, if possible, we’ll come back to NASCAR – I think we need to find the right way to come back in.\n“I’ve agreed with both Jim and Lesa (France-Kennedy) to come back to the issue in short order.\"\nDodge is represented occasionally in the Xfinity and Truck Series but hasn't been in the Cup Series full time since 2012. Brad Keselowski was Cup champion in the manufacturer's final race with Team Penske. There were rumors that the company would return in 2014 but that never came to fruition.\nNASCAR vice president David Higdon commented on Marchionne comments, saying: \"There is increasing excitement around NASCAR. We continue to have on-going dialogue with a number of auto manufacturers about their interest in joining our sport. We look forward to exploration with them on this topic.\nIn the past, American carmakers had more than one nameplate in NASCAR. Ford and Mercury; Chevy, Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac; Dodge and Plymouth. Most of those brands are defunct.",

      "text": "Toyota dealer sued for stealing intimate photo off couple's smartphone There’s an important lesson in data security here… David Bisson | December 5, 2016 6:58 pm | Filed under: Mobile , Privacy | 0 0 SHARES \nA couple has sued a Toyota dealership for stealing an intimate photograph off the husband's smartphone and uploading it to a website for swingers. \nIn January 2015, Tim Gautreaux, 29, a pastor at Hope Fellowship in Frisco, went to Texas Toyota with his wife Claire, 27, who works in retail management. \nTim had saved his pre-approved financing document for a new car on his smartphone. The salesperson helping the couple asked to borrow the smartphone so that he could show the information to his manager. \nFive minutes later, the salesperson returned and handed the phone back to Tim. To complete the purchase, the couple went to see the dealership's finance manager, who asked to see the financing document. \nThat's when Tim noticed something was wrong. \nWhen he went to pull up the document, he saw that an intimate photo of his wife had recently been selected. Some additional digging on his part revealed that someone had sent the photo of his wife to a couple based in Garland and a swingers' website. \nClaire was absolutely mortified. As quoted by NBC 5 : \n\"My husband took a photograph of me in a private moment in our home. I never imagined anyone else would see it, let along that they would send my picture to an email address associated with swingers. We were at a Toyota dealership to buy a car and not to share anything about our lives with the people there.\" \nThe couple called the police. Investigators arrived on the scene and learned that Matt Thomas, the dealership's owner, had emailed the images to himself before he uploaded it to his profile on a swingers' website. \nThomas deleted those emails, but an app installed on Tim's phone managed to recover them. \nLocal law enforcement arrested Thomas in November 2015 on computer security charges. He posted bail shortly thereafter and is now due back in court on 29 December. \nIn the meantime, the Gautreauxs have sued Thomas, Texas Toyota of Grapevine, and Toyota Motor North America citing intrusion and negligence, among other crimes. \nThey're demanding one million dollars in damages. I would be surprised if Toyota doesn't settle with the Gautreauxs before the case makes it to trial. No car manufacturer wants that kind of negative publicity to be dragged out in court, even if it pertains to just one salesperson at one of their car dealerships. \nNow let's be clear about something. The young couple has every right to feel violated by Thomas and Texas Toyota. But as their lawyer says in the press briefing above, this isn't the first time something like this has happened, and it certainly won't be the last. That's because even in professional situations like buying a car, you never know who the other person really is on the other side of the table. \nWith that in mind, if you have saved data that you don't want others to see, it's a good idea to NEVER hand over access of your smartphone or computer to anyone you don't trust unless it's the manufacturer for a technical issue. It might be more inconvenient to, say, print out a pre-approved financing document than to save it on a phone, but that type of measure could prevent incidents like this from happening. 0 ",

      "text": "Car Salesman Allegedly Sent Customer's Nude Pics to Website Texas couple is suing dealership, Toyota Motor North America By Evann Gastaldo  25 PM CST 10 comments Comments A Toyota dealership sign is shown. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson, File) (Newser) – Tim and Claire Gautreaux, a Texas pastor and his wife, got far more than they bargained for when they went to a Grapevine Toyota dealership in January 2015 to buy a new car. According to a lawsuit seeking more than $1 million in damages that the couple filed against Texas Toyota of Grapevine and Toyota Motor North America, Tim Gautreaux, 29, handed over his phone to the salesman because he had his application for pre-approved financing saved on an app. The salesman gave the phone to his manager, 44-year-old Matthew Luke Thomas—and Thomas allegedly stole nude photos of Claire Gautreaux, 27, off the phone, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports. The phone was out of sight for just five minutes, per CBS DFW . When Tim Gautreaux got his phone back, he opened it to see a year-old photograph of Claire \"in a compromising stage of undress,\" per the lawsuit. He then opened an app that saves deleted emails, and saw that an email with financial info had been sent to Thomas—but two other emails, which included photos of his wife getting in and out of the bath, had been sent to a swingers' website. \"These actions have caused the Gautreauxs to suffer humiliation and mental anguish, particularly because they do not know who has seen these photographs or may see them in the future,\" said one of their lawyers, Gloria Allred, per the Dallas News . Thomas also has been criminally charged with misdemeanor computer security breach. (A crazy sex tape blackmail scandal started at a Texas church .)",

So says the Human Rights Campaign, which today honored Toyota with its 10 th consecutive perfect score of “100” on HRC’s 2017 Corporate Equality Index (CEI), a national benchmarking survey on corporate policies and practices related to LGBT workplace equality. “We thank HRC for this recognition of Toyota’s commitment to workplace equality for all,” said Latondra Newton, Chief Diversity Officer of Toyota Motor North America. “Toyota’s LGBT initiatives stem from our core values—including respect for people and continuous improvement—and an appreciation for a diverse, inclusive workforce that better serves our customers. Toyota is proud to stand with its LGBT employees and be recognized as a best place to work.” In compiling the index, HRC evaluated 1,043 businesses, assessing LGBT-related policies and practices including non-discrimination workplace protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-inclusive health care benefits, competency programs, and public engagement with the LGBT community. Toyota is one of about 400 companies – from over a thousand rated—that earned a perfect score of 100.

      "text": "from bland to bold toyota camrys design may be worth getting excited about camry teaser More There are many reasons Toyota’s Camry midsize sedan is one of the best-selling cars of all time, but none of those reasons relate to the car’s design. Camry buyers simply don’t care if their vehicle is striking; more important to them is a reliable, fuel-efficient, safe, and comfortable commuter vehicle.\nConservative styling has worked for Toyota for decades, but something about the teaser image of the 2018 Camry says the Japanese automaker is about to break new ground. Debuting at the 2017 Detroit Motor Show in January, the next-generation Camry will serve up a new challenge to its main rivals – the Ford Fusion, Mazda6, Honda Accord, Chevrolet Malibu, Nissan Altima, and Hyundai Sonata.\nReview: Toyota’s Camry is the best-selling car in America for a reason\nWhile the teaser only shows a sliver of the car, we can see cues like thin LED taillights, a trunk-mounted spoiler, strong and swooping character lines, fake rear air vents, and large wheels. If I didn’t know better, I’d almost call the image “exciting.”\nToyota has made some outlandish production vehicles recently, though not everything has received a warm reception. The new Prius, for example, is bold, but hardly beautiful. By contrast, the C-HR (due next year), wears its extreme styling quite well. It’s difficult to say from such a small glimpse whether the new Camry will be more of an experimental success or failure, but with Toyota’s competition taking bigger design leaps lately, you can understand why the conservative manufacturer is taking a risk.\nStyling aside, the new Camry will ride on the same modular platform that underpins the Prius – which is great news, considering that chassis is one of the best parts of the Prius – and will use both 2.5-liter four-cylinder and turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines. There are also rumors of a 3.5-liter, V6-powered TRD Camry to rival Ford’s Fusion Sport. The Camry line-p will be rounded out by a hybrid version due in 2018.\nFord’s 2017 F-150 Raptor raced at Baja, then drove straight home Apple Car rumor roundup: Here’s all you need to know about ‘Project Titan’",

      "title": "NextEV planning Tesla-rivaling SUV with Toyota price tag",
      "text": "By : Jeff Perez , Editor The first electric SUV could make its debut as early as next year. The arrival of the NIO EP9 electric supercar was… shocking, to say the least. With 1,341 horsepower (1,000 kilowatts) under the hood, and 0-60 mph (0-96 kmh) of about 2.6 seconds, it’s well within hypercar territory. But parent company NextEV doesn’t want its NIO brand to be known exclusively as a builder of high-performance vehicles. According to Automotive News , the company is allegedly working on a number of all-electric SUVs, MPVs, and even a sedan to compete with the likes of Audi, BMW, and most importantly, Tesla , but with a price tag that rivals offerings from Toyota. It will be \" as good as or better than the Tesla [Model X] but cheaper. It will be positioned at Audi and BMW but with a Toyota price,\" said NextEV co-founder Jack Cheng. The first example of the proposed affordable luxury car will come in the form of the ES8. That car is expected to make its debut at the Shanghai Auto Show in April, with U.S. sales expected to begin late 2018 or early 2019. Soon after the debut of the ES8, the smaller ES6 SUV will hit the scene sometime in 2018. The ES6 will rival current SUV offerings like the BMW X3 , Volvo XC60, and Tesla Model X, while the ES8 is expected to be a larger, possibly three-row offering. An ES9 is expected to follow, but there is no time table on when that model will debut. Though the company is still unclear on how it plans to go about building these upcoming new SUVs, it does say that it hopes to partner with a current Chinese car maker, likely JAC, one of the largest auto conglomerates in China today.",

      "text": "Learn More \nThere are many reasons Toyota’s Camry midsize sedan is one of the best-selling cars of all time, but none of those reasons relate to the car’s design. Camry buyers simply don’t care if their vehicle is striking; more important to them is a reliable, fuel-efficient, safe, and comfortable commuter vehicle. \nConservative styling has worked for Toyota for decades, but something about the teaser image of the 2018 Camry says the Japanese automaker is about to break new ground. Debuting at the 2017 Detroit Motor Show in January, the next-generation Camry will serve up a new challenge to its main rivals – the Ford Fusion, Mazda6, Honda Accord, Chevrolet Malibu, Nissan Altima, and Hyundai Sonata. \nReview: Toyota’s Camry is the best-selling car in America for a reason \nWhile the teaser only shows a sliver of the car, we can see cues like thin LED taillights, a trunk-mounted spoiler, strong and swooping character lines, fake rear air vents, and large wheels. If I didn’t know better, I’d almost call the image “exciting.” \nToyota has made some outlandish production vehicles recently, though not everything has received a warm reception. The new Prius, for example, is bold, but hardly beautiful. By contrast, the C-HR (due next year), wears its extreme styling quite well. It’s difficult to say from such a small glimpse whether the new Camry will be more of an experimental success or failure, but with Toyota’s competition taking bigger design leaps lately, you can understand why the conservative manufacturer is taking a risk. \nStyling aside, the new Camry will ride on the same modular platform that underpins the Prius – which is great news, considering that chassis is one of the best parts of the Prius – and will use both 2.5-liter four-cylinder and turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engines. There are also rumors of a 3.5-liter, V6-powered TRD Camry to rival Ford’s Fusion Sport. The Camry line-p will be rounded out by a hybrid version due in 2018. Also watch:",

      "text": "Toyota has teamed up with five Japanese power companies to offer plug-in hybrid connected power services using data from PHVs. It serves as a value added service that’s due to roll out following the launch of the new Prius PHV.\nIn their statement, Toyota shared their tie up with Tohoku Electric, TEPCO Energy, Chubu Electric, Kansai Electric, and Shikoku Electric to offer a new PHV connected power service. In other words, the EV-mode cruising distance, amount of electricity charged in one's home, as well as other information which is acquired by the data communication module (DCM) that’s installed in the Prius PHV are provided by Toyota to the respective power companies.\nCustomers can check their data online, and the service primarily seeks to reduce the environmental impact of vehicles by encouraging customers who drive the new Prius PHV to use the car's EV-mode for longer driving distances. So power companies are able to award customers with points, who in turn can use these points to pay their power bills or exchange them for various other products.\nToyota added that they would continue to analyse the data obtained from the vehicles and strive to offer potential services that could help the consumer and the environment.",

      "text": "Accra, Ghana - A middle-aged man driving a Toyota pick-up truck shouts political slogans into a loudspeaker while campaign music booms from the back of his truck for all to hear. As he barrels along a two-lane motorway in Ghana's capital Accra, pedestrians wave their arms and motorists blast their car horns. Despite slowing economic growth, high unemployment, an unstable power sector and allegations of government mismanagement and corruption, excitement is high in this West African nation in anticipation of the December 7 presidential and parliamentary elections.\nIncumbent President, John Dramani Mahama of the National Democratic Congress, and main opposition leader Nana Akufo-Addo of the New Patriotic Party are the leading candidates, although four other parties and an independent nominee will also be on the ballot. Akufo-Addo lost to Mahama in a hotly contested election in 2012 , after alleging fraud. The case was brought to the Supreme Court, which ultimately ruled in Mahama's favour.\nElections in Ghana are generally peaceful, but anxiety and tension lurk in the shadows in a country that is only a generation removed from the establishment of democracy. Although voter confidence in Ghana's independent election facilitator, the Electoral Commission (EC), is at an all-time high , opposition parties have fuelled distrust by questioning its credibility. \nAl Jazeera spoke to voters about the integrity of the upcoming elections and the key issues that have dominated public discourse in the run-up to the vote, including the economy, unemployment, healthcare and the state of the country's politics.\nJoseph Gumah, 25, nurse Joseph Gumah, 25, nurse [Brennan Weiss/Al Jazeera] \"The main problem Ghana in is that [politicians] promise things way beyond what they can do. They should begin to be very realistic about the policies they are rolling out.\nDuring the 2012 elections, the NPP promised free high school education. In a developing country like Ghana, I thought it would've been very tough to achieve that goal. If it worked it would be very good, but I think it was just a promise to get people to vote for them.\nNDC also promised that they would build 200 community high schools, but up to date, only a fraction of those have been built.\nI think we should vote based on the policies and ideas of the parties. I should be convinced by the ideas you are bringing onboard and not because my family or tribe is NDC or NPP. That way we can never change the situation. We have to be floating voters.\"\nEmmanuel Appiah, 31, delivery driver Emmanuel Appiah, 31, delivery driver [Brennan Weiss/Al Jazeera] \"When [NPP] was in power 8 years ago, I saw what they brought. They brought health insurance, school feeding programmes, capital and employment for the youth.\nNow everything is spoiled. The economy is very bad. The cedi to [US] dollar ratio is almost four to one. This government has borrowed enough.\nBased on what NPP did in the eight years they were in power, they will do much better than this president.\"\nAngela Akwei, 23, student Angela Akwei, student, 23 [Brennan Weiss/Al Jazeera] \"Some people are taking [the election] so personally, but I think it will be fine. We're looking forward to a peaceful and safe election and I trust the EC.\nI'm voting for NDC. I think our president deserves another chance. He needs time to be able to cover everything. You can't expect him to do everything you want him to do in a small or limited amount of time.\nI believe he will fulfil every objective he's laid out. He's been able to build more hospitals and schools, but he can work on increasing the salary of government workers.\"\nElizabeth Amoah, 24, self-employed Elizabeth Amoah, 24, self-employed [Brennan Weiss/Al Jazeera]\n\"The economy is not good, but I wouldn't blame it on the government. I think it's a worldwide problem. Still, [Mahama] is doing well. For example, when it comes to healthcare, he just opened Ridge Hospital [in Accra]. He has done what [former President] John Kufour couldn't do, or what [former President] JJ Rawlings couldn't do. He needs to be given a pat on the back, not insulted.\nThat's fine if the NPP wants to come to power, but they should at least say [Mahama] has done well. Everyone knows what Mahama has done is good, but the NPP is overlooking it and saying it's nothing.\"\nOwsunasah Collins, 32, clothing vendor Owsunasah Collins, 32, clothing vendor [Brennan Weiss/Al Jazeera] \"Due to the economic hardships, I had to leave Kumasi and come to Accra. I had to divert my work from weaving kente to selling second-hand clothes from abroad.\nI believe in the policies of the NPP. They are going to manage [the wealth] very well. But now we are suffering because of mismanagement and bad leadership.\nBefore, banks were chasing people for loans with a low interest rate. Now, you dare not go for a loan because you cannot pay. You have to provide collateral security, but what can I use as collateral security? I have nothing.\nThe NDC only thinks of themselves. They've been squandering the nation's wealth. They keep on putting this nation into hardship. God has blessed us with so many resources like timber, gold, oil and diamonds, but we seem to not be making good use of them.\"\nMichael Agbetiafah, 25, student Michael Agbetiafah, 25, student [Brennan Weiss/Al Jazeera] \"One of the biggest issues is about the elections being free, fair and transparent. Opposition parties in Ghana are having doubts about the credibility, which to me shouldn't be so as they have been involved in all the decision-making processes regarding the election. But it's politics, so I understand.\nWe are also focusing on healthcare with regards to the National Health Insurance Scheme because its current status is not encouraging. Portable drinking water is also an issue that Ghanaians care about.\nAlthough there have been challenges, [Mahama] has been bold. That's one of the qualities of a leader. You must see beyond your challenges and be on your feet. I would say on the whole he has done well.\"\nDora Amankwah, 22, sales representative Dora Amankwah, 22, sales representative [Brennan Weiss/Al Jazeera] \"In Ghana, [politicians] are giving us big promises, but they just want our votes. Four years later they'll come again and tell a new story to get our votes. They start fixing the roads just when it's about to be elections. The leaders are power and money drunk.\nAs for me, I'm not schooling because I need money to continue my education. I'm working to save. The economy is bad. The money is under people's pillows and they're sleeping on it. If the politicians would sacrifice one month's pay, I'm sure Ghana would be a blessed nation.\nSo, I won't vote. Why should I queue at 4AM when [politicians] don't follow through with their promises?\"\nCharles Ofosu, 48, freelance photographer Charles Ofosu, 48, freelance photographer [Brennan Weiss/Al Jazeera] \"I hope this year we are going to change the government because there's no money in the system. We are suffering with all the school fees, light bills and water bills. Our youth are roaming about without work, so we need someone who will give them jobs.\nWith the NPP, we will have free senior high school, which will benefit me because I will get something small to support my children since they are about to enter high school.\nIf Mahama wins, we are going to suffer more. Day in and day out, things are getting worse. A few are enjoying [the economy], but the vast majority is suffering.\"\nJennifer Acheampong, 32, beautician Jennifer Acheampong, 32, beautician [Brennan Weiss/Al Jazeera] \"I don't think the best party is in power, so I want to see a change in this election. Things are very difficult. It's not like it used to be.\nThe government keeps taking taxes from us, but I don't know what they're using it for. They say they're using it for the roads, schools and hospitals, but I only see them fixing some of that.\nI want to see what the NPP can do, especially with its plans to build one dam in every village. There are some villages that don't have access to water. They have to fetch water from the ground, which isn't healthy.\nI'm also hoping food prices will reduce. I'm ready to vote to see change in Ghana.\"\nLeonel Japhet, 23, barista Leonel Japhet, 23, barista [Brennan Weiss/Al Jazeera] \"For most of us graduates, there are no good jobs. That's the biggest issue people are facing.\nThe currency is also not doing well and electricity is unreliable. You buy pre-paid electricity and, in the blink of an eye, it's gone. In the beginning [the power] was really bad. The light would go on and off all the time, but things are changing. \nI think Mahama is investing in the country. It's like a business. You have to invest in your business without expecting to gain an immediate profit. Then later, it will be successful.\nFor politics, it's the same. And at the end of the day, it's just an election. Someone is going to lose, so I don't think there should be any conflict.\"\nSource: Al Jazeera",

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nTOKYO Toyota Motor Corp on Tuesday said it would expand the development of its gasoline-hybrid technology over the next five years to speed up the introduction of lower-emission engines in the face of stricter global emissions standards. \nThe announcement was the latest by the Japanese firm aimed at making \"greener\" cars as global automakers face tighter regulations in China, the United States and other regions that will require more environment-friendly cars in the coming years. \nIn addition to improving the efficiency of its hybrid systems and gasoline engines, Toyota is stepping up the development of longer-range battery-electric cars in a shift from its strategy of promoting hydrogen fuel-cell technology as the future of zero-emission vehicles. \nToyota said it would expand personnel on its hybrid technology development team by 30 percent through 2021, by which time it aims to introduce 19 new lower-emission powertrain components made on its recently introduced common manufacturing platform. \nBy 2021, at least 60 percent of Toyota vehicles sold in Japan, the U.S., Europe and China will feature new powertrain components which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent or more compared with the average amount of emissions of vehicles sold in 2015, the automaker said. \nToyota is speeding up the development of lower-emission cars, last month appointing President Akio Toyoda to lead a new electric car division to accelerate the development of battery-powered cars. \nToyota has pledged to reduce global average CO2 emissions of its new vehicles by around 90 percent by 2050. \nTo this end, Toshiyuki Mizushima, president of Toyota's powertrain division, told reporters at a strategy briefing that he expected the take-up of hybrid vehicles to increase, accounting for around 20 percent of Toyota's global annual vehicle sales by 2025, from around 10 percent now. \nWhile Toyota invests heavily in alternatives to conventional engines, it believes gasoline engines and hybrid systems will play a large role in the medium term as it will take \"quite some time\" for electric cars to become a common sight on roads and highways around the world, given their limited driving range and charging infrastructure. \n(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Christopher Cushing) Next In Technology News",

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon A \nTOKYO: Toyota Motor Corp on Tuesday said it would expand the development of its gasoline-hybrid technology over the next five years to speed up the introduction of lower-emission engines in the face of stricter global emissions standards. \nThe announcement was the latest by the Japanese firm aimed at making \"greener\" cars as global automakers face tighter regulations in China, the United States and other regions that will require more environment-friendly cars in the coming years. \nIn addition to improving the efficiency of its hybrid systems and gasoline engines, Toyota is stepping up the development of longer-range battery-electric cars in a shift from its strategy of promoting hydrogen fuel-cell technology as the future of zero-emission vehicles. \nToyota said it would expand personnel on its hybrid technology development team by 30 percent through 2021, by which time it aims to introduce 19 new lower-emission powertrain components made on its recently introduced common manufacturing platform. \nBy 2021, at least 60 percent of Toyota vehicles sold in Japan, the U.S., Europe and China will feature new powertrain components which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent or more compared with the average amount of emissions of vehicles sold in 2015, the automaker said. \nToyota is speeding up the development of lower-emission cars, last month appointing President Akio Toyoda to lead a new electric car division to accelerate the development of battery-powered cars. \nToyota has pledged to reduce global average CO2 emissions of its new vehicles by around 90 percent by 2050. \nTo this end, Toshiyuki Mizushima, president of Toyota's powertrain division, told reporters at a strategy briefing that he expected the take-up of hybrid vehicles to increase, accounting for around 20 percent of Toyota's global annual vehicle sales by 2025, from around 10 percent now. \nWhile Toyota invests heavily in alternatives to conventional engines, it believes gasoline engines and hybrid systems will play a large role in the medium term as it will take \"quite some time\" for electric cars to become a common sight on roads and highways around the world, given their limited driving range and charging infrastructure. \n(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Christopher Cushing) - Reuters",

      "text": "December 06, 2016 3:17am Comments Share: New Engines and Transmissions and Improved Hybrid Systems Also Reduce Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Toyota City, Japan, Dec 6, 2016 - (JCN Newswire) - Toyota Motor Corporation, in pursuit of superb driving and environmental performance, and based on the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) structural reform for making ever-better cars, has developed advanced engines and transmissions and further evolved its hybrid systems. Toyota intends to deploy these new powertrain units in a rapidly broadening range of vehicle models, starting in 2017.- Fundamental vehicle performance thoroughly reviewed in pursuit of better driving performance and better environmental performance. Under \"Direct & Smooth\" developmental theme, challenge taken up to \"change how Toyota cars drive\".- New powertrain units to feature in 60 percent or more of vehicles sold annually in Japan, United States, Europe and China in 2021, reducing CO2 emissions in those markets by 15 percent or more(1).Using TNGA, Toyota has been changing the automobile from its very structure, lowering hood heights, lowering the center of gravity and implementing other innovations to improve driving performance. To enhance fundamental vehicle performance in terms of running, turning and stopping, it initiated a comprehensive review centered on vehicle platforms and is now, since the release of the fourth-generation Prius in 2015, expanding the use of new platforms throughout its product lineup. At the same time, it has been developing new powertrain units, which form the core of an automobile, that significantly improve both driving and environmental performance.Toyota's newly developed powertrain units are light and compact and have a low-center of gravity. In-depth reconsideration of fundamental vehicle performance has resulted in engines with high-speed combustion and in highly efficient multi-geared transmissions. Furthermore, to standardize the basic structure of these new units, modular design (unified design) was used, building a foundation for the future making of \"well-built cars\".While it was a given that the new powertrain units would be designed to have a high level of environmental performance, development focused on achieving driving performance that would \"change how Toyota cars drive\", under the theme \"Direct & Smooth\".For Toyota, the starting point of making cars is \"fun to drive\" - the feeling of joy that comes when behind the wheel. Toyota aims to make cars with driving performance that responds to the will of the driver and are, at the same time, highly fuel efficient, among having other environment-friendly attributes. The new powertrain units announced today, in themselves, provide approximately 10 percent better power performance(2) and approximately 20 percent better fuel economy. Combining the new powertrain units with the overall evolution of the vehicle body, including aerodynamics, weight reduction and others, can open the way to even greater power performance and fuel economy.New 2.5-liter Direct-injection, Inline 4-cylinder Gasoline EngineToyota has named its new line of internal-combustion power plants \"Dynamic Force Engines\". To bring out the new engines' potential to the fullest, their basic structure was completely rethought using TNGA, and their overall structure and configuration were wholly innovated to achieve high-level driving and environmental performance. Work will continue to make the new engines even more advanced.The new engines employ high-speed combustion technology and a variable control system. They also achieve greater thermal efficiency, resulting in high output, due to a reduction in energy losses associated with, among others, exhaust and cooling systems and the movement of mechanical parts. Their lineup includes a 2.5-liter engine that has one of the world's best thermal efficiencies(3) - 40 percent when used in gasoline-powered vehicles and 41 percent when used in hybrid vehicles (HVs). This new, thoroughly reconsidered and greatly evolved engine features numerous new technologies, such as technologies for minute control that make it highly responsive and allow it to generate ample torque at all speeds.New 8-speed and 10-speed Automatic Transmissions (Direct Shift-8AT & Direct Shift-10AT)Toyota has developed two new automatic transmissions-the 8-speed Direct Shift-8AT and the 10-speed Direct shift-10AT. For both, various measures were taken to minimize energy loss and heighten transmission efficiency. Gear tooth surfaces were processed using a new technique for a lower coefficient of friction when the gears engage, and the configuration of the friction material used inside the clutch was optimized to reduce clutch torque loss by approximately 50 percent during rotation (compared to a conventional 6-speed transmission). These and other efforts resulted in achieving one of the world's best transmission efficiencies(3). The new automatic transmissions are more compact and lighter than comparative conventional transmissions, lowering a vehicle's fuel requirements. And their lower center of gravity results in both improved straight-driving stability and better cornering stability.Furthermore, widened gears and a newly developed high-performance compact torque convertor combine for a broader gear lockup range. The resulting quick and smooth response to accelerator pedal operation creates an \"as desired\" direct driving feel.In the case of the Direct Shift-10AT, even though the number of gears has been increased to 10 (compared to eight gears in the case of the Direct Shift-8AT), the use of close-ratio gears optimizes the range of use of each gear, particularly in the low-to-mid speed range. The resulting smooth gear changes, which are among the world's quickest(3), create a rhythmical and comfortable sensation that is suitable for a premium rear-wheel-drive vehicle.Through such measures, fundamental vehicle performance in practical driving situations ranging from driving around town to driving on the highway has been improved to a degree that drivers can distinctly experience. Smooth response to accelerator pedal operation enables \"as desired\" vehicle departure and, in overtaking maneuvers, it allows lag-free and rhythmical acceleration that meets driver expectations, even in cases of sudden and heavy accelerator pedal use.Advancement of Toyota Hybrid System II (THS-II)Applying size-reducing, weight-reducing and loss-reducing technologies used in the fourth-generation Prius, Toyota has enhanced its hybrid system for 2.5-liter engines and developed the new, high-performance Multistage THS II for rear-wheel-drive vehicles.THS II for 2.5-liter engines excels in both power and fuel-economy performance due to the synergistic effect of size-reducing, weight-reducing and loss-reducing technologies coupled with the high thermal efficiency and output of a new TNGA-based engine.Multistage THS II gives hybrid vehicles an all-new driving image with its start-from-stop acceleration performance and abundant direct feel. In addition to improving system efficiency at high speeds, intermittent use of the engine at high speeds has also been made possible, further improving high-speed fuel economy.The system for plugin hybrid vehicles (PHVs) has also been enhanced. A new dual-mode drive system allows the electric motor, which was hitherto used only as a generator, to provide direct driving power, resulting in powerful driving, even when in EV mode. Further enhancing the system for PHVs is a large-capacity lithium-ion battery that largely increases the EV-mode cruising range to 60 kilometers or more(4).Roll-out of New Powertrain UnitsThrough TNGA-based car-making, efficiencies have been achieved in the development of the base technologies of the new powertrain units, along with improvements in quality, making possible the concerted release of affordable, high-quality products. This will lead to Toyota being able to quickly provide its customers with ever-better cars and to further promote widespread use of environment-friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles.Within the five years to the end of 2021, Toyota plans to introduce 17 versions of nine engines, including the 2.5-liter engine announced today, 10 versions of four transmissions, including multi-geared automatic transmissions and a new kind of continuously variable transmission, and 10 versions of six hybrid systems.In this way, through TNGA-based modular development, Toyota will roll out numerous types of new powertrain units within a short timeframe, successively introducing them in various vehicle models, starting with the launch of a new-model vehicle in 2017.By the end of 2021, Toyota aims to have the new powertrain units feature in 60 percent or more of Toyota-brand and Lexus-brand vehicles sold annually in Japan, the United States, Europe and China. Toyota forecasts that Toyota and Lexus vehicles sold that year in those markets will account for a CO2 reduction in those markets of 15 percent or more, counting the fuel-efficiency-improvement contributions made by the new powertrain units alone.Review and Strengthening of Development Structure of Powertrain CompanyToyota intends to review and strengthen the development structure of its in-house Powertrain Company. Conventional engine-powered vehicles account for the vast majority of vehicles currently on the market, and HVs and PHVs, the advance of which is expected to continue, also have internal-combustion engines. In addition to promoting development of engines and transmissions, which are seen to remain mainstay for some time to come, toward the coming electrification of vehicles, Toyota is accelerating its development of hybrid technologies (electrification technologies), such as those used in electric motors, batteries and power control units (PCUs).1) Sharing technologies to raise the collective ability of the Toyota GroupToyota has long conducted research and development of key technologies and systems based on its stance to \"acquire through in-house creation\". The accumulation of knowledge, know-how and experience is what allows Toyota to turn failure into improvements. This approach has been the backbone of Toyota research and development and is viewed as why Toyota was able to develop a practical hybrid system, launch the \"Prius\"-the world's first mass-production HV, and develop and be quick to market with the \"Mirai\" fuel cell vehicle (FCV).However, Toyota realizes that it would be difficult to heighten the pace of development and commercialization of electrification technologies for further reducing CO2 emissions if Toyota addressed such as it has done until now, relying only on its own resources. Toyota will continue to carefully select that which it deems necessary to \"acquire through in-house creation\". But, from now on, it will also promote the sharing of technologies within the Toyota Group and increase the number of fields covered by joint research. It will strengthen joint development that uses cross-group obeya (project rooms with displays for sharing and reviewing goals, policies, timelines, progress and problems, etc.), efficiently use group resources to quickly establish advanced technologies and aim for increases in three areas: in the collective ability of the Toyota Group, in the speeding of development and in the scale of proliferation and expansion of environmental technologies.2) Strengthening the development structure for hybrid technologies, which are core technologies for electrificationKey hybrid technologies, such as those found in electric motors, batteries and PCUs, are also key technologies used in vehicles that are powered by electricity, such as PHVs, FCVs and EVs. For the electrification of vehicles, to greatly accelerate the development of hybrid technologies, which Toyota positions as the core technologies of environmental technology development, Toyota plans to increase its number of hybrid technology-development personnel. Specifically, it plans to reorganize its development structure starting in 2017 and increase its number of people involved in hybrid technology development by approximately 30 percent within the five years to the end of 2021. Beyond then, as well, it plans to further strengthen its human resources for hybrid technology development as needed.To contribute to the preservation of Earth's environment, Toyota is aiming to reduce new-vehicle CO2 emissions by 90 percent (compared to 2010 levels) by 2050. Based on its principle policy of conserving energy, which is the cornerstone of its development of environment-friendly technologies, by furthering the evolution of engines and transmissions and by promoting widespread use of HVs and PHVs, Toyota is endeavoring to improve fuel efficiency as a means of reducing CO2 emissions. And with a view to the future and an eye on limiting the consumption of fossil fuels centered on petroleum, to respond to the diversification of energy sources, Toyota is advancing its development of zero-emission vehicles, such as FCVs, which use hydrogen, and EVs.To further reduce CO2 emissions, Toyota is continuing its development of environmental technologies and its commercialization of environment-friendly vehicles from the perspective that environmental contributions cannot be achieved without widespread use of environment-friendly vehicles.Going forward, through TNGA-based ever-better car-making, to accelerate the commercialization of ever-better cars that are both fun to drive and that contribute to Earth's environment and to accelerate the reduction of CO2 emissions, Toyota will strengthen its undertakings by rallying the collective ability of the Toyota Group.(1) Comparison of average amount of CO2 emitted by Toyota and Lexus vehicles actually sold in 2015 in Japan, United States, Europe and China and average amount of CO2 emitted by Toyota and Lexus vehicles planned to be sold in 2021 in Japan, United States, Europe and China, including vehicles equipped with newly developed powertrain unitsEstimated CO2-reduction contribution made only by newly developed powertrain units based on certified data in each country or region(2) In terms of time needed for a gasoline-powered vehicle to accelerate from 0 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour and for a hybrid vehicle to accelerate from 40km/h to 70km/h(3) As of November 2016, according to Toyota survey(4) Developmental target value (in the JC08 test cycle); measured by ToyotaAbout ToyotaSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products.

      "text": "Tokyo: Toyota Motor Corp on Tuesday said it would expand the development of its gasoline-hybrid technology over the next five years to speed up the introduction of lower-emission engines in the face of stricter global emissions standards.\nThe announcement was the latest by the Japanese firm aimed at making \"greener\" cars as global automakers face tighter regulations in China, the United States and other regions that will require more environment-friendly cars in the coming years.\nIn addition to improving the efficiency of its hybrid systems and gasoline engines, Toyota is stepping up the development of longer-range battery-electric cars in a shift from its strategy of promoting hydrogen fuel-cell technology as the future of zero-emission vehicles.\nBoosting hybrid manpower\nToyota said it would expand personnel on its hybrid technology development team by 30 percent through 2021, by which time it aims to introduce 19 new lower-emission powertrain components made on its recently introduced common manufacturing platform.\nBy 2021, at least 60 percent of Toyota vehicles sold in Japan, the US, Europe and China will feature new powertrain components which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent or more compared with the average amount of emissions of vehicles sold in 2015, the automaker said.\nToyota is speeding up the development of lower-emission cars, last month appointing President Akio Toyoda to lead a new electric car division to accelerate the development of battery-powered cars.\nToyota has pledged to reduce global average CO2 emissions of its new vehicles by around 90 percent by 2050.\nTo this end, Toshiyuki Mizushima, president of Toyota's powertrain division, told reporters at a strategy briefing that he expected the take-up of hybrid vehicles to increase, accounting for around 20 percent of Toyota's global annual vehicle sales by 2025, from around 10 percent now.\nWhile Toyota invests heavily in alternatives to conventional engines, it believes gasoline engines and hybrid systems will play a large role in the medium term as it will take \"quite some time\" for electric cars to become a common sight on roads and highways around the world, given their limited driving range and charging infrastructure.",

      "text": "  \nIf the Lexus Sriracha IS wasn’t your flavor, Toyota’s luxury division has built another one-off sedan that should get your attention, and possibly the attention of astronauts in low Earth orbit. The Lexus LIT IS uses 41,999 LEDs to display graphics, pulse in time to music, and respond to human gestures. \nBuilt in collaboration with online music distributor VEVO, the LIT IS started life as a 2017 IS sedan , but was wrapped in programmable LEDs to turn it into a rolling screen. The LEDs were applied by hand and required 5,280 feet of wire. If the strips were placed end to end, they’d extend nearly half a mile, according to Lexus. When all the lights are fully lit, the car produces 175,000 lumens. In a video, Lexus demonstrates how the lights can react to certain gestures. For example, a pushing motion sends a ripple through the car’s body, changing the lights’ color as it passes. The car can also illuminate and pulse in sync to music, displaying custom animations to the beat of your favorite song. \nThe LIT IS stars in a new music video by U.K. artist Dua Lipa, alongside actor Ansel Elgort of “Divergent” fame. Check out both videos below to see the LIT IS do its thing. \nSource: Lexus",

      "text": "TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. said today it would expand the development of its gasoline-hybrid technology over the next five years to speed up the introduction of lower-emission engines in the face of stricter global-emissions standards.\nThe announcement was the latest by the automaker aimed at making greener cars as global automakers face tighter regulations in China, the U.S. and other regions that will require more environment-friendly cars in the coming years.\nIn addition to improving the efficiency of its hybrid systems and gasoline engines, Toyota is stepping up the development of longer-range battery-electric cars in a shift from its strategy of promoting hydrogen fuel-cell technology as the future of zero-emission vehicles.\nToyota said it would expand personnel on its hybrid technology development team by 30 percent through 2021, by which time it aims to introduce 19 new lower-emission powertrain components made on its recently introduced common manufacturing platform.\nBy 2021, at least 60 percent of Toyota vehicles sold in Japan, the U.S., Europe and China will feature new powertrain components which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent or more compared with the average amount of emissions of vehicles sold in 2015, the automaker said.\nEV unit \nToyota is speeding up the development of lower-emission cars, last month appointing President Akio Toyoda to lead a new electric car division to accelerate the development of battery-powered cars.\nToyota has pledged to reduce global average CO2 emissions of its new vehicles by around 90 percent by 2050.\nTo this end, Toshiyuki Mizushima, president of Toyota's powertrain division, told reporters at a strategy briefing that he expected the take-up of hybrid vehicles to increase, accounting for around 20 percent of Toyota's global annual vehicle sales by 2025, from around 10 percent now.\nWhile Toyota invests heavily in alternatives to conventional engines, it believes gasoline engines and hybrid systems will play a large role in the medium term as it will take \"quite some time\" for electric cars to become a common sight on roads and highways around the world, given their limited driving range and charging infrastructure.",

Toyota Motor Corp's logo is pictured on a car in Tokyo \nBy Naomi Tajitsu \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it will expand the development of its gasoline-hybrid technology over the next five years to speed up the introduction of lower-emission engines in the face of stricter global emissions standards. \nThe announcement was the latest by the Japanese firm aimed at making cars \"greener\" as global automakers face tighter regulations in China, the United States and other regions that will require more environment-friendly cars in the coming years. \nToyota is also stepping up the development of longer-range battery-electric cars, in a shift from an earlier strategy of promoting hydrogen fuel-cell technology as the future of zero-emission vehicles. \n\"We need to take an aggressive approach to deal with changing regulations,\" Toshiyuki Mizushima, president of Toyota's powertrain division, told reporters at a briefing. \nToyota said it would expand personnel on its hybrid technology development team by 30 percent through 2021, by which time it aims to introduce 19 new lower-emission powertrain components made on its recently introduced common manufacturing platform. \nBy 2021, at least 60 percent of Toyota vehicles sold in Japan, the United States, Europe and China will feature new components which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent or more compared with the average amount of emissions of vehicles sold in 2015, the automaker said. \nToyota's hybrid push comes as regulators require automakers to produce more electric cars, while hybrid technology, introduced in the Toyota Prius nearly 20 years ago, is increasingly considered as conventional technology. \nBut Mizushima said that hybrid technology would be key to developing more zero-emission vehicles. \n\"The core technology of plug-in hybrids and electric and fuel-cell vehicles is based on hybrid technology. By increasing our hybrid team, we can leverage new developments for use in electric powertrains,\" he said. \nToyota is speeding up the development of lower-emission cars, last month appointing President Akio Toyoda to lead a new electric car division to accelerate the development of battery-powered cars. \nThe automaker, which sells around 10 million vehicles a year, has pledged to reduce global average CO2 emissions of its new vehicles by around 90 percent by 2050. \nTowards this end, Mizushima said that he expected the take-up of hybrid vehicles to increase, accounting for around 20 percent of Toyota's global annual vehicle sales by 2025, from around 10 percent now.

      "text": "Toyota Develops TNGA-based Powertrain Units for Smooth, Responsive, 'As Desired' Driving New Engines and Transmissions and Improved Hybrid Systems Also Reduce Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Fundamental vehicle performance thoroughly reviewed in pursuit of better driving performance and better environmental performance. Under \"Direct & Smooth\" developmental theme, challenge taken up to \"change how Toyota cars drive\". New powertrain units to feature in 60 percent or more of vehicles sold annually in Japan, United States, Europe and China in 2021, reducing CO 2 emissions in those markets by 15 percent or more *1 . December 06, 2016 Toyota City, Japan, December 6, 2016 -- Toyota Motor Corporation, in pursuit of superb driving and environmental performance, and based on the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) structural reform for making ever-better cars, has developed advanced engines and transmissions and further evolved its hybrid systems. Toyota intends to deploy these new powertrain units in a rapidly broadening range of vehicle models, starting in 2017. \nUsing TNGA, Toyota has been changing the automobile from its very structure, lowering hood heights, lowering the center of gravity and implementing other innovations to improve driving performance. To enhance fundamental vehicle performance in terms of running, turning and stopping, it initiated a comprehensive review centered on vehicle platforms and is now, since the release of the fourth-generation Prius in 2015, expanding the use of new platforms throughout its product lineup. At the same time, it has been developing new powertrain units, which form the core of an automobile, that significantly improve both driving and environmental performance. \nToyota's newly developed powertrain units are light and compact and have a low-center of gravity. In-depth reconsideration of fundamental vehicle performance has resulted in engines with high-speed combustion and in highly efficient multi-geared transmissions. Furthermore, to standardize the basic structure of these new units, modular design (unified design) was used, building a foundation for the future making of \"well-built cars.\" \nWhile it was a given that the new powertrain units would be designed to have a high level of environmental performance, development focused on achieving driving performance that would \"change how Toyota cars drive\", under the theme \"Direct & Smooth.\" \nFor Toyota, the starting point of making cars is \"fun to drive\"?the feeling of joy that comes when behind the wheel. Toyota aims to make cars with driving performance that responds to the will of the driver and are, at the same time, highly fuel efficient, among having other environment-friendly attributes. The new powertrain units announced today, in themselves, provide approximately 10 percent better power performance *2 and approximately 20 percent better fuel economy. Combining the new powertrain units with the overall evolution of the vehicle body, including aerodynamics, weight reduction and others, can open the way to even greater power performance and fuel economy. New 2.5-liter Direct-injection, Inline 4-cylinder Gasoline Engine Toyota has named its new line of internal-combustion power plants \"Dynamic Force Engines\". To bring out the new engines' potential to the fullest, their basic structure was completely rethought using TNGA, and their overall structure and configuration were wholly innovated to achieve high-level driving and environmental performance. Work will continue to make the new engines even more advanced. \nThe new engines employ high-speed combustion technology and a variable control system. They also achieve greater thermal efficiency, resulting in high output, due to a reduction in energy losses associated with, among others, exhaust and cooling systems and the movement of mechanical parts. Their lineup includes a 2.5-liter engine that has one of the world's best thermal efficiencies *3 ?40 percent when used in gasoline-powered vehicles and 41 percent when used in hybrid vehicles (HVs). This new, thoroughly reconsidered and greatly evolved engine features numerous new technologies, such as technologies for minute control that make it highly responsive and allow it to generate ample torque at all speeds. New 8-speed and 10-speed Automatic Transmissions (Direct Shift-8AT & Direct Shift-10AT) Toyota has developed two new automatic transmissions?the 8-speed Direct Shift-8AT and the 10-speed Direct shift-10AT. For both, various measures were taken to minimize energy loss and heighten transmission efficiency. Gear tooth surfaces were processed using a new technique for a lower coefficient of friction when the gears engage, and the configuration of the friction material used inside the clutch was optimized to reduce clutch torque loss by approximately 50 percent during rotation (compared to a conventional 6-speed transmission). These and other efforts resulted in achieving one of the world's best transmission efficiencies *3 . The new automatic transmissions are more compact and lighter than comparative conventional transmissions, lowering a vehicle's fuel requirements. And their lower center of gravity results in both improved straight-driving stability and better cornering stability. \nFurthermore, widened gears and a newly developed high-performance compact torque convertor combine for a broader gear lockup range. The resulting quick and smooth response to accelerator pedal operation creates an \"as desired\" direct driving feel. \nIn the case of the Direct Shift-10AT, even though the number of gears has been increased to 10 (compared to eight gears in the case of the Direct Shift-8AT), the use of close-ratio gears optimizes the range of use of each gear, particularly in the low-to-mid speed range. The resulting smooth gear changes, which are among the world's quickest *3 , create a rhythmical and comfortable sensation that is suitable for a premium rear-wheel-drive vehicle. \nThrough such measures, fundamental vehicle performance in practical driving situations ranging from driving around town to driving on the highway has been improved to a degree that drivers can distinctly experience. Smooth response to accelerator pedal operation enables \"as desired\" vehicle departure and, in overtaking maneuvers, it allows lag-free and rhythmical acceleration that meets driver expectations, even in cases of sudden and heavy accelerator pedal use. Advancement of Toyota Hybrid System II (THS-II) Applying size-reducing, weight-reducing and loss-reducing technologies used in the fourth-generation Prius, Toyota has enhanced its hybrid system for 2.5-liter engines and developed the new, high-performance Multistage THS II for rear-wheel-drive vehicles. \nTHS II for 2.5-liter engines excels in both power and fuel-economy performance due to the synergistic effect of size-reducing, weight-reducing and loss-reducing technologies coupled with the high thermal efficiency and output of a new TNGA-based engine. \nMultistage THS II gives hybrid vehicles an all-new driving image with its start-from-stop acceleration performance and abundant direct feel. In addition to improving system efficiency at high speeds, intermittent use of the engine at high speeds has also been made possible, further improving high-speed fuel economy. \nThe system for plugin hybrid vehicles (PHVs) has also been enhanced. A new dual-mode drive system allows the electric motor, which was hitherto used only as a generator, to provide direct driving power, resulting in powerful driving, even when in EV mode. Further enhancing the system for PHVs is a large-capacity lithium-ion battery that largely increases the EV-mode cruising range to 60 kilometers or more *4 . Roll-out of New Powertrain Units Through TNGA-based car-making, efficiencies have been achieved in the development of the base technologies of the new powertrain units, along with improvements in quality, making possible the concerted release of affordable, high-quality products. This will lead to Toyota being able to quickly provide its customers with ever-better cars and to further promote widespread use of environment-friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles. \nWithin the five years to the end of 2021, Toyota plans to introduce 17 versions of nine engines, including the 2.5-liter engine announced today, 10 versions of four transmissions, including multi-geared automatic transmissions and a new kind of continuously variable transmission, and 10 versions of six hybrid systems. \nIn this way, through TNGA-based modular development, Toyota will roll out numerous types of new powertrain units within a short timeframe, successively introducing them in various vehicle models, starting with the launch of a new-model vehicle in 2017. \nBy the end of 2021, Toyota aims to have the new powertrain units feature in 60 percent or more of Toyota-brand and Lexus-brand vehicles sold annually in Japan, the United States, Europe and China. Toyota forecasts that Toyota and Lexus vehicles sold that year in those markets will account for a CO 2 reduction in those markets of 15 percent or more, counting the fuel-efficiency-improvement contributions made by the new powertrain units alone. Review and Strengthening of Development Structure of Powertrain Company Toyota intends to review and strengthen the development structure of its in-house Powertrain Company. Conventional engine-powered vehicles account for the vast majority of vehicles currently on the market, and HVs and PHVs, the advance of which is expected to continue, also have internal-combustion engines. In addition to promoting development of engines and transmissions, which are seen to remain mainstay for some time to come, toward the coming electrification of vehicles, Toyota is accelerating its development of hybrid technologies (electrification technologies), such as those used in electric motors, batteries and power control units (PCUs). Sharing technologies to raise the collective ability of the Toyota Group Toyota has long conducted research and development of key technologies and systems based on its stance to \"acquire through in-house creation\". The accumulation of knowledge, know-how and experience is what allows Toyota to turn failure into improvements. This approach has been the backbone of Toyota research and development and is viewed as why Toyota was able to develop a practical hybrid system, launch the \"Prius\"?the world's first mass-production HV, and develop and be quick to market with the \"Mirai\" fuel cell vehicle (FCV). However, Toyota realizes that it would be difficult to heighten the pace of development and commercialization of electrification technologies for further reducing CO 2 emissions if Toyota addressed such as it has done until now, relying only on its own resources. Toyota will continue to carefully select that which it deems necessary to \"acquire through in-house creation\". But, from now on, it will also promote the sharing of technologies within the Toyota Group and increase the number of fields covered by joint research. It will strengthen joint development that uses cross-group obeya (project rooms with displays for sharing and reviewing goals, policies, timelines, progress and problems, etc.), efficiently use group resources to quickly establish advanced technologies and aim for increases in three areas: in the collective ability of the Toyota Group, in the speeding of development and in the scale of proliferation and expansion of environmental technologies. Strengthening the development structure for hybrid technologies, which are core technologies for electrification Key hybrid technologies, such as those found in electric motors, batteries and PCUs, are also key technologies used in vehicles that are powered by electricity, such as PHVs, FCVs and EVs. For the electrification of vehicles, to greatly accelerate the development of hybrid technologies, which Toyota positions as the core technologies of environmental technology development, Toyota plans to increase its number of hybrid technology-development personnel. Specifically, it plans to reorganize its development structure starting in 2017 and increase its number of people involved in hybrid technology development by approximately 30 percent within the five years to the end of 2021. Beyond then, as well, it plans to further strengthen its human resources for hybrid technology development as needed. To contribute to the preservation of Earth's environment, Toyota is aiming to reduce new-vehicle CO 2 emissions by 90 percent (compared to 2010 levels) by 2050. Based on its principle policy of conserving energy, which is the cornerstone of its development of environment-friendly technologies, by furthering the evolution of engines and transmissions and by promoting widespread use of HVs and PHVs, Toyota is endeavoring to improve fuel efficiency as a means of reducing CO 2 emissions. And with a view to the future and an eye on limiting the consumption of fossil fuels centered on petroleum, to respond to the diversification of energy sources, Toyota is advancing its development of zero-emission vehicles, such as FCVs, which use hydrogen, and EVs. To further reduce CO 2 emissions, Toyota is continuing its development of environmental technologies and its commercialization of environment-friendly vehicles from the perspective that environmental contributions cannot be achieved without widespread use of environment-friendly vehicles. Going forward, through TNGA-based ever-better car-making, to accelerate the commercialization of ever-better cars that are both fun to drive and that contribute to Earth's environment and to accelerate the reduction of CO 2 emissions, Toyota will strengthen its undertakings by rallying the collective ability of the Toyota Group. \nTo download presentations and video, go to: http://newsroom.toyota.co.jp/en/detail/14391907/ *1 Comparison of average amount of CO 2 emitted by Toyota and Lexus vehicles actually sold in 2015 in Japan, United States, Europe and China and average amount of CO 2 emitted by Toyota and Lexus vehicles planned to be sold in 2021 in Japan, United States, Europe and China, including vehicles equipped with newly developed powertrain units Estimated CO 2 -reduction contribution made only by newly developed powertrain units based on certified data in each country or region *2 In terms of time needed for a gasoline-powered vehicle to accelerate from 0 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour and for a hybrid vehicle to accelerate from 40km/h to 70km/h *3 As of November 2016, according to Toyota survey *4 Developmental target value (in the JC08 test cycle); measured by Toyota Toyota's Approach to Developing Environmental Technologies Reducing CO 2 Emissions through Sure and Steady Steps and Widespread Application As fuel consumption regulations continue to strengthen in various countries, and as many automobile manufacturers advance their commercialization of electric-powered vehicles, such as plug-in hybrids (PHVs) and electric vehicles (EVs), Toyota is working to further evolve conventional fossil-fuel-powered engines and transmissions. The reason: To steadily promote reduction in CO 2 emissions. \nIn 1997, Toyota launched sales of the \"Prius\" as the world's first mass-production hybrid vehicle (HV). Now, nearly 20 years later, hybrid vehicles have gradually grown in use, mainly in Japan, the United States and Europe. But, on a global scale, they have yet to become widespread. The widespread use of PHVs and EVs, which have already been introduced, mainly in Japan, the United States and Europe, is expected to take time. The vast majority of cars in use or on the market are conventional engine-powered vehicles that consume large amounts of fossil fuels, such as gasoline and diesel fuel, and they will continue to emit large volumes of CO 2 , as from before. \nIt is expected that it will take quite some time for the proliferation of vehicles that use electricity?some of which emit very little CO 2 and some of which have no emissions at all?to make headway and for their effect on reducing CO 2 emissions to become apparent. Therefore, to be able to stop the advance of global warming, finding other ways of reducing CO 2 emissions, which are thought to play a role in the rise of global temperatures, is an urgent issue. \nFor the time being, the vast majority of cars in use or on the market will remain to be conventional engine-powered vehicles, and HVs and PHVs, the use of which is expected to increase, also have internal-combustion engines. As such, considering that fossil fuels will continue to serve as automotive fuel for some time to come, improving the environmental performance of engines and transmissions can promote a measureable reduction in CO 2 emissions that is proportional with an increase in the number of vehicles. Toyota believes that developing conventional powertrain technologies is a sure, steady, realistic and effective means of reducing CO 2 emissions. Further Reducing CO 2 Emissions through Fuel Diversification Beyond the reduction of CO 2 emissions through the widespread use of HVs and PHVs is the need to achieve zero CO 2 emissions. The widespread use of zero-emission vehicles, such as fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) and EVs, is a must. The only way to achieve such is to use non-fossil-fuel hydrogen and electricity as automotive power sources and to develop powertrain technologies for vehicle electrification, such as fuel cell systems, motors and batteries, and power control units. \nToyota believes that hydrogen and electricity are important alternatives to fossil fuels for use in automobiles. As such, it intends to advance its development and commercialization of zero-emission FCVs and EVs, which emit no CO 2 during driving and are effective in making large contributions to the environment. \nTaking into consideration the energy situation and fuel infrastructure in various countries and regions, as well as consumer preferences and other factors in the market environment, Toyota is endeavoring to promote the widespread use of FCVs and EVs, while considering the appropriate roles for each, and is aiming for even greater reductions in CO 2 emissions. \nHowever, the road to fuel diversification is not an easy one. Such cannot be achieved by automobiles alone. Essential is the existence of a supply infrastructure (fuel infrastructure) for new fuels that can allow peace of mind in the use of automobiles that run on new types of fuel. For energy companies, that means new investment. Support by governments and municipalities is also indispensable. \nAlso necessary is the understanding of society and our customers and their acceptance of new fuels. This is because new fuels are different in many ways?such as in terms of fueling locations, fueling times, fueling methods and fuel costs?from fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel, with which we are familiar after so many years of use. New fuels could also mean fueling that is not as convenient as that in the case of the cars our customers are using today. This means that \"diversification\" must apply to not only fuels but to customer values, as well. \nThis is especially true when it comes to FCVs, which use hydrogen?a fuel with which people rarely come in contact in daily life. Because hydrogen can be produced from various primary energy sources, beyond its environmental benefits, it is seen as an important energy resource that will be used in the future as a way to heighten energy security. FCVs, which use electricity created through a chemical reaction involving hydrogen and which can be driven without emitting CO 2 , have high potential as a form of \"the ultimate eco-car\". Toyota has been developing FCVs for more than 20 years. But issues still exist. These include understanding of hydrogen on the part of society and our customers and the availability of hydrogen stations. Much time is still required for the widespread use of FCVs and the realization of a hydrogen society. \nAware of such, Toyota was quick to initiate an FCV commercialization project, resulting in the launch of the \"Mirai\" FCV in Japan in 2014, followed by sales in the United States and Europe. Toyota has taken up the challenge. This is just the beginning of what Toyota sees as a long-running challenge to make a hydrogen society a matter of fact and to make FCVs everyday vehicles. \nToyota, while promoting efforts to conserve energy, intends to accelerate its response to fuel diversification and to work as one with the entire Toyota Group to achieve greater reductions in CO 2 emissions.

      "title": "Toyota Develops TNGA-based Powertrain Units for Smooth, Responsive, \"As Desired\" Driving",
      "text": "December 06, 2016 at 18:28 PM EST Toyota Develops TNGA-based Powertrain Units for Smooth, Responsive, \"As Desired\" Driving \nNew Engines and Transmissions and Improved Hybrid Systems Also Reduce Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions \nToyota City, Japan, Dec 6,   Toyota Motor Corporation, in pursuit of superb driving and environmental performance, and based on the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) structural reform for making ever-better cars, has developed advanced engines and transmissions and further evolved its hybrid systems. Toyota intends to deploy these new powertrain units in a rapidly broadening range of vehicle models, starting in 2017. \n- Fundamental vehicle performance thoroughly reviewed in pursuit of better driving performance and better environmental performance. Under \"Direct & Smooth\" developmental theme, challenge taken up to \"change how Toyota cars drive\".- New powertrain units to feature in 60 percent or more of vehicles sold annually in Japan, United States, Europe and China in 2021, reducing CO2 emissions in those markets by 15 percent or more(1). \nUsing TNGA, Toyota has been changing the automobile from its very structure, lowering hood heights, lowering the center of gravity and implementing other innovations to improve driving performance. To enhance fundamental vehicle performance in terms of running, turning and stopping, it initiated a comprehensive review centered on vehicle platforms and is now, since the release of the fourth-generation Prius in 2015, expanding the use of new platforms throughout its product lineup. At the same time, it has been developing new powertrain units, which form the core of an automobile, that significantly improve both driving and environmental performance. \nToyota's newly developed powertrain units are light and compact and have a low-center of gravity. In-depth reconsideration of fundamental vehicle performance has resulted in engines with high-speed combustion and in highly efficient multi-geared transmissions. Furthermore, to standardize the basic structure of these new units, modular design (unified design) was used, building a foundation for the future making of \"well-built cars\". \nWhile it was a given that the new powertrain units would be designed to have a high level of environmental performance, development focused on achieving driving performance that would \"change how Toyota cars drive\", under the theme \"Direct & Smooth\". \nFor Toyota, the starting point of making cars is \"fun to drive\" - the feeling of joy that comes when behind the wheel. Toyota aims to make cars with driving performance that responds to the will of the driver and are, at the same time, highly fuel efficient, among having other environment-friendly attributes. The new powertrain units announced today, in themselves, provide approximately 10 percent better power performance(2) and approximately 20 percent better fuel economy. Combining the new powertrain units with the overall evolution of the vehicle body, including aerodynamics, weight reduction and others, can open the way to even greater power performance and fuel economy. \nNew 2.5-liter Direct-injection, Inline 4-cylinder Gasoline Engine \nToyota has named its new line of internal-combustion power plants \"Dynamic Force Engines\". To bring out the new engines' potential to the fullest, their basic structure was completely rethought using TNGA, and their overall structure and configuration were wholly innovated to achieve high-level driving and environmental performance. Work will continue to make the new engines even more advanced. \nThe new engines employ high-speed combustion technology and a variable control system. They also achieve greater thermal efficiency, resulting in high output, due to a reduction in energy losses associated with, among others, exhaust and cooling systems and the movement of mechanical parts. Their lineup includes a 2.5-liter engine that has one of the world's best thermal efficiencies(3) - 40 percent when used in gasoline-powered vehicles and 41 percent when used in hybrid vehicles (HVs). This new, thoroughly reconsidered and greatly evolved engine features numerous new technologies, such as technologies for minute control that make it highly responsive and allow it to generate ample torque at all speeds. \nNew 8-speed and 10-speed Automatic Transmissions (Direct Shift-8AT & Direct Shift-10AT) \nToyota has developed two new automatic transmissions-the 8-speed Direct Shift-8AT and the 10-speed Direct shift-10AT. For both, various measures were taken to minimize energy loss and heighten transmission efficiency. Gear tooth surfaces were processed using a new technique for a lower coefficient of friction when the gears engage, and the configuration of the friction material used inside the clutch was optimized to reduce clutch torque loss by approximately 50 percent during rotation (compared to a conventional 6-speed transmission). These and other efforts resulted in achieving one of the world's best transmission efficiencies(3). The new automatic transmissions are more compact and lighter than comparative conventional transmissions, lowering a vehicle's fuel requirements. And their lower center of gravity results in both improved straight-driving stability and better cornering stability. \nFurthermore, widened gears and a newly developed high-performance compact torque convertor combine for a broader gear lockup range. The resulting quick and smooth response to accelerator pedal operation creates an \"as desired\" direct driving feel. \nIn the case of the Direct Shift-10AT, even though the number of gears has been increased to 10 (compared to eight gears in the case of the Direct Shift-8AT), the use of close-ratio gears optimizes the range of use of each gear, particularly in the low-to-mid speed range. The resulting smooth gear changes, which are among the world's quickest(3), create a rhythmical and comfortable sensation that is suitable for a premium rear-wheel-drive vehicle. \nThrough such measures, fundamental vehicle performance in practical driving situations ranging from driving around town to driving on the highway has been improved to a degree that drivers can distinctly experience. Smooth response to accelerator pedal operation enables \"as desired\" vehicle departure and, in overtaking maneuvers, it allows lag-free and rhythmical acceleration that meets driver expectations, even in cases of sudden and heavy accelerator pedal use. \nAdvancement of Toyota Hybrid System II (THS-II) \nApplying size-reducing, weight-reducing and loss-reducing technologies used in the fourth-generation Prius, Toyota has enhanced its hybrid system for 2.5-liter engines and developed the new, high-performance Multistage THS II for rear-wheel-drive vehicles. \nTHS II for 2.5-liter engines excels in both power and fuel-economy performance due to the synergistic effect of size-reducing, weight-reducing and loss-reducing technologies coupled with the high thermal efficiency and output of a new TNGA-based engine. \nMultistage THS II gives hybrid vehicles an all-new driving image with its start-from-stop acceleration performance and abundant direct feel. In addition to improving system efficiency at high speeds, intermittent use of the engine at high speeds has also been made possible, further improving high-speed fuel economy. \nThe system for plugin hybrid vehicles (PHVs) has also been enhanced. A new dual-mode drive system allows the electric motor, which was hitherto used only as a generator, to provide direct driving power, resulting in powerful driving, even when in EV mode. Further enhancing the system for PHVs is a large-capacity lithium-ion battery that largely increases the EV-mode cruising range to 60 kilometers or more(4). \nRoll-out of New Powertrain Units \nThrough TNGA-based car-making, efficiencies have been achieved in the development of the base technologies of the new powertrain units, along with improvements in quality, making possible the concerted release of affordable, high-quality products. This will lead to Toyota being able to quickly provide its customers with ever-better cars and to further promote widespread use of environment-friendly, fuel-efficient vehicles. \nWithin the five years to the end of 2021, Toyota plans to introduce 17 versions of nine engines, including the 2.5-liter engine announced today, 10 versions of four transmissions, including multi-geared automatic transmissions and a new kind of continuously variable transmission, and 10 versions of six hybrid systems. \nIn this way, through TNGA-based modular development, Toyota will roll out numerous types of new powertrain units within a short timeframe, successively introducing them in various vehicle models, starting with the launch of a new-model vehicle in 2017. \nBy the end of 2021, Toyota aims to have the new powertrain units feature in 60 percent or more of Toyota-brand and Lexus-brand vehicles sold annually in Japan, the United States, Europe and China. Toyota forecasts that Toyota and Lexus vehicles sold that year in those markets will account for a CO2 reduction in those markets of 15 percent or more, counting the fuel-efficiency-improvement contributions made by the new powertrain units alone. \nReview and Strengthening of Development Structure of Powertrain Company \nToyota intends to review and strengthen the development structure of its in-house Powertrain Company. Conventional engine-powered vehicles account for the vast majority of vehicles currently on the market, and HVs and PHVs, the advance of which is expected to continue, also have internal-combustion engines. In addition to promoting development of engines and transmissions, which are seen to remain mainstay for some time to come, toward the coming electrification of vehicles, Toyota is accelerating its development of hybrid technologies (electrification technologies), such as those used in electric motors, batteries and power control units (PCUs). \n1) Sharing technologies to raise the collective ability of the Toyota Group \nToyota has long conducted research and development of key technologies and systems based on its stance to \"acquire through in-house creation\". The accumulation of knowledge, know-how and experience is what allows Toyota to turn failure into improvements. This approach has been the backbone of Toyota research and development and is viewed as why Toyota was able to develop a practical hybrid system, launch the \"Prius\"-the world's first mass-production HV, and develop and be quick to market with the \"Mirai\" fuel cell vehicle (FCV). \nHowever, Toyota realizes that it would be difficult to heighten the pace of development and commercialization of electrification technologies for further reducing CO2 emissions if Toyota addressed such as it has done until now, relying only on its own resources. Toyota will continue to carefully select that which it deems necessary to \"acquire through in-house creation\". But, from now on, it will also promote the sharing of technologies within the Toyota Group and increase the number of fields covered by joint research. It will strengthen joint development that uses cross-group obeya (project rooms with displays for sharing and reviewing goals, policies, timelines, progress and problems, etc.), efficiently use group resources to quickly establish advanced technologies and aim for increases in three areas: in the collective ability of the Toyota Group, in the speeding of development and in the scale of proliferation and expansion of environmental technologies. \n2) Strengthening the development structure for hybrid technologies, which are core technologies for electrification \nKey hybrid technologies, such as those found in electric motors, batteries and PCUs, are also key technologies used in vehicles that are powered by electricity, such as PHVs, FCVs and EVs. For the electrification of vehicles, to greatly accelerate the development of hybrid technologies, which Toyota positions as the core technologies of environmental technology development, Toyota plans to increase its number of hybrid technology-development personnel. Specifically, it plans to reorganize its development structure starting in 2017 and increase its number of people involved in hybrid technology development by approximately 30 percent within the five years to the end of 2021. Beyond then, as well, it plans to further strengthen its human resources for hybrid technology development as needed. \nTo contribute to the preservation of Earth's environment, Toyota is aiming to reduce new-vehicle CO2 emissions by 90 percent (compared to 2010 levels) by 2050. Based on its principle policy of conserving energy, which is the cornerstone of its development of environment-friendly technologies, by furthering the evolution of engines and transmissions and by promoting widespread use of HVs and PHVs, Toyota is endeavoring to improve fuel efficiency as a means of reducing CO2 emissions. And with a view to the future and an eye on limiting the consumption of fossil fuels centered on petroleum, to respond to the diversification of energy sources, Toyota is advancing its development of zero-emission vehicles, such as FCVs, which use hydrogen, and EVs. \nTo further reduce CO2 emissions, Toyota is continuing its development of environmental technologies and its commercialization of environment-friendly vehicles from the perspective that environmental contributions cannot be achieved without widespread use of environment-friendly vehicles. \nGoing forward, through TNGA-based ever-better car-making, to accelerate the commercialization of ever-better cars that are both fun to drive and that contribute to Earth's environment and to accelerate the reduction of CO2 emissions, Toyota will strengthen its undertakings by rallying the collective ability of the Toyota Group. \n(1) Comparison of average amount of CO2 emitted by Toyota and Lexus vehicles actually sold in 2015 in Japan, United States, Europe and China and average amount of CO2 emitted by Toyota and Lexus vehicles planned to be sold in 2021 in Japan, United States, Europe and China, including vehicles equipped with newly developed powertrain unitsEstimated CO2-reduction contribution made only by newly developed powertrain units based on certified data in each country or region(2) In terms of time needed for a gasoline-powered vehicle to accelerate from 0 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour and for a hybrid vehicle to accelerate from 40km/h to 70km/h(3) As of November 2016, according to Toyota survey(4) Developmental target value (in the JC08 test cycle); measured by Toyota \nAbout Toyota \nSupported by people around the world, Toyota Motor Corporation (TSE: 7203; NYSE: TM ), has endeavored since its establishment in 1937 to serve society by creating better products. As of the end of December 2013, Toyota conducts its business worldwide with 52 overseas manufacturing companies in 27 countries and regions. Toyota's vehicles are sold in more than 170 countries and regions.

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters | December 6, 2016 : 5:43 PM MYT\n TOKYO (Dec 6): Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it will expand the development of its gasoline-hybrid technology over the next five years to speed up the introduction of lower-emission engines in the face of stricter global emissions standards.\nThe announcement was the latest by the Japanese firm aimed at making cars \"greener\" as global automakers face tighter regulations in China, the United States and other regions that will require more environment-friendly cars in the coming years.\nToyota is also stepping up the development of longer-range battery-electric cars, in a shift from an earlier strategy of promoting hydrogen fuel-cell technology as the future of zero-emission vehicles.\n\"We need to take an aggressive approach to deal with changing regulations,\" Toshiyuki Mizushima, president of Toyota's powertrain division, told reporters at a briefing.\nToyota said it would expand personnel on its hybrid technology development team by 30 percent through 2021, by which time it aims to introduce 19 new lower-emission powertrain components made on its recently introduced common manufacturing platform.\nBy 2021, at least 60 percent of Toyota vehicles sold in Japan, the United States, Europe and China will feature new components which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent or more compared with the average amount of emissions of vehicles sold in 2015, the automaker said.\nToyota's hybrid push comes as regulators require automakers to produce more electric cars, while hybrid technology, introduced in the Toyota Prius nearly 20 years ago, is increasingly considered as conventional technology.\nBut Mizushima said that hybrid technology would be key to developing more zero-emission vehicles.\n\"The core technology of plug-in hybrids and electric and fuel-cell vehicles is based on hybrid technology. By increasing our hybrid team, we can leverage new developments for use in electric powertrains,\" he said.\nToyota is speeding up the development of lower-emission cars, last month appointing President Akio Toyoda to lead a new electric car division to accelerate the development of battery-powered cars.\nThe automaker, which sells around 10 million vehicles a year, has pledged to reduce global average CO2 emissions of its new vehicles by around 90 percent by 2050.\nTowards this end, Mizushima said that he expected the take-up of hybrid vehicles to increase, accounting for around 20 percent of Toyota's global annual vehicle sales by 2025, from around 10 percent now.\nhttp://www.theedgemarkets.com/en/article/toyota-expand-hybrid-system-development-further-cut-emissions\nShare this More articles on Good Articles to Share >>\nAmerican shale companies' rush to hedge is turning the oil market upside down - Dec 06, 2016 Malaysia Airlines names Schrene Goh as new head of marketing - Dec 06, 2016 Trump's corporate tax holiday could spur pharma M&A - Dec 06, 2016 RAM reaffirms Danajamin's 'AAA' rating - Dec 06, 2016 Daimler may make electric cars in China to boost sales - Dec 06, 2016 China fund manager, arrested after market crash, admits to manipulation - court - Dec 06, 2016",

      "text": "Print This File photo A middle-aged man driving a Toyota pick-up truck shouts political slogans into a loudspeaker while campaign music booms from the back of his truck for all to hear. As he barrels along a two-lane motorway in Ghana's capital Accra, pedestrians wave their arms and motorists blast their car horns. Despite slowing economic growth, high unemployment, an unstable power sector and allegations of government mismanagement and corruption, excitement is high in this West African nation in anticipation of the December 7 presidential and parliamentary elections. Incumbent President John Dramani Mahama, of the National Democratic Congress, and main opposition leader Nana Akufo-Addo of the New Patriotic Party are the leading candidates, although four other parties and an independent nominee will also be on the ballot. Akufo-Addo lost to Mahama in a hotly contested election in 2012, after alleging fraud. The case was brought to the Supreme Court, which ultimately ruled in Mahama's favour. Elections in Ghana are generally peaceful, but anxiety and tension lurk in the shadows in a country that is only a generation removed from the establishment of democracy. Although voter confidence in Ghana's independent election facilitator, the Electoral Commission (EC), is at an all-time high, opposition parties have fuelled distrust by questioning its credibility. Al Jazeera spoke to voters about the integrity of the upcoming elections and the key issues that have dominated public discourse in the run-up to the vote, including the economy, unemployment, healthcare and the state of the country's politics. \"The main problem Ghana in is that [politicians] promise things way beyond what they can do. They should begin to be very realistic about the policies they are rolling out. During the 2012 elections, the NPP promised free high school education. In a developing country like Ghana, I thought it would've been very tough to achieve that goal. If it worked it would be very good, but I think it was just a promise to get people to vote for them. NDC also promised that they would build 200 community high schools, but up to date, only a fraction of those have been built. I think we should vote based on the policies and ideas of the parties. I should be convinced by the ideas you are bringing onboard and not because my family or tribe is NDC or NPP. That way we can never change the situation. We have to be floating voters.\" \"When [NPP] was in power 8 years ago, I saw what they brought. They brought health insurance, school feeding programmes, capital and employment for the youth. Now everything is spoiled. The economy is very bad. The cedi to [US] dollar ratio is almost four to one. This government has borrowed enough. Based on what NPP did in the eight years they were in power, they will do much better than this president.\" \"Some people are taking [the election] so personally, but I think it will be fine. We're looking forward to a peaceful and safe election and I trust the EC. I'm voting for NDC. I think our president deserves another chance. He needs time to be able to cover everything. You can't expect him to do everything you want him to do in a small or limited amount of time. I believe he will fulfil every objective he's laid out. He's been able to build more hospitals and schools, but he can work on increasing the salary of government workers.\" \"The economy is not good, but I wouldn't blame it on the government. I think it's a worldwide problem. Still, [Mahama] is doing well. For example, when it comes to healthcare, he just opened Ridge Hospital [in Accra]. He has done what [former President] John Kufour couldn't do, or what [former President] JJ Rawlings couldn't do. He needs to be given a pat on the back, not insulted. That's fine if the NPP wants to come to power, but they should at least say [Mahama] has done well. Everyone knows what Mahama has done is good, but the NPP is overlooking it and saying it's nothing.\" \"Due to the economic hardships, I had to leave Kumasi and come to Accra. I had to divert my work from weaving kente to selling second-hand clothes from abroad. I believe in the policies of the NPP. They are going to manage [the wealth] very well. But now we are suffering because of mismanagement and bad leadership. Before, banks were chasing people for loans with a low interest rate. Now, you dare not go for a loan because you cannot pay. You have to provide collateral security, but what can I use as collateral security? I have nothing. The NDC only thinks of themselves. They've been squandering the nation's wealth. They keep on putting this nation into hardship. God has blessed us with so many resources like timber, gold, oil and diamonds, but we seem to not be making good use of them.\" \"One of the biggest issues is about the elections being free, fair and transparent. Opposition parties in Ghana are having doubts about the credibility, which to me shouldn't be so as they have been involved in all the decision-making processes regarding the election. But it's politics, so I understand. We are also focusing on healthcare with regards to the National Health Insurance Scheme because its current status is not encouraging. Portable drinking water is also an issue that Ghanaians care about. Although there have been challenges, [Mahama] has been bold. That's one of the qualities of a leader. You must see beyond your challenges and be on your feet. I would say on the whole he has done well.\" \"In Ghana, [politicians] are giving us big promises, but they just want our votes. Four years later they'll come again and tell a new story to get our votes. They start fixing the roads just when it's about to be elections. The leaders are power and money drunk. As for me, I'm not schooling because I need money to continue my education. I'm working to save. The economy is bad. The money is under people's pillows and they're sleeping on it. If the politicians would sacrifice one month's pay, I'm sure Ghana would be a blessed nation. So, I won't vote. Why should I queue at 4AM when [politicians] don't follow through with their promises?\" \"I hope this year we are going to change the government because there's no money in the system. We are suffering with all the school fees, light bills and water bills. Our youth are roaming about without work, so we need someone who will give them jobs. With the NPP, we will have free senior high school, which will benefit me because I will get something small to support my children since they are about to enter high school. If Mahama wins, we are going to suffer more. Day in and day out, things are getting worse. A few are enjoying [the economy], but the vast majority is suffering.\" \"I don't think the best party is in power, so I want to see a change in this election. Things are very difficult. It's not like it used to be. The government keeps taking taxes from us, but I don't know what they're using it for. They say they're using it for the roads, schools and hospitals, but I only see them fixing some of that. I want to see what the NPP can do, especially with its plans to build one dam in every village. There are some villages that don't have access to water. They have to fetch water from the ground, which isn't healthy. I'm also hoping food prices will reduce. I'm ready to vote to see change in Ghana.\" \"For most of us graduates, there are no good jobs. That's the biggest issue people are facing. The currency is also not doing well and electricity is unreliable. You buy pre-paid electricity and, in the blink of an eye, it's gone. In the beginning [the power] was really bad. The light would go on and off all the time, but things are changing. I think Mahama is investing in the country. It's like a business. You have to invest in your business without expecting to gain an immediate profit. Then later, it will be successful. For politics, it's the same. And at the end of the day, it's just an election. Someone is going to lose, so I don't think there should be any conflict.\" Related Articles:",

Antuan Goodwin/Roadshow \nIf Toyota can sell this , it can do anything it puts its mind to. Photo by Antuan Goodwin/Roadshow \nToyota has finally seen the light and started work on electric vehicle development in earnest. But its bread-and-butter hybrids haven't been forgotten -- in fact, Toyota's speeding up their development, too. \nToyota said it plans to expand hybrid development over the next half a decade in order to keep hitting global emissions targets, Reuters reports . To make this happen, Toyota will expand its hybrid development team by 30 percent through 2021. \nThe goal is to introduce 19 new powertrain components that contribute to lower emissions. These updates will be added to Toyota's New Global Architecture, its latest modular platform that underpins just two cars for now -- the new Prius and the forthcoming C-HR crossover . Toyota claims at least 60 percent of its vehicles sold in major markets will have these new parts by 2021. \n\"The core technology of plug-in hybrids and electric and fuel-cell vehicles is based on hybrid technology,\" said Toshiyuki Mizushima, president of Toyota's powertrain division, at a press briefing. \"By increasing our hybrid team, we can leverage new developments for use in electric powertrains.\" \nToyota's plan also involves a greater market share for its hybrid vehicles. Hybrids comprise roughly 10 percent of Toyota's global annual sales right now, a figure the automaker wishes to double by 2025. \nThe hope is to reduce Toyota's global average carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 90 percent through 2050. That's a lofty goal, but if Toyota can convince people that the new Prius looks good, it's capable of just about anything. 28 Toyota C-HR looks outrageous, conceals practical side Share your voice",

The fuel-sipping technology could soon find its way into the majority of Toyota vehicles. \nReuters reports that the automaker took the time today to publicly affirm its commitment to green tech as emission regulations become progressively more stringent worldwide. “We need to take an aggressive approach to deal with changing regulations,” Toshiyuki Mizushima, president of Toyota’s powertrain division, said in a press conference. \nThe central theme of Toyota’s plan is to to put some extra muscle behind the development of a long-range pure EV, focusing less on the pipe dream hydrogen fuel-cell as the dominant power source of tomorrow’s emission vehicles. It also doesn’t hurt the company’s ability to fulfill its promise of selling of fifteen-million hybrids by 2020 \nMizushima believes that the commonality of hybrid vehicles will increase, eventually accounting for 20 percent of Toyota’s global sales by 2025.

Subscribe Toyota Power Train Company President Toshiyuki Mizushima (Picture: Bertel Schmitt) \nToyota introduced new powertrains at a press briefing today in Tokyo. If you expected the company to do away with valves, camshafts, and exhaust pipes, you went away disappointed. If you wanted to hear how to wring the last ounce of power out of every drop of gasoline, the this was the event to be. \nThis morning, Toyota showed a new line of gasoline and hybrid engines, based on the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA). At Toyota, TNGA is the acronym for a completely revamped thought and production process, and the new engines do their part by delivering a low-center of gravity, 10% more performance, and 20% better fuel economy. The highly efficient 2.5 liter engine (Picture: Bertel Schmitt) \nA new 2.5 liter direct-injection engine, first in a series of power plants dubbed \"Dynamic Force Engines,\" delivers what Toyota says is “one of the world's best thermal efficiencies ― 40% when used in gasoline-powered vehicles and 41% percent when used in hybrid vehicles.” Thermal efficiency is the measurement of how much of the fuel energy actually is converted into motion. Until not too long ago, a thermal efficiency of 25% was considered normal, meaning that three quarters of the fuel put in the tank went to waste, it added to the greenhouse-effect without doing anything useful. \nWith a 40% thermal efficiency, Toyota’s new engines compete with diesel engines. Diesel engines are more efficient, but fell into disrepute due to dieselgate. Diesel engines also are more expensive to produce, and they will cost even more once they are fitted with exhaust systems that work on the road, and not just in the testing lab. \nThe industry is facing increasingly stringent limits on pollution produced by their cars. Last weekend, Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung published a list of automakers that will meet the EU’s 2020 CO2 fleet targets – or not. Per the list, Toyota, Renault-Nissan, Peugeot Citroen, and Volvo should meet the target. Everybody else probably won’t. “High penalties threaten, billions for some automakers,” the paper wrote. \nDieselgate made that problem even more painful. Especially in Europe, automakers planned to meet the targets by selling more diesel cars. Then it became known that while the diesel engine produces less of the carbon dioxide greenhouse gas, it also emits frightening amounts of cancer-causing nitrogen oxide. The days of the diesel engine appear to be counted, therefore, automakers performed a sudden pivot towards electric cars. ",
