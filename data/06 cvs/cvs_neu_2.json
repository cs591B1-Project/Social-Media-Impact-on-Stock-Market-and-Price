      "text": "How to Spend Less than $5.00 Rolling Rewards at CVS! November 26, 2016 Check out what you can get for less than $5.00 at CVS ! Roll Extrabucks to keep your final cost low. Just follow our step-by-step transactions each week, and you’ll be rolling rewards like a pro in no time. First, here’s what you need to know about shopping at CVS: CVS allows one manufacturer coupon and one store coupon per product. You may use CVS Extrabucks (EBs) in addition to these coupons. Extrabucks are rewards that are printed at the end of your cash register receipt. These rewards can be used on your next purchase. Remember, if there is a limit in the ad for the Extrabucks items, this limit is per household. One great thing about CVS is their rain checks which include the Extrabucks offers, so you can still get the offer when they have more in stock. Get your CVS ExtraCare card so you can enjoy these extreme savings. Be sure and read the CVS coupon policy . You can also go here to review the CVS How-To Video.

      "text": "Is It Time to Throw In the Towel on CVS Health Stock? newsfeedback@fool.com (Keith Speights) 1 hr ago \nWarren Buffett once said, \"Our favorite holding period is forever.\" Many CVS Health (NYSE: CVS) shareholders probably bought the healthcare giant's stock thinking that they might be able to buy and never sell. But even Buffett has sold his fair share of stocks well before forever arrived. Is it time now to throw in the towel on CVS Health stock? Image source: Getty Images. Too many problems \nEven though CVS Health beat consensus analysts' estimates in the last several quarters, there have been reasons for concern. Prescription growth has slowed. The company's retail business performed at the low end of management's expectations in the third quarter, due in part to lower customer traffic. CVS Health isn't seeing as much growth from its acquisitions of Omnicare's and Target 's (NYSE: TGT) retail pharmacies as expected. \nIf those were CVS Health's only problems, we probably wouldn't be talking about whether or not to sell the stock. The bigger issues lie ahead. \nWalgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) appears to be simply out-hustling CVS Health. Come Jan. 2017, all members covered by Prime Therapeutics will have to move their business from CVS to Walgreens. That's because Walgreens struck a deal in August with Prime, the country's fourth-largest pharmacy benefits manager, which is owned by 14 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. \nAnother CVS Health loss to Walgreens takes effect even sooner. Active-duty and retired military members and their families covered by Tricare won't be able to use CVS Health beginning Dec. 1. Walgreens again took business away from its main rival. \nThe Prime Therapeutics and Tricare defeats caused CVS Health to slash 2017 earnings guidance. Unfortunately, these losses are particularly damaging because they represent 40 million of CVS' most profitable prescriptions. \nWall Street was already expecting lower growth over the next few years than CVS has enjoyed during the last five years. Depending on what happens in Washington, expectations could be lowered even further. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump and the incoming Republican-controlled Congress have pledged to repeal Obamacare. If fewer Americans have health insurance coverage as a result of the demise of the health reform legislation, it could have a negative impact on CVS Health and other pharmacy chains. Fighting on \nDespite these real challenges, plenty of opportunities remain. The company expects average annual earnings growth of 10% over the next several years. That's not great compared to previous expectations -- but it's not horrible. \nCVS Health plans to begin offering a suite of bundled services to other pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) and health plans. These offerings could include MinuteClinic services, infusion services, and Omnicare long-term care services. The company also has kicked off an initiative to increase efficiency and lower costs. This effort especially focuses on leveraging technology investments to cut costs. \nSometimes getting kicked in the teeth brings out the inner fighter. That could happen with CVS Health. The company might have become somewhat complacent. Walgreens' wins should fire up CVS Health's competitive drive. \nLarry Merlo, CVS Health's CEO, hinted at the potential for acquisitions in his comments during the company's third-quarter earnings call. It's not hard to envision a smart strategic acquisition helping spark share prices once again. \nAs for a potential repeal of Obamacare, the impact on CVS Health depends on the details. Trump has spoken of his desire to replace Obamacare with something better. It's possible that the effect on CVS won't be all that bad. Look at the big picture \nInvestors should look at the big picture when it comes to CVS Health (or any other stock, for that matter). The company's dividend is an important part of that picture. CVS Health's yield stands at 2.27% right now. CFO David Denton underscored the company's commitment to increasing dividend payments each year in his remarks during the third-quarter call.

Could investors do better? Probably, but that's not a bad total return. \nThe stock is also cheaper than it's been in a while. I don't see it going too much lower, since most (if not all) of the negative factors impacting 2017 are already baked into the price. Throw in the towel on CVS Health? My view is to let the company keep fighting and see what happens. \n10 stocks we like better than CVS Health \nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "title": "The 'Coiled Spring' Of CVS",
      "text": "The 'Coiled Spring' Of CVS Nov.27.16 \nFrom 2005 to 2010 CVS the business performed quite well. \nHowever, the share price followed a different path. \nAfter 2010 the roles were reversed. \nLearning from this history could better prepare you for owning the security today. By the end of 2005, CVS (NYSE: CVS ) was earning around $1.40 per share and paying out a $0.145 annual dividend . If you fast-forward five years, to 2010, the company was earning around $2.70 per share and paying out a $0.35 annual dividend. That's a roughly 93% increase in a shareholder's underlying earnings claim and a 140% increase in their income. Given this impressive performance, you might suppose that the share price marched right along with the business results. Yet this wasn't even close to the case. The share price went from around $26.40 at the end of 2005 to just $27 by the end of August 2010. Earnings-per-share had compounded by 14% annually, the dividend grew by an average compound rate of over 19% per year, and yet the share price did basically nothing. The reason, at least at it relates to linking share price performance and business performance, is straightforward: valuation. At the end of 2005, shares of CVS were trading hands around 19 times earnings. By late 2010, shares were trading at just 10 times earnings. And for a lot of investors this is the sort of thing that can be discouraging. You see a business perform much better - making a whole lot more money and paying you quite a bit more - and yet the share price roller coasters up and then back to where it was. Suddenly five years are gone and so too, for the moment, is your capital appreciation. It's easy to get discouraged at this point, but the interesting thing is that this is usually when things start to get interesting. It's what I like to call the \" carry through effect \" or what Tim McAleenan Jr. calls the \"coiled spring.\" From 2010 through 2015, CVS would go on to grow per share earnings up to $5.15 and pay out $1.40 in dividends. The earnings figure equates to a total increase of 91%, or a compound rate of increase of about 13.8% per annum. If the valuation remained the same during the beginning and the end of this period, the share price performance would follow suit. Yet much like before, only in reverse, this isn't even close to what actually occurred. Shares went from $27 in August of 2010 all the way up to $98 by the end of 2015. The share price had increased 260% or at an eye popping compound rate of 29% per year. The business performance for CVS, at least with regard to earnings-per-share results, was nearly identical during the two five year periods: 93% growth and 91% growth. Yet the share price results varied dramatically. In one period you had basically no capital appreciation and in the other shares easily tripled and then some. Over the entire period things more or less worked out as you would have suspected: earnings-per-share grew by an average compound rate of roughly 14% per annum over the last decade and so too did the share price. Yet the sequence of this return was far from constant. Had I told you the business results beforehand, you would have been hard pressed to get the share price performance correct. Now certainly you can argue that there were concerns back in 2010. Indeed, earnings stalled for a moment - growing by \"just\" 3% and 4% in 2010 and 2011. There are always going to be concerns. The point is that the much lower valuation set up the \"coiled spring\" for exceptional investment results to come. Not only did ongoing shareholders capture business performance, they also got to see the earnings multiple expand as well. Especially with an above average growth firm, that's an excellent combination for wealth creation. (Albeit at the consequence of shareholders who sold out back in 2010, but a formidable combination for new and ongoing shareholders nonetheless.) I bring this up because the spring has begun to coil once more. At the end of 2015 shares were trading around 19 earnings again. As compared to the 5, 10 and 20-year historical norms in the 16 - 22 range for CVS, that wasn't unreasonable. Yet this past year shares are now down 24% and adjusted per share earnings are now expected to be ~12% higher. As a consequence you have a security trading hands at 12 to 13 expected earnings - the spring has been reset. At 19 times earnings you may anticipate share price performance that is roughly in line with business results. You could even bake in some prudence and suppose the valuation may compress a bit. At 12 or 13 times earnings, not only are you looking at capturing business performance, but your odds of seeing some sort of eventual boost from a higher earnings multiple has increased significantly. Once again there are concerns. This time the company has told you to anticipate only a moderate uptick in per share earnings (less than 1% using midpoints) for next year as a result of the projected loss of 40 million retail prescriptions. If this lasts forever it could be a problem. If it lasts for a year or three, the long-term potential could very well spell opportunity. It sort of reminds me of when CVS earned just a bit more in 2010 and 2011 and the valuation drifted materially lower. Thereafter the company returned to growth, and the coiled spring effect was in full force. Today management is still suggesting that the company can grow earnings-per-share by 10% over the long-term. Indeed, the intermediate-term expectation from analysts tells a similar story . Now certainly this does not mean that this growth has to formulate. CVS has seen this sort of thing happen before and grown tremendously thereafter in the past, but there's no requirement for this time to be the same. You should always take estimates with a side of caution, as we're simply looking at guesses about the future. Still, should your thesis be that CVS could once again grow the coiled spring effect starts to look particularly attractive. I'll give you a couple of examples to demonstrate what I mean. Suppose CVS were able to grow earnings by 3% annually, from ~$5.80 or so up to $6.70 after five years. With a future earnings multiple of say 15 - easily below the security's historical average but nonetheless reasonable - you'd be looking at perhaps 8.3% annual gains with dividends included. If CVS could grow by 5% per year and still traded at 15 times earnings, you'd be looking at 10.3% annual gains. And at 8% annual growth that equates to returns on the magnitude of 13.4% per year. And this is still below what many are anticipating (and prior to thinking about the possibility for a higher earnings multiple and / or faster dividend growth). The point is that the propensity for CVS the security to provide better results than CVS the business (whatever that may be) is now much greater. A lot of people get nervous around this time, but often its just when the spring has started to compress again. The timeframe is unpredictable, but from this starting place eventually share price performance tracking and catching up to business results can provide an outsized benefit.

      "text": "By Ashley Dejean \nOh boy, here we go. So Ricky Berry and his roommate, who are both black, went to CVS and asked one of the employees if they carried slice cheese . The employee said no before disappearing. Berry, his roommate and one other customer then looked around the store in Richmond, Virginia for about 30 minutes before a cop showed up . The officer then joined in the search for the missing employees. \n“He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start,” Berry told local TV station WRIC . \nEventually, the employees were found in the back of the store hiding in a locked room. After making a few calls, the officer told the customers they had to leave. \nIn one of the videos he recorded, Berry said, “We’re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding.” \n“He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us,” Berry told [WRIC] Reporter Jonathan Costen. “We had no idea what was going on.” \nYes, you read that right. Two black men walked into a store and wanted to buy cheese. That apparently scared the employees working there so much they hid and called the cops. Because racism. \nNow, we only have Berry’s account of the story, but here’s what else we have: the knowledge that society teaches us to fear black men . Oh, and that even someone like Oprah has a hard time spending money because of the color of her skin . \nWRIC reports that the employee who called the cops will be interviewed and possibly retrained, according to a CVS spokesperson who issued an apology about the incident.

      "text": "Is CVS Health a Buffett Stock? \nWarren Buffet likes to keep Berkshire Hathaway's balance sheet packed with cash so he can dive in and make a game-changing acquisition at any time. As of the third quarter, the conglomerate's cash balance exceeded $68 billion. So what companies could be on Buffett's radar right now? Is an Actelion Deal Good for Johnson & Johnson Shareholders? \nAnother huge biotech deal could be in the making. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) wants to buy Swiss biotech Actelion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQOTH: ALIOF). According to the Financial Times, however, Actelion is playing hard to get and prefers a partnership rather than acquisition. But would a potential buyout or more complicated combination be good for J&J shareholders? Latest Business Achievements",
