Trump had publicly blasted AT&T’s proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner  //usat.ly/2fCVdm7   Join the Nation's Conversation   What does Trump victory mean for AT&T-Time Warner? Edward C. Baig , USA TODAY 12:49 p.m. EST November 9, 2016 x Share What will a Donald Trump White House look like? Veuer's Josh King looks takes a closer look at possible cabinet picks and the history behind building a team. Buzz60 \nNEW YORK—Candidate Donald Trump had publicly blasted AT&T’s proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, saying the blockbuster merger concentrated too much power in the hands of too few. The question now is will President Trump stick to that belief? \nTime Warner (TWX) stock was down 1.32% in early afternoon trading. AT&T (ATT) shares on the other hand were up 0.74%. \nAs part of the stock and cash transaction announced last month, AT&T agreed to pay Time Warner shareholders $107.50 per share. \nAT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens told a Wells Fargo tech conference audience Wednesday that AT&T was “optimistic” that regulators would approve the deal. “From a company perspective, we really look forward to working with President-Elect Trump and his transition team. His policies, his discussions about infrastructure investment, economic development, and American innovation all fit right in with AT&Ts goals.” \nTime Warner declined a USA TODAY request for comment. \nGiven his background, the expectation is that Trump, backed by GOP lawmakers, will bring a pro-business bent to the White House, raising the possibility that his remarks against the deal may have been populist campaign rhetoric, especially since Time Warner owns CNN, and that he might be more inclined to move forward. That remains of course to be seen. \nSeveral Democratic leaders had also voiced opposition to the proposed merger. \nSays Recon Analytics telecom analyst Roger Entner: “I think we have to wait until we have an attorney general and new chief of the antitrust bureau because they’re taking the lead on this.” \nIf the deal does end up getting regulatory approval--a major if--it could close sometime late next year. \nEmail: ; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "Mark Cuban revokes credentials from two ESPN reporters for no good reason Now that Donald Trump has been elected President, there are several stances he took during the campaign to see if he follows through as the Chief Executive of the United States. One of them was regarding the AT&T purchase of Time Warner. During an October 22 speech, Trump fully addressed the idea: \n“As an example of the power structure I’m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN — a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” \nTrump has set his targets on the media throughout the campaign, in particular CNN which is owned by Time Warner as well as Comcast which purchased NBCUniversal in 2011. Trump said he would also look to break up Comcast saying it was too big. \nAT&T is hoping to purchase Time Warner to help it provide content for its DirecTV satellite system and DirecTV Now streaming service which is expected to launch later this year. \nNow, if Trump follows through, it could stop a wave of media mergers and acquisitions. But AT&T says it’s hoping that Trump will be amenable to its purchase. AT&T Chief Finnacial Officer John Stephens told investors that he’s still optimistic that the deal will be approved. \nThe AT&T deal has to await federal approval so we’ll see how a Trump Administration handles it, deciding to disapprove or to sign off. \nIf it goes through, AT&T will have a hold on plenty of content including sports programming like Turner Sports properties like MLB, NBA, NCAA Tournament and the PGA Championship and HBO Sports programming like boxing, Real Sports and documentaries as well digital properties like Bleacher Report and The Ringer. \nIt’s going to an interesting 2017 for deals. \n[ Bloomberg ] About Ken Fang Ken has been covering the sports media in earnest at his own site, Fang's Bites since May 2007 and at Awful Announcing since March 2013.

      "text": "Trump doesn’t like the media. He certainly doesn’t like media mergers. No AT&T deal for Time Warner. Also, Comcast breakup from NBCUniversal? share Photo by Darren Hauck/Getty Images Let’s get this big caveat out of the way: Donald Trump probably isn’t interested in the minutiae of being president — that is to say the actual, everyday management of the most powerful state on earth. His cabinet will end up exercising far more power than any unelected body ever has in the U.S. But it’s worth examining what Trump himself has said, since we still believe in the public process of a democracy — if he’s said it out loud, it’s fair game. It’s clear Trump doesn’t like the media. He certainly doesn’t like media mergers. In the first 100 days of his presidency, he vowed to block AT&T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner , arguing it “concentrates too much power in the hands of too few.” That makes Trump come across like a First Amendment evangelist, but more likely there’s a deeper, more personal animus motivating this position. Time Warner owns CNN, which he’s blamed for negative stories and for being in Clinton’s camp. The network became a prime target among Trump supporters in the last few months of his campaign as chants of “ CNN sucks! ” became a popular rallying cry at his events. ( There was another media chant, too .) Trump added: \"Deals like this destroy democracy.” He also said he’d break up Comcast and NBCUniversal (an investor in Recode owner Vox Media), with his campaign maligning MSNBC as a “Clinton megaphone.” To be clear, Trump does not actually have an ideology. He at once comes across as a pro-business outsider favoring lower taxes and less regulation, while also pushing the notion he’s a pro-consumer apparatchik looking out for a free and fair press. He’s neither. Trump is a vain pragmatist who simultaneously craves and reviles the media’s attention. This great Trump interview from a few years ago reveals just how obsessed he’d become after first seeing his name in print: “I loved it. ... I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that. I thought it was amazing. … It felt good.” Today, there’s little evidence he’s against the AT&T-Time Warner deal for the sake of democracy. Still, will it be blocked? As I outlined at the top, Trump may never actually follow through on anything he’s said in the campaign. If he does, Trump would have to create a new antitrust doctrine to block AT&T’s deal for Time Warner. Currently, the law and precedent are on AT&T’s side. The deal doesn’t change or limit consumer choice, what’s known as a “vertical merger,” so there isn’t, broadly speaking, a threat of creating a monopoly. The same logic was applied to Comcast’s ownership of NBCUniversal. I’ve talked before about why AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner doesn’t make sense , and by that same argument (that it actually doesn’t help AT&T), there shouldn’t be any regulatory reason why it shouldn’t pass. There is, however, a growing faction in D.C. that does favor a new antitrust standard for mergers: If the combination is too big, regardless of whether it maintains a consumer’s choice, it should still be blocked. James Stewart of the New York Times does a good job of outlining such a possibility . There are other media deals in the works that could also come under Trump’s gaze. Viacom and CBS are looking at a merger , and it’s likely Disney will look for some kind of deal as well, even if it’s unlikely to buy Vice . If Trump does go all out on AT&T (and Comcast), he’d be aligning himself with some unusual political bedfellows: Senators Bernie Sanders and Al Franken, both of whom oppose the merger. recode_divider",

Will Trump follow through on his promise to block AT&T's planned acquisition of Time Warner? Posted: Tags : AT&T - AT&T + When AT&T announced that it was purchasing Time Warner for $85.4 billion last month , Donald Trump promised to block the deal if he was elected president, saying that \"It's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" At the time, it seemed like a threat that AT&T wouldn't have to deal with. But following the shocking election results on Tuesday night, the carrier's plans now seem up in the air.One of the properties involved in the purchase, 24-hour cable news service CNN was decidedly pro-Clinton throughout the campaign. Trump could decide to block the deal just for revenge. In his original statement, he said that the AT&T bid for Time Warner was an example of how the \"power structure\" was rigged against him. Besides CNN, some of the other properties that AT&T is looking to pick up in the deal include the Warner Brothers Studio, HBO, TNT, TBS and 10% of streaming video company Hulu. Content is important in mobile, and the nation's second largest carrier would be picking up a treasure trove of content if the deal goes through.About 30 months ago, AT&T acquired DirecTV for $48.5 billion , picking up 142 million wireless subscribers and 38 million pay TV subscribers. In July, Verizon purchased Yahoo for $4.83 billion. \"From a company perspective, we really look forward to working with President-elect Trump and his transition team. Policies and discussions about infrastructure investment, economic development and American innovation all fit right in with AT&T’s goals…. We’ve been the leading investor in this country for more than five years running. We look forward with optimism to working with the leadership and providing benefits to our customers and shareholders.\"-John Stephens, CFO, AT&T Historically, Republican administrations have been pro-business and pro-merger. But Trump won the presidency as a political outsider, which means that past rules do not apply.",

      "text": "Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nBillionaire Wall Street investor Mario Gabelli said he's betting on approval of the AT&T and Time Warner merger, pointing to regulatory changes that may come under the administration of president-elect Donald Trump. \nIn an interview on CNBC's Squawk Box on Friday, Gabelli -- who owns stock in AT&T and Time Warner -- gave the merger a 70 percent chance of approval. He said the odds have increased because Tom Wheeler, the current chairman of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, will step down as part of the transition to a Republican president. \nGabelli is chairman and CEO of New York-based Gamco Investors. He owns 4 million shares of Time Warner and 2.9 million shares of AT&T. In a previous CNBC interview, he said \"we're a cheerleader for both companies.\" \nHe said he expects the AT&T-Time Warner deal to usher in similar large mergers and acquisitions. \nThe FCC regulates interstate and international communications by radio, TV, wire, satellite and cable. The government agency is led by five commissioners, who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Will FCC's 'serious concerns' derail AT&T's video service DirecTV Now? \nWhen a new president is elected, the makeup of the FCC shifts. It's customary for the chairman to step down and for the president to pick a new chairman of his same political party. Only three of the five commissioners can be of the same political party at any time. All of the commissioners have five-year terms. \nOn Wednesday, the FCC told AT&T it had \"serious concerns\" about an AT&T program that waives data charges for customers who use two online TV apps that AT&T owns. AT&T already allows the practice, called \"zero-rating,\" for AT&T wireless and TV customers who use the DirecTV app. The FCC said the practice \"may obstruct competition and harm consumers.\" It asked AT&T to respond to concerns by Nov. 21. \nWatch the video here:",

      "text": "AT&T agreed to acquire Time Warner, but the deal looks to be at risk. \nThe DirecTV acquisition is having a significant impact on the company's operating results. \nAT&T is a long-term buy at today's price. AT&T (NYSE: T ) has been in the news a lot lately, with the most recent buzz being about the proposed deal to acquire Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ), but the one thing that has not been widely covered is the fact that AT&T has been able to report impressive earnings results over the last two years while operating in a very challenging environment. Moreover, AT&T's fundamentals have greatly improved since the 2015 acquisition of DirecTV and it looks like this trend is set to continue well into 2017. One of the biggest takeaways from the last few quarters is just how impactful the DirecTV acquisition has already been to AT&T's operating results (more on this below). So, I question why management would want to significantly increase the company's risk profile by acquiring Time Warner at a point in time when AT&T's future already looks bright. Acquiring Time Warner could indeed provide some great long-term benefits (Liberty Media's Chairman Mr. John Malone seems to think so too ), but, in my opinion, AT&T staying status quo may be the best option for this company. If It Isn't Broke, Don't Fix It On October 22, 2016, AT&T reported Q3 2016 adjusted EPS of $0.74, which was in line with analyst estimates. For comparison purposes, AT&T reported adjusted EPS of $0.74 in the same quarter in the prior year. Click to enlarge (Source: Fidelity) This makes it the eighth consecutive quarter that AT&T has been able to meet or beat the consensus earnings estimate. In the most recent quarter, AT&T's results showed improvements almost across the board, but, in my opinion, the best is still yet to come. AT&T reported a ~5% YoY increase in revenue and ~2% increase in cash from operations, which were both positively impacted by the game-changing DirecTV acquisition . The DirecTV Acquisition Is Working, So Why Try To Mess Up A Good Thing? This acquisition has greatly impacted AT&T's operating results over the last few quarters, and this was again the case in the most recent quarter. Not only has the acquisition impacted AT&T's top line but it has also allowed for AT&T to report earnings growth and improve its cash flow metrics. Click to enlarge (Source: AT&T's Q3 2016 Financial & Operational Results Report ) The nine months ended September 30, 2016 ratio of 67% may not appear to be a great figure, but let's not forget that this same ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, which was the year before the DirecTV acquisition was approved/finalized, was over 80% . The improvements in the cash flow metrics are largely a result of management properly managing the company's capex and cost structure, which was a topic that was well-covered by management during the conference call . Management mentioned that the company is in line to achieve the $2.5b cost synergy target by 2017 and they highlighted the fact that the company was ahead of schedule in relation to the $1.5b cost synergy target for the current year. AT&T has steadily improved its cash flow metrics since acquiring DirecTV and management expects for the cash flow dividend coverage to be under 70% for full year 2016. However, the benefits from the DirecTV acquisition were not the only positive developments for the quarter, because AT&T again reported improving results for the international operations. International Operations, Already Showing Promise AT&T is still in the early innings of its international expansion efforts, but the company reported encouraging results again this quarter. The company reported over 700k net adds, which helped bring the total wireless subscriber number to 10.7m. (Source: Q3 2016 Earnings Presentation ) AT&T is building a strong foundation for its international operations and the company is already beating several internal targets/benchmarks. More importantly, the company's international operations are already becoming more profitable and the international cash flow metrics have greatly improved YoY (i.e. DirecTV Latin America is now cash flow positive). As I described in \" AT&T: The Path Is Becoming Clearer , \" AT&T has a real opportunity to grow the international operations into a material portion of the company's consolidated results within the next few years. So far, so good. AT&T is firing on all cylinders with the DirecTV integration going well and the international operations already showing promise, especially given the challenging wireless environment and the changing pay-TV space, but the one thing that could quickly change my positive view of AT&T's long-term business prospects is if the company takes on too much risk by adding Time Warner into the fold. The Deal Makes Sense, But That Does Not Mean That It Should Be Done The details of the T-TWX deal have already been well-covered here on SA (see here and here for two recent articles on the deal) so I will not bore you all by going over the same details. The biggest concern, in my mind, is the amount of debt that AT&T would have to take on to acquire Time Warner, but it does not stop there because this type of deal brings significant integration and operational risks that also need to be considered. At the end of the day, I do think that a T-TWX tie-up makes sense from a content standpoint (i.e. Time Warner's content would differentiate the DirecTV Now service from what competitors are offering/will offer) but I believe that the deal is too risky and that there are still too many open questions. That's why I think that the Donald Trump victory may be one of the best things to happen to AT&T investors ( full disclosure: I was not a Trump supporter but, as an American, I will fully support our soon-to-be president). The president-elect is likely to block the proposed deal and this should be viewed as good news for shareholders because it will not only save the company from a years-long battle with regulators on a deal that may not be approved (many are predicting that the deal will not be approved) but it will also prevent management from making a mistake that could have a lasting impact on AT&T's long-term prospects. Bottom Line AT&T has been able to report improving results over the last two years, and the company's future looks even brighter, so I have serious reservations about the Time Warner deal. On one hand, I am happy that management is not sitting on their hands while the pay-TV landscape is changing at a rapid pace, but, on the other hand, I do not necessarily believe that paying a steep premium for Time Warner is warranted. The DirecTV Now service appears to have promising prospects , so I would much rather see AT&T take the less-risky approach of licensing content instead of taking on too much risk by acquiring a large content provider. The DirecTV acquisition is already paying huge dividends and the international efforts are already bearing fruit so I believe that there is already a clear path for this company to create additional shareholder value in the years ahead. AT&T shares are up ~8% on a YTD basis, but there is still room for shares to run. As such, long-term investors should treat any significant pullbacks as buying opportunities.

      "text": "AT&T to Gain Unfair Advantage With Time Warner (T, TWX) By Richard Saintvilus | November 11, 2016 — 8:44 AM EST \nAT&T, Inc.'s ( T ) $85.5 billion blockbuster acquisition of media giant Time Warner Inc. ( TWX ) sent shockwaves throughout market, sending media investors scrambling to wonder who's next. \nAlthough there's speculation about whether president-elect Donald Trump could seek to block the deal, Federal regulators may take their time to review the possible unfair advantages AT&T would gain over competitors like Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ ) and Dish Network Corp. ( DISH ). (See also: AT&T CFO Says He Can Work With Trump .) \nSeveral AT&T competitors have already complained about the company's tactics that exempt its own video services from affecting its users' data plans. AT&T allows customers to watch video on DirecTV apps on their AT&T cell phones without eating into monthly data allotments. And the company is expected to do the same with an upcoming TV streaming service called DirecTV Now, for which it will charge $35 per month. \nThat's a massive advantage given that AT&T now owns DirecTV. In a letter to AT&T dated Wednesday, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said that the practice of exempting its users from data caps may ultimately hurt consumers. The FCC asked that AT&T reply to its concerns by Nov. 21. \nOn Thursday, AT&T said that the practice actually helps consumers, rather than hurt them, since they gain from watching video without using up their data. Any video provider can pay AT&T, \"at [the company's] lowest wholesale rates,\" to let customers watch without using up their AT&T data, said AT&T executive Bob Quinn in an emailed statement, according to the Associated Press. (See also: Can AT&T Fund Its $85.5B Time Warner Purchase? ) \nHowever, if AT&T also takes over Time Warner's video assets, it would give AT&T a level of strength to dictate not only data-plan pricing on the mobile side of the business, but it could also re-introduce debates over net neutrality . What's more, the deal now casts a shadow over the broader mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market. And how the deal unfolds may dictate M&A policies under this new administration. \nTime Warner shares closed Thursday at $86.33, down 0.31%, while AT&T shares closed at $36.57, down 2.32% Subscribe to News To Use for the latest insights and analysis Thanks for signing up to Investopedia Insights - News to Use.",

      "text": "Getty/Alex Wong\nAT&T wants to buy Time Warner in a monster $85 billion deal, but some are concerned the government, particularly under Donald Trump, will move to block it.\n“In an example of the power structure I’m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN — a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” Trump said while campaigning.\nAT&T, however, is telling Wall Street not to worry.\nAt RBC's recent Technology, Internet, Media and Telecommunications (TIMT) Conference in New York, AT&T management suggested there wouldn't be any trouble with the merger.\nThe FCC question One big reason AT&T is smiling is because the company believes the merger won't be under the jurisdiction of the FCC.\n\"The only scenario in which the FCC would have jurisdiction is if Time Warner transfers certain broadcast licenses to AT&T,\" RBC analyst Jonathan Atkin, who viewed the presentation by AT&T's Chris Womack and Michael Black, wrote. \"The company believes these licenses (primarily business radio licenses and licenses related to Time Warner’s ownership of the WPCN superstation) can be offloaded easily, obviating the need for an FCC review.\"\nThat would mean the merger would only need to clear the Department of Justice, which AT&T is optimistic about.\n\"The major difference between an FCC and DOJ review is that a DOJ review provides AT&T legal recourse while the FCC, if it chooses not to support the deal can defer the issue to an administrative law judge, a process that can last upwards of three years, usually resulting in the dissolution of the deal,\" Atkin wrote.\nAT&T likes its odds, and expects the timeline on the merger to be 12-14 months.\nWhy Time Warner? In the presentation, AT&T also outlined some of the rationale for the Time Warner deal.\nHere's the most interesting bit: \"AT&T hopes to strengthen its quad-play offering by zero-rating Time Warner content, which the company believes will provide consumers an incentive to adopt the AT&T bundle,\" Atkin wrote.\n\"Zero-rating\" is when wireless carriers don't count data used with certain streaming services against your data cap. So for AT&T-Time Warner, it could mean that you never have to pay for data to watch HBO. You won't have to worry about data overages when you're watching \"Game of Thrones.\"\nThis sounds great for the customer on the surface, but the FCC has said it has \" serious concerns \" about the way AT&T is using zero-rating, particularly with regards to its upcoming DirecTV Now streaming TV service.\nWhy?\nAT&T has said it will treat its rivals (and friends) equally when it comes to zero-rating. That likely means that every company, from Netflix to Showtime, will have to pay a certain fee to have their video zero-rated. No freebies for HBO. But since AT&T would own HBO, that \"fee\" money would just be shifting from one pocket of AT&T to another. That's a place AT&T could potentially act anti-competitively.\nAT&T provided a few other reasons for the Time Warner merger, as well. Here they are:\nAT&T thinks it could help reduce churn (cancellations) in its wireless business. It could help AT&T maintain control of content distribution in the face of potential rivals like Amazon, Google, and Facebook, as video shifts toward over-the-top (OTT) delivery. AT&T thinks it can boost ad revenue. \" In internal trials, the company has successfully increased sales of certain products by as much as 80% through targeted advertising,\" Atkin wrote.

      "text": "How the Time Warner Acquisition Could Benefit AT&T PART 2 OF 13 What’s the Advertising Outlook for Time Warner’s Turner Business? By Shirley Pelts | Nov 17, 2016 3:18 pm EST Reduction in TV advertising loads \nMany media companies like Time Warner ( TWX ) have been talking about reducing advertising loads on television. At the start of 2016, Time Warner said it intends to reduce ad loads on Turner’s TNT channel. It also intends to reduce ads on TNT’s three new dramas set to premiere this year. The company’s truTV channel has already been targeting the reduction of advertising loads by 50%. \nThe company stated at its fiscal 3Q16 earnings call that the responses to its reduced advertising strategy have been encouraging from both viewers and advertisers. Time Warner also indicated that advertisers are still willing to advertise on Turner networks mainly due to television’s wide audience reach and engagement. The company also stated that its program ratings are up and it has observed “higher consumer satisfaction and higher brand recall” among viewers. Advertising outlook for Turner \nTime Warner also stated at its fiscal 3Q16 earnings call that in fiscal 4Q16, it expects its advertising revenue at Turner to be flat. However, its scatter advertising market remains up, with the pricing of advertising slots on its television networks in the United States up in “double-digits over the upfront.” The company also indicated that in fiscal 4Q16, Turner’s TNT network will have “fewer hours of original programming,” which is expected to ramp up in 2017. \nTime Warner also stated that when it comes to international advertising revenues, based on current exchange rates, it expects currency fluctuations to have the same impact as in fiscal 3Q16. In fiscal 3Q16, international advertising revenues remained flat in fiscal 3Q16 for Time Warner’s Turner division. But excluding a drag of eight percentage points from currency fluctuations, it was up year-over-year in “high-single digits.” \nAs the above chart indicates, advertising revenues comprised 38% of Turner’s total revenues of $2.6 billion in fiscal 3Q16. Advertising revenues for Turner were $996 million in fiscal 3Q16.  [\"TWX\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Time Warner Inc.\"]}",

      "title": "Will the AT&T and Time Warner Merger Survive the FCC?",
      "text": "By Casey C. Sullivan, Esq. on November 17, 2016 2:58 PM \nLast month, AT&T announced plans to acquire Time Warner for over $85 billion. The merger, if allowed, would give birth to a massive new telecom and media Goliath, combining one of the nation's biggest content creators with one of its biggest content distributors. \nBut, like all mergers, AT&T and Time Warner will have to survive the scrutiny of antitrust authorities at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission first. And, because Time Warner is a media company, the deal could come under scrutiny from the   Commission, an agency Bloomberg describes as \" a graveyard for mergers .\" \nWhy Worry About the FCC? \nTime Warner's media holdings include everything from HBO to Warner Bros. to CNN to the Cartoon Network. A review by Bloomberg found that Time Warner has dozens of FCC licenses that would trigger FCC review of the planned merger. \nThe merger would be reviewed by the federal government, FCC licenses or not, but FCC could increase the likelihood that the merger will not be successful, since FCC merger review is considered particularly difficult, even \" Kafkaesque ,\" killing mergers by delaying them until they're no longer viable. \nA new Trump administration probably won't mean a friendly environment for the AT&T-Time Warner merger, either. On the campaign trail, President-elect Donald Trump promised to block the deal, saying, \"It's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\" That statement, as the Wall Street Journal notes , is in contrast with his pledge to deregulate the telecom industry, leaving many to wonder what position the administration will actually take. \nHow the Merger Could Avoid FCC Review \nFCC review is triggered if Time Warner transfers its licenses as part of the acquisition. To avoid that, the company could simply offload its licenses. Bloomberg presents one possible scenario: \nIn theory, Time Warner could sell its dishes to an unaffiliated third party and enter into a contract with them for the same services -- but in that case, the buyer would need to ask the FCC for a license to provide services in the same location over the same airwaves, said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, senior counselor at the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington. \nIt's possible the FCC would accept the application without a fuss, Schwartzman said. But, he said, FCC officials also might say, \"Wait a minute! We're not stupid -- you are evading this review.\" \nBut AT&T does see offloading those licenses as the most likely strategy to advancing the merger, it seems. The company presented that as a probable approach last week, according to RBC analyst Jonathan Atkin . Again, evading FCC review would be at the heart of that strategy. \n\"The major difference between an FCC and DOJ review is that a DOJ review provides AT&T legal recourse while the FCC, if it chooses not to support the deal, can defer the issue to an administrative law judge, a process that can last upwards of three years, usually resulting in the dissolution of the deal,\" Atkin says. With the FCC out of the picture, the merger is more likely to take 12 to 14 months to complete. \nRelated Resources:",

      "text": "President-Elect Donald Trump's picks to search for suitable nominees to staff top federal antitrust and competition posts are good omens for AT&T ( T ) and Time Warner ( TWX ) , the media giants who announced plans to merge last month.\nThe appointment of staunch conservatives to the transition team won't cheer liberals already distraught by Trump's election. But they do indicate that fair-minded experts in their field will be in charge of telecom and competition policy. They also should dampen fears generated by Trump himself on the campaign trail that he'll use regulatory powers to strike back at media outlets and company officials that clashed with him during the lead-up to the election. When the Time Warner deal was announced Trump said he'd have it blocked if elected.\nHeading the efforts to find a new Federal Communication Commission chair and advise the incoming administration on where it should take telecom policy is Jeffrey Eisenach. He is co-chair of economic consulting firm NERA's communications, media, and Internet practice and an adjunct economics professor at George Mason University Law School, where he teaches about regulated industries. He's also a Visiting Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\nEisenach has served in senior policy positions at the Federal Trade Commission and the White House Office of Management and Budget and served on the 1980-81 Reagan-Bush Transition Team on the FTC and the 2000-2001 Bush-Cheney Transition Team on the Federal Communications Commission.\nServing the Trump Transition Team on staffing the FTC and giving input on the Department of Justice's antitrust picks is former FTC member Joshua Wright, now executive director of the Global Antitrust Institute at George Mason University. Wright served as an FTC commissioner from 2013 to 2015.",

      "text": "Despite his campaign vows to block the deal, President-elect Donald Trump could be forced to take a friendlier stance on AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner than he initially laid out, analysts say -- potentially disappointing supporters who were hoping for a big showdown with the company.\nRegulators at the Justice Department are likely to examine the proposed deal closely no matter what happens. But a constellation of factors, from the makeup of Trump's transition team to the mundane details of antitrust law, may make it difficult for Trump to oppose the tie-up once he is in office. As a result, one of the earliest decisions to occur on Trump's watch may be the regulators' approval of the massive acquisition.\nTrump blasted the merger at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last month. \"As an example of the power structure I'm fighting,\" he said, \"AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\"\nTrump's critique of media consolidation is stoked by fears that the trend may suppress conservative voices. Trump has clashed repeatedly with CNN over its coverage of him, at one point calling the channel \"an arm of the Clinton campaign.\" He derided a CNN documentary about himself as a \"total waste of time\" and \"a joke.\" But by highlighting CNN -- which is owned by Time Warner -- as a reason to oppose the AT&T deal, Trump risks revealing a personal grudge against CNN's coverage that will not help his administration make an antitrust case, economists say.\n\"Personal vendettas can't be the basis that you take a case to court,\" said Hal Singer, an economist and senior fellow at the George Washington Institute for Public Policy.\nTrump has targeted other media companies, as well. On the campaign trail, Trump accused Comcast-NBCUniversal of \"trying to poison the mind of the American voter,\" adding that he believes the two companies should never have been allowed to combine. He has also said that Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon's chief executive and owner of The Washington Post, faces \"a huge antitrust problem,\" complaining of The Post's critical coverage and accusing Bezos of using the newspaper to benefit Amazon politically in Washington.\nAntitrust experts say these objections do not constitute a compelling antitrust case. In order to challenge AT&T-Time Warner, regulators would need to demonstrate that the transaction poses significant harms to the economy and to competition.\nBut Trump advisers charged with handling tech policy may not view the AT&T deal in a negative light -- highlighting tensions to come between an outsider candidate and the countless insiders who would likely staff the majority of Trump's administration.\n\"A lot of these jobs are going to go to establishment Republican types who, ironically, are probably going to just be a continuation of everything he's railed against,\" said one tech industry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak more freely.\nOne of Trump's earliest hires on tech, Jeffrey Eisenach, is a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, an elite Republican think tank in Washington. Eisenach's role on Trump's transition team gives him notable sway over the future of the administration's tech policies. The economic researcher's previous clients include the country's largest wireless carrier, Verizon, among others.\nAnalysts say he has spoken approvingly of big mergers in the past. Eisenach \"has been supportive of all the deals in the last few years, including the AT&T/[T-Mobile] and Comcast/Time Warner Cable deals,\" according to a recent investor note from the analyst firm New Street Research.\nThat could suggest Eisenach takes a similar view of the AT&T deal, though Eisenach did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\"Either there's going to be mass tension within his team, or he's going to sit back and let the [establishment conservatives] have their way -- in which case, all of his campaign rhetoric on blowing up Comcast and AT&T was just cheap talk,\" said Singer.\nAnalysts say AT&T was likely caught off-guard by Trump's victory. \"They made a calculated bet with the Hillary administration -- this is not what they expected,\" said Frank Louthan, an industry analyst at Raymond James. \"They may still prevail, but that was a shock.\"\nAT&T has said it stands ready to work with the incoming Trump administration and that their priorities appear aligned. \"We really look forward to working with President-elect Trump and his transition team,\" AT&T chief financial officer John Stephens said at an investor conference Wednesday. \"His policies and his discussions about infrastructure investment, economic development, and American innovation all fit right in with AT&T's goals.\"\n  Business Technology Washington Post Donald Trump",

      "title": "AT&T-Time Warner Deal Is Great For Long-Term AT&T Shareholders But Royally Screws Time Warner Investors",
      "text": "12.2% Click to enlarge \nThe big reason that I own AT&T is that besides the generous and highly secure current yield, I think that AT&T's future cash flows will be able to support much faster dividend growth . And since long-term total returns are a function of yield + dividend growth , that should help to accelerate AT&T's overall returns and make it a potential low-risk market beater. \nClick to enlarge Source: Simply Safe Dividends \nBUT even before this merger was announced I was fully expecting to have to wait until 2019 for AT&T to accelerate its dividend growth past the token $0.01/quarter per year we've been getting since 2009. \nAfter all, wireless telecom is a monstrously expensive industry, and AT&T recently spent $18.2 billion on AWS spectrum, $4.4 billion to expand into Mexican wireless (with another $3 billion in pledged infrastructure updates), as well as $49 billion to acquire DirecTV. All of this resulted in the balance sheet becoming more leveraged than management was comfortable with, as well as a credit downgrade from S&P (NYSE: SPGI ). \nSo AT&T dividend investors were prepared to wait a few years for management to complete its cost cutting and DirecTV synergies in order to raise annual FCF to $20 billion, knowing that much of that would have to be directed to paying down the debt. \nNow that we are trying to buy Time Warner, we have the potential to achieve far higher free cash flow than before, and in a less capital intensive industry, which is a great diversification move. \nBUT it also means that we are going backwards in terms of strengthening the balance sheet. In fact Moody's (NYSE: MCO ) is now considering downgrading AT&T's credit thanks to how much additional leverage this deal will require. For example, starting in 2018, the new larger AT&T will have more than $9 billion in debt maturing every year. \nCombined with the new $14.5 billion dividend, you can see that the vast majority of the projected $26 billion in annual FCF the company will generate will be spoken for. That's especially true now that interest rates are rising and the cost of rolling over AT&T's maturing debt will likely rise steadily over time. \nWhich means that, in the medium-term, ie next four to six years, AT&T investors shouldn't expect anything more than our annual $0.01 per quarter increase. Simply put, AT&T is paying a steep price to acquire quality, and faster-growing FCF, and we aren't likely to see dividend growth acceleration until the debt is brought down to a more reasonable level. \nTime Warner is selling out just as its hitting its stride \nTWX Free Cash Flow Per Share (Annual) data by YCharts \nOver the last few years, Time Warner has become very good at growing its FCF/share at a double-digit rate, which has resulted in nice dividend growth for investors of 11.2% CAGR. \nWhat's more, analysts were expecting Time Warner's dividend to grow at 8.1% over the next decade. And while such long-term forecasts always need to be taken with a grain of salt, in this case my own growth models agree that this is a pretty reasonable expectation. \nIn other words, Time Warner investors are giving up superior dividend growth potential in order to own shares of a much higher-yielding stock, but one that, even under the best-case scenario, can't hope to deliver the same kind of income growth. \nNow, theoretically on a total return basis AT&T might be able to achieve better long-term returns thanks to the hypothetical faster payout growth this deal MIGHT allow, when combined with the much higher current yield. \nBut that assumes many things, including that management achieves its targeted cost cutting/synergies, that AT&T's underlying businesses at least tread water rather than declines in the coming years, and most of all, that management doesn't go on another acquisition bender before the balance sheet is cleaned up. \nOr to put it another way, AT&T's current management seems to be trying to grow as quickly as possible and take on mountains of debt to do it. If the current trend of \"buy something big, pay off a portion of the debt, then buy something else\" continues, AT&T investors might be stuck with 2% annual dividend growth for 10 years or more as our debt levels continue to grow proportionally to our FCF. \nTrump threat is looking like it might have been hollow pandering \nIn an example of the power structure I'm fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN-a deal we will not approve in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few. -Donald Trump \nDuring the presidential campaign Donald Trump made a big deal about how he is against what he sees as too much media consolidation and would thus torpedo the AT&T-Time Warner merger. \nAdd to this the broader net neutrality concerns raised by AT&T's potential to zero rate Time Warner content, (not count it againt customer data caps), which the FCC sees as an obstruction of fair competition , and you can see why many investors think this is going to end up just another failed mega deal. \nHowever, in recent days several events have transpired that seem to point to a higher probability of federal regulators approving the deal. \nFor one thing, AT&T has said that it believes it can sell some Time Warner satellite liscences that might result in a deeper FCC review. \nIn addition, the proposed appointment of Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General has some analysts expecting a far more lenient M&A environment under a Trump administration. \nPerhaps most importantly, the appoitnment of anti-regulatory lobbyist Jeffrey Eisenach to Trump's transition team, (specifically to help determine a new FCC position on zero rating, and net neutrality), could mean that Trump's anti AT&T-Time Warner stance was just campaign bluster; rather than something he intends to follow up on. \nOf course either way, it will likely take until the end of 2017 for us to find out whether or not the merger will be greenlighted, which potentially means that both AT&T and Time Warner shares will be under pressure during this time. \nAs a long-term AT&T dividend investor I'm more than happy to wait for potential dips under $36 to accumulate to my existing position, because with or without Time Warner, AT&T remains a solid core high-yield position. \nBottom line: Time Warner's higher FCF margin and faster growth could EVENTUALLY end up helping AT&T to accelerate dividend growth, but long-term Time Warner investors have less reason to cheer \nDon't get me wrong, there is still a significant risk that the Trump administration doesn't approve this deal. From the point of view of long-term dividend growth investors, Time Warner investors would likely benefit from such a scenario thanks to a faster dividend growth rate that would likely translate to superior long-term total returns. \nMeanwhile AT&T investors are, theoretically, getting the better end of this deal, assuming it winds up happening. And as long as management eventually solidifies the balance sheet, and diverts our growing river of FCF towards faster dividend growth, we are likely to do very well, especially at today's low share price, which makes for a an attractive price to add to our positions.

      "text": "Key Analysis of AT&T’s Acquisition of Time Warner PART 2 OF 14 How Will Time Warner’s Acquisition Help AT&T with Advertising? By Shirley Pelts | Nov 22, 2016 9:36 pm EST Advertising outlook for Time Warner \nIn the previous part of this series, we saw how Time Warner’s ( TWX ) premium content has been a key factor in AT&T’s (T) acquisition of the company. In this part of the series, we’ll look at the advertising outlook for the proposed combined AT&T–Time Warner entity. \nTime Warner ( TWX ) stated in its fiscal 3Q16 earnings call that in fiscal 4Q16, it expects advertising revenue for the Turner cable network to be flat. However, its scatter advertising market is still up, with the pricing of advertising slots on its television networks in the United States in the “double-digits over the upfront.” The company also indicated that in fiscal 4Q16, Turner’s TNT network will have “fewer hours of original programming,” which is expected to ramp up in 2017. \nTime Warner also stated that when it comes to international advertising revenues, based on current exchange rates, it expects currency fluctuations to have the same impact as in fiscal 3Q16. In that quarter, international advertising revenues remained flat for Time Warner’s Turner division. But excluding an 8% drag from currency fluctuations, it was up year-over-year in the high single digits. \nAs the above graph shows, advertising revenues comprised 38.0% of Turner’s total revenues of $2.6 billion in fiscal 3Q16. Advertising revenues for Turner were $996.0 million in fiscal 3Q16. Premium content drives advertising \nIn the previous part of this series, we looked at the premium content offered by Time Warner. AT&T stated in the company’s fiscal 3Q16 earnings call that it expects viewership insights gained through premium content and the rise in subscribers across various platforms after its acquisition of Time Warner to help the company target advertising. \nAT&T added, “Owning content will help us innovate on new advertising options, which combined with subscriptions will allow us to grow two-sided business models, help pay for the cost of content creation.” {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"T\",\"TWX\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"AT&T Inc.\",\"Time Warner Inc.\"]} X",

By Shirley Pelts | Nov 17, 2016 3:18 pm EST Technical parameters \nTraders and investors analyze technical aspects of companies when making market entry and exit decisions. Moving averages and RSI (relative strength index) levels are among the most widely used technical parameters. \nGenerally, an RSI of below 30 signifies that a stock is oversold, while an RSI of above 70 indicates that a stock is overbought. In this part of the series, we’ll look at Time Warner’s ( TWX ) technical parameters and compare them to those of other media companies. 100-day moving averages \nOn November 14, 2016, Time Warner was trading 9.7% above its 100-day moving average of $79. In comparison, Viacom ( VIAB ) was trading 3.4% below its 100-day moving average, and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) was trading 5.1% above its 100-day moving average. CBS ( CBS ) was trading 7.4% above its 100-day moving average. Relative strength index \nTime Warner currently has a 14-day RSI of 58. By comparison, Viacom has a 14-day RSI of 60, which traders see as approaching oversold levels. \nTime Warner makes up 0.33% of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ).

      "text": "Key Analysis of AT&T’s Acquisition of Time Warner PART 8 OF 14 How Is Time Warner a Good Fit for AT&T in Latin America? By Shirley Pelts | Nov 22, 2016 9:36 pm EST Time Warner in Latin America \nAT&T (T) has stated that its acquisition of Time Warner ( TWX ) would result in Time Warner’s representing ~15.0% of the combined company’s revenue due to the diversity of the premium content offered by Time Warner both in the United States and in Latin America. Let’s look at why AT&T considers Time Warner’s popularity in Latin America a big win for the combined company. \nTime Warner’s CEO, Jeff Bewkes, who was present on AT&T’s 3Q16 earnings call, stated that for Time Warner, Latin America was its biggest market outside of the United States. He further stated that the company’s cable networks in Latin America were the top-rated non-local networks in the region. He also indicated that Time Warner’s television programming was present across almost all pay-TV providers in the region. \nTime Warner also has Latin American programming aside from its US-based television networks in Latin America. Bewkes said that when it comes to the company’s acquisition by AT&T, “I think the match between the two of us in being able to help upgrade distribution and lead a real continuing buoyancy, just a secular take-up in Latin American countries of television services.” AT&T’s expansion into the Mexican and Latin American markets \nAT&T’s focus on growing its newly acquired Mexican operations appears to have been successful, helping it to offset ongoing US weaknesses in 3Q16. In Mexico, AT&T added 743,000 wireless net subscribers in 3Q16, and total Mexican wireless subscribers for the company have now reached 10.7 million. In Latin America, DIRECTV lost 48,000 video subscribers in 3Q16, mainly driven by falls in Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil. \nIn 3Q16, AT&T’s DIRECTV pay-TV operations in Latin America had revenue of $1.3 billion, a quarter-over-quarter rise 6.0%. Time Warner’s acquisition by AT&T would result in AT&T’s combining Time Warner’s premium content with DIRECTV’s pay-TV operations in Latin American markets, which could boost its pay-TV subscriber base. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"TWX\",\"T\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Time Warner Inc.\",\"AT&T Inc.\"]} X",

      "text": "Key Analysis of AT&T’s Acquisition of Time Warner PART 13 OF 14 What Are Time Warner’s Valuation Metrics? By Shirley Pelts | Nov 22, 2016 9:36 pm EST Valuation metrics \nIn this part of the series, we’ll look at some key metrics investors can use to compare values of media companies. We’ll specifically look at media valuation multiples, which are helpful in the valuation of conglomerates. \nThe most common valuation multiples for companies are PE (price-to-earnings), EV-to-EBITDA, 1 PCF (price-to-cash-flow) ratio, and PFCF (price-to-free-cash-flow) ratio. \nRemember, price-based multiples take into account the value from a shareholder’s perspective, while EV-based multiples help investors understand the value of a company from a capital holders’ points of view. The latter metrics are forward multiples based on the expected values of the denominator after a year. Time Warner’s valuation compared to its peers \nAs the above graph shows, Time Warner ( TWX ) has a forward PE multiple of 14.6x, which is high among its peers. Of these peers, Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA), Viacom ( VIAB ), and CBS ( CBS ) have forward PE ratios of 12.8x, 9.2x, and 13.1x, respectively. Only The Walt Disney Company ( DIS ) has a higher PE multiple at 14.6x. \nTime Warner has a forward EV-to-EBITDA multiple of 10.0x, while Viacom has the lowest forward EV-to-EBITDA at 8.4x. Time Warner’s value proposition \nTime Warner ( TWX ) is pursuing original programming for its Turner division, which bodes well for the parent company in the long term. The company is also pursuing a content licensing strategy in international markets instead of owning a network. This approach could reap rewards in the long term. \nTime Warner’s viewership is increasing for its digital platforms, including HBO Now, HBO Go, and HBO On Demand. This trend indicates that the company is poised to corner a significant share of the online streaming market. enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization ↩ {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"TWX\",\"FOXA\",\"VIAB\",\"CBS\",\"DIS\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Time Warner Inc.\",null,\"Viacom, Inc.\",\"CBS Corporation\",\"The Walt Disney Company\"]} X",

      "title": "AT&T is optimistic about its Time Warner merger after talking to Trump's team (TWX, T)",
      "text": "Getty/Alex Wong \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has assured AT&T that, contrary to Trump's campaign rhetoric, the proposed merger of AT&T- and cable company Time Warner will be treated without prejudice, according to the Financial Times.\n\"After talking with the president-elect’s team, AT&T executives are confident that their deal has a good chance of passing regulatory scrutiny, people informed about the conversation said,\" the FT wrote on Thursday .\nThere have been concerns that the government, particularly under Donald Trump, would move to block the $85 billion deal. Trump certainly helped give that impression.\n“In an example of the power structure I’m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN — a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” Trump had said while campaigning. \nThis attitude seems to have softened, especially with Trump's appointment of two former officials with favorable records on the issue to his transition team. \nThe FCC question But even before these recent developments, AT&T was telling Wall Street not to worry.\nAt RBC's Technology, Internet, Media and Telecommunications (TIMT) Conference in New York last month, AT&T management suggested  there wouldn't be any trouble with the merger. \nOne big reason AT&T was optimistic at the conference is because the company believes the merger won't be under the jurisdiction of the FCC. \n\"The only scenario in which the FCC would have jurisdiction is if Time Warner transfers certain broadcast licenses to AT&T,\" RBC analyst Jonathan Atkin, who viewed the presentation by AT&T's Chris Womack and Michael Black, wrote. \"The company believes these licenses (primarily business radio licenses and licenses related to Time Warner’s ownership of the WPCN superstation) can be offloaded easily, obviating the need for an FCC review.\" \nThat would mean the merger would only need to clear the Department of Justice, which AT&T is optimistic about. \n\"The major difference between an FCC and DOJ review is that a DOJ review provides AT&T legal recourse while the FCC, if it chooses not to support the deal can defer the issue to an administrative law judge, a process that can last upwards of three years, usually resulting in the dissolution of the deal,\" Atkin wrote.\nAT&T said it liked its odds, and expects the timeline on the merger to be 12-14 months.\nNOW WATCH: Obama: 'We are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism' \n",

      "text": "By Trey Williams, MarketWatch\nSenate antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights panel set to examine AT&T--Time Warner deal on Dec. 7\nGood afternoon, MarketWatch readers. Welcome back -- after a much-needed Thanksgiving respite -- to another edition of the Swerve newsletter. As President-elect Donald Trump continues to put together a cabinet, the incoming administration has been fairly quiet on a potential approach to AT&T Inc.'s(T)proposed $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner Inc.(TWX), which Trump earlier vowed to block. The separate companies, however, have continued to make moves and news, and there's plenty else happening in the broader media and entertainment landscape. Sign up to receive Swerve: Time Warner, AT&T and the future of media (https://marketwatch.typeform.com/to/YStdOx).\nStandard-issue scrutiny: AT&T executives reportedly met with members of Donald Trump's transition team, which told the telecom company its proposed merger would be scrutinized without prejudice, according to James Fontanella-Khan and David Crow at the Financial Times (https://www.ft.com/content/4c2d02fe-b7ea-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62). Executives are apparently confident the deal can pass regulatory review. The report put shares of Time Warner on a path toward a 15-year high in Thursday trades.\nCandid news network: Despite the insults Donald Trump has hurled at the cable news network CNN, Turner Broadcasting Chief Executive John Martin isn't batting an eye at Trump's claims. \"Please -- 'failing?' \" he asked at a recent Recode event in New York. \"I think [Trump] really cares about what CNN is saying.\"\n(https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/803562827776720896)\nMartin said he couldn't have been prouder of how CNN covered the election, before speaking about his parent company's proposed tie-up with AT&T. Asked if AT&T could take a selfish approach to Time Warner's HBO -- which has been one of the concerns surrounding the deal -- Martin said, \"That's a moronic thought.\" He did concede there could be exclusive forms of content for AT&T subscribers, according to the Hollywood Reporter (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/turner-ceo-says-donald-trump-cares-what-cnn-is-saying-talks-at-t-time-warner-deal-950956).\nAT&T coming online: AT&T pulled back the curtain on its much-talked-about over-the-top online live TV streaming platform DirecTV Now earlier this week. DirecTV Now had been heralded as an industry-shifting addition to the landscape, but the new service came on the scene more in line with existing offerings, as MarketWatch reported (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/atts-new-directv-now-streaming-service-will-likely-cannibalize-cable-subscriptions-2016-11-29). And some analysts think the service will cannibalize traditional cable subscriptions.\nAnd DirecTV's zero rating, meaning the service won't count against AT&T customers' data caps, raises concerns of stifling net neutrality (http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/29/13774648/fcc-att-zero-rating-directv-net-neutrality-vs-tmobile), writes T.C. Sottek at the Verge. The FCC sent AT&T a letter over worries of that zero rating in November. The company argues that the practice benefits customers, the Wall Street Journal reported (http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-reply-to-fcc-at-t-says-zero-rating-benefits-consumers-1479767200).\nDisney's decade-old blueprint: Walt Disney Co.'s studio arm is on its way to posting the most successful year in film for a Hollywood studio, thanks to a dependable rotation of production studios in Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Disney Animations. The company is reaping the benefits of a strategy that began a decade ago with the $7.4 billion acquisition of Pixar in 2006 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-pixar-agree-to-74-billion-deal) and continued with deals for Marvel in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/lucasfilm-may-be-bargain-for-disney-2012-10-31).\n\"This is the first year where all five brands have films being released in the same calendar year and what you're seeing is the strategy [Bob Iger] certainly teed up through those acquisitions,\" head of distribution at Walt Disney Studios, Dave Hollis, told MarketWatch (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/disneys-record-year-in-film-has-been-years-and-billions-of-dollars-in-the-making-2016-11-30).\nJudging competition: AT&T and Time Warner are on the Senate Judiciary Committee's schedule (http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/examining-the-competitive-impact-of-the-atandt-time-warner-transaction) for Dec. 7. The subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights will examine the competitive impact of the AT&T--Time Warner merger at 10 a.m. that Wednesday. A webcast will be available for the meeting on the committee's website.\nAcquiring apps and audience: CNN has bought video-sharing startup Beme in a deal valued at about $25 million, as Wall Street Journal reporter Steven Perlberg wrote (http://www.wsj.com/articles/cnn-buys-casey-neistats-video-app-beme-1480353128). The social-media app, created by popular YouTube star Casey Neistat, will allow CNN to tap into its large, young and digital audience.\nDownload complete:Netflix is rolling out a download feature (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/you-can-finally-stream-netflix-without-the-annoying-buffering-2016-11-30) for some of the platform's movies and TV series. The new feature gives viewers -- finally -- a way to stream content on the go when cellular and/or wireless connections are spotty or even nonexistent.\nThanks for reading Swerve.

      "text": "By Trey Williams, MarketWatch\nSenate antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights panel set to examine AT&T--Time Warner deal on Dec. 7\nGood afternoon, MarketWatch readers. Welcome back -- after a much-needed Thanksgiving respite -- to another edition of the Swerve newsletter. As President-elect Donald Trump continues to put together a cabinet, the incoming administration has been fairly quiet on a potential approach to AT&T Inc.'s(T)proposed $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner Inc.(TWX), which Trump earlier vowed to block. The separate companies, however, have continued to make moves and news, and there's plenty else happening in the broader media and entertainment landscape. Sign up to receive Swerve: Time Warner, AT&T and the future of media (https://marketwatch.typeform.com/to/YStdOx).\nStandard-issue scrutiny: AT&T executives reportedly met with members of Donald Trump's transition team, which told the telecom company its proposed merger would be scrutinized without prejudice, according to James Fontanella-Khan and David Crow at the Financial Times (https://www.ft.com/content/4c2d02fe-b7ea-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62). Executives are apparently confident the deal can pass regulatory review. The report put shares of Time Warner on a path toward a 15-year high in Thursday trades.\nCandid news network: Despite the insults Donald Trump has hurled at the cable news network CNN, Turner Broadcasting Chief Executive John Martin isn't batting an eye at Trump's claims. \"Please -- 'failing?' \" he asked at a recent Recode event in New York. \"I think [Trump] really cares about what CNN is saying.\"\n(https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/803562827776720896)\nMartin said he couldn't have been prouder of how CNN covered the election, before speaking about his parent company's proposed tie-up with AT&T. Asked if AT&T could take a selfish approach to Time Warner's HBO -- which has been one of the concerns surrounding the deal -- Martin said, \"That's a moronic thought.\" He did concede there could be exclusive forms of content for AT&T subscribers, according to the Hollywood Reporter (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/turner-ceo-says-donald-trump-cares-what-cnn-is-saying-talks-at-t-time-warner-deal-950956).\nAT&T coming online: AT&T pulled back the curtain on its much-talked-about over-the-top online live TV streaming platform DirecTV Now earlier this week. DirecTV Now had been heralded as an industry-shifting addition to the landscape, but the new service came on the scene more in line with existing offerings, as MarketWatch reported (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/atts-new-directv-now-streaming-service-will-likely-cannibalize-cable-subscriptions-2016-11-29). And some analysts think the service will cannibalize traditional cable subscriptions.\nAnd DirecTV's zero rating, meaning the service won't count against AT&T customers' data caps, raises concerns of stifling net neutrality (http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/29/13774648/fcc-att-zero-rating-directv-net-neutrality-vs-tmobile), writes T.C. Sottek at the Verge. The FCC sent AT&T a letter over worries of that zero rating in November. The company argues that the practice benefits customers, the Wall Street Journal reported (http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-reply-to-fcc-at-t-says-zero-rating-benefits-consumers-1479767200).\nDisney's decade-old blueprint: Walt Disney Co.'s studio arm is on its way to posting the most successful year in film for a Hollywood studio, thanks to a dependable rotation of production studios in Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and Disney Animations. The company is reaping the benefits of a strategy that began a decade ago with the $7.4 billion acquisition of Pixar in 2006 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-pixar-agree-to-74-billion-deal) and continued with deals for Marvel in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/lucasfilm-may-be-bargain-for-disney-2012-10-31).\n\"This is the first year where all five brands have films being released in the same calendar year and what you're seeing is the strategy [Bob Iger] certainly teed up through those acquisitions,\" head of distribution at Walt Disney Studios, Dave Hollis, told MarketWatch (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/disneys-record-year-in-film-has-been-years-and-billions-of-dollars-in-the-making-2016-11-30).\nJudging competition: AT&T and Time Warner are on the Senate Judiciary Committee's schedule (http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/examining-the-competitive-impact-of-the-atandt-time-warner-transaction) for Dec. 7. The subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights will examine the competitive impact of the AT&T--Time Warner merger at 10 a.m. that Wednesday. A webcast will be available for the meeting on the committee's website.\nAcquiring apps and audience: CNN has bought video-sharing startup Beme in a deal valued at about $25 million, as Wall Street Journal reporter Steven Perlberg wrote (http://www.wsj.com/articles/cnn-buys-casey-neistats-video-app-beme-1480353128). The social-media app, created by popular YouTube star Casey Neistat, will allow CNN to tap into its large, young and digital audience.\nDownload complete:Netflix is rolling out a download feature (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/you-can-finally-stream-netflix-without-the-annoying-buffering-2016-11-30) for some of the platform's movies and TV series. The new feature gives viewers -- finally -- a way to stream content on the go when cellular and/or wireless connections are spotty or even nonexistent.\nThanks for reading Swerve.

      "text": "With Dividends, Make 12% On AT&T Deal Dec. 2.16 \nAT&T-Time Warner deal on track. \nSiriusXM wants to open Pandora’s box. \nTeleflex buys Vascular Solutions. Welcome to the Ma Bell issue of M&A Daily AT&T The $12.03 arb spread in the AT&T (NYSE: T ) acquisition of Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) offers a 12% IRR if the deal closes by 2018 as I anticipate. Before it can close, it requires approvals by the DoJ, FCC and Time Warner shareholders. Each should and probably will grant their consent. This is a good deal for the target's shareholders. As for the regulators, it is not a highly problematic deal for a transaction of this size. If they stick to their statutory mandates and do not unduly politicize the process, it should be pretty straightforward. What about the politics? The President-Elect spoke badly of this deal (probably because of unfavorable treatment from CNN). However, there does not appear to be much follow-up to his adversarial statements. Focusing on the people Trump is picking for his antitrust and regulatory agencies, they appear to be highly professional and market-oriented. If anything, the most surprising thing about this team is that it is so entirely normal , similar to who other more traditional Republicans would pick. After AT&T management met with Trump antitrust leaders such as Joshua Wright, they had renewed confidence in their deal's prospects. Regardless of the President-Elect's prior comments, the incoming administration's agencies will be led by sound people who trust in market-based competition. President-Elect Trump's agency landing team includes Jeff Eisenach for the FCC and Paul Atkins for the SEC, CFPB, DFIC, and the OCC. Both would be my top choices for key roles. They could help rein in America's expensive and obtrusive regulatory burden. Watsi We raised $8,552 for Watsi so far. Thanks to everyone who has chipped in. I am grateful to all 89 donors. My goal is to reach $10,000 and 100 donors by Saturday. Let's help Watsi reach our next 10,000 patients. One day remains; please help!",

      "text": "What to expect at this week's hearing about AT&T-Time Warner deal Filed under Technology at Get Daily Dallas News Headlines Sign Up Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now \nDallas-based AT&T will go before lawmakers for the first time Wednesday to make the case that its $108.7 billion purchase of Time Warner should be approved. The deal would combine AT&T , the country's largest pay-TV provider, with Time Warner , a media and entertainment company with a valuable library of TV shows and movies. \nWould the merger expand competition or shrink it? At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes will face questions along those lines. The hearing will have some celebrity star power, too: Tech billionaire and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban will be among the witnesses . The lineup also includes Gene Kimmelan, president and CEO of Washington, D.C.-based consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge , and Daphna Ziman, president of Los Angeles-based fashion and film TV network Cinemoi. How to talk about the AT&T, Time Warner deal like an insider \nStephenson will likely echo AT&T's position on the merger. He's said the deal is a vertical merger rather than horizontal merger and thus will not decrease competition. Vertical mergers combine companies that operate at different parts of the production or supply chain. In AT&T and Time Warner's case, AT&T is a distributor of content and Time Warner is an owner of content. \nCuban, an advocate of the AT&T-Time Warner deal, has said it would allow AT&T to compete with tech giants like Google, Apple and Facebook as they continue to snap up digital content companies. But consumer advocacy groups like Public Knowledge have raised concerns that the mega-deal would put too much power in the hands of one company. AT&t CEO Randall Stephenson speaks during a House Judiciary Subcommittee hearing in Washington, on June 24, 2014. MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Andrew Harrer. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has testified before to lawmakers about two other mergers. He'll head back to Washington, D.C. this week to speak about the Time Warner deal. Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg \nAT&T has been on the winning and losing side of mergers before. Stephenson went before lawmakers to testify about the company's purchase of DirecTV. The acquisition, completed last year, energized AT&T's business focus on entertainment and ultimately led to its interest in buying Time Warner. On the other hand, AT&T's attempted merger of T-Mobile, another wireless carrier, in 2011 faltered because of concerns that it'd hurt competition. \nHere's a preview of the themes that may come up on Wednesday: \nZero-rating \nOne of AT&T's current practices called zero-rating has come under fire ahead of the hearings. The Federal Communications Commission has written letters to AT&T , saying it objects to how the telecom provider waives data charges for its own TV apps. Customers who have wireless service and TV through AT&T can stream on AT&T's apps without it counting toward their data allowance. The FCC says zero-rating harms competitors by giving preferential treatment to certain content. To compete with AT&T's video streaming products, Netflix and others would have to pay AT&T to waive data charges through a \"Sponsored Data\" program. Other providers, including Verizon, are being scrutinized for similar use of zero-rated apps. \nAccess to programming by rivals \nTime Warner owns prized content, such as HBO and its hit show Game of Thrones , Warner Bros. Studios and more. Its customers include TV providers like Comcast and streaming services like Hulu that pay to add networks or shows to their lineup. If AT&T buys Time Warner, it would own that content. Some consumer advocacy groups say that Time Warner might charge lower prices for AT&T and higher prices for other companies. Ultimately, those content costs would be passed on to customers' cable bills or subscription costs. \nEditorial independence of CNN \nCNN is one of the Time Warner networks that'd become part of AT&T, if the merger goes forward. The Atlanta-based news network has editorial independence under Time Warner. AT&T consultants and lobbyists have attributed President-elect Donald Trump's objections to the AT&T-Time Warner deal to his dislike of CNN's coverage of the election, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal . On Twitter, Trump has called CNN the \"Clinton News Network.\" Stephenson has pledged to uphold CNN's editorial independence, but some are skeptical. Harold Feld, senior vice president of Washington, D.C.-based Public Knowledge, said he wonders if AT&T might push for more favorable Trump coverage to stay out of hot water with the president-elect. \nPrivacy in the age of targeted ads \nAT&T executives say they'll use \"next generation advertising\" to offset the cost of new TV streaming services, such as DirecTV Now. It will do that in the form of personalized ads that target certain TV audiences or customized lists. With the merger, AT&T would own the pipes and the content, which would allow it to collect more data about viewing habits. Lawmakers may ask about safeguards for customer privacy. View Comments",

Subscribe On Wednesday, December 7, 2016 the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy & Consumer Rights will hold a hearing on \"Examining the Competitive Impact of the AT&T-Time Warner Transaction.\" Among the witnesses will be AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson, Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes and AXS TV Chairman Mark Cuban. AT&T unveiled a mega-deal for Time Warner that would transform the telecom giant into a media-entertainment powerhouse (KENA BETANCUR/AFP/Getty Images) \nThere’s been a great deal of ink spilt over the proposed AT&T-Time Warner merger. Much of the commentary on the merger has been critical, with various authors expressing concern that the merger will limit consumer choice and lead to increased prices. Others have sounded alarm at the wave of cable and telecom consolidations we’ve seen in recent years and argued that bringing content and distribution together under a single roof will concentrate too much power in the hands of a single provider. In our current populist climate, it is perhaps unsurprising that an effort to join together two very large companies into one, even larger company would face substantial opposition. And indeed, when two companies merge, there is always concern that the resulting entity may use its increased size to raise prices or reduce service. When a company has a large enough share of the market, it has the ability to exercise what economists call “market power,” or the ability to charge a higher price for its goods and services because it doesn’t have to worry about competitors or new entrants swooping in and stealing away customers by offering lower prices. \nWatch on Forbes: AT&T Sings A Song To Video Lovers With Time Warner Deal When two competitors merge, economists call the union a “horizontal merger.” Two companies at the same level in the distribution chain decide to pool resources, simultaneously decreasing competition and increasing concentration in the relevant market. Regulators examine such mergers very closely to ensure that the reduction in competition will not lead to increased market power. The AT&T-Time Warner merger, however, is not a horizontal merger. AT&T and Time Warner are not competitors. AT&T provides wireless and broadband Internet service, while Time Warner creates movies, TV shows and other content that AT&T and other distributors transmit to consumers. AT&T and Time Warner operate at different levels of the distribution chain. Theirs would be a “vertical merger.” Economists tend to worry less about vertical mergers than horizontal mergers because vertical mergers don’t reduce the number of competitors in a given market. Rather, they integrate separate levels of the distribution chain. Following a vertical merger, Company A still has the same number of competitors as before. The difference is that rather than having to contract with another company above it in the distribution chain (say, a parts supplier) or below it in the chain (say, a retailer) to obtain a needed service, the company simply merges its operations with the other company. The hope in such a transaction is that the integration of operations will create efficiencies that will lower the company’s costs and increase profits, with some of those savings being passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices. That’s not to say that vertical mergers are worry-free. A company with market power in a given market could potentially try to use a vertical merger to extend its dominance into another level of the marketplace. Or it could attempt to cut off its competitors’ access to necessary goods and services by purchasing the firm that produces those goods and services and then refusing to deal with the competitor. Some commentators, such as Robert Bork, have argued that such “foreclosure” dangers are ephemeral and that any harm competitors might suffer would result only from cost advantages the merging company would enjoy as a result of increased efficiencies—cost advantages that would ultimately be passed on to consumers.

      "text": "AT&T CEO: Time Warner Deal Would 'Disrupt' Cable TV Model  13:  AT&T CEO: Time Warner Deal Would 'Disrupt' Cable TV Model By John D. McKinnon \nAT&T Inc. Chairman Randall Stephenson plans to tell senators Wednesday his company's deal with Time Warner Inc. will \"disrupt\" the long-established cable TV model in ways that will benefit consumers, according to his prepared testimony. \n\"It would be a gross mistake to view this transaction as anything but pro-competitive,\" Mr. Stephenson says in his prepared remarks, adding that the deal will create more competition for consumers while accelerating the next generation of advanced wireless broadband. \nUnder the proposed deal, AT&T hopes to use Time Warner's broad array of content, such as HBO, to anchor innovative new video services such as its online DirecTV Now. \nBut the merger deal has already raised concerns from the right and left and taken flak from President-elect Donald Trump, who criticized it on the campaign trail as too much concentration of power and promised to block it. \nTime Warner chief Jeff Bewkes, in his prepared testimony, will say the deal would allow his company to continue innovating in content as well as in consumer experiences, for example by adding more interactive features to video products. \nBut the giant deal is likely to face a barrage of questions from lawmakers, including over its potential impacts on consumers, other distributors and content producers, as well as over its sheer size. \nThe deal would combine AT&T, which has millions of pay-TV subscribers and wireless customers, with one of the nation's most prized media content companies. Time Warner includes HBO as well as the Warner Bros. studios, plus networks including CNN and TNT. \nThe proposal comes at a time when some lawmakers in both parties are expressing discomfort with concentration in some industries, including media and telecommunications. \nWhen Wednesday's hearing was announced, the antitrust subcommittee's chairman, Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), and its top Democrat, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, issued a joint statement saying that the deal \"would potentially raise significant antitrust issues\" which they promised to \"carefully examine.\" \nThe deal will be examined at length by antitrust enforcers, and the senators have no say in their final decision on approving the deal. Still, the lawmakers can reflect and contribute to the public mood, which polls -- and election outcomes -- suggest has grown more populist and anti-big business, as well as anti-big government, in recent years. \nMs. Klobuchar said in a statement on Tuesday that she is concerned the deal \"could be used to undermine competition at the distribution level, harm independent providers, and drive up prices for consumers.\" \nSome lawmakers also are concerned that the deal comes at a time when big broadband companies such as AT&T are beginning to find ways around the Obama administration's so-called net neutrality rules. \nThose rules require internet service providers to treat all content equally, without blocking or slowing. But several providers, including AT&T, are giving consumers big incentives to favor some video content by providing it without imposing data charges. \nWrite to John D.

      "text": "HBO may be the most buzzed-about asset in the Time Warner media galaxy, but its won’t be as profitable in 2017 as the company’s Warner Bros. division.\n“Earnings growth is being led by theatrical,” CEO Jeff Bewkes said at the UBS media conference on Tuesday.\nThat’s largely because seven Warner Bros. movies have already crossed the $100 million barrier in domestic ticket sales this year, including two $300-million-plus winners in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and “Suicide Squad.”\nIt’s the largest number of $100 million-plus movies in a single year since 2013 — when they had eight. Last year there were only three.\nBewkes predicted theatrical will lead his company next year, too, given a slate that draws from its iconic DC brands, including “Batman,” “Superman” and “Wonder Woman.”\nThe 64-year old executive also predicted, perhaps not surprisingly, that AT&T would wrap up its $85.4 billion acquisition of his company by “the end of 2017, if not sooner.”\nFindTheCompany | Graphiq Meanwhile, he attempted to deflect a report in The Post that the subscriber count for HBO Now’s over-the-top streaming service had slowed considerably at just above 1 million.\n“We didn’t hit the wall,” he said. “And we’re not building the wall.”\nWith the attempted rebuttal out of his mouth, Bewkes didn’t provide an official number for subscribers to the $14.99-a-month premium service – launched in April 2015.\nHe did announced that HBO, his premium network, boasts 130 million subscribers worldwide.\nEarlier in the day, at Business Insider’s “Ignition” conference, Bewkes said he didn’t think President-elect Donald Trump’s comments about torpedoing his company’s merger with AT&T were “a serious thing.”\nIndeed, in a statement widely discussed in social media, Bewkes claimed the biggest threat to free speech wasn’t a Trump administration but, rather, the Democratic party.\n“Remember, the Democratic party had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment, and they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform,” he said.\nTime Warner’s CEO then expressed his fear that “cleaning up money in politics” could inadvertently “restrain multiple voices.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy",

It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.

      "text": "Innovation or a monopoly? AT&T, Time Warner go before Senate Posted: By MARCY GORDONAP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.  ",

      "text": "Innovation or a monopoly? AT&T, Time Warner go before Senate Posted: By MARCY GORDONAP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.  ",

AT&T, Time Warner go before Senate By MARCY GORDONAP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.  ",

AT&T, Time Warner go before Senate Posted: Updated: Wednesday, December 7 2016 10:22 AM EST 2016-12-07 15:22:05 GMT While a few designers have made news saying they would not dress the future first lady, Carolina Herrera said she'd be honored if Melania Trump wore one of her outfits. More > While a few designers have made news saying they would not dress the future first lady, Carolina Herrera said she'd be honored if Melania Trump wore one of her outfits. More > Updated:   Press' chief     By MARCY GORDONAP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies - including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films - and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n__ \nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.  ",

      "text": "AT&T-Time Warner Deal: Is This Enough to Convince Donald Trump? By Mukta Samtani BMS, MBA, PhD.   7, 2016 Photo: George Frey / Stringer / Getty Images AT&T Inc. To Defend the Merger Today \nAT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) has been under fire ever since President-elect Donald Trump gave the company a piece of his mind about AT&T-’s $85.0-billion deal with Time Warner Inc (NYSE:TWX). This deal makes Trump uncomfortable, as it would lead to a concentration of power. \nIt is not clear what Donald Trump would eventually do about the AT&T-Time Warner merger. However, more clarity will emerge today when the company executives face the senate antitrust subcommittee. T stock gained about two percent on Tuesday and closed at $39.35. \nAT&T Inc. Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson plans to tell senators today that his company’s deal with Time Warne r Inc will “disrupt” the long-established cable TV model in ways that will benefit consumers, according to his prepared testimony. (Source: “ AT&T CEO: Time Warner Deal Would ‘Disrupt’ Cable TV Model ,” The Wall Street Journal , December 6, 2016.) \n“It would be a gross mistake to view this transaction as anything but pro-competitive,” said Randall Stephenson. He further added that the deal will create more competition for consumers while accelerating the next generation of advanced wireless broadband. \nAT&T calls this a vertical merger, in which the company gets access to Time Warner’s media properties like HBO and CNN. The new entity hopes to compete with the likes of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) by delivering content and creating new customer experiences. \nAT&T had acquired the satellite television company DirecTV (NASDAQ:DTV) earlier. It launched “DirecTV Now” on November 30, at $35.00 for 100 channels streamed to mobile devices and Internet set-top boxes. Randall Stephenson said that the company hit its December goal for new subscribers the day that the streaming TV service launched. \n“The early demand for DirecTV Now has been rather dramatic,” he said at an investor conference on Tuesday. He was also pleased with how many customers have purchased HBO and Cinemax, which are $5.00 add-ons to the core service. Stephenson had expressed his optimism regarding Donald Trump earlier. He is hopeful that decreasing corporate taxes and easing regulations will boost economic growth. (Source: “ AT&T calls early DirecTV Now demand ‘rather dramatic’ ,” CNET, December 6, 2016.) \nIf all goes according to the plans of the executives of both companies, then the AT&T-Time Warner merger may easily go through. However, the premise that the deal benefits the consumer may not be enough to convince Donald Trump. He had earlier remarked that, if elected, his administration will do everything to block the deal. Donald Trump Would Be Hard to Please for AT&T-Time Warner Merger \nWith the way Donald Trump is following up on his campaign promises and targeting different companies, it looks like it may not be an easy ride for the AT&T-Time Warner merger. Trump has been an open critic of CNN, and the deal would mean that AT&T gets access to the network. \nOne of the possibilities is that Donald Trump may propose changes to the AT&T-Time Warner merger to keep CNN out of the equation. Whatever happens, Wednesday’s senate hearing will make clear how prepared the company executives are and what the future may hold for the AT&T-Time Warner merger. \nEditor’s Note: Hi, Mukta Samtani  ",

      "text": "0 \nTime Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes believes the greater threat to the First Amendment came from the Democratic Party during the election campaign, not from President-elect Donald Trump. \nBewkes was not worried by Trump’s threats to sue media outlets over libel issues and his frequent attacks on CNN, which is owned by Time Warner. Tweet \n“I don’t think that’s a serious thing,” Bewkes told Business Insider’s Henry Blodget at a conference on Tuesday. \n“We should all worry if anybody’s going to change the First Amendment and remember the Democratic Party had a campaign plank to change the First Amendment. And they were doing it in the guise of campaign finance reform,” he said. \nBewkes believed the media’s tendency to miss that was due to their usual agreement with Democrats. \n“And that was worrying me more because the press tends to miss that because they tend to lean that way, and therefore they were supporting what they were viewing — I think overly charitably — as something in cleaning up money in politics when in fact what it would do is restrain multiple voices,” he said. \nBewkes referred to Democrats vowing campaign finance reform and wanting to overturn the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision which allowed political contributions by corporations and labor unions as protected by the First Amendment. \n“So I thought the real threat to the First Amendment came from the Democrats’ side more,” Bewkes concluded. “There’s not going to be a serious effort on the Republican side.” \nWake up right!

      "text": "Markets Today Cuban Speaks in Favor of AT&T-Time Warner at Congressional Hearing The internet investor and star of ABC's 'Shark Tank' tells a Senate subcommittee that with the rise of Facebook and Google, AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner is small potatoes. Dec7,201612:01PMEST \nKeep your eye on the real target, Mark Cuban told Congress on Wednesday. \nTestifying before a Senate subcommittee, the internet investor, Dallas Mavericks owner and star of ABC's Shark Tank said AT&T 's ( T ) proposed acquisition of Time Warner ( TWX ) is small potatoes with the rise of Facebook ( FB ) and Google ( GOOGL ) . \nTelevision, he said, is no longer the primary medium for news and entertainment; instead, he argued, it's the internet. And the internet is dominated by technology companies, not AT&T or Time Warner. \n\"TV is experiencing a declining share of content consumption,\" Cuban said before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy & Consumer Rights. \"It is losing viewers to the other dominant content players in Netflix ( NFLX ) , Amazon ( AMZN ) with Prime, Twitch, Apple ( AAPL ) with Music, and finally Google with YouTube.\" \nCuban argued that AT&T buying Time Warner would create a stronger competitor to Facebook and Google, which receive about two-thirds of all U.S. digital advertising. A combined company would be able to build an internet presence that might offer seekers of entertainment and news as well as advertisers a viable alternative. \n\"This merger is not only one of survival and opportunity, but one that is needed by consumers,\" he said. \"We need more companies that have the ability to compete with Apple, Google, Microsoft ( MSFT ) , Amazon and Facebook.\" \nRather than framing the merger as a combination of two dominant media conglomerates, Cuban sought to paint a picture of an industry whose biggest players are legacy technology companies that increasingly are getting into the content business. Amazon, though its Prime service, is spending billions on original content, licensing more programming from Disney ( DIS ) , Time Warner and others. \nIn recent days, Time Warner executives Jeff Bewkes and John Martin have hinted that Amazon and Apple could launch the same kind of multichannel streaming service that AT&T started a week ago with DirecTV Now. Disney, like most major media companies, is a client of AT&T's DirecTV Now. \n\"Alone, it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for either AT&T or Time Warner to compete with any of the companies I've mentioned,\" Cuban said. \"Together it will be still be difficult, but a combined entity at least gives them a chance to battle the dominant players in the marketplace and increase consumer choice and competition for consumer attention.\" \nApple, Facebook and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

      "text": "WASHINGTON Senators questioning the logic of a proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner turned their focus to the nickels and dimes of the issue, at least as to how the $85.4 billion mega-deal would affect Americans. OK, you say this huge merger will enhance, not quash, competition and benefit consumers. Will it actually reduce prices that consumers pay?\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson assured the members of a Senate antitrust panel Wednesday that yes, \"We will bring the consumers better price options than what they have today.\" He said, though, that it wasn't possible at this point to separate how much of the anticipated savings would go to customers of the company's DirectTV, broadband and mobile phone services.\nStephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes made the case that the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. \"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson testified.\nIn hours of questioning before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, the skepticism of some senators seemed to deepen over what would be one of the largest media mergers ever.\n\"I have yet to be convinced\" that the benefits of the merger outweigh the potential negative effects on competition, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes.\nPanel chairman Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah said, \"The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\"\nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it.\nCritics of the merger range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal \"because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\"\nGene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department official who leads the consumer-advocate group Public Knowledge, crystallized those concerns.\n\"There are too few players in these markets already. They are heavily concentrated,\" he told the panel. The concentration of market power could \"harm the democratic process\" as well as consumers' pocketbooks, Kimmelman warned.\nMark Cuban, the billionaire sports and media mogul who owns the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, played evangelist for the deal in a fast-moving world of media and entertainment content. Consider Facebook's mergers with WhatsApp, Snapchat and others, he testified: Those deals are driving innovation. Old media like Time Warner can't compete with the likes of Facebook if they can't merge.\nWhat about Trump's avowed opposition?\nStephenson says he's confident the merger will be approved despite the president-elect's objection.\nThe Justice Department, and possibly the Federal Communications Commission under the incoming Trump administration, will put the proposed deal under close scrutiny. Even assuming the merger is approved, some experts believe regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense.\nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs.\nThe concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films. That, critics say, could limit consumer choice.\nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video.\nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO, would hurt competition.\n__\nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Innovation or a monopoly? AT&T, Time Warner go before Senate   1:30 PM MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner are heading to Capitol Hill in a bid to convince senators that a merger of their two companies will mean innovative new experiences for consumers. \nThey can expect a skeptical audience. \nThe CEOs, Randall Stephenson of AT&T and Jeffrey Bewkes of Time Warner, are due to appear Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel whose Republican chairman and senior Democrat have said the proposed $85.4 billion merger of the communications giants would potentially raise significant antitrust issues. \nOther critics range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he'd kill the deal because it concentrates too much \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nStephenson, however, said Tuesday he is confident the deal will be approved despite Trump's public opposition. \nThe deal, which must win approval from federal regulators, would be one of the biggest media mergers to date. It would tie up the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate whose stable includes CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It's a big-time bet on synergy between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers and one that produces it. \nThe Justice Department, and possibly also the Federal Communications Commission in the incoming Trump administration will give the merger close scrutiny. Even assuming the deal is approved, some experts believe the regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense. \nThe Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust doesn't have authority to rule on the merger, but members are likely to use their platform to ask questions such as whether the companies would not share Time Warner content with other cable companies or online video providers. \nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers' computers, phones and TVs. The concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner's programs and films, hurting consumers. \nBecause of Time Warner's shows and movies — including \"Game of Thrones\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films — and AT&T's ability to gather information about its tens of millions of customers, AT&T thinks it could do a better job tailoring ads and video to user preferences. It could then create more attractive subscription packages suited for phones, where people are increasingly watching video. \nBut many consumers already consider ads that know everything about them creepy or invasive, and digital-rights groups complain that any preferential deal AT&T could offer with, say, HBO would hurt competition. \nBillionaire sports and media mogul Mark Cuban, owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, is expected to join the CEOs at Wednesday's hearing. He has said the merger would enhance competition and also is expected to testify in favor. \n\nAP Technology Writer Tali Arbel in New York contributed to this report. About Us",

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators questioning the logic of a proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner turned their focus to the nickels and dimes of the issue, at least as to how the $85.4 billion mega-deal would affect Americans. OK, you say this huge merger will enhance, not quash, competition and benefit consumers. Will it actually reduce prices that consumers pay?\nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson assured the members of a Senate antitrust panel Wednesday that yes, \"We will bring the consumers better price options than what they have today.\" He said, though, that it wasn&apos;t possible at this point to separate how much of the anticipated savings would go to customers of the company&apos;s DirectTV, broadband and mobile phone services.\nStephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes made the case that the combined company would push technology forward and lead to more choices for customers. \"Together, AT&T and Time Warner will disrupt the entrenched pay-TV models, giving customers more options, creating more competition for cable TV providers and accelerating deployment of 5G wireless broadband,\" Stephenson testified.\nIn hours of questioning before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, the skepticism of some senators seemed to deepen over what would be one of the largest media mergers ever.\n\"I have yet to be convinced\" that the benefits of the merger outweigh the potential negative effects on competition, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes.\nPanel chairman Sen. Michael Lee, R-Utah said, \"The potential anticompetitive favoritism that the combined firm could bestow on its own products is not limited to price or access, but extends to the quality of the offerings as well.\"\nThe deal must win approval from federal regulators. It would bind the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company with a media and entertainment conglomerate that owns CNN, HBO, the \"Harry Potter\" franchise and pro basketball. It&apos;s a big-time bet on a partnership between a company that distributes information and entertainment to consumers, and one that produces it.\nCritics of the merger range from industry analysts and public-interest groups to President-elect Donald Trump, who promised on the campaign trail that he&apos;d kill the deal \"because it&apos;s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\"\nGene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department official who leads the consumer-advocate group Public Knowledge, crystallized those concerns.\n\"There are too few players in these markets already. They are heavily concentrated,\" he told the panel. The concentration of market power could \"harm the democratic process\" as well as consumers&apos; pocketbooks, Kimmelman warned.\nMark Cuban, the billionaire sports and media mogul who owns the NBA&apos;s Dallas Mavericks, played evangelist for the deal in a fast-moving world of media and entertainment content. Consider Facebook&apos;s mergers with WhatsApp, Snapchat and others, he testified: Those deals are driving innovation. Old media like Time Warner can&apos;t compete with the likes of Facebook if they can&apos;t merge.\nWhat about Trump&apos;s avowed opposition?\nStephenson says he&apos;s confident the merger will be approved despite the president-elect&apos;s objection.\nThe Justice Department, and possibly the Federal Communications Commission under the incoming Trump administration, will put the proposed deal under close scrutiny. Even assuming the merger is approved, some experts believe regulators might saddle the combined company with so many conditions that the deal would no longer make sense.\nTime Warner makes TV shows and movies, while AT&T gets that video to customers&apos; computers, phones and TVs.\nThe concern is that AT&T might try to make its broadband service stand out by tying it to Time Warner&apos;s programs and films.

      "title": "Lawmakers change tone on AT&T and Time Warner deal",
      "text": "At a hearing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that was being closely watched for how megamergers will be viewed in the coming Trump administration, members of a Senate Judiciary subcommittee that oversees regulatory agencies that decide on mergers said the deal merits tough scrutiny. [...] in a change from previous comments, they also questioned whether traditional ways of evaluating mergers are growing outdated as Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google become huge media outlets that threaten the television industry. “We want to ensure that competition thrives in this critical market and we don’t stifle innovation or deter the emergence of cutting-edge technologies that customers demand,” said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who heads the full Judiciary Committee. When the deal was announced, days before the presidential election , leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee issued strong cautionary statements about it. During the hearing, the companies pitched a message that catered to the new administration: a populist promise of lower prices and the potential to build more wireless infrastructure through the merger. Consumer groups rejected the characterization of AT&T and Time Warner as disadvantaged rivals, saying a combined company would have too much negotiating power over competitors on licensing rights to Time Warner’s networks like HBO and CNN. [...] streaming providers like Sling TV and Hulu would face a major new competitor, with AT&T’s access to 110 million wireless and satellite subscribers and premium television networks under the same roof. “Last time I looked, Google and Facebook weren’t charging me $200 a month to get those apps,” said Gene Kimmelman, president and chief executive of Public Knowledge, a consumer group, at the hearing.",

      "text": "News roundup: FEMA reimburses Baton Rouge food bank $1.4M for flood damage … LSU researchers find carbon in seaside sparrows from 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill … AT&T, Time Warner plead their case for megadeal Daily Report Staff December 7, 2016 \nTrickling down: The Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank has received a $1.4 million grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency as reimbursement for debris disposal and other costs related to the August flood. The reimbursement also covers the cost of cleaning and disinfecting property and equipment and restoring refrigeration and freezing gear at the food bank’s damaged Choctaw Drive distribution facility. It also will help the food bank get a temporary facility to support its services. The funds were made available through FEMA’s Public Assistance program, according to a news release. The program reimburses expenses to eligible local and state governments and certain private nonprofit entities in 26 designated parishes to repair or replace disaster-damaged facilities and infrastructure. \nA first: LSU researchers have found the presence of carbon in the internal tissues of seaside sparrows living in areas exposed to oil from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill, according to the LSU AgCenter’s School of Renewable Natural Resources. Carbon from oil previously had been found in marine species, but this is the first time evidence of oil from the spill was found in a terrestrial vertebrate species, the AgCenter says. The presence of carbon from oil in the sparrows’ feathers and their gut contents indicated it was from a chronic or long-term exposure, says Philip Stouffer, one of the researchers on the project. Researchers are not sure of the implications of finding the oil in the sparrows, Stouffer says. The LSU AgCenter has the full story. \nMaking the case: The top executives of AT&T and Time Warner appeared on Capitol Hill today in an attempt to convince a Senate subcommittee the two companies’ proposed $85.4 billion merger will ultimately be good for consumers. As USA Today reports, several GOP and Democratic lawmakers have voiced antitrust concerns surrounding the proposed merger, as did President-elect Donald Trump, who says the blockbuster deal would concentrate too much power in the hands of too few. AT&T is the nation’s second largest wireless carrier and also a major player in the pay-TV space as the owner of DirecTV. Time Warner has HBO, Warner Bros. and CNN among the assets in its entertainment and media portfolio. A potential concern is that AT&T might give preferential treatment to its own content, either by withholding access or raising the costs of such programming to rivals. Read the full story.",

      "text": "By Erik Wemple December 7 at 6:54 PM Follow @ErikWemple \nAs this blog has pointed out , Donald Trump was the cable-news candidate, is the cable-news president-elect and will be the cable-news president. As such, he has spent a goodly portion of the past six months tweeting, speechifying and otherwise shouting his disdain for the programming of CNN . \n“.@CNN is so embarrassed by their total (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don’t know what to do,” he wrote late last month . \nHow can such a fellow be trusted to run an administration that oversees the proposed $85 billion acquisition by AT&T of CNN’s parent company, Time Warner? Back in October, Trump said , “As an example of the power structure I’m fighting, AT&T is buying Time Warner and thus CNN, a deal we will not approve in my administration because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” Trump’s Justice Department will be reviewing the deal. \nIn a Senate hearing Wednesday on the merger, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) criticized Trump for his pronouncements on this topic. “For a public official to use the blunt, heavy instrument of law enforcement to try to silence or change coverage by a news department of any company is, for me, absolutely abhorrent,” said Blumenthal. Then he directed a question at AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson and Time Warner chief executive Jeffrey Bewkes: “Would you agree?” \n“Senator, I’m a novice in the world of politics, so I struggle to engage at that level. My expectation was when we announced this deal and is today that the Department of Justice will be the one reviewing this transaction and making the determination whether it is competitive or not,” said Stephenson. \nBewkes: “In terms of the independence of our journalism, and, I hope, all the other journalistic outlets, we have always vigorously defended that for decades, whether at Time Inc. and when we have CNN. And we intend to continue defending and being an independent journalistic voice. Everyone that watches us may have their own opinion about whether we succeed in being objective. We try hard every day and we’re going to continue to do that.” \nNo one will fault Bewkes for pledging to fashion CNN as an “independent journalistic voice,” though that’s just what bothers the president-elect so much. opinions",

ADVERTISEMENT \nOne potential challenge appeared to fade on Wednesday. The bill includes language to help fast-track the nomination of Trump's pick for Defense secretary. But expected opposition to that measure fizzled. \nThe Hill's Sarah Ferris tells us more about what's inside the bill: http://bit.ly/2gc56KG . \nBut no so fast... A Dem senator is threatening to slow-walk the legislation: Sen. Joe Manchin Joe Manchin Congress to clear path for Mattis Overnight Finance: Trump blasts Carrier's union leader | What's in the spending bill | Jamie Dimon gets perch for Trump era | AT&T, Time Warner execs grilled Trump's Cabinet: What jobs are left to fill MORE (D-W.Va.) is threatening to block the Senate from fast-tracking a funding bill as lawmakers face a Friday deadline to avoid a government shutdown. \nThe Democratic senator will object to a unanimous consent request to speed up the Senate's consideration of a continuing resolution (CR) unless lawmakers reach a deal to help miners, Manchin spokesman Jonathan Kott said. \nThe Senate isn't expected to receive the short-term funding bill until Thursday. If Manchin makes good on his pledge to hold it up, the Senate will not be able to pass the funding legislation by the Friday deadline to avoid a shutdown. The Hill's Jordain Carney explains: http://bit.ly/2gbYnAh . \nTrump puts new bull's-eye on business: President-elect Donald Trump is finding a novel way to push his populist economic agenda: take on American businesses directly. \nPrevious presidents exerted a light touch with businesses, tackling industries as a whole while discussing policy in overarching tones. \nTrump, who built his name and brand in business, has shown a repeated interest in diving into specific brawls with particular companies, to the point that a company in his sights could see a tweet swing its stock price. The Hill's Peter Schroeder tells us about the ramifications: http://bit.ly/2h7sRDh . \nTrump blasts Carrier's union leader: Donald Trump blasted the Carrier union's president Wednesday after he said the president-elect \"lied his ass off\" about terms of the deal to keep Carrier manufacturing jobs in the United States. \n\"Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers,\" the president-elect tweeted Wednesday. \"No wonder companies flee country!\" \nJones appeared on CNN just before Trump's tweet. He told CNN anchor Erin Burnett that Trump's comment \"isn't very damn nice.\" He added it \"must mean I'm doing a good job,\" and said Trump \"doesn't like to be challenged.\" The Hill's Rebecca Savransky has more here: http://bit.ly/2h4Yfzw \nBrady: Trump can play 'key role' in tax reform push: Rep. Kevin Brady Kevin Brady Overnight Finance: Trump blasts Carrier's union leader | What's in the spending bill | Jamie Dimon gets perch for Trump era | AT&T, Time Warner execs grilled Koch Industries warns about 'devastating' House GOP tax plan provision Chairman: Trump can play ‘key role’ in tax reform push MORE (R-Texas) thinks a long-awaited tax reform measure is possible next year -- and says President-elect Donald Trump can be an asset from the bully pulpit. \nBrady, as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, could soon be charged with moving the first major tax reform legislation through Congress in more than 30 years. \nIt's a prospect Republicans have long salivated over and now see as a real possibility, with the party set to control both chambers of Congress and the White House in 2017. \n\"I'm so excited I can't sleep,\" Brady said in an interview in the Capitol with The Hill. \"And it's because ... the American public made it very clear in the election they want change in the direction our country's going.\" The Hill's Naomi Jagoda sat down with the chairman: http://bit.ly/2gc5Vmo . \nHappy Wednesday and welcome to Overnight Finance, where we're two days away from the government funding deadline.

The Hill's Vicki Needham has more: http://bit.ly/2gco5zU . \nTrump picks pro wrestling mogul McMahon for administration role: President-elect Donald Trump has selected professional wrestling mogul Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration. \nMcMahon has long been floated as a potential administration appointee due to her ties to GOP causes and Trump personally, as well as the president-elect's history of appearances at WWE pro wrestling events. Trump lauded McMahon in a statement announcing the decision, praising her as \"one of the country's top female executives\" who helped the WWE become a \"global enterprise.\" \n\"Our small businesses are the largest source of job creation in our country,\" McMahon added in a statement. The Hill's Ben Kamisar reports: http://bit.ly/2h7sWH7 . \nAnd another nominee... Trump taps Iowa governor as China envoy: Donald Trump is picking Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad (R) as the next ambassador to China. Business groups gave the pick a thumbs up. Branstad has been friends with Chinese President Xi Jinping for over 30 years. \"That experience will serve him well as he represents America’s interests and further develops a mutually beneficial relationship with Chinese leadership,\" Trump said. \nJay Timmons, head of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), said the governor’s \"deep understanding of China, and close relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, uniquely qualifies him for this vital post.\" The Hill's Vicki Needham has more: http://bit.ly/2gcyQXK \nFunding bill gives New York $7 million for protecting Trump: A bill released Tuesday night to fund the federal government through April contains $7 million to reimburse New York for the cost of protecting President-elect Donald Trump. \nThe bill designates $7 million for overtime paid by state and local law enforcement agencies to protect Trump from Nov. 9 through his inauguration on Jan. 20. The money can only go toward overtime pay for officers maintaining security for Trump. \nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) and 10 lawmakers representing the state previously asked for $35 million for the total cost of protecting Trump. The president-elect has spent most of his time since the election at his home in Trump Tower, in the heart of New York's bustling Manhattan borough. \nNew York lawmakers panned the provision. I've got it all here: http://bit.ly/2gWeYak . \nLawmakers grill AT&T, Time Warner execs on $85B merger: Lawmakers on Wednesday grilled the CEOs of AT&T and Time Warner on their proposed $85.4 billion merger during a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel. \nDemocrats raised concerns about the merger's effect on consumers and expressed worries that it could result in higher prices and fewer options. \nAT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, however, insisted the deal would help AT&T provide lower rates to consumers and said they had \"no incentive\" to create more restrictive pricing and packing plans. \nStephenson cited AT&T's previous merger with DirecTV, which he said had clearly benefitted consumers. The Hill's Ali Breland takes us there: http://bit.ly/2h7okAu . \nHatch to meet with Trump Cabinet picks Thursday: Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch Orrin Hatch Overnight Finance: Trump blasts Carrier's union leader | What's in the spending bill | Jamie Dimon gets perch for Trump era | AT&T, Time Warner execs grilled The Hill's 12:30 Report Hatch to meet with Trump Cabinet picks Thursday MORE (R-Utah) will meet Thursday with two of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks. \nHatch will meet in the Capitol with Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, and Steven Mnuchin, Trump's choice for Treasury secretary. \nThe two nominees will be considered by the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax, trade and healthcare issues. \nHatch has said positive things about both Trump selections. \nHe said Price was selected \"because of his experience as a respected physician and deep understanding of the health law and its flaws.\" Hatch also said Price will play a key role in GOP efforts to repeal and replace ObamaCare: http://bit.ly/2gDCSVk . \nKoch Industries warns about 'devastating' House GOP tax plan provision: Koch Industries on Wednesday expressed concerns with a feature of the House Republicans' tax reform blueprint, saying it could have \"devastating\" consequences to the economy in the long run. \nThe company, owned by billionaire conservative mega-donors Charles and David Koch, criticized a provision in the tax plan known as border adjustments, under which imports would be taxed and exports would not be taxed. House Republicans plan to use their blueprint as the starting point for tax reform legislation. \nPhilip Ellender, president of government and public affairs for Koch Companies Public Sector, said that Koch Industries supports comprehensive tax reform but is concerned that border adjustments would hurt consumers because they would end up paying higher prices on imported products. Naomi Jagoda explains: http://bit.ly/2gcdO6M . \nEx-Im Bank fails to get help in stopgap spending bill: The Export-Import Bank failed to win a restoration of its full lending powers as part of a stopgap spending bill released on Tuesday night. \nAdvocates for the 82-year-old agency were urging congressional leaders to add a provision to the continuing resolution that would have temporarily lowered a quorum requirement to restore the bank's ability to approve loans of more than $10 million. \nThe bank now has only two confirmed board members, one short of the three needed to approve larger transactions that are in the pipeline. \nAn amendment proposed by Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham Overnight Cybersecurity: Retired general picked to head DHS | Graham vows to probe Russian election interference Overnight Tech: AT&T, Time Warner CEOs defend merger before Congress | More tech execs join Trump team | Republican details path to undoing net neutrality Overnight Finance: Trump blasts Carrier's union leader | What's in the spending bill | Jamie Dimon gets perch for Trump era | AT&T, Time Warner execs grilled MORE (R-S.C.) and Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) would have allowed the bank to operate for up to three years with only two board members, instead of three. Vicki Needham reports: http://bit.ly/2glKHB4 . \nTreasury sanctions two Yemeni nationals tied to al Qaeda: The Treasury Department on Wednesday targeted two Yemeni nationals for funding and supporting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), freezing their United States-based assets and barring American persons and firms from doing business with them. \nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Al-Hasan Ali Ali Abkar and Abdallah Faysal Sadiq al-Ahdal for supporting the terrorist group's operations in Yemen. \nAbkar has been supporting al Qaeda's Yemen activities since at least 2014, according to the Treasury Department, financing and running weapons to the terrorist group's leaders to carry out attacks. I've got more here: http://bit.ly/2h7ojdD . \nGOP lawmaker plans bill targeting 'sanctuary' universities: A House GOP lawmaker plans to introduce legislation on Wednesday to punish universities for serving as sanctuaries for students who are illegal immigrants. \nRep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) said on the House floor that his upcoming legislation would require any entity receiving federal funds, including institutions of higher education, to meet lawful requests by federal immigration authorities. Institutions that refuse to comply would stand to lose all funding they receive from the federal government. \n\"Congress has the responsibility to protect the rule of law in our country and to provide for the safety in our citizens. The American people have spoken loudly in this past election that they want federal immigration law enforced. Shame on those universities who take federal money and then promote lawlessness,\" Harris said.

ADVERTISEMENT \nStephenson cited AT&T's previous merger with DirecTV, which he said had clearly benefitted consumers. \n\"We now offer 100 channels for $35 [on DirecTV],\" the AT&T CEO said. \"That is innovation that results in lower prices for consumers.\" \nAT&T's proposed purchase of Time Warner, first announced in October, would link a telecommunications powerhouse with one of the country's largest players in the entertainment industry. Time Warner includes many of the most popular networks and studios in the country, including HBO, CNN and Warner Brothers. \nDemocrats pressed the executives on whether the merger would give the companies an unfair advantage over their competitors. \n\"There would greater leverage in negotiation with content distributors as a result of this deal,\" Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) said to the executives. \"Do you think AT&T would benefit from using this as leverage?\" \nBut the executives insisted that the merger was needed to help the companies keep up with an already competitive marketplace. \n\"We don't have the market power to do that,\" Bewkes responded. \"The market is too competitive for that.\" \nWhile Franken and Democrats expressed skepticism at the executives arguments in favor of the merger, Republicans appeared to be more sympathetic. \nRead more: http://bit.ly/2hhZHBW \nMEDIA WORRIES: Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) used Wednesday's Judiciary Committee hearing on the pending AT&T-Time Warner merger to press CNN's parent company about media independence under the next president. \"The president-elect has said that his Department of Justice will enforce a different standard of law depending on what kind of coverage he receives,\" Blumenthal said. \"For a public official to use the blunt, heavy instrument of law enforcement to try to silence or change coverage in the news department of any company is for me, absolutely abhorrent. Would you agree?\" he asked AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes. \nRead more: http://bit.ly/2h7wGpk \nPlease send your tips, comments and stray observations to Ali Breland ( ) and follow us on Twitter: @alibreland and @HilliconValley . \nBLACKBURN ON THE FCC: Trump transition advisor, Rep. Marsha Blackburn John Thune Overnight Tech: AT&T, Time Warner CEOs defend merger before Congress | More tech execs join Trump team | Republican details path to undoing net neutrality Overnight Tech: Big win for Samsung over Apple | Trump to sit down with tech leaders | Trump claims credit for B investment deal Senate Dems may block water bill over drought language MORE (R-S.D.) will likely introduce a proposal. Blackburn also told reporters that FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel should not be confirmed, saying that Trump should have his pick. \nMORE TECHIES ON TRUMP TRANSITION TEAM: The Trump transition team added two technology industry executives today, reports The Wall Street Journal. Mark Woolway, vice president of corporate development at Zenefits, and Kevin Harrington, a managing director at Thiel Capital will join the Treasury Department and Commerce Department landing teams, respectively. A Zenefits spokesperson said that Woolway will still serve as acting CFO at the company while he works on the transition team. \nCIRCLING BACK TO BITCOIN: Goldman Sachs backed bitcoin startup Circle is removing the ability to buy and sell bitcoin on its app reports Reuters. According to the company, bitcoin transactions failed to become a meaningful part of the business. \n\"Using bitcoin for speculative trading or people buying and selling bitcoin because they think it's fun -- that's not an interesting business for us,\" Jeremy Allaire, Circle's chief executive and co-founder, said in an interview with Reuters. \"It's a distraction to have to support these customers given that our growth has been on our social payments business.\" \nON TAP: \nThe National Telecommunications and Information Administration will hold a webinar on broadband access Thursday at 2:00 p.m. \nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT:",
