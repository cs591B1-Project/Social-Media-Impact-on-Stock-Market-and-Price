      "text": "Toyota to pay up to $3.4 billion to settle US truck lawsuit Josh Boak, Ap Economics Writer Updated 2:18 pm, Sunday, November 13, 2016 WASHINGTON (AP) — Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. Court filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. The settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. Today's Deals",

      "text": "Toyota to pay up to $3.4 billion to settle US truck lawsuit By Josh Boak ,  20pm 0  \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. \nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. \n ",

      "title": "2017 Toyota C-HR 1.8 Hybrid review",
      "text": "Toyota’s rival to the Nissan Qashqai is interesting to look at and sit in, albeit largely forgettable to drive It’s the Toyota C-HR. And, well, far be it from me to get your pedantry radar pinging, but if you’re going to call a car a ‘coupé, high-rider’, then you might expect an element of accuracy within both of those statements. But, well, this is a post-fact world, or so The Guardian keeps reminding me, so let’s allow Toyota some poetic licence. The C-HR, effectively its new mainstream five-door hatchback, does have a swooping rear window and sits a hand width higher than its own Auris hatchback. But a GT86 SUV it ain’t.You remember the Auris hatchback, right? Go on, you do. Replaced the Corolla? Competes against the Ford Focus, Volkswagen Golf, that sort of thing? No? Well, anyway, you can still buy one, only not many people do, hence the requirement, I suppose, for something else. Something crossover-shaped, because if you want a new mainstream hatchback to sell in Europe, then these days you’ll need to make what we used to think was a niche one.The C-HR is precisely one of those. Toyota expects to sell no fewer than 100,000 of them a year within Europe, which is the only market where Toyota initially thought it would sell the car, before other regions got a look at it and demanded it, too. So the C-HR will sell in Japan and other parts of Asia, and before long other regions as well. A crossover is, effectively, the new global family hatch.In none of those markets, though, will the C-HR be offered with anything other than petrol or electric propulsion. Even in a Toyota, this is slightly surprising but probably shouldn’t be. Toyota long ago decided that a combination of petrol and electricity – then, further away, hydrogen and electricity – was its future, because it foresaw that although CO2 emissions were the factor that most affected new car legislation, that situation wouldn’t last forever. Air quality – particulates, nitrogen dioxide and so on – are about to replace CO2 as the bigger concern facing legislation makers, despite the non-end to global warming fears. City dwellers trump polar bears, in other words. I suppose they have better lawyers.The C-HR, then, comes with either a 1.2-litre turbocharged petrol engine (£20,995-£27,995), which can drive the front wheels through a six-speed manual gearbox or, when mated to a continually variable transmission (CVT), can propel either the front wheels or all four wheels (it’s a crossover, innit). Or it can be had in front-wheel drive with the 1.8-litre petrol-electric drivetrain (£23,595-£27,995) that you’ll find in the latest Toyota Prius, whose architecture the C-HR also shares.",

      "text": "Toyota's Prius 54 miles per gallon isn't even its best trait Sunday Nov 13, 2016 at 6:00 AM\nBy Warren Brown The Washington Post\nExcellent gasoline mileage is good. It's not everything.\nThe 2016 Toyota Prius Two Eco hatchback gas-electric hybrid, specially built for maximum mileage, has a federal average mileage rating of 58 miles per gallon in the city and 53 miles per gallon on the highway.\nCity mileage is higher because that is where the car relies more on its electric drivetrain and start-stop engine technology. The highway demands more gasoline. Still, using the government's rating, you get a city-highway rating of 56 miles per gallon. My real-world mileage was 54 mpg using regular-grade gasoline.\nThat is excellent if yours is a commuting life. But my humble recommendation is that you skip the generally well-done 2016 Prius Two Eco hatchback, all new for 2016, and go with the slightly more expensive 2017 Prius Two hatchback.\nWhy? There's more to driving than fuel economy, and the 2017 model comes standard with many of the things that make a modern car a modern car - Toyota's excellent \"Safety Sense\" package, to be exact.\n\"Safety Sense\" includes full-speed adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warning and lane-departure warning and intervention. Those technologies can make an inches-moments difference between a serious vehicle crash and no crash, a serious injury and no injury, a traffic fatality and none.\n\"Safety Sense\" should be standard. I'd also recommend standardizing items such as blind-side warning, rear cross-traffic alert, and rear-camera feeds. But I drive and write about cars. I don't sell them. The new standard safety technologies I want cost money, which means they either contribute to or detract from a vehicle manufacturer's profit column. It is easy for me to demand that the companies carry the cost.\nBut \"Safety Sense\" works and works well. That means the package contributes to safer driving and less traffic mayhem. Toyota is moving in the right direction here. With continuing rapid improvements in advanced electronic safety technologies, maybe, it can go further. I hope so.\nAt any rate, the 2016 and 2017 Toyota Prius hatchbacks, the latter with mild cosmetic exterior changes, give you everything you could possibly want: reasonable comfort and quiet, with superb fit-finish quality and hard-to-beat gas mileage.\nKeep in mind that you buy either the 2016 or 2017 model for fuel economy. They do OK with their 1.8-liter, four-cylinder gasoline engines and electric motor drivetrains. But \"okay,\" here, is a very relative thing - a combined gas-electric oomph of 121 horsepower and moving from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 9.8 seconds.\nYou won't win any races at that speed. But you can drive to the racetrack and have more than enough fuel to visit that venue several times over without visiting a gasoline pump. And this is a hatchback - which means, as I and my wife, Mary Anne, discovered, that you can carry lots of stuff.\nNuts and Bolts\n2016 TOYOTA PRIUS\nBottom line: If your primary concern is fuel economy, it is hard to beat any Toyota Prius gas-electric. There are six trim levels in the 2016/17 Prius hatchbacks - Two, Three, Four, Three Touring, Two Eco (2016 only) and Four Touring.\nRide, acceleration and handling: All OK. It gets you there. It is not a high-performance car and was never designed or engineered to be.\nHead-turning quotient: It is a science project gone mainstream.\nBody style/layout: The 2016/17 Toyota Prius hatchback is a front engine/electric motor, front-wheel-drive, four-door gas-electric hybrid with a rear hatch.\nDrivetrain: It uses a 1.8-liter, four-cylinder 16-valve gasoline engine with variable valve timing in combination with a pair of electric motor/generators to produce 121 horsepower, which is transmitted to the front wheels via a continuously variable automatic transmission.\nCapacities: Seating is for five people. Cargo capacity with all seats in place is 24.6 cubic feet. Fuel capacity is 11.3 gallons of gasoline. Regular grade is OK.\nMileage: I experienced a combined city-highway mileage of 54 miles per gallon using regular grade gasoline. I'm still blinking!\nSafety: Standard equipment includes four-wheel disc brakes, ventilated front and solid rear; four-wheel anti-lock brake protection; emergency braking assistance; traction and stability control; rear center 3-point seat belt; side and head air bags.\nPrices: The 2016 Prius Two Eco hatchback starts at $24,700, with a $23,218 dealer's invoice price. Price as tested is $26,203, including $668 in mostly cosmetic options and an $835 factory-to-dealer shipment charge. Dealer's price as tested is $24,473. Add about $1,000 more for the 2017 model.",

      "text": "Toyota to pay up to $3.4 billion to settle US truck lawsuit By JOSH BOAKAP Economics Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. \nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.

The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.",

The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. ",

The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.",

      "text": "Toyota to pay up to $3.4 billion to settle US truck lawsuit By JOSH BOAKAP Economics Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. \nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.  ",

Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners who say their vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. (Toyota) Associated Press \nToyota Motor Corp. will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners who claimed their vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. \nCourt filings show that the proposed settlement covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker, whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Plaintiffs’ lawyers had pegged the total cost at nearly $3.4 billion. \nUnder the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. \nThe proposed settlement was reached Oct. 31 and filed Wednesday before U.S. District Court Judge Fernando M. Olguin in Los Angeles. Toyota didn’t admit liability or wrongdoing in proposing the settlement. \n“We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,” Toyota said in a statement.

      "text": "Toyota to pay up to $3.4 billion to settle US truck lawsuit By JOSH BOAKAP Economics Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. \nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.  ",

The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.  ",

      "text": "Toyota to pay up to $3.4 billion to settle US truck lawsuit By JOSH BOAK AP Economics Writer 3 hrs ago ( … ) \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. \nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement. Tags",

The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008.\nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle.

      "text": "Toyota to pay up to $3.4 billion to settle US truck lawsuit By JOSH BOAKAP Economics Writer \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Toyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. \nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. The settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. Under the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.

      "text": "Toyota to pay up to $3.4 billion to settle US truck lawsuit Posted: Updated: (AP) - \nToyota will pay up to $3.4 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by U.S. pickup truck and SUV owners whose vehicles lacked adequate rust protection. \nCourt filings show that the settlement reached on October 31 covers 1.5 million vehicles, dealing a financial blow to the Japanese automaker whose trucks were subject to corrosion that could harm their structural integrity. \nThe settlement applies to Tacoma trucks made from 2005 to 2010, Sequoias from 2005 to 2008 and Tundras from 2007 to 2008. \nThe settlement estimates the value of replacing the frame at roughly $15,000 per vehicle. \nUnder the settlement, Toyota will inspect vehicles for 12 years from their initial sales or lease date to decide if the owner is eligible for a replaced frame or reimbursement.

      "text": "Reuters |   \nWASHINGTON: Toyota Motor Corp. has agreed to a settlement of up to $3.4 billion for a federal class action brought by US owners of pickup trucks and SUVs whose frames could rust through, plaintiffs lawyers have said in court papers.The proposed settlement covers about 1.5 million Tacoma compact pickups, Tundra full-size pickups and Sequoia SUVs alleged to have received inadequate rust protection that could lead to corrosion serious enough to jeopardize their structural integrity, according to court papers.Attorneys for the plaintiffs in court papers supporting the settlement estimated the value of frame replacements at about $3.375 billion based on a cost of about $15,000 per vehicle and the inspections at about $90 million at $60 per vehicle.Toyota admitted no liability or wrongdoing in the proposed settlement filed on Wednesday before US District Judge Fernando Olguin in Los Angeles.“We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,” Toyota said in a statement.Under the settlement terms, Toyota will inspect the vehicles for 12 years from the day they were first sold or leased to determine whether frames need to be replaced at company expense and reimburse owners who previously paid for frame replacement.The settlement reached on Oct. 31 covers Tacoma trucks from the model years 2005 through 2010, Sequoias from 2005 through 2008 and Tundras from the 2007 and 2008 model years.Toyota also agreed to pay $9.75 million in attorneys’ fees, $150,000 in costs and expenses, and $2,500 each to the named eight class representatives as well as the cost of advertising the settlement.

      "text": "Email \nCHICAGO -- Hundreds of tow trucks from all over the country came together at Toyota Park in Bridgeview Sunday, forming a caravan of holiday caring to bring thousands of gifts for needy kids. \n“This is perfect weather for towing companies to get together one day out of the year; to put all their differences away and come for a common cause,” said John Meyers, Grosse Pointe Towing. \nThis is the 9th year towing companies paraded 40 miles from Joliet to help kids in need. Roger Jackson has been doing it almost from the start, never once seeing those his deeds have helped, but living the spirit of the season. \n“It’s all about the kids; Christmastime is for kids,” Jackson said. \nAnd while the towing business is a competitive community, its members know showing kindness and decency goes a long way to lifting everyone up. \n“Towing is 24/7, so the fact that they’re doing this on some of these guys’ only day off this week is pretty impressive,” said Jeff Irr, Jerr-Dan Corporation. “It really shows what type of community that towers are.”",

      "text": "Toyota in $3.4 Billion Corrosion Deal  35:  \nToyota Motor Corp. has agreed to pay up to about $3.4 billion to settle claims that certain of its trucks and sport-utility vehicles lacked proper rust protection, leading to premature corrosion of vehicle frames. \nThe agreement is a substantial financial setback at a time when the Japanese auto giant's record-breaking profit streak has slowed in recent quarters as a strong yen dents its performance. The company also is part of a broader group of auto makers facing plateauing retail sales in the profitable U.S. market. \nThe deal, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles this week, settles litigation in two states over problems with Toyota Tacoma trucks from model years 2005 to 2010, Tundras from 2007 to 2008 and Sequoias from 2005 to 2008. \nThe agreement represents a significant settlement for the auto industry and follows several costly agreements auto makers have forged in recent years to address quality, safety or emissions issues in vehicles. \nGeneral Motors Co. recalled millions of vehicles in 2014 and spent billions of dollars to address ignition-switch problems linked to 124 deaths; Volkswagen AG forged a $14.7 billion deal more recently to settle with U.S. drivers of diesel-powered cars affected by an emissions-cheating scheme. \nSeveral auto makers, including Toyota, continue to work with Takata Corp. to repair tens of millions of air bags in the largest automotive safety campaign in history. \n\"We want our customers to have a great ownership experience, so we are pleased to resolve this litigation in a way that benefits them and demonstrates that we stand behind the quality and reliability of our vehicles,\" Toyota said. \nThe settlement was reported earlier by The Detroit News. \nToyota and plaintiffs' lawyers said the deal, which is still subject to court approval, reflects months of negotiation. As part of the agreement, Toyota doesn't admit to any wrongdoing. \nOnce approved, consumers will be entitled to an inspection of their vehicles and ultimately replacement of its frame if the car is found to have the faulty rust protection. Car owners who already have replaced their frames will also be reimbursed. \nCourt documents peg the cost of inspection to Toyota under the accord at $90 a vehicle and to replace each frame at $ 15,000. \nThe deal also sets aside up to $9.9 million for attorneys' fees and expenses. Toyota said it would pay between $1.75 million and $2.5 million to notify potential affected consumers by mail and through publication notices and internet campaigns. \nAttorneys for consumers called the settlement \"the result of hard-fought litigation\" and a \"complete and total success\" for affected drivers. Toyota said in its own filing that while it \"disputes and contests the allegations in these class actions lawsuits,\" the deal \"represents a reasonable and fair way to end the controversy.\" \nThe litigation dates back to 2014, when consumers filed a lawsuit in Arkansas that was later combined with litigation in California. \nJohn D.
