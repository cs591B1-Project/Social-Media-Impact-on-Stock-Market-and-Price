I've taken it to game night a few times and everyone is eager to play it again after I've introduced them to it. Even my non-gaming husband will play 4 or 5 rounds in an evening. I received a notice from the creators that they're selling the remainder of their stock on Amazon for half price. It will show up as $6.49 when you add it to your cart. Great stocking stuffer.",

      "text": "FarkIt \nWe see hundreds of brand and company logos in a single day. Because we’re so inundated with these images, it’s easy to miss out on what’s right under our noses. Especially, when it comes to clever logos with double meanings. \nSo here’s a look at 10 of the sneakiest everyday logos that require a second glance: \nTostitos \nTostitos is the Kleenex of tortilla chips, the king that wears the salty chip crown. So, it only makes sense the brand’s logo deserves a wee bit closer look. If you do so, you’ll notice that the logo itself is having the time of its life. In fact, the two “T”s at the centre of the brand make for two adorable triangular chip men who are united by the power of the chip. One of whom clearly did not forget to bring the salsa, and as we all know, that guy is the life of the party. While there may be no “I” in team, there certainly is in Tostitos. And thank god for that, because there is no party without dip. \nFedEx \nFedEx may have the most recognizable logo when it comes to double meanings. When it comes to duplicitous designs, this was likely the first one to catch your eye. Let’s just say, if the “D” and the “E” look awfully intimate, you may want to look a little closer at the “E” and the “X,” because a little something has gotten in between that orange letter sandwich. \nWendy’s \nWendy’s has long been a company associated with family. Founded by Dave Thomas, the titular Wendy happens to be an image of Thomas’s daughter Wendy. But he kept his bases covered, with a little shoutout to his wife and Wendy’s mother with the collar of the blouse that the red-haired icon is wearing. \nBaskin-Robbins \nAs the world’s largest chain of ice cream shops, Baskin-Robbins is best known for its distinctive 31 flavours. With the benefit of a little subliminal messaging, good ole Baskin reinforces its number of flavour (one for every day of the month) with that not-so-subtle pink “31” in the middle halves of the “BR.” Because when it comes to ice cream, you never forget who came first — 31 times. \nToblerone \nWhile Toblerone’s triangular design makes it unique for a chocolate bar, it’s worth noting the chocolate was originally founded in Switzerland. Specifically Bern, Switzerland, a city commonly associated with bears. As such, the Matterhorn mountain featured on the Toblerone has made sure you’ll never forget those grizzly origins, no matter how sleek the bar ends up being. \nHershey’s Kiss \nSpeaking of triangles and romantically entangled letters, Toblerone and FedEx have nothing on Hershey’s Kisses. There may be two Kisses giving each other some love in this logo, but if you take a look at the space between the “K” and “I”, you’ll catch another sweet little Kiss just chillin’. \nSpartan Golf Club \nThe food industry doesn’t get to have all the fun. Spartan Golf Club has one of the more aesthetically impressive logos around, especially when you catch not just the dude swinging his club like his life depends on it, but a Spartan himself, with the sort of perfectly curved chin even George Clooney dreams about. One wonders, however, what exactly a true Spartan would make of a sport like golf. \nAmazon \nFrom A to Z, Amazon has got you covered. You can browse for an item, from kitchen utensils to luxury soaps to a life-sized cutout of Jeff Goldblum. You can then purchase it. And anywhere from one-20 days, you can find it sitting on your doorstep, waiting to be opened and shared. Basically, there is no moment in time in this process where you need to leave your couch. Because, from beginning to end, Amazon is there. And if you’re still not seeing what I’m referring to in the logo, I cannot help you. Amazon probably can, though! \nPittsburgh Zoo \nThe Pittsburgh Zoo’s logo is a true work of art, one that deserves to be hung in the Louvre perhaps or, I guess, the Met. Because not only are we looking at a grand and majestic tree, the sort that you might find yourself staring at for hours at a time as a single tear slowly glides down your cheek, but the faces of a gorilla and lion as they longingly gaze at each other. Or predatorily, whatever floats your boat. \nTour de France \nIs it a bird? Is it a plane? Is it Lance Armstrong? No, but it is a real biker on an actual bike , who may or may not have a back problem. Because “R”s are never just “R”s. And orange circles are never just orange circles. In fact, literally nothing is what it appears to be. And if that doesn’t give you an unsettling thrill, it’s time to reevaluate. ",

      "text": "× Amazon unveils Black Friday deals \nNEW YORK — For Amazon, Black Friday deals are starting early and ending just days before Christmas. \nStarting Wednesday, the e-commerce giant is offering deals on a variety of products, including toys, electronics, kitchen and home goods and video games. \nHowever, the company said many of its top deals will be offered during the “Turkey 5,” which starts on Thanksgiving Day and runs through the Monday following the holiday — known as Cyber Monday. \nAmazon claims it will have the lowest prices on certain Samsung, LG and Sony TVs and is reducing some prices of Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price toys by as much as 50%. \nThe company is also discounting its own products: The Amazon Echo will be on sale for $139.99 and the Tap will be $89.99, a price cut of $40. \nShoppers can track deals on Amazon’s app and customers who have Prime memberships, which costs $99 a year, will get early access to “Lightning Deals.” \nHere are a few of the deals Amazon will offer at various times between Nov. 18 and Nov. 25: 32″ 720p LED TV for $69.99 55″ LG 4K Smart TV for $398 $150 off a Delonghi Super Automatic Coffee Machine Sennheiser HD 598 Cs Closed Back Headphone for $99.95 Sphero Star Wars BB-8 Droid for $99.99 Amazon Fire HD 8 for $59.99 Amazon Kindle for Kids Bundle for $69.99 Up to 60% off select Disney toys and apparel Intex Explorer K2 Kayak for $70.99 Nest Thermostat (3rd Generation) for $199 ",

      "text": "Smarter bots are coming to Facebook, Google and Amazon assistants MindMeld's tech gives assistants a \"deep understanding\" of products and services. Share Save \nWe keep hearing that robots are going to take our jobs , but a company called MindMeld is giving us an idea how with its \"Deep-Domain Conversational AI Platform.\" It'll allow bots that can essentially replace customer service agents and even baristas by answering complicated voice or text queries over Google Assistant, Amazon Echo, Facebook Messenger and other popular platforms. Uniqlo, for one, will offer a Facebook bot that can answer questions about its products, services and retail locations with more detail than ever. \nThe \"MindMeld Language Parser\" helps it understand and answer questions with \"human-like accuracy,\" whether by talk or text, the company says. It adds that while current AI toolkits from Google, Facebook and others are great, they provide \"little data suitable for production-quality applications\" -- in other words, they can do deep learning, but don't give companies anything to teach them. It reckons that customers have been \"disappointed and underwhelmed\" with first-gen bots -- something Facebook pretty much said not long ago. \nIn a video (below) the company showed some (simulated) scenarios of the bot in action. It understands relatively complicated searches, like a coffee order for a \"venti, hot Pike Place Roast with room,\" (I have no idea myself what that actually is). The bot can then process the order and give you a pickup time and price, or else auto-suggest more options via buttons at the bottom of the screen. \nOther features include question responses across \"any dynamic knowledge graph,\" dialogue management and state tracking, large-scale training data generation and cloud-based or on-premise deployment. Basically, all of those buzzwords mean that companies can put together a bot without needing to do a lot of extra work (for a price, of course). \nThe company thinks bots will be able to do tasks like \"placing a take-out order at a local restaurant, booking a flight or hotel reservation, creating a service appointment at an auto repair shop or doctor's office, or finding retail store and production information.\" It'll eventually work across \"Amazon Alexa, Facebook Messenger, Google Assistant, Skype, Slack, Google Home and more,\" says MindMeld CEO Tim Tuttle. \nThe platform is available starting today, and MindMeld customers and investors already include Google, Samsung, Intel, Uniqlo, Spotify, Telefonica and others. Suffice to say, if you work in customer service or other areas, you may want to start buffing up your resume.",

Baig , USA TODAY 10:02   The basic eero system consists of three routers (Photo: WKG Creative) \nNEW YORK—I’ve been a big fan of the $499 eero Wi-Fi system since February when it solved the poky networking issues and dead zones in my house that had previously made my Internet hiccup and stutter all too often. \nOn Thursday, eero inc. promised to make the system even better, by enlisting the assistance of Amazon’s Alexa, the voice inside Amazon’s Echo speaker. \nAlexa brings three skill sets to eero. You can ask Alexa to turn off the LED lights on an eero router, when, say, you want to watch a movie in pitch black or go to sleep. \nIf you’ve misplaced your smartphone or some other device that’s connected to Wi-Fi in your house, Alexa can help you locate it, by letting you know which eero it is closest to. \nAnd here's a feature parents may come to love. Alexa can “pause” the Internet on request for the specific Wi-Fi connected device that your kid is using at dinnertime or when he should be doing homework instead—and no, your smart aleck youngster can’t ask Alexa to turn it back on, since doing so requires mom or dad going into the eero app. \nEero had previously added this “family profile” feature, but you had to go into a smartphone app to turn it on as well as turn it off. \nThe basic Eero system consists of what are essentially three identical Internet routers that provide wireless access points and Wi-Fi extenders to cover your home, each compatible with modern Wi-Fi standards. In my house I have one in my basement, one on my main floor, and one in an upper bedroom. The system makes use of “mesh” technology that automatically seeks out the clearest possible network channel as one eero in your house communicates with another. \nIn the nine months since its launch, the company says it has compiled the largest ever consumer mesh network dataset, which it uses to improve diagnostics and performance. On Thursday, CEO Nick Weaver also announced what he refers to as eero’s “most significant product update” yet, a redesign of the company’s mesh technology that eero claims can bolster local area network (LAN) speeds by more than 40% improvement on the average network, and makes the network more resilient to outside interference. \nThe eero smartphone app can give you information on device connectivity. (Photo: eero) \nI’m curious to see if I notice any significant improvement in my own network once the update is applied overnight. \nMeantime, the eero app on your phone has also been updated, with clearer indications of where potential network snags may be coming from—your Internet provider, say, as opposed to a problem within your own network —and what steps you might take to address the issue. \nEmail: ; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

Opinions expressed here are the author's alone, not those of the bank, credit card issuer, airlines or hotel chain, and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any of these entities. Please check out my advertiser policy for further details about our partners, including American Express, Chase, and Citi, and thanks for your support! \nFor those of you not familiar with Amex Offers, it’s a program available through most Amex cards, where different cards are eligible for different savings or bonus offers. These Amex Offers in many cases help offset the annual fees on my cards. To view Amex Offers, go to the bottom of the account summary page of any American Express card, where you’ll see all the offers you’re eligible for. \nAt the moment there’s a targeted Amex Offers promotion for earning 3x Membership Rewards points for purchases made with Amazon through December 31, 2016 . You’ll want to check if your card is eligible, because registration is limited. \nThis promotion only works on Membership Rewards cards, and on top of that is targeted, though a lot of people seem to be eligible. In my case, the offer is showing up on The Amex EveryDay® Preferred Credit Card from American Express , The Platinum Card® from American Express , and the Premier Rewards Gold Card from American Express . \nIf you are targeted for this offer, your best bet for maximizing points is the Amex EveryDay Preferred Card , since it offers a 50% points bonus when you make at least 30 purchases per billing cycle. That means you’d be earning a total of 3.5x Membership Rewards points per dollar spent (the 50% points bonus wouldn’t count for the bonus points through this promotion, since they only post after the fact). \nHowever, it could also be worth using The Platinum Card® from American Express , as it offers an extra year added to the manufacturer’s warranty for many products, as I described in this post . \nI should mention that many people can earn 5x points at Amazon through gift cards, so this won’t be for everyone. However, you do get more purchase protection when using an American Express card, so many will find it worthwhile to forgo those points for much better protection on your purchase. \nIf you want to use an Amex card to save money on Amazon purchases, also keep in mind the special sign-up bonuses being offered on the Blue Cash Amex cards , offering up to 10% back on Amazon purchases: \nBlue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express — no annual fee Earn $100 back after you spend $1,000 in purchases on the card within the first three months Earn 10% back on purchases at amazon.com on the card within the first six months, up to $200 \nBlue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express — $95 annual fee Earn $150 back after you spend $1,000 in purchases on the card within the first three months Earn 10% back on purchases at amazon.com on the card within the first six months, up to $200 \nWere you targeted to earn two additional Membership Rewards points per dollar spent with Amazon?

      "text": "Home » Amazon taps merchants for warehouse space to expand inventory Amazon taps merchants for warehouse space to expand inventory November 17, 2016 Largest Indianapolis-Area Commercial Real Estate Brokerages - Excel \nIn an effort to secure extra warehouse space, Amazon.com Inc. is turning to merchants who sell on its marketplace as a less-costly way to expand inventory available for quick delivery. \nInventory available for delivery within two business days expanded by 6 million items under the Seller Fulfilled Prime program, the company announced Thursday. Amazon earlier this year introduced the program, which lets independent merchants sell goods on Amazon as “Prime Eligible” even if Amazon isn’t handling packaging and delivery. \nIt’s the latest sign the world’s biggest online retailer can’t build facilities quickly enough to meet demand for an ever-expanding assortment of goods that customers want delivered fast and free. \nWarehouse capacity issues and the cost of new facilities helped increase Amazon’s spending on order fulfillment 34 percent in the third quarter. The big expenses caused the Seattle-based company to miss analysts’ profit projections, driving down shares 8.8 percent since the results were reported Oct. 27. \nAmazon’s revenue is projected to increase 28 percent to $137 billion this year, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The fast growth prompted the company to accelerate its warehouse building spree, with more than 15 fulfillment centers opening in California, Texas, Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey, Georgia and Florida that will collectively employ more than 12,000 workers. \nIndiana is a huge part of Amazon's fulfillment network. The company has several major distribution centers in the state that employ more than 9,000 workers, including centers in Plainfield, Whitestown and Indianapolis. \nAmazon told IBJ last month that it planned to hire thousands of seasonal workers in Indiana for the holidays, including 6,000 at four facilities in the Indianapolis area. \nIn addition to adding capacity, Amazon introduced Seller Fulfilled Prime to take advantage of the warehouse space of its merchant partners. Amazon sells its own inventory as well as products owned by merchants who give the company a cut of each sale, similar to a consignment shop. Many of those merchants send their products to Amazon warehouses and pay the company extra to handle packing and shipping, which lets their products be listed as Prime eligible. Seller Fulfilled Prime is a way to let select merchants get the Prime label on products without using Amazon’s facilities. Prime subscribers pay $99 a year for faster, free delivery in addition to other benefits such as access to the company’s video service. \nJeff McDonald, owner of Raw Paws Pet Food in Indianapolis, joined the program in August about a year after he began selling products on Amazon. His company, which is located at 5601 Fortune Circle South, near Indianapolis International Airport, had to pass a test by fulfilling 300 orders with little wiggle room for returns, defective products or late shipments, he said. \n\"It was a really hard approval process,\" he said. \nThe advantage is that he can now list all of the pet food and chew toys in his inventory as Prime eligible to see which ones are the most popular. \nEarlier this year, Amazon began restricting access to its warehouses due to capacity concerns and it changed its fee structure to penalize merchants who store slow-moving and off-season products during the busy holiday shopping period.",

      "text": "Huawei MediaPad M3 Android tablet comes to America for $299 11/17/2016 \nAmazon is taking orders for the tablet for $299 . It’s expected to begin shipping November 20th. \nThe MediaPad M3 features a 2560 x 1600 pixel IPS display and Android 6.0 software, with the EMUI 4.1 user interface. \nIn a nutshell, the tablet has the same processor and software experience as Huawei’s $400 Honor 8 smartphone , but it has a larger and higher-resolution display, a little less RAM, and… you know, it’s not a phone. \nThe MediaPad M3 measures about 8.5″ x 4.9″ x 0.3″ and weighs 11 ounces. It has a 5,100 mAh battery, a microSD card slot and micro USB port, stereo Harman Kardon-certified speakers, and 8MP cameras on the front and back. \nAt a time when most new Android tablets from companies other than Samsung and Google seem to be destined for the bargain bin, it’s nice to see a model with decent specs. This model has a much better screen and a much faster processor than those found on $50 devices like the Amazon Fire and the new $50 B&N NOOK tablet. But it also costs about six times as much…",

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock Earlier this week, a cybersecurity firm called Kryptowire revealed that it had identified several models of Android-based mobile phones that included firmware to collect sensitive personal data about the devices’ users and then to transmit this data to third-party servers with no disclosure to or consent from the users.\nConsumers could purchase the devices at online retailers, including Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE: BBY), and they included popular devices such as the BLU R1 HD. The phones are no longer available at either Amazon or Best Buy.\nAccording to Kryptowire:\nThese devices actively transmitted user and device information including the full-body of text messages, contact lists, call history with full telephone numbers, unique device identifiers including the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). The firmware could target specific users and text messages matching remotely defined keywords. The firmware also collected and transmitted information about the use of applications installed on the monitored device, bypassed the Android permission model, executed remote commands with escalated (system) privileges, and was able to remotely reprogram the devices.\nFor more details and information see the Kryptowire press release .\nThe latest data breach count from the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC) reports that there have been 873 data breaches recorded this year through November 15, 2016, and that nearly 30 million records have been exposed since the beginning of the year. The total number of reported breaches increased by 15 since ITRC’s last report on November 9.\nThe number of breaches in 2015 totaled 781, just two shy of the record 783 breaches that ITRC tracked in 2014. The 873 data breaches reported so far for 2016 are nearly 25% above the number reported (700) for the same period last year. A total of more than 169 million records were exposed in 2015.\nHere’s a rundown of the latest ITRC report:\nThe medical/health care sector leads all others in the number of records compromised to date in 2016. The sector has posted 36% (314) of all data breaches to date this year. The number of records exposed in these breaches totaled is nearly 14.5 million, or about 48.5% of the total so far in 2016. The government/military sector has suffered 59 data breaches this year, representing about 41.2% of the total number of records exposed and 6.8% of the incidents. More than 12 million records have been compromised in the government/military sector to date. The business sector accounts for more than 2.5 million exposed records in 389 incidents. That represents 44.6% of the incidents, and 8.6% of the exposed records. The number of banking/credit/financial breaches totals 37 for the year to date and involves more than 26,000 records, some 4.2% of the total number of breaches and about 0.1% of the records exposed. The educational sector has seen 74 data breaches in 2016. That accounts for 8.5% of all breaches for the year and nearly 500,000 exposed records, about 1.6% of the total so far. Since beginning to track data breaches in 2005, ITRC had counted 6,683 breaches through November 15, 2016, involving more than 881 million records.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "title": "Amazon SaaS Subscriptions Available on AWS Marketplace - November 17, 2016",
      "text": "Amazon.com, Inc. ’s ( AMZN - Free Report ) Amazon Web Services (AWS) has made AWS Marketplace a one-stop solution for customers who subscribe to third party Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Application Programming Interface (API) products through AWS.\nThe company announced yesterday that it has enabled subscription to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications directly through AWS Marketplace.\nWhat Does it Mean\nPreviously, independent software vendors (ISVs) offering SaaS application to AWS customers were required to have their own metering and billing system or avail a third party billing system.\nNow AWS has developed a unified metering and billing system that will make things easy and hassle-free for customers and vendors. Vendors can put their charges in a customer’s existing AWS bill, thereby saving costs and accelerating the sales cycle.\nCustomers on the other hand get a streamlined payment system. They will have to pay a single monthly bill that includes SaaS usage charges and charges for other AWS products and services. This eliminates the need to maintain accounts with each ISV from which they source products.\nAt launch, AWS has 24 products from 21 sellers - Aspera, Avalara, Alert Logic, Bitium, Cloudyn, Cloudinary, Dome9, Druva, Datadog, Datapath.io, HERE, Pitney Bowes, Qubole, NetApp, New Relic, Solodev, Sumo Logic, Trend Micro, Dynatracea and Signiant, Solano, and expects further additions in the coming months.\nThe company stated that following the launch, vendors and customers will have greater access to each other with more products available in its marketplace.\nAMAZON.COM INC Price\nAMAZON.COM INC Price | AMAZON.COM INC Quote:\nAWS Holds the Key\nWe see the move as Amazon’s latest gambit to increase its market share in the lucrative cloud computing business. It intends to give both sellers and customers a solid reason to opt for AWS.\nAmazon Web Services is the cash cow for Amazon. The business contributed $3.2 billion in the third quarter. It generates much higher margins than retail and therefore has a positive impact on Amazon’s profitability. We remain optimistic about the functionality, partner ecosystem and the experience AWS offers and believe this will lead to continued customer wins.\nAmazon remains the cloud infrastructure leader, well ahead of Microsoft and Alphabet.\nZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider\nCurrently, Amazon is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Better-ranked stocks in the in the broader technology sector include NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA - Free Report ) , Kimball Electronics, Inc. ( KE - Free Report ) and Control4 Corporation ( CTRL - Free Report ) , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .\nFor the current year, the consensus estimate for NVIDIA has gone up by 30.6% in the past 30 days. Estimates for Kimball Electronics and Control4 have gone up by 8.1% and 10%, respectivelyover the same time frame.\nZacks' Top Investment Ideas for Long-Term Profit\nHow would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today’s most promising long-term stocks? Starting now, you can look inside our portfolios featuring stocks under $10, income stocks, value investments and more.

      "text": "by Paul Lilly — Thursday, November 17, 2016 Amazon Prime Falls To $79 On Friday To Celebrate ‘The Grand Tour’ Debut Do you hear that noise? It's the sound of the holiday shopping season getting underway and if you want to get a head start on the madness, you can treat yourself (or someone else) to a discounted Amazon Prime membership this Friday, November 18. The one day discount starts at 12:00 AM (Eastern) and ends at 11:59 PM (Pacific) and is for new members only. That last bit is a buzz kill, but if you have managed to go this long without being a Prime member, Friday is your chance to jump on board for $79, a 20 percent discount for the first year's membership fee. Each year thereafter runs $99, barring any future promotions that might bring the price down for existing members or price hikes that drive it up. Amazon is running the one-day deal in celebration of its new original series The Grand Tour, which it recorded in 4K Ultra HD. The Grand Tour is a motoring show featuring former Top Gear stars Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May. New episodes will release weekly over a 12-week period ending Friday, February 3, 2016. \"Amazon is committed to bringing Prime members programming that is unique and exciting,\" said Conrad Riggs, Head of Unscripted, Amazon Originals. \"We are thrilled to bring back together the world’s beloved hosting team of Clarkson, Hammond and May for extraordinary adventures that can only be seen on Amazon Prime Video.\" It remains to be seen how receptive Prime subscribers will be to the new original series, though there are plenty of other benefits to being a member. One of the biggest, of course, is free two-day shipping on millions of qualifying items. However, Amazon Prime carries a bunch of other perks these days, such as free unlimited photo storage, ad-free streaming of over two million songs, and more.",

      "text": "Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is reaping the rewards of its digital investments, which could position it as a force to be reckoned with in the online battle against the rest of the retail competition.\n“For holiday and fourth quarter, we expect Walmart to continue to excel on multiple fronts, particularly online where we expect sales to continue to accelerate on a percentage basis, with a growth rate approaching 30% likely as it leverages its store network to handle online orders, especially via its buy online/pick-up in-store capability, as well as increasing benefits from Jet.com,” said Charlie O’Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody’s.\nWal-Mart WMT, -4.43% reported a 20.6% increase in global e-commerce sales on a constant-currency basis for the third quarter. Moody’s puts Wal-Mart’s online sales growth on a base of $14 billion to $15 billion, without a full quarter of Jet.com results.\nTotal revenue for the third quarter was $118.2 billion, up from $117.4 billion last year, but falling short of the FactSet consensus of $118.6 billion. Earnings per share were 98 cents, down from $1.03 last year, but ahead of the 96-cent FactSet estimate.\nWal-Mart shares are down 4.4% in Thursday trading.\nSee also: Wal-Mart sales fall short as profit declines 8.2%\nWal-Mart added eight million SKUs (stock keeping units) to the website over the past three months, Chief Executive Doug McMillion said Thursday in his prepared remarks. And e-commerce added 50 basis points to the retailer’s third-quarter U.S. same-store sales figure, “which is our largest contribution yet,” he added.\nWalmart U.S. same-store sales increased 1.2% in the third quarter, driven by a 0.7% traffic increase, Wal-Mart said.\nWal-Mart announced a strategic alliance with Chinese e-commerce company JD.com this summer, that included the sale of its Yihaodian website to JD.com.\nSee also: Wal-Mart’s deal with China’s JD.com may be copied by others\nThe partners announced that they were launching three new initiatives in late October.\nWal-Mart has also invested in New Dada, a Chinese on-demand logistics and grocery e-commerce platform, McMillon said in his remarks. New Dada is making two-hour delivery service from 45 Walmart locations possible.\nSee also: Amazon’s big rival in e-commerce is Wal-Mart\nWal-Mart announced that it was acquiring Jet.com for $3 billion in August. Jet.com founder Marc Lore took over Wal-Mart’s e-commerce operations earlier this month .\nNeil Saunders, chief executive of retail research agency and consulting firm Conlumino, believes Wal-Mart’s U.S. online growth “is now well above the overall market,” which indicates they’re adding share. But there are other factors playing a role in the result.\n“[T]he figures include half a quarter of sales from recently acquired Jet.com, which flatters the results somewhat,” said Saunders in a note published Thursday. “Nonetheless, we believe that Walmart is now on much more positive trajectory in terms of both its e-commerce strategy and results.”\nSee also: Wal-Mart to take on Amazon with upgrades to its brick-and-mortar stores\nWalmart's Strategy on Food Safety and Affordability (3:07) Frank Yiannas, vice president of Food Safety at Walmart Stores, discusses the strategy for reducing risk and providing consumers with safe, affordable foods at America's largest grocery chain. He spoke with WSJ's Sarah Nassauer at the WSJ Global Food Forum in New York.\n“We view the same-store sales growth as evidence that Wal-Mart’s investment in labor, e-commerce and marketing its value message are working,” said The Buckingham Research Group in a note published Thursday. “However, some investors may be disappointed that traffic and comps decelerated slightly from fiscal second-quarter 2016.”\nWal-Mart highlighted food deflation, weather and currency impacts among the headwinds.\nWal-Mart shares are up 11.8% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.17% is up 6.7% for the same period. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.08% is up 8.3% for 2016 so far.\nMore from MarketWatch 5 things NOT to buy at Lowe’s and Home Depot How Might Donald Trump Shape the Supreme Court?

      "text": "Barnes and Noble officially announces Nook Tablet 7\" The Nook Tablet 7\" is an answer to Amazon's Fire Tablet. (Source: Barnes and Noble) The Nook Tablet 7\" is official, and its ready to take on the Fire tablet from rival Amazon. Will the budget priced Nook be a boon or a bust for the bookseller? by Sam Medley, 2016/11/17 Android ARM Tablet Touchscreen   Barnes and Noble is officially back in the tablet market. After dropping the NOOK brand, the bookseller relied on Samsung to produce the tablets sold in its stores. However, a new NOOK branded tablet was officially announced yesterday. Spotted earlier as it made its way through the FCC , the NOOK Tablet 7” is a budget priced Android tablet that hopes to be an alternative to Amazon’s popular Fire Tablet. The NOOK Tablet 7” has specifications the expected for an Android tablet in this price range: up to 128 GB expandable storage via microSD 5 MP rear-facing camera 3,000 mAh battery 1024x600 resolution touchscreen The display is an IPS panel, but the low resolution is disappointing. Overall, the NOOK Tablet 7” is a budget device through and through, and the specs are fairly underwhelming but in line with the price. The device will run Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box, and users will have full access to the Google Play Store. This isn’t too surprising as Barnes and Noble closed down its own NOOK app store earlier this year. In addition, the device will come pre-installed with Barnes and Noble apps, including B&N Readout. Barnes and Noble describes the software as “an innovative feature that brings the pleasures of bookstore browsing and discovery to the NOOK digital experience.” According to the press release: “Leveraging Barnes & Noble’s vast content catalog and deep bookseller knowledge, B&N Readouts delivers compelling two-minute book excerpts as well as full articles from current issues of popular periodicals. These mobile-friendly quick reads are tailored to users’ favorite genres and subjects and optimized for sharing.

      "text": "NEW YORK — For Amazon, Black Friday deals are starting early and ending just days before Christmas.\nAmazon will hold its second annual Prime Day after its blazing success in 2015. (David McNew/Getty Images)\nStarting Wednesday, the e-commerce giant is offering deals on a variety of products, including toys, electronics, kitchen and home goods and video games.\nHowever, the company said many of its top deals will be offered during the “Turkey 5,” which starts on Thanksgiving Day and runs through the Monday following the holiday — known as Cyber Monday.\nAmazon claims it will have the lowest prices on certain Samsung, LG and Sony TVs and is reducing some prices of Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price toys by as much as 50%.\nThe company is also discounting its own products: The Amazon Echo will be on sale for $139.99 and the Tap will be $89.99, a price cut of $40.\nShoppers can track deals on Amazon’s app and customers who have Prime memberships, which costs $99 a year, will get early access to “Lightning Deals.”\nHere are a few of the deals Amazon will offer at various times between Nov. 18 and Nov. 25:\n32″ 720p LED TV for $69.99 55″ LG 4K Smart TV for $398 $150 off a Delonghi Super Automatic Coffee Machine Sennheiser HD 598 Cs Closed Back Headphone for $99.95 Sphero Star Wars BB-8 Droid for $99.99 Amazon Fire HD 8 for $59.99 Amazon Kindle for Kids Bundle for $69.99 Up to 60% off select Disney toys and apparel Intex Explorer K2 Kayak for $70.99 Nest Thermostat (3rd Generation) for $199\n40.712784 -74.005941 ",

      "text": "Share \nAs it leads up to the launch of the show The Grand Tour, its new original series, Amazon is also launching an even grander promotion. New Amazon Prime members can grab the service for 20 percent off the regular first-year membership subscription fee. The limited promotion of $79 for the initial year is temporarily available on one single day — Nov. 18 – the same day the new show’s first episode premieres exclusively through Amazon. New episodes will drop each week for 12 weeks. \nThe Grand Tour, shot in 4K Ultra High Definition, has been a highly anticipated new series taking viewers across the globe — from Johannesburg to England to Nashville — with the help of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May. It will be available through the Amazon Video app for TVs, connected devices including Amazon Fire TV, mobile devices and online at Amazon.com/thegrandtour . \n“We are thrilled to bring back together the world’s beloved hosting team of Clarkson, Hammond and May for extraordinary adventures that can only be seen on Amazon Prime Video,” said Conrad Riggs, head of Unscripted Amazon Originals. \nEvery Thursday before an episode, viewers receive a clue related to the upcoming episode and unlock exclusive video content. Between the show, clues and promotion, Amazon’s Alexa is also on board. The tech giant added a skill related to the new show just for Alexa, as well as the Amazon Echo and Echo Dot devices. Weekly drawings with prizes related to the show, such as a $25 Amazon gift certificate, will also be given away. According to the release, asking Alexa if she was invited on the Grand Tour is a big hint toward a prize. \nAmazon Prime exclusive content also includes Mr. Robot , Downton Abbey , The Americans , Orphan Black , Transparent , The Man in the High Castle , Love & Friendship , and Tumble Leaf . \nThe services coincides with an attempt to musically rival Spotify and Apple Music. Amazon also recently announced its music service — Amazon Music Unlimited — with its family plan deal, which allows six people to share one account for $14.99 per month. \nThe family plan rate is the same whether users are Amazon Prime members or not. That said, it is up from the individual rate of $7.99 per month for Amazon Prime members and $2 more for non-Prime members, but the average family plan user has a more competitive pricing. \nThat said, experts say the flat family plan rate is a missed opportunity to get more Amazon Prime members on board. The reason may be that Amazon already has certain demographics like students hooked on the Prime product through other marketing methods. \nHowever, Prime members do get one big benefit: They can opt against the monthly billing and choose to pay on annual basis. The lump-sum cost comes out to $149, which takes off about $2.50 per month, or $30.84 for the year. Sure, the monthly option is easier on the monthly bills, but in the long run, the lower annual rate could be a realized benefit for consumers. \nFor those who have Alexa on board, Amazon sees this as a great pairing. Upon request, she is able to sync up with Amazon Music Unlimited and provide a variety of capabilities, from playing children’s music to the top pop song, creating a playlist on demand or even playing a song that a user knows only a few lyrics to.",

      "text": "Ari Levy | CNBC Google Cloud chief Diane Greene speaking on September 29, 2016 \nGoogle, in its bid to challenge Amazon.com 's dominance in the cloud, has enlisted a big partner: Intel . \nIt's been a splashy year for Google's cloud platform, following the hiring of VMware co-founder Diane Greene last November to run the business. In addition to aggressive pricing and a big rebranding effort, Greene's strategy to chase down Amazon Web Services has centered around partnerships with key players in the business world. \nOn Thursday, Google and Intel said they're working together on technology to help enterprises securely move data to the cloud. By linking up with Intel, Google is following through on its plan to lure businesses that have been reluctant to embrace the cloud. Customers don't have to think about it as a wholesale shift, but rather can count on an existing vendor — Intel — to help guide them. \nDespite Google's advances, AWS still controls the market. According to Synergy Research Group , AWS' share of the cloud infrastructure market sits at 45 percent, while Microsoft, Google and IBM have less than 20 percent combined. At the end of the second quarter, Google had only 5 percent of the market, according to Synergy. \nAnd while virtually all emerging companies and new applications are being developed in the cloud, only 41 percent of all enterprise workloads are running in a public or private cloud, according to 451 Research , with the rest still sitting in data centers on premises. By mid-2018, that number will be up to 60 percent. \nIn teaming up with Intel, whose chips power traditional servers, Google can layer in software that simplifies the process of migrating data from their own machines into the cloud and back as needed. Google's homegrown Kubernetes technology allows developers to package information in virtual containers to make it movable and accessible from more places and a multitude of devices. \n\"You just can't pick up and move every workload,\" said Nan Boden, head of global alliances at the newly branded Google Cloud, in an interview. \"You have to come up with an architecture that makes it practical for these companies to be able to take advantage of these new technologies in the cloud and new economics in the cloud.\" \nRevenue from public cloud services, including software and infrastructure, is expected to more than double to $195 billion by 2020 from $96.5 billion this year, according to IDC . \nGoogle Cloud previously partnered with Autodesk on technology for entertainment companies to quickly render 3-D images and with Okta to help businesses securely deploy Google Apps. In an interview with CNBC.com in May, Greene said that she's \"super partner-oriented.\" \nGoogle and Intel aren't disclosing if there's a revenue split in the products they're developing. Raejeanne Skillern, vice president of Intel's data center group, said the partnership is focused on serving clients' needs and creating technology that's secure and accessible. \nIn addition to Kubernetes, another Google product that Skillern is excited about is TensorFlow, software that brings machine learning tools into more applications. \n\"This is definitely groundbreaking for our work with Google,\" Skillern said.

Crystal Cruz reports. \"The feedback we've gotten so far from Cyber Monday, this is going to be a record-breaking year for us, said General Manager Scott Anderson. Crystal Cruz reports. Spencer Soper Bloomberg \nAmazon.com Inc. is turning to merchants who sell on its marketplace for extra warehouse space, a less-costly way to expand inventory available for quick delivery. \nInventory available for delivery within two business days expanded by 6 million items under the Seller Fulfilled Prime program, the company announced Thursday. Amazon earlier this year introduced the program, which lets independent merchants sell goods on Amazon as \"Prime Eligible\" even if Amazon isn't handling packaging and delivery. \nIt's the latest sign the world's biggest online retailer can't build facilities quickly enough to meet demand for an ever-expanding assortment of goods that customers want delivered fast and free. Warehouse capacity issues and the cost of new facilities helped increase Amazon's spending on order fulfillment 34 percent in the third quarter. The big expenses caused the Seattle-based company to miss analysts' profit projections, driving down shares 8.8 percent since the results were reported Oct. 27. \nA look at the Amazon warehouse in Kenosha, Wis., as Amazon announces plans to more than double its presence in Joliet, adding a second warehouse that it says will add more than 2,000 full-time jobs. Those positions will be in addition to the 1,500 jobs Amazon announced last summer for Joliet, site of its first Illinois warehouse. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) \nAmazon's revenue is projected to increase 28 percent to $137 billion this year, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The fast growth prompted the company to accelerate its warehouse building spree, with more than 15 fulfillment centers opening in California, Texas, Illinois, Kansas, New Jersey, Georgia and Florida that will collectively employ more than 12,000 workers. \nIn addition to adding capacity, Amazon introduced Seller Fulfilled Prime to take advantage of the warehouse space of its merchant partners. Amazon sells its own inventory as well as products owned by merchants who give the company a cut of each sale, similar to a consignment shop. \nMany of those merchants send their products to Amazon warehouses and pay the company extra to handle packing and shipping, which lets their products be listed as Prime eligible. Seller Fulfilled Prime is a way to let select merchants get the Prime label on products without using Amazon's facilities. \nPrime subscribers pay $99 a year for faster, free delivery in addition to other benefits such as access to the company's video service. \nJeff McDonald, owner of Raw Paws Pet Food in Indianapolis, joined the program in August about a year after he began selling products on Amazon. His company had to pass a test by fulfilling 300 orders with little wiggle room for returns, defective products or late shipments, he said.",

      "text": "Story highlights Groups rated retailers' safer chemicals programs in new report Amazon, Costco and Albertsons received F grades on the toxic chemical report card; Walmart and Target received Bs (CNN) As you're poring over the holiday ads from major retailers to make your wish list, environmental activists want you to consider more than price when you shop. \n\"Use your purchasing power to drive positive change in the marketplace,\" said Mike Schade of Safer Chemicals Healthy Families , a group devoted to reducing toxic chemical footprints. \"Ask major retailers to get tough on manufacturers and use their influence to rid the marketplace of toxic chemicals.\" Common chemicals hurt our health -- and cost us money \"When out shopping, no one should have to worry that the shampoo, lotions, cleaners, clothing, shoes, or home electronics contain toxic ingredients that could harm their family's health,\" said Mike Belliveau, executive director of the Environmental Health Strategy Center , another group working to reduce toxic chemicals in the marketplace. \"Where would you rather shop, at a retailer that scores a B or the retailer with a red F for failure to ensure their safety of their products?\" To help consumers make those decisions, a new report from the coalition grades retailers for the first time on how well they are reducing toxic chemicals in the products they sell. Called \"Who's Minding the Store\" the report graded companies on a scale of zero to 130 points by looking at 13 different categories of action retailers could take, including chemical safety screening, ingredient disclosure, efforts to find safer alternatives and reporting the amount of \" chemicals of high concern \" the company has reduced or eliminated. Those chemicals include heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic, toxic flame retardants and endocrine disruptors such as parabens, BPA and formaldehyde. Read More The good news, said Schade, is that two top retailers, Walmart and Target, received a B grade for making \"meaningful progress\" over the last three years toward safer chemicals in the products they sell. In fact, both companies expanded their list of problematic chemicals to over 2,000. \"This summer Walmart reported that their suppliers had reduced high priority chemicals by 23 million pounds,\" said Schade, \"and Target added cosmetics to their policy for the first time and improved suppliers' transparency practices, especially in regard to fragrance.\" Unfortunately, says Schade, the average grade among the 11 retailers was a D+. \"There are some serious laggers,\" he said, \"showing there is a need for significant improvement in the marketplace to protect consumers.\" F for Amazon, Costco, Albertsons The online retailer Amazon received the worst score, only 7.5 points out of 130. Costco didn't fare much better, scoring only 9.5 points. Schade said all of the companies were shown the report in advance, and given the chance to respond. Dangerous chemicals hiding in everyday products \"Neither Costco or Amazon formally responded to our communications,\" said Schade. \"We think this is deeply concerning. Amazon, for example, is set to become the largest retailer of apparel and electronics over the next year, and increasingly rolling out new product lines. They need to catch up.\" Albertsons, a supermarket chain, also received an F in the report, scoring only 12.5 points out of 130. The company told CNN that the Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families report \"offers an incomplete view of the work we do to offer our customers products and merchandise that put safety first.\" \"In fact, in May 2016, we were recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency for our efforts toward labeling our private label products which meet the EPA's Safer Choice requirements,\" said Chris Wilcox, vice president of communications. \"We are committed to continuing these efforts across the products we manufacture and those we sell in our stores, and to giving our customers the information they need to make purchasing choices that are right for them.' Amazon did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Costco said it was not able to provide a response. More scores Kroger received a D- in the ratings, with only 15.5 points. More Ds were assigned to Walgreens with 29.5 points, Lowe's at 29.5 and Home Depot at 35.5 points of out 130. Fast food serves up phthalates, too, study suggests Home Depot and Kroger did not respond to a request for comment. Corporate public relations at Lowe's said: \"Safer Chemicals shared a copy of their study with us. We continue to have conversations with this group and others to learn more about their concerns.\" Walgreens told CNN it is working with their English partner Walgreens Boots Alliance, which has \"already developed an advanced program in retailing, manufacturing and chemical sustainability. We also are in continuous dialogue with multiple external parties including laboratories, NGO's and other retailers to improve the transparency of product ingredients and chemicals of concern.\" \"It's not all doom and gloom,\" said Schade. \"Some companies are making significant progress. For example, CVS Health has signed the Chemical Footprint Project, the first pharmacy to do so, and has pledged to tell the public by 2017 about its list of restricted chemicals. And Best Buy told us they are working on a safer chemicals policy and restricted substance list.\" CVS Health (53 points) and Best Buy (41 points) both fell into the C category. Why retailers? Why should so much of the responsibility for change rest on the shoulders of giant retailers? Because they are on the front line of consumer discontent and they have a fundamental moral responsibility, argues Schade. Exposure to household chemicals may cause IQ drop \"If you think about it, most people don't buy products directly from the manufacturer,\" he said. \"It is retailers that have the relationships. The eleven retailers we evaluated have combined sales of over one trillion dollars , a market power that can transform the toxic chemical economy.\" Schade also pointed to the economic fallout that can affect companies when consumers find out that a company has been selling toxic products. Take for example the case of Lumber Liquidators, whose stock collapsed after CNN's Anderson Cooper reported, on the CBS News show \"60 Minutes,\" that the flooring sold by the company contained high levels of the cancer-causing chemical formaldehyde. The company's CEO later resigned. Tell us your story Tell us your story \nWe love to hear from our audience. Follow @CNNHealth on Twitter and Facebook for the latest health news and let us know what we're missing.\n\n\"And there's a United Nations report that documents the various financial and business risks associated with toxic chemicals -- including over $138 million in fines against Walmart, CVS and other retailers,\" said Schade. So what can a consumer do if they believe their favorite retailer doesn't have a satisfactory grade? \"We have an online action page ,\" said Schade. \"There you can both thank those companies who are doing well, and encourage those who are not to become a leader and not a lagger.\"",

      "text": "by Paul R. La Monica @lamonicabuzz November 17, 2016: 11:31 AM ET 5 stunning stats on Amazon November has been a terrible month for Amazon. The election of Donald Trump, who has attacked Amazon and CEO Jeff Bezos on Twitter, and increased competition from Walmart, Best Buy and Target appear to be taking their toll on the stock. \nShares of Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) have fallen nearly 5% since Election Day, wiping out about $20 billion in market value for the company in the process. \nThe net worth of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has taken a hit too. Bezos has been passed by both Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKB ) CEO Warren Buffett -- who is also not a friend of Trump -- and Spanish retail magnate Amancio Ortega -- who owns Zara -- in the process. \nMany big tech stocks -- including Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) , Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) and Google owner Alphabet ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) -- have fallen on fears about how Trump policies, especially a possible crackdown on immigration and potential trade wars with China, could impact the sector. \nBut Amazon could be in the crosshairs of Trump even more than any other tech company. \nRelated: What Trump's win means for Silicon Valley \nTrump and Bezos have already feuded on Twitter. \nThe President-elect has taken issue with the coverage of his campaign by The Washington Post, which is owned personally by Bezos. \nTrump also has erroneously suggested that Bezos will use the newspaper as a tax shelter for Amazon and has claimed that Amazon is still losing lots of money -- even though the company is now consistently profitable. \nBezos responded to Trump's complaints late last year with a tweet saying that he would like to send Trump into orbit on a rocket owned by his space exploration company Blue Origin. He also said last month that Trump is bad for democracy . \nBut Bezos took the moral high ground last week, tweeting his congratulations to Trump after his victory over Hillary Clinton. Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country. — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 \nSo will this end the animosity between Bezos and Trump? Maybe. Maybe not. \nAmazon might have even bigger problems than The Donald in the Oval Office. \nWhile Amazon remains the undisputed leader of e-commerce, the latest earnings from Walmart ( WMT ) , Best Buy ( BBY ) and Target ( TGT ) show that they are starting to nip at Amazon's heels. \nWalmart, which recently bought e-commerce unicorn Jet for more than $3 billion and struck a partnership in China with Alibaba ( BABA , Tech30 ) rival JD.com ( JD ) , reported online sales growth of more than 20% in the third quarter. \nBut Walmart's stock fell 4% since overall sales missed forecasts. \nBest Buy fared better though. It reported digital sales growth of nearly 25% from a year ago. \nInvestors used to mockingly refer to Best Buy as Amazon's showroom because people would often go to Best Buy stores to check prices and then order products from Amazon instead. That's no longer the case. \nThe company's overall sales and profits beat Wall Street's estimates too and Best Buy had a solid outlook -- despite the fact that the recall of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones and Samsung washing machines will cut fourth quarter sales by $200 million. \nBest Buy stock soared 7% on the solid results and the stock is now up 45% this year, thanks in large part to its digital success. \nRelated: Target hits the mark and wows with holiday outlook \nAnd Target reported strong digital sales growth too. The company said Wednesday that e-commerce revenue was up 26% from a year ago. \nOf course, Amazon is now much more than a retailer. It's a leader in cloud hosting and a burgeoning player in the media business thanks to its original TV shows for Prime customers. \nBut the combination of an unfriendly face in the White House and more competition from brick and mortar retailers may lead investors to finally question if Amazon's pricey stock -- trading at 85 times next year's earnings estimates -- is still worth it.

      "text": "Growth-Needy Cisco Aiming To Be Top Dog In Security Vs. Palo Alto (Investor's Business Daily) \nTrip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research commented in a report Thursday that Cisco Systems, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: CSCO ) earnings report and guidance reaffirms his prior thesis that the company is losing share to SuperCloud providers, such as Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) AWS and Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Azure. \nChowdhry commented in a report on November 12 that traditional on-premises software companies, including Cisco, could see their addressable market decline by around 60 percent and their business will secularly decline in tandem. \nChowdhry added that Software-Defined-Everything is \"passe\" and \"should not be a part of investors bull thesis\" since these offerings are not priced for scale. Companies that operate in this space other than Cisco includes Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE: JNPR ) and VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW ). \nOn the other hand, Cisco faces competition from Amazon's AWS that can offer 100 times the performance at 1/10th the price. \nIn addition, the analyst noted that neither Amazon's AWS nor Microsoft's Azure use branded network equipment. \n\"Recovery in CSCO's business is impossible,\" Chowdhry said in his report on Thursday. \"It will be in secular decline. Cisco has zero chance of winning against SuperCloud providers.\" \nShares of Cisco were trading lower by more than 5 percent. Latest Ratings for CSCO",

      "text": "Announcing Sumo Logic’s State of Modern Apps in AWS Report November 15, 2016 | By bruno Amazon Web Services , DevOps , IT Ops , Security , Technology \nToday we published Sumo Logic’s first “ The State of The Modern App in AWS ” report. We wanted to explore how modern applications differ from traditional applications: how are the modern app workloads run, what application components are used, and which types of application services are leveraged? This report is based on anonymized data from about 1,000 customers running modern application workloads in AWS and it examines the composition of those applications. \nSumo Logic provides our customers with the operational and security visibility of their applications. As such, multiple millions events per second of live data are sent to our service from our customers’ full application stack: infrastructure, application components, custom app code, as well as variety of application services leveraged to manage the application. Fingerprint of this data then gives us unprecedented ability to answer questions about these applications. \nWhen we founded Sumo Logic, we decided to build a multi-tenant analytics service in order to be able to leverage the cross customer visibility in order to provide more value to each customer. Our architecture and technology behind it allows us to: Analyze anonymized statistics about technology usage to help our existing and future customers learn about latest technology trends emerging from enterprises leading the way to digital transformation (e.g. this report) Prioritize roadmap items in order to help our customers gain visibility into most commonly used technologies (e.g. our integration with Docker) Improve our machine learning algorithms by exposing them to larger data sets of same data types across multiple customers Derive meanings from events occurring across same sources across multiple customers to improve operational and security outcomes \nI am excited to have this report as it is a very tangible response to a question I very frequently get: what is the value of having a multi-tenant architecture? It is easy to quickly respond that we benefit from the same operating model as other all-in cloud services, such as AirBnB, Netflix, Hudl, etc. But this report also highlights another, and perhaps more important and unique value of multi-tenancy – it gives us the ability to analyze trillions of anonymized events across our customer community and convert them into value for each individual customer as they build, run, and secure their modern application. With Sumo Logic, you are not alone. \nWe are excited to continue deriving insights that will help our customers create better outcomes for their business. More Posts By bruno",

      "text": "Amazon says it expects the independent merchants selling on its website to have a record holiday season, a prediction that, if true, will test its readiness to handle the oncoming shopping onslaught. \nThe forecast comes as the world’s largest e-commerce player braces for the busiest time in retail, having invested billions and tweaked its merchant platform to avoid the crunch that befell it last year when shoppers bought more than it could easily handle. \nThird-party sellers account for about half of the items sold on Amazon, paying fees to the Seattle juggernaut for the transactions and other services. \nThrough a program called Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), many merchants leave the storage and shipping of their products in Amazon’s hands and can participate in the Prime loyalty program, which offers members free shipping. Last year the fulfillment program delivered more than a billion items around the world. \n  While these third parties compete with Amazon’s own retail division, they also constitute an increasingly important source of profit for the company.\nBut in the fourth quarter of 2015, an unexpectedly large quantity of wares from merchants enrolled in FBA also strained Amazon’s logistical capacity. \nSo this year Amazon hiked its storage and handling fees during the holiday season and lowered them during the quiet season in order to keep merchants from parking slow-selling merchandise in Amazon warehouses during the busy time. \nIt’s also relying more on Seller Fulfilled Prime, a special program in which sellers who ship their own orders can also participate in the Prime program; Seller Fulfilled Prime has added more than 6 million new items in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and Japan, Amazon said Thursday.\nAmazon also opened 18 new warehouses in the third quarter, a record number. By comparison, the retail giant opened 14 during all of 2015.\nOn average, analysts expect Amazon to rake in $44.7 billion in sales during the holiday quarter, up 25 percent from last year. \nÁngel González: 206-464-2250 or agonzalez@seattletimes.com .

      "text": "DALLAS , Nov. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- AT&T is launching a skill on Amazon's Alexa-enabled devices that lets you send a text message simply by talking. Customers can get the AT&T Send Message skill starting Nov. 18 . Customers can also buy Amazon Echo and Echo Dot that day at www.att.com and AT&T retail stores. Amazon Echo is available for $179 and Echo Dot can be purchased for $49 .\nSkills are voice-driven capabilities that enhance the functionality of Alexa devices, including Amazon Echo and Echo Dot. Alexa is Amazon's cloud-based voice service, to play music, provide information, news, sports scores, weather, and now the AT&T Send Message skill. 1 AT&T is the first carrier to offer this skill that lets you send text messages from your mobile number to your predetermined list of contacts that will recognize you. \nThe AT&T Send Message skill is ideal if you're in a hurry or busy with your hands. Just ask Alexa to have AT&T text your friend and then Alexa will prompt you to say your text message. You can add up to ten frequent contacts to the skill so can send them text messages without typing on your smartphone. \n\"Amazon Echo is ahead of the curve in terms of voice recognition technology and functionality,\" said Jeff Bradley , senior vice president, Device and Network Services Marketing. \"AT&T is the first carrier to bring this unique skill to a product already known for innovation. We're always working to bring simple solutions for our customers to stay in touch. In the tradition of NumberSync, another solution that was introduced at AT&T first, the Send Message Skill gives our customers another easy and convenient way to communicate.\"\nFor more information on the Send Message skill visit www.att.com/SendMessageSkill starting this Friday. \n1 Available only to qualified AT&T wireless customers.  Compatible device and service plan with text messaging are required.  Standard text messaging and data rates apply.  Texts may be sent only to recipients on a list you predetermine and maintain using the Skill.  Content of texts sent by AT&T are determined by Alexa's reading of your voice commands.

      "title": "Did Amazon secretly acquire online meeting startup Biba? Newly uncovered filings point to stealthy deal",
      "text": "Biba makes business communications and conferencing tools. (Image: Biba) Merger documents uncovered by GeekWire suggest that Amazon last year stealthily acquired Biba , a San Francisco-based company that makes chat, video and audio conferencing tools for businesses.\nDocuments filed with the Delaware Secretary of State in September 2015 show a series of corporate changes that merged Biba Systems with an entity called Justin Acquisition. Justin’s incorporation documents used Amazon’s address, 410 Terry Ave. N. in Seattle, and the entity was incorporated by Julie Santel, at the time a corporate paralegal focused on U.S. subsidiaries for Amazon, according to her profile on LinkedIn .\nThe deal has flown almost entirely under the radar, and that appears by design. The only reference we could find to it online is an article about IBM that mentioned Amazon acquiring Biba in 2015 and suggests it could potentially put its technology together with Elemental Technologies , a Portland-based video processing company Amazon bought , also in 2015, for $296 million.\nBiba CEO Carlin Wiegner We’re not sure what Amazon wanted with Biba because neither side is talking. We’ve reached out to Biba and Amazon in recent days about the documents we uncovered, but have not heard back. Biba CEO Carlin Wiegner didn’t respond to email messages, and the company didn’t return a voice mail.\nIt’s possible Amazon could be using Biba for internal communication purposes, or the company may be planning an external product that would compete with other workplace communication tools like Slack, Skype, Google Hangouts, GoToMeeting, the newly announced Microsoft Teams and others. These tools have become essential to many teams in recent years, as employees increasingly telecommute or work flex hours. Amazon also competes in business communications with its WorkMail service .\nJustin.tv was the name of the predecessor to game streaming site Twitch, acquired by Amazon for $970 million in 2014 , but it’s not clear if the Justin Acquisition name is connected to Twitch. One clue that something significant happened Biba last year: The official Biba Twitter account has been quiet since August 2015 , a month before the date of the merger documents.\nBiba was founded in 2012 by a group of five friends who were tired of having bad experiences with conference calls. The company started as a way to make it easier to participate in conference calls on smartphones and evolved to encompass other collaboration tools such as video conferencing, screen sharing and business chat. The company raised more than $15 million funding from investors including InterWest Partners, Benchmark Capital and Trinity Ventures.\nBiba touts the simplicity of managing its products as well as its security. Biba says it hosts its cloud data on Amazon Web Services and offers several means to encrypt data and protect privacy. Biba’s executives all come from cyber security company Symantec.\n“Security principles and best practices underlie the Biba team’s mission to build a product that not only helps you build a collaborative culture and a productive workforce, but also helps keep your organization safe and your company information secure,” according to Biba’s Security Overview .\nAmazon spent a total of $690 million on acquisitions in 2015 , most of it in cash, according to the company’s annual 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in January. The purchase of Israeli chipmaker Annapurna Labs for a reported price of $350 million, which was not confirmed by the company at the time , as well as the Elemental Technologies deal, were among Amazon’s biggest buys last year.\nOther companies acquired by Amazon in 2015 included cloud technology startup ClusterK , 3D shoe-fitting technology startup Shoefitr ; database migration startup Amiato ; Internet of Things startup 2lemetry , and automated text translation software startup Safaba Translation Systems .",

      "text": "Bob Mangat, Realtor and Founder, Featured on Forbes and Amazon \nBlaine, WA   The founder of multiple companies that have earned over $50 million in sales, Bob Mangat was recently featured on Forbes and Amazon. As a highly successful and experienced businessman Bob is passionate about transferring his knowledge to struggling entrepreneurs and online marketers, he has taught his marketing techniques to over 1200 small business owners, real estate professionals, and investors. The article draws focus on why social media marketing strategies fail. In today's age of technology and the internet, business owners and marketers have to turn their focus to online marketing activities now more than ever. Internet has emerged as a unique and powerful marketing and advertising medium, presenting a wide variety of marketing opportunities for today's business owners and marketers which include powerful tools for connecting with the prospective customers through social media marketing on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube and more. Even though internet marketing can prove to be very fruitful, it's usually hard for small business owners to get the hang of it in the beginning. \"It's the 21st Century and pretty much everyone has some sort of social media account. Well, at least 73% of adults do. But just because you're on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or Pinterest doesn't guarantee success. Even if you have a decent amount of fans, likes, or followers, it doesn't mean that your social media strategy is working. If you're not generating conversations or new subscribers, or making any money, then whatever you're doing has failed.\" – Bob Mangat said about the importance social media marketing. Simply existing online or being present on the social media website does not cut it anymore, as more and more businesses make their way online, the competition for the attention of the target market is becoming increasingly cut throat. Social media platforms such as Facebook allow business owners and marketers to talk directly to their fans, followers and customers, which enables them to know the likes and dislikes of the people, similarly they can connect to the fans on a more personal level to get their feedback, this should be ideally the focus of any great social media marketing strategy. Bob wants business owners and online marketers to realize this crucial detail and develop a cohesive strategy that is more than just the basic information about a business, product or service. About Bob Mangat Bob Mangat is the founder of a few 7 figure businesses, a realtor and an online marketing guru. Bob Mangat",

      "text": "share this share this \nGoogle is way behind Amazon in the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) market but it fully intends to catch up. \nThe company recently added a new zone to its Cloud Platform infrastructure business with the opening of the Asia-Northeast region in Tokyo. This brings Google's total number of regions around the world to six, adding to the three existing regions in th eU.S., one in Belgium and one in Taiwan. SUBSCRIBE to Website Magazine & Accelerate 'Net Success \nWhat this means is Google is able to offer busineses lower latency and o verall better performance in terms of data-transfer speeds. During a beta test, according to Google, its customers in Japan experience 85 percent lower latency when compared to when linked to the Taiwan region. \nThe Tokyo Cloud Region supports Google Compute Engine, Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Persistent Disk, Google App Engine Standard Environment, Google Container Engine, database and analytics services, and core networking and security services, including Cloud VPN and Google Cloud DNS.",

      "text": "3x Membership Reward Points at Amazon November 17, 2016 by Deals We Like 2 Comments \nThis   links from our advertising partners, such as American Express.   here. \nA new Amex Offers came out this morning where you can receive 3x points on all Amazon purchases . This offer is ONLY available on Membership Reward earning American Express credit cards, i.e., EveryDay, Premier Gold Rewards, Platinum, etc. And unlike most other Amex Offers, instead of receiving a statement credit on your purchase, you’ll receive 3x point bonus points. For example, I have it on my Amex EveryDay card which typically earns 1 point per dollar spent at Amazon. However, if I make 20 purchases within a billing cycle, I’ll receive a 20% bonus. Taking this 3x bonus into account and assuming I am able to make the 20 purchases, that will net me 3.6x points per dollar spent at Amazon. This promotion lasts through December 31, 2016. To register for this offer… Sign into your AmericanExpress.com account and go to the “Amex Offers For You” tab. Find the Amazon.com offer and make sure to select the “Save Offer” button (although once you do this for one card the option will disappear on other cards, so you’ll need to set up a Twitter account to save the offer to the rest of your Amex cards or read this post to learn how to sync multiple Amex cards with your AmericanExpress.com account) \n\nI personally wish this was a statement credit offer like we’ve seen in the past during this time of year. Fingers crossed another offer will come out soon, but I am not holding my breathe. There are actually better cards to use for Amazon purchases and I will be posted on that later today.",

      "text": "Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump are using online retailer Amazon to attack Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly through harsh reviews of her new book.\nMore than 100 negative one-star reviews appeared on the Amazon page selling Kelly’s memoir “Settle for More” within hours of its Tuesday release.\nMany of the comments came through a link on a pro-Trump Reddit forum called “The_Donald.” While the forum uses a Trump-Pence logo from the election campaign, it has no official association with the president-elect.\nThe forum instructed users to trash “Settle for More.” One post said: “Megyn Kelly’s new book on Amazon (link included). It would be a shame if her biased reporting was reflected in the customer reviews!” The forum mounted a similar campaign against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s last book.\nThe rapid spread of rhetoric against Kelly's book shows that many Trump fans have not forgiven her for her tough treatment of him during the contentious campaign. It also underscores how no platform — even an online retailer — is off-limits for a mobilized political force that wants to target a perceived opponent.\nExecutives at Harper Collins noticed the unusually high number of negative reviews – with one star out of a possible five -- for “Settle for More” by midday Tuesday, just hours after the book became available. The publisher only made a few advance copies available.\n'Cuck,' 'snowflake,' 'masculinist': A guide to the language of the 'alt-right' Jessica Roy Stephen K. Bannon's fringe brand of conservatism is suddenly front and center, after he was named to be chief strategist in Donald Trump ’s White House.

Bannon's fringe brand of conservatism is suddenly front and center, after he was named to be chief strategist in Donald Trump ’s White House. As the chairman of Breitbart News, Bannon turned the website into, in his own words, the \"go-to platform of the alt-right” – a far-right ideology ...\n(Jessica Roy) “It has the hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book and our author Megyn Kelly,” said Tina Andreadis, senior vice president and director of publicity for HarperCollins. “We have brought it to the attention of Amazon.”\nAmazon, which did not respond to a request for a comment, had removed many of the reviews by Wednesday. But the page still has a high number of harsh comments for a celebrity tome that has just recently gone on sale.\nThe negative reviews can be potentially damaging to the success of “Settle for More,” as more than 50% of a best-selling book’s sales come through Amazon. Kelly received a $6-million advance from HarperCollins to write the book.\nAmazon users do not need to buy a book in order to post a review. The reviews from actual customers are given a “verified purchaser” designation, and those appear to have been left on the page for Kelly’s book.\n“Confused as a feminist, lacking as a 'journalist.' Now she can add 'failed as an author,' ” said one reviewer identified as One Woman’s Opinion.\n'A great purge'? Twitter suspends prominent alt-right accounts Travis M. Andrews Ever since alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulous sent actress Leslie Jones a string of deeply offensive tweets, insulting the comedian's race and intelligence, Twitter has made banning abusive accounts a priority.\nAt the time, the company offered a statement, which read in part:\n\"… our rules...\nEver since alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulous sent actress Leslie Jones a string of deeply offensive tweets, insulting the comedian's race and intelligence, Twitter has made banning abusive accounts a priority.\nAt the time, the company offered a statement, which read in part:\n\"… our rules...\n(Travis M. Andrews) Kelly is no stranger to the online wrath of Trump’s most ardent supporters.\nA prime-time anchor on Fox News Channel since 2012, Kelly became a household name after putting tough Republican primary debate questions to Trump about his past behavior toward women. Trump responded with hostile remarks about Kelly, including one that suggested she was menstruating during the debate held in August 2015. He used Twitter to attack her in the months that followed, calling her a bimbo and questioning her credibility as a journalist.\nTrump’s supporters piled on, unleashing a torrent of vicious posts. The candidate retweeted many of those remarks to his millions of Twitter followers.\nIn her book, Kelly said Trump’s public behavior toward her in 2015 led to anonymous death threats in the months that followed. She needed to have security guards accompany her and her family on a Disney World vacation.\nKelly said she made peace with Trump in April, when she personally negotiated his appearance on her prime-time special on the Fox broadcast network.\nBut Kelly has remained a polarizing figure for the conservative segment of Fox News Channel’s audience, which responds negatively to any criticism of Trump on her program.\nDuring her publicity tour for “Settle for More,” Kelly has used her confrontation with Trump as a cautionary tale for journalists who cover him in the White House.\n“If a President Trump were to come after a journalist the way the candidate Trump came after me, I think it could be potentially dangerous,” Kelly said Wednesday during an interview on “CBS This Morning.” “And I think, hopefully, the book will provide somewhat of a road map for reporters on how, potentially, to handle him.”\nKelly’s book also has caused some tension among her colleagues at Fox News. Bill O’Reilly, host of the top-rated “The O’Reilly Factor,” suggested in a TV interview and on his program that Kelly is “making my network look bad” and that she has been disloyal by writing in detail about the sexual harassment allegations against Roger Ailes , who was ousted from his post as Fox News chairman in July.\nIn the book, Kelly revealed how Ailes made inappropriate remarks and tried to initiate a sexual relationship with her early in her 12-year tenure at Fox News. She shared her experiences with the attorneys who investigated the sexual harassment charges brought in a suit against Ailes by former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson, which led to Ailes’ downfall.\n“If somebody is paying you a wage, you owe that company allegiance,” O’Reilly said Tuesday on his program without mentioning Kelly by name. “You don’t like what’s happening in the workplace, go to human resources or leave. I’ve done that…. Don’t run down the concern that supports you by trying to undermine it.”\nDuring a publicity stop on her book tour interviews on Wednesday, Kelly was asked about O’Reilly’s comment that her book reflected poorly on Fox News.\n“I believe that Roger Ailes made the company look bad,” Kelly told “CBS This Morning.”\nThe Fox News contracts with O’Reilly and Kelly are both up in 2017.\nstephen.battaglio@latimes.com\nTwitter: @SteveBattaglio\n Megyn Kelly Donald Trump Fox News Channel Crime Roger Ailes Fox Broadcasting Company",

Throughout the campaign, the president-elect vowed to “drain the swamp” of Washington, partly by decreasing the role of lobbyists and special interests in policymaking. [Trump aide Sean Spicer] said this is the first step toward that goal.The Obama administration has its own ban in place. Anyone who had been a registered lobbyist in the prior two years is prohibited from joining — unless they get a waiver.

I am suspicious that had the power brokers in Washington known what was coming, they'd have found a way to get Hillary Clinton into office. I didn't want that. I'm fed up. Enough is enough. I want my country back. This is supposed to be a government of the people — not of the banks, lobbyists and foreign donors. I am one of an endangered species called the American middle class [Y]ou, the pollsters and the incredibly biased \"mainstream\" media, wouldn't listen to me. You have been too busy promoting your own poisonous agenda. You did everything you could to brand conservatives as homophobic, xenophobic, greedy racists... America is not intolerant, it is kind and welcoming and insists only that people follow the rule of law and assimilate if they come here.... You fail to understand this because you are listening exclusively to America's worst critics; people who believe only in tearing down the traditions, perspectives and governmental foundations that made us great. You were trained up by liberal professors... And now, you scratch your heads, wondering how you could have been so clueless. You spend endless television and radio hours interviewing not the typical Americans like me, but one another — asking what happened. That was actually kind of incoherent. He says he wouldn't talk to the pollsters and then he complained that the pollsters didn't listen to people like him. I get that he's angry. And his side won, so go ahead and taunt them for not figuring out how to see you. I'm not quite sure why this man is able to think that he personally is the voice the pollsters didn't hear. He's a voice that wasn't heard. Except it was, wasn't it? It just wasn't counted accurately, and — more aptly — it was dis counted. People like this should be ignored because they can be overwhelmed by other voters. But not enough of those voters— the unreliable reliable Democrats — showed up. Posted by Ann Althouse at 6:21 AM",

      "text": "AT&T just announced that beginning tomorrow, its mobile customers will be able to compose and send text messages using Amazon’s Alexa assistant . So if you’ve got an Echo, Echo Tap, or Echo Dot somewhere in the house, you can ask Alexa to “have AT&T text” a contact’s name (Alexa can store up to 10), followed by your message. You’ve got to take that first step of adding people to the skill before Alexa can do anything; you can’t just call out the name of anyone in your contact list, for example.\nAT&T claims it’s the first carrier to offer an Alexa skill for SMS, and naturally the company sees it being most useful “if you’re in a hurry or busy with your hands.” The website with all the specifics on this feature isn’t live yet, so it’s not clear whether Alexa reads your spoken message back to you before firing it off to the recipient. Maybe stick with your phone for the important texts, but having Alexa as a relay for the everyday stuff sounds pretty convenient. As always, standard text messaging and data rates apply, and AT&T’s fine print says “content of texts sent by AT&T are determined by Alexa’s reading of your voice commands.” That’s another way of saying if Alexa completely misunderstands you and blows up a conversation, it’s all Amazon’s fault.",

      "text": "By Nick 27 minutes ago \nAmazon is gearing up for the small screen return of the internationally renowned Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May with The Grand Tour - and yes, that \"gearing\" pun was intended. The company is wisely using this particular release to announce and usher in the massive expansion of Amazon Prime, which will follow in Netflix's global footsteps by spreading its streaming programming across the planet. No more having to cross real international borders to watch The Man in the High Castle 's fake international borders. \nHere's how the rollout schedule is going to work for Amazon's international expansion and its newest big-budget property . The Grand Tour will hit Amazon Prime customers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria, Japan and five other territories on its release date, and it will later move on to the rest of the countries in December, when Amazon debuts its streaming and download video service in more than 200 countries. That's massive, and it will definitely help the company's wide variety of original series, both scripted and unscripted, find swaths of new audiences. Here's Jeremy Clarkson soothing some of those viewers. So. People of Ireland, Canada, Australia and pretty well everywhere else. You WILL be able to watch the Grand Tour. Amazon has gone global. — Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 16, 2016 \nAll those new eyeballs, in turn, will probably influence a broadening in Amazon's programming library with a misison to bring in more shows and movies from many other countries . Amazon took a widened approach to acquiring content over the past few years, and so there are, say, more British projects and co-productions, and things will likely only get more varied as time goes on. Due to the acclaim of Top Gear in many countries beyond its home nation, this will be a great litmus test to see how well the streaming goes once the service goes global. It's bound to get more eyes in other countries than some of Amazon's more niche fare. \nOnce Amazon is done with its initial expansion, it will actually be in more countries than Netflix, which is currently running in 190 nations, so even though it's behind in the updates, Amazon still comes out ahead in a way. There were hints that such a monumental announcement was on the way, with recent behind-the-scenes changes indicating worldwide growth, and this is about as big as it gets. \nThe Grand Tour will hit Amazon (almost) everywhere with its very first episode on Friday, November 18, so you don't have long to wait at all for your initial taste of what this trio has been up to in 2016. Head to the next page to watch Jeremy Clarkson & Co. make the Amazon announcement themselves in a cheeky video. And of course, check out our fall TV schedule and midseason premiere schedule to see what else you can look forward to watching in the future.",

      "text": "Book your tickets now! Amazon Prime has officially given us a UK launch time for The Grand Tour. Former Top Gear trio Richard Hammond, James May and Jeremy Clarkson will be back behind the wheel for their Amazon Prime series premiere on Friday (November 18) at 12.01am. A message from the guys. pic.twitter.com/p1IJNRjAnS — The Grand Tour (@thegrandtour) November 16, 2016 Amazon Prime subscribers in the UK will be able to watch Clarkson's latest automotive antics on \"smart TVs, streaming media players - including FireTV and FireTV Stick - Xbox, PlayStation, Wii, Wii U, on iOS and Android phones and tablets, and on the web\", the company confirmed. Along with its UK premiere, The Grand Tour will also be launching in more than 200 countries in 2016. New episodes will appear on a weekly basis. In their first series since leaving the BBC's Top Gear, Hammond, May and Clarkson travel the globe from Los Angeles to Dubai driving the fastest cars on Earth and testing out the coolest new automotive kit. Sure, they've gone global, but don't assume they've deserted their UK fans! The Grand Tour also stops in Loch Ness and even Whitby over the course of its first run. If you're still wavering on whether to make the jump to Amazon Prime for The Grand Tour, the streaming and retail giant is offering £20 off its membership in honour of Jeremy, Richard and James's arrival. A deal like that is probably enticing enough to convince even Jeremy's old nemesis Piers Morgan to fork over some cash... Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

      "text": "News, analysis, and actionable investing ideas. Search Tech Trader Daily2 November 17, 2016, 10:31 A.M. ET Apple, Amazon: Relax, Trump Win is a Buying Opportunity, Says Piper By Tiernan Ray \nWho’s afraid of F.A.N.G. ? asks Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray this morning, reiterating his Overweight rating on shares of Apple ( AAPL ), Amazon ( AMZN ), Netflix ( NFLX ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), and Facebook ( FB ), in the wake of several days of declines last week on the heels of Donald Trump ’s upset victory in the U.S. Presidential election a week ago. \nThe fall, he believes, is “a rare opportunity to buy fear in Mega-Cap Internet.” \nMunster glosses over concerns about Trump during the election, conceding tech’s “leaders are the closest to the core issues faced in tech and their view should not be ignored.” \n“Having said that, Trump’s presidency is likely to be markedly different than the positioning used during his campaign,” he argues. “The industry and financial markets have reacted by intensely analyzing a handful of Trump’s scrambled snippets used during his campaign,” however, Stepping back, it is our opinion that Trump will not roll back net neutrality, neglect to alter the status of H1-B immigration caps, and will not encourage crucial science and technology education. We believe the tech industry is in more control of its own destiny than Donald Trump and will work past these issues, partially offsetting this temporary headwind. \nMoreover, the stock’s are a great value, with or without a tax holdiay on overseas cash: Amazon,Alphabet,Facebook, and Netflix have clear, long-term tailwinds for revenue and earnings growth; in our opinion, on long-term valuation frameworks each looks attractively priced. Moreover, as investors roll their focus to 2018 estimates for their valuation frameworks these companies look remarkably attractive relative to broader tech and the market. There have been attractive opportunities to buy the tech mega-caps in the past (i.e. AMZN during its 2014 “investment” cycle, early 2016 as tech stocks reacted disproportionately to market fears) – we believe this is one of those opportunities and that long-term investors should use this pullback as an opportunity to buy long-term secular winners at discounted valuations. \nThe stocks today are mostly up, with the exception of Apple: \nApple is down 80 cents, or 0.7%, at $109.19; Amazon is up $5.32, or 0.7%, at $751.81; Alphabet is up $3.25, or 0.4%, at $783.23; Facebook is up 4 cents at $116.38; Netflix is up 21 cents, at $115.40.",

It’s an odorless substance that slowly deprives you of oxygen and can make you violently sick or even kill you. Incidents of carbon monoxide poisoning sky rocket as the temperature drops. People turn on their heaters which haven’t been used all summer, and that’s when exhaust or malfunctions occur that increase the levels of CO. The Nest Protect rarely goes on sale, just like all Nest products, so at a $6 savings, this deal is better than nothing. I wanted to list this deal because CO poisoning happens a lot more frequently than it should and a simple investment can protect you and your loved ones.

Not only do they look good, but they also feel comfortable while managing to give extreme protection. Almost all of Spigen’s cases are on sale today and are a great way to keep your devices protected from drops. The S7 and S7 edge are great phones, but being made out of mostly glass makes them prone to cracks in a fall. For those of you with the edge version, I highly recommend a case as the edges are a weak point in falls. My particular favorite Spigen case is the Rugged Armor with the carbon fiber design in the image above. \nCaseology S7 and S7 edge cases – on sale at Amazon \nCaseology is another case maker who offers great designs, protection and value. I reviewed several of its cases for the Note 7 and found them to be one of my favorite brands. Spigen Pixel and Pixel XL cases – all on sale at Amazon We love our Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones here at AndroidGuys. Most of us think, in our early impressions, that they are the best two Androids you can get. The only problem is their massive prices which start at $649. Regardless, it still is ridiculously fast, has the coolest launcher, and has one of the best cameras in a smartphone. You need to protect your investment with a case. Right now, Spigen has a sale on most of its premium cases at Amazon . Spigen has been an industry leader in cases, and its Pixel examples are top notch too. My personal favorite of the Spigen cases is the Rugged Armor Carbon Fiber series case because it offers a solid look without being flashy with ultra strong protection.

The 6ft braided cable from iOrange is one of the most durable you can get with its nylon wrapping, and I use several around my house and office. This particular is my favorite because the ends are metal and the cable is wrapped in ballistic nylon which makes it incredibly tough. All of my i-Orange cables still look brand new even though they are six months old. At $9.99 these cables are an incredible value considering they will last longer than any device you currently own.
