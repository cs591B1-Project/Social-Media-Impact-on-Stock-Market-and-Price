      "text": "\nMicrosoft today announced that they are a new version of Visual Studio for Mac. This is based on Xamarin Studio, but its UX is inspired by Visual Studio on Windows. If don’t want full IDE experience, you can always use Visual Studio Code, a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor.\nAs you expect from a Visual Studio product, its IntelliSense and refactoring use the Roslyn Compiler Platform. And it uses the same debugger engines for Xamarin and .NET Core apps, and the same designers for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android. For now, it doesn’t support all of the Visual Studio project types, but If you have team members on MacOS and Windows, or switch between the two OSes yourself, you can seamlessly share your projects across platforms. Visual Studio for Mac supports native iOS, Android and Mac development via Xamarin, and server development via .NET Core with Azure integration. It supports C# and F# languages as well.\nVisual Studio for Mac is based on the open source MonoDevelop IDE and it has a rich extensibility model. Developers can use to add their own functionality ranging from simple editor commands to entirely new languages and project types.\nYou can download the preview toay from VisualStudio.com .

      "text": "Microsoft Builds System to Project Windows 10 on a Table and Work with Gestures GO Nope, no typo there, Microsoft wants you to work on a table Nov 14, 2016 07:57 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: One of the things that Microsoft has managed to do with the Surface series is inventing new product categories, as it’s the case of the 2-in-1 that everyone seems to love these days. And after launching the Surface Studio and trying to invent a new category, Microsoft might be aiming to do the same thing in the future with what could be a device that makes it possible to work on a table. A patent that was recently spotted by MSPU envisions an affordable system that integrates a PC and a projector with all the necessary sensors to provide a working environment on a regular table. While this would be specifically aimed at the enterprise, where collaboration is essential, working on a large table with the power of Windows 10 seems to be the main purpose of this new patent intuitively called “ Interactive integrated display and processing device .” The whole thing is based on a very simple approach: what it does is to project a working space on a table and then you let interact with the projected UI using gestures. Sensors and built-in cameras This is possible with Windows 10 and built-in sensors, such as cameras and infrared sensors that recognize your gestures, which are then processed by the projector and the connected system. “An interactive service, provided using the device or a network connected host, enables users of companion processing devices to interact in the display area of the integrated processing and projection device using the companion devices, via an interface in the display provide by the projector. Users without companion devices can interact with users of companion devices using an interface provided in the display area,” the patent notes. What’s important to know is that this patent isn’t new, which could be a sign that we’re closer to this technology that we might be tempted to believe. And yet, since it’s just a patent, there’s also a good chance that it never makes it to production, although it goes without saying that such a technology would make sense given all the investments that Microsoft is making lately in innovative products. Also, the patent was developed with help from Microsoft’s Education unit, and this might be an indication that such a tech would be primarily aimed at schools.",

      "text": "Microsoft Releases Interactive Mail Notifications for All Windows 10 Users GO The Mail app now comes with better notifications Nov 14, 2016 06:25 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has silently released a new feature for Windows 10 users that makes it possible to control incoming notifications for the Mail client a little bit easier without having to open the app every time. Specifically, interactive notifications allow users to delete new emails or set flags without the need for firing up the email client and clicking on the new message, as the whole thing can be performed thanks to the options that are included in the notification message itself. This is a feature that has been around for a while in other apps and operating systems, and Microsoft recently rolled it out for fast ring insiders. It turns out that feedback was mostly positive, so this feature is now available for all Windows 10 users who stick with the default Mail app. The quick actions are displayed in the toast notifications showing up on PC and mobile, but at the same time, they’re also available in the Action Center, should you miss the notification. Fully customizable The default options that are provided right now are set flag and delete, but you can further customize them from the “Quick Actions” screen in Settings, where you can also configure Mark as read and Archive. Without a doubt, this makes the Mail app a little bit more useful, especially because Microsoft is working hard on making it a fully-featured email client that can compete with the likes of Mozilla Thunderbird, which is still dominating the desktop on the majority of PCs. Truth be told, the Mail app has evolved a lot since the first version was included in preview builds of Windows 10 and Microsoft is actively working on improving it even more for the upcoming Creators Update due in early 2017. There still are a few things here and there that need to be improved, but we’re getting there and updates like the one today contribute to a better experience with the app.",

      "text": "Kaspersky alleges Microsoft to force its own Windows Defender on users Russia's FAS has reportedly opened an investigation into Microsoft Microsoft is yet to respond to the claims made by Kaspersky \nRussia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has reportedly opened an investigation into Microsoft on receiving a complaint from Internet security company, Kaspersky Lab. Microsoft is alleged to force its own Windows Defender on Windows 10 users while disabling third-party security software. \nAccording to the security company, Microsoft is using its dominating position in the market of operating systems to give an upper hand to its own products over others. \"The company is foisting its Defender on the user, which isn't beneficial from the point of view of protection of a computer against cyber-attacks. The company is also creating obstacles for companies to access the market, and infringes upon the interests of independent developers of security products,\" wrote Eugene Kaspersky in a blog post . ZDNet points out that Microsoft is said to violating Part 1 Article 10 of the Federal Law \"On Protection of Competition\" which states , \"the actions (omission to act) of an economic unit occupying a dominant position which result or can result in barring, restricting or eliminating competition and (or) infringe upon the interests of other persons shall be prohibited.\"\nMicrosoft has been also alleged to \"automatically and without any warning deactivate\" the already installed security software on the system. \"When you upgrade to Windows 10, Microsoft automatically and without any warning deactivates all 'incompatible' security software and in its place installs... you guessed it - its own Defender antivirus,\" added Kaspersky in his post. \nFurther adding, the blog post gave several examples how Microsoft is pushing its users to use Windows Defender instead of third-party software. \nKaspersky adds that Microsoft has limited the possibility of \"independent developers\" to warn users about their licenses expiring in the first three days after expiration. \"Actually, a warning is there, but it's buried in a Windows Security Center notification, which hardly ever gets read,\" notes the blog. Unfortunately, Microsoft is yet to respond to the claims made by Kaspersky. \nIn a statement, Deputy Head of FAS Anatoly Golomolzin ( via SoftPedia) said, \"Since Microsoft itself develops antivirus software - Windows Defender that switches on automatically if third-party software fails to adapt to Windows 10 in due time, such actions lead to unreasonable advantages for Microsoft on the software market. Our task is to ensure equal conditions for all participants on this market.\"",

      "text": "Microsoft Research has found a new way to detect lung cancer earlier by simply analyzing user search queries and keeping an eye on specific keywords that could indicate signs of disease. A research paper that was published in JAMA Oncology reveals that Microsoft has found a connection between the searches that users perform online and the diagnosis that is performed way later (which in many cases, unfortunately, is too late). Specifically, Microsoft analyzed Bing searches for queries such as “I was just diagnosed with lung cancer,” and then started an analysis of searches performed by the same user in the months and years before this. Scientists looked at the search history for queries that could be related to the disease, including symptoms, but also demographics. For example, Microsoft was particularly interested in detecting searches for common lung cancer symptoms,...",

      "title": "Windows 10 Security: Russia Investigating Microsoft After Kaspersky Antitrust Complaint",
      "text": "11/14/16 AT 3:59 AM Close \nRussian antitrust authorities are investigating Microsoft for possible abuse of dominance after antivirus maker Kaspersky Labs filed a complaint with the country’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS). In its complaint, Kaspersky accused Microsoft of “using its dominating position in the market of operating systems to create competitive advantages for its own [antivirus] product.” \nIn a lengthy blog post Thursday, Kaspersky CEO Eugene Kaspersky said Microsoft gave independent antivirus developers only one week to make their software compatible with Windows 10, and even in the case of compatible antivirus being installed, the operating system kept prompting users to activate the inbuilt Windows Defender antivirus, which would automatically disable any third-party security software. \nKaspersky even quotes from George Orwell’s \"Animal Farm\" (\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”) to drive home the point that Microsoft violates its own policy on the number of antivirus applications that can simultaneously run on its OS. He also says the inbuilt security program in Windows 10, Defender, “is far from the best protection you can get.” \nThat claim is echoed by various reviews and comparisons. According to av-test.org , Windows Defender scored a 3.5 on 6 for Windows 10, while at least a dozen third-party antivirus programs, including Kaspersky, scored 5.5 or higher on the protection scale in benchmarking carried out in October. Various other compilations of the best antivirus programs available, such as by PC magazine or PC Antivirus Reviews , do not list Windows Defender in the top 10 (they all feature Kaspersky). \nPC Magazine even says: “Whichever Windows version you're using, your computer is theoretically under the protection of the built-in Microsoft Windows Defender. However, our hands-on tests and independent lab tests show that you're better off with a third-party antivirus solution.” Related Stories Kaspersky Accused Of Sabotage \nAn employee works near screens in the virus lab at the headquarters of Russian cyber security company Kaspersky Labs, Moscow, July 29, 2013. Photo: REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin \nTaking up the Kaspersky complaint, Russia’s FSA said it is investigating Microsoft. Anatoly Golomolzin, deputy head of FAS, said a statement : “Since Microsoft itself develops antivirus software — Windows Defender that switches on automatically if third-party software fails to adapt to Windows 10 in due time, such actions lead to unreasonable advantages for Microsoft on the software market. Our task is to ensure equal conditions for all participants on this market.” \nThe fact that Windows has security flaws is no news, but the point was driven home recently when Google publicly announced a vulnerability in the OS after Microsoft did not fix the issue even a week after being informed of it by Google. \nThe Redmond, Washington, company has been at odds with Moscow the last few months. Russia announced in September it would start replacing some Microsoft products with local software to reduce reliance on foreign technology. The company also blamed Russian hackers from exploiting the vulnerability exposed by Google.

      "text": "Microsoft Garage has just launched a new iPhone app that’s specifically aimed at color blind people, as it helps them distinguish colors in a photo they take with the camera by automatically adjusting certain colors. Published in the App Store and available with a free license, Color Binoculars is an app that is based on a very simple approach: color blind users only have to take a photo with the iPhone camera and then let the app automatically apply filters that make colors easier to distinguish. Color Binoculars supports all three common forms of color blindness, according to the official description published in the store, and can help distinguish even the most difficult color combinations, such as red and green. Exclusive to iOS The app is the creation of two Microsoft engineers, one of them suffering from color blindness too and needing an app lik...",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface table could use a projector, not a screen",
      "text": "Reddit \nThe word “Surface” in Microsoft has come a long way. It started out as a futuristic idea of a coffee table that also functioned as a touch screen computer. Since then it has become a brand than embraced 2-in-1 tablets, a giant whiteboard/screen computer, and, more recently, an all-in-one PC that’s a creative’s wet dream. It might, however, come full circle soon. A recent Microsoft patent filing for an “INTERACTIVE INTEGRATED DISPLAY AND PROCESSING DEVICE” shows the company toying again with the idea of a computer table, but one that uses projectors and sensors instead of more expensive touch screens. \nGiven the pervasiveness and familiarity of touch screens, you’d think it was a no-brainer to create a touch-enabled display the size of a computer table. But the costs of creating such a large screen were just far too high and the yield probably too low. This would translate to a prohibitively expensive price tag, thereby limiting such a product’s appeal, reach, and sales. Just look at the Surface Hub. \nAnd so the original “Microsoft Surface” idea was seemingly shelved, with the name reused for a different product. The Surface table was actually also renamed to PixelSense, which now refers to a different thing as well. With the launch of the gigantic Surface Studio, however, it would seem that Microsoft is a step nearer to a larger display, one that could fit on a table. Well, yes and no. \nMicrosoft’s new “Surface Table” patent isn’t exactly new. It has been used before, even in existing products. It basically involves two things. The first is a computing device that projects the screen, as well as the interface, on a usually flat surface. The second is a bunch of sensors that detect movement and gestures. Again, we’ve seen that setup before, from Microsoft’s own experiments as well a something like the Sony Xperia Projector. \nOf course, a patent is just a patent and is no assurance of a finished product, much less a successful one. That said, Microsoft basically has all the pieces it needs to build one. It just needs to weave them into a single, convincing, and hopefully better-looking package.",

      "text": "Microsoft announces Visual Studio for Mac will launch in November Posted Amazon Music Unlimited expands to the UK, Germany and Austria today \nFans of cross-platform coding will be happy to know that Visual Studio, a “a true mobile-first, cloud-first development tool for .NET and C#,” will arrive for Mac during the Connect() conference in November. The move places Microsoft’s IDE on Macs. The IDE follows Visual Studio Code , Microsoft’s code editor, to OS X. \nWhy is Microsoft seemingly abandoning the quest for Windows hegemony? The writing is one the wall: cloud computing is there future and tools like AWS and Azure are quickly replacing the local server. Microsoft is losing out to tools like Docker and Heroku on the web and it’s only a matter of time before coders are more comfortable with their MacBooks and VIM than with Windows. \n“They make their money off Azure and other services. In other words, they are making their money mainly off of developers now and its in their best interest to get on the good side of devs which is why they suddenly have a vested interest in open sourcing tools and helping Mac/Linux,” wrote Hacker News user BoysenberryPi. \nThe IDE is very similar to the one found on Windows. In fact, that is presumably the point. By making it easy for OS X users to switch back and forth between platforms Microsoft is able ensure coders can quickly become desktop agnostic or, barring that, give Windows a try again. From the release : ￼At its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio. If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home. Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor. \nYou can read more about the platform here and prepare yourself for a little C# coding with Visual Studio Code . 0",

      "text": "Microsoft Launches iPhone App for Color Blind Users GO Color Binoculars adjusts colors of camera photos Nov 14, 2016 09:16   Microsoft Garage has just launched a new iPhone app that’s specifically aimed at color blind people, as it helps them distinguish colors in a photo they take with the camera by automatically adjusting certain colors. Published in the App Store and available with a free license, Color Binoculars is an app that is based on a very simple approach: color blind users only have to take a photo with the iPhone camera and then let the app automatically apply filters that make colors easier to distinguish. Color Binoculars supports all three common forms of color blindness, according to the official description published in the store, and can help distinguish even the most difficult color combinations, such as red and green. Exclusive to iOS The app is the creation of two Microsoft engineers, one of them suffering from color blindness too and needing an app like this to better distinguish colors. “It’s an app that helps colorblind people distinguish color combinations that they would normally have trouble telling apart. For example, since I have difficulty distinguishing between red and green, our app makes reds brighter and greens darker so that the difference is more obvious. It replaces difficult color combinations, like red and green, with more easily distinguishable combinations, like pink and green,” Tom Overton, the colorblind engineer, explained. He teamed up with Tingting Zhu, another Microsoft engineer, who helped him develop an application which they claim “uses the phone’s camera as a way to translate images.” “For me at least, it’s such a personal project. I showed it off to my family. I have a cousin who is also colorblind, and he really enjoyed it. Also, when I’m cooking and I need to brown meat, I can bust it out so I can tell when it’s not pink anymore!” Overton added. For the moment, the app is exclusive to iOS, and the two developers explain that it can support any screen size on this operating system, so it can be used on iPads as well. There’s no word on an Android or Windows phone version for the time being.",

      "title": "Facebook opens analytics and FbStart to developers of Messenger’s 34,000 bots",
      "text": "Facebook opens analytics and FbStart to developers of Messenger’s 34,000 bots Posted Microsoft announces Visual Studio for Mac will launch in November \nFacebook has been putting a lot of effort into growing Messenger as a bot platform this year, and now there are 34,000 of these bots in existence, built to present you with news and entertainment, let you shop, and more — expanding Messenger’s use beyond simple chats with friends. Today, that strategy is getting a significant boost: Facebook says it will now let developers track bots on its free analytics platform, alongside ads and apps. At the same time, Facebook is also opening up its developer program, FbStart , to bot developers. \nBoth potentially give bot makers more reasons to build and monitor how their new widgets are working. \nJosh Twist, a product manager for Facebook Messenger’s bot efforts, who is an Englishman based in Seattle but is in London today to debut the tools at a developer event, tells me that Facebook expanded the analytics and FbStart tools after a lot of requests from the developers. \n“Getting bot support for messenger is the most frequently requested feature from bot developers,” he said. This shouldn’t be too much of a surprise: Facebook already provided these kinds of tools to other developers on its platform, and bots have seen a massive surge of interest since they first made their debut earlier this year. That interest has not just come from users curious about how they work; developers are also very keen to see if bots really are the next big thing. \nTwist tells me that for now, the analytics will cover bots built just for Messenger. But given how bots are making their way to other communication platforms, from competing messaging apps like Viber’s through to enterprise-focused platforms like Slack , don’t be surprised if Facebook expands its both analytics to other platforms beyond Messenger. \n“It is something we have talked about and haven’t ruled it out,” he said. “It’s possible, absolutely, since we already support analytics for other platforms for apps. But right now we’re prioritizing support for Messenger bots. ” \nAnalytics, of course, is an essential tool for a developer, both to be able to track how well something is working and other kids of feedback. Here Facebook says that features that will be included are reaches across mobile and desktop devices and measurement of customers’ journeys across apps and websites. \nDevelopers also will be able to view reports on messages sent, messages received, and people who block or unblock your app. And they will also get access to anonymized data reports on bot demographics, which include details like age, gender, education, interests, country and language to figure out who is using your bot. \nFbStart, meanwhile, currently has some 9,000 members who get feedback from Facebook on their apps, ads and bots, as well as Facebook ads credits and other free tools from partners like Amazon, Dropbox, and Stripe. If Facebook was looking at ways of swelling those ranks, tapping 34,000 developers could be one way of doing that. \nTwist points out that while there are a lot of standalone bot developers coming to Facebook for the first time, there is a lot of crossover with other Facebook services like apps and ads. Those who are leveraging these together — for example using the recent ability to channel a person from a News Feed ad through to your Messenger experience — will be able to look at the effectiveness of those efforts now, and make potentially more ad buys based on them.",

      "text": "Google Pixel, Safari, and Microsoft Edge all pwned at PwnFest 2016 Adoble Flash Player also fell. Surprised? We’re not. 0 SHARES \nSecurity researchers broke the Google Pixel, Apple's Safari browser, and the Microsoft Edge browser running on Windows 10 at PwnFest 2016. \nPwnFest is a part of Power of Community , an international security and hacking conference which takes place in Seoul, South Korea. \nTeams of white-hat hackers register to compete in PwnFest to see who can gain system-level access to a variety of technologies in the shortest amount of time. \nSounds fun! But that's not all. It also pays well to those who win... like, hundreds of thousands of dollars well. One of the competitors, Chinese security firm Qihoo 360, walked away from the competition with more than half a million dollars (US $520,000). \nHow? By being one of the best at what they do. \nOn Friday, Qihoo 360's hackers leveraged an undisclosed vulnerability to achieve remote code execution on the Google Pixel. Google will now work on a fix for the issue, a bug which by itself netted the team US $120,000. The pwned Pixel opened up a web page in Google Chrome that reads \"Pwned By 360 Alpha Team.\" \nThe successful compromise is the second time hackers have compromised the Pixel in recent weeks. \nThe first to do it was the Qihoo 360 rival Keen Team of Tencent at the Mobile Pwn2Own event in Japan. Those hackers later demonstrated at PwnFest how they were able to obtain system-level privileges on the phone, including access to the device's contacts, SMS messages, phone number, and other features. \nThat exploit is shown in the video below. Here are a few additional highlights from PwnFest 2016: In 20 seconds flat, the Pangu Team abused a root privilege escalation bug to break Apple's Safari browser and win 80,000 USD. South Korean hacker Lokihardt smashed Microsoft Edge running on Windows 10 in just 18 seconds, earning for himself 140,000 USD in the process. Qihoo 360 exploited a use-after-free zero day and a win32k kernel flaw to pop Flash. All it took was four seconds to win the 120,000 USD prize money. \nWe've all heard about bugs in Safari , Flash ( too many to count , in fact), and other software. What makes PwnFest fun is the ability for researchers to research a method of attack, demonstrate it in front of their peers, and win some moolah in the process. \nAt the same time, none of the PwnFest exploits are made public. Those who compete at and sponsor PwnFest (well...maybe except for Google ...) support the idea of responsible disclosure. That's why exploits go straight to the vendors so that they can develop appropriate fixes. \nMoney... fame... security fixes... PwnFest is a win-win for all. \nI tip my hat to Darren Pauli of The Register for his excellent coverage of this year's competition. 0",

      "title": "Microsoft is violating anti-competition legislation, says Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of Kaspersky lab",
      "text": "Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of Kaspersky Lab, a leading cyber security services vendor, has presented evidence that Microsoft is pushing out third party anti-virus software companies from its ecosystem.\nThe problem is with the latest version of Windows 10. The bundled Windows Defender app aggressively pushes itself to users over third party anti-virus software. On upgrading to the latest version of Windows 10, Microsoft disables “incompatible” security applications. Windows Defender takes over even if the software passes the initial compatibility check. If users have installed a third party security service, and are using it, Windows pushes out an alert claiming weaker security because Windows Defender is disabled.\nEnabling Defender prevents the existing anti-virus software from working, but this is not immediately apparent from the graphics used in the alert window. Additionally, Microsoft has restricted third party software vendors from pushing alerts to continue subscriptions, to within three days after expiry of the license. If a user forgets to renew a license, there is a buried notification in the Security Center, and Windows turns on Defender.\nMicrosoft has limited the operating system to support just one anti-virus software. This may seem like a bad idea because the software might be incompatible, fight over viruses and use up too many resources. However, it prevents users from running trial versions of anti-virus software while being subscribed to a service. If such a situation occurs, Windows turns off both anti-virus software and turns on Defender.\nThe rule for only one anti virus software on the operating system does not apply to Defender itself. Defender scans the system periodically, and on such scans, prompts the user to switch to Defender.\nKaspersky claims that having a single anti-virus solution for all Windows users is in itself a security threat. Malicious attackers will have to get through the defenses of just one software instead of compromising a wide range of anti-virus software. Kaspersky also alleges that Windows Defender provides security that is markedly below the industry standard, in terms of false positives and missed samples.\nChris Hallum, Senior Product Manager of Windows Client Security at Microsoft, outlined improvements to Windows Defender for the Windows 10 Anniversary Update in a video posted on YouTube. Over the course of the video (at 58:20), Hallum says “I can’t promise you we will be number one, but I can promise you that we will be within a tenth of a point, so meaning basically like we have very comparable protection. And so this is something that I think you should put on a roadmap, I want you to evaluate it, and I want you to think about kicking out third party antivirus.”\n\nThe blog post by Eugene Kaspersky calls for co-operation from the entire third party software industry, as well as anti-virus vendors, to take on Microsoft for its violation of anti-competition legislation. Kaspersky has taken up the matter with official bodies around the world, including the EU and Russia.\nResponses to the post ranged from cheering Kaspersky in taking such a measure, to users who genuinely wanted an integrated security solution from Microsoft.\nThe post Microsoft is violating anti-competition legislation, says Eugene Kaspersky, CEO of Kaspersky lab appeared first on Tech2 .",

Combined, these agreements represent 237 megawatts of wind energy, which brings Microsoft's total investment in wind energy projects in the U.S. to more than 500 megawatts.\n\"Microsoft is committed to building a responsible cloud, and these agreements represent progress toward our goal of improving the energy mix at our datacenters,\" said Brad Smith , president and chief legal officer at Microsoft. \"Our commitment extends beyond greening our own operations because these projects help create a greener, more reliable grid in the communities in which we operate.\"\nMicrosoft has contracted with Allianz Risk Transfer (ART) to fix its long-term energy costs and purchase the environmental attributes connected with the new, 178-megawatt Bloom Wind project in Kansas . The project is the first to use a novel structure developed by ART and designed to offset high upfront costs associated with the creation of large-scale wind projects. Microsoft is the first buyer to participate in this structure, which has the potential to bring clean energy projects online at a faster pace.\n\"It is important for investors in renewable energy projects to secure long-term, stable revenues, and our structure does just that,\" said Karsten Berlage, managing director of ART. \"We are thrilled to be partnering with Microsoft on this groundbreaking project.\"\nIn addition, Microsoft has contracted with Black Hills Corp. subsidiary Black Hills Energy, under a long-term agreement, to purchase 59 megawatts of renewable energy certificates from the Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind projects, which are adjacent to Microsoft's Cheyenne, Wyoming , datacenter. The combined output of the Bloom and Happy Jack/Silver Sage projects will produce enough energy on an annual basis to cover the annual energy used at the datacenter.\n\"Our longstanding partnership with Microsoft productively led to this landmark collaboration.

      "text": "November 14, 2016 6:00am Comments Share: New investments further company's progress on commitment to creating a responsible cloud, greener grid. \nREDMOND, Wash. , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- On Monday, Microsoft Corp. announced its largest purchase of wind energy to date with the signing of two agreements. Combined, these agreements represent 237 megawatts of wind energy, which brings Microsoft's total investment in wind energy projects in the U.S. to more than 500 megawatts. \n\"Microsoft is committed to building a responsible cloud, and these agreements represent progress toward our goal of improving the energy mix at our datacenters,\" said Brad Smith , president and chief legal officer at Microsoft. \"Our commitment extends beyond greening our own operations because these projects help create a greener, more reliable grid in the communities in which we operate.\" \nMicrosoft has contracted with Allianz Risk Transfer (ART) to fix its long-term energy costs and purchase the environmental attributes connected with the new, 178-megawatt Bloom Wind project in Kansas . The project is the first to use a novel structure developed by ART and designed to offset high upfront costs associated with the creation of large-scale wind projects. Microsoft is the first buyer to participate in this structure, which has the potential to bring clean energy projects online at a faster pace. \n\"It is important for investors in renewable energy projects to secure long-term, stable revenues, and our structure does just that,\" said Karsten Berlage, managing director of ART. \"We are thrilled to be partnering with Microsoft on this groundbreaking project.\" \nIn addition, Microsoft has contracted with Black Hills Corp. subsidiary Black Hills Energy, under a long-term agreement, to purchase 59 megawatts of renewable energy certificates from the Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind projects, which are adjacent to Microsoft's Cheyenne, Wyoming , datacenter. The combined output of the Bloom and Happy Jack/Silver Sage projects will produce enough energy on an annual basis to cover the annual energy used at the datacenter. \n\"Our longstanding partnership with Microsoft productively led to this landmark collaboration. This collaboration provided them the opportunity to utilize significantly more renewable energy while still ensuring the reliability they've come to expect through our energy infrastructure and generation resources,\" said David R. Emery , chairman and CEO of Black Hills Corp. \"We are proud to be a strong supporter and partner in their mission to power their datacenters with increased renewable energy resources, and look forward to our continued collaboration in the years ahead.\" \nMicrosoft and Black Hills Energy also worked together to create a new tariff, available to all eligible customers, that allows the utility to tap the local datacenter's backup generators, thereby eliminating the need for Black Hills Energy to construct a new power plant. The tariff received approval from the Wyoming Public Service Commission in July. \n\"We are constantly looking for new ways to approach energy challenges and avenues of engagement with our utility partners,\" said Christian Belady, general manager of cloud infrastructure strategy and architecture at Microsoft. \"The team worked closely with ART to come up with a completely new model to enable faster adoption of renewables. Likewise, the tight engagement with Black Hills created the opportunity for Microsoft's datacenter to become an asset for the local grid, maintaining reliability and reducing costs for ratepayers. This kind of deep collaboration with utilities has great potential to accelerate the pace of clean energy, benefitting all customers — not just Microsoft.\" \nThese are Microsoft's third and fourth wind energy agreements, joining the 175-megawatt Pilot Hill wind project in Illinois and 110-megawatt Keechi wind project in Texas . In March, Microsoft also signed an agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia and Dominion Energy Inc. to bring 20 megawatts of solar energy onto the grid in Virginia . These projects are in addition to the renewable and carbon-free energy Microsoft purchases from the grid mix in the markets in which it operates. \nMore information about this announcement is in the Microsoft on the Issues blog post by Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith . \nAbout Allianz Risk Transfer \nAllianz Risk Transfer (ART) is the center of competence for alternative risk transfer business within the Allianz Group offering tailor-made insurance, reinsurance and other non-traditional risk management solutions to industrial and financial clients worldwide.

Read more Russia's Kaspersky Lab, Intel & Europol take on ransomware \n“Microsoft has created obstacles to third-party products and is acting against the interests of the antivirus developers,” company CEO Eugene Kaspersky wrote in a blog post entitled Enough is enough . \nMicrosoft has reportedly reduced the period for independent developers to adapt their antivirus software to the Windows 10 operating system to just six days, compared with two months for earlier versions. \nRussia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) opened an investigation into Microsoft after Kaspersky filed a complaint. \n“As Microsoft is the firm developing Windows Defender antivirus software, which plugs in automatically, if third-party software fails to adapt to Windows 10 in due time, these actions are leading to unreasonable advantages for the company in the software market,” said Deputy Head of FAS Anatoly Golomolzin. \nKaspersky Lab is also planning to file complaints against Microsoft in the EU for being anti-competitive, according to company representative Julia Ilyina. \nKaspersky claims to have spent “months of fruitless discussions and multiple exhausting attempts to resolve the issue directly with Microsoft.” \n“The trend is clear: Microsoft is gradually squeezing independent developers out of the Windows ecosystem if it has its own application for this or that purpose,” Kaspersky wrote.",

      "text": "Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac GO The debut will take place at Connect() in November Nov 14, 2016 10:56 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has just announced that Visual Studio for Mac would be introduced at the Connect() conference kicking off on November 16, as it’s aiming to empower Apple customers with the same coding tools as their Windows colleagues. Specifically, Visual Studio for Mac is designed to run on macOS but is essentially the same as the Windows version of Visual Studio, so customers who already tried it on Microsoft’s own operating system should feel no difference. Redmond explains that the UX is inspired by Visual Studio, but the looks have been adapted to look and feel like a native macOS solution. Just like on Windows, Visual Studio for Mac comes together with Visual Studio Code. “Compatibility is a key focus of Visual Studio for Mac. Although it’s a new product and doesn’t support all of the Visual Studio project types, for those it does have in common it uses the same MSBuild solution and project format. If you have team members on macOS and Windows, or switch between the two OSes yourself, you can seamlessly share your projects across platforms. There’s no need for any conversion or migration,” Microsoft explains. Support for iOS and Android Visual Studio for Mac was designed from the very beginning with a mobile first, cloud first approach in mind, which is CEO Satya Nadella’s strategy at Microsoft since he replaced Steve Ballmer at the helm of the company. This means that Visual Studio for Mac can also come in handy for projects aimed at iOS, Android, and Mac with Xamarin, and server deployment with .NET Core with Azure integration. “Because it’s based on Xamarin Studio, Visual Studio for Mac has mature support for C#-based iOS, Android and Mac development with the Xamarin Platform. You can take advantage of your existing C# experience and libraries, and share common code across platforms, with full access to the native APIs so you can build a fast, polished native app experience,” Microsoft notes. Visual Studio for Mac comes with the same feature package as on Windows, but a full introduction of the new solution will be given at Connect() this week. A lengthy description of the way the app works is available on MSDN here, but everything else should be discussed as the event in a couple of days.",

      "title": "Microsoft announces largest wind energy purchase to date",
      "text": " 00 AM EST Microsoft announces largest wind energy purchase to date \nREDMOND, Wash. , Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- On Monday, Microsoft Corp. announced its largest purchase of wind energy to date with the signing of two agreements. Combined, these agreements represent 237 megawatts of wind energy, which brings Microsoft's total investment in wind energy projects in the U.S. to more than 500 megawatts. \n\"Microsoft is committed to building a responsible cloud, and these agreements represent progress toward our goal of improving the energy mix at our datacenters,\" said Brad Smith , president and chief legal officer at Microsoft. \"Our commitment extends beyond greening our own operations because these projects help create a greener, more reliable grid in the communities in which we operate.\" \nMicrosoft has contracted with Allianz Risk Transfer (ART) to fix its long-term energy costs and purchase the environmental attributes connected with the new, 178-megawatt Bloom Wind project in Kansas . The project is the first to use a novel structure developed by ART and designed to offset high upfront costs associated with the creation of large-scale wind projects. Microsoft is the first buyer to participate in this structure, which has the potential to bring clean energy projects online at a faster pace. \n\"It is important for investors in renewable energy projects to secure long-term, stable revenues, and our structure does just that,\" said Karsten Berlage, managing director of ART. \"We are thrilled to be partnering with Microsoft on this groundbreaking project.\" \nIn addition, Microsoft has contracted with Black Hills Corp. subsidiary Black Hills Energy, under a long-term agreement, to purchase 59 megawatts of renewable energy certificates from the Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind projects, which are adjacent to Microsoft's Cheyenne, Wyoming , datacenter. The combined output of the Bloom and Happy Jack/Silver Sage projects will produce enough energy on an annual basis to cover the annual energy used at the datacenter. \n\"Our longstanding partnership with Microsoft productively led to this landmark collaboration. This collaboration provided them the opportunity to utilize significantly more renewable energy while still ensuring the reliability they've come to expect through our energy infrastructure and generation resources,\" said David R. Emery , chairman and CEO of Black Hills Corp. \"We are proud to be a strong supporter and partner in their mission to power their datacenters with increased renewable energy resources, and look forward to our continued collaboration in the years ahead.\" \nMicrosoft and Black Hills Energy also worked together to create a new tariff, available to all eligible customers, that allows the utility to tap the local datacenter's backup generators, thereby eliminating the need for Black Hills Energy to construct a new power plant. The tariff received approval from the Wyoming Public Service Commission in July. \n\"We are constantly looking for new ways to approach energy challenges and avenues of engagement with our utility partners,\" said Christian Belady, general manager of cloud infrastructure strategy and architecture at Microsoft. \"The team worked closely with ART to come up with a completely new model to enable faster adoption of renewables. Likewise, the tight engagement with Black Hills created the opportunity for Microsoft's datacenter to become an asset for the local grid, maintaining reliability and reducing costs for ratepayers. This kind of deep collaboration with utilities has great potential to accelerate the pace of clean energy, benefitting all customers — not just Microsoft.\" \nThese are Microsoft's third and fourth wind energy agreements, joining the 175-megawatt Pilot Hill wind project in Illinois and 110-megawatt Keechi wind project in Texas . In March, Microsoft also signed an agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia and Dominion Energy Inc. to bring 20 megawatts of solar energy onto the grid in Virginia . These projects are in addition to the renewable and carbon-free energy Microsoft purchases from the grid mix in the markets in which it operates. \nMore information about this announcement is in the Microsoft on the Issues blog post by Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith . \nAbout Allianz Risk Transfer \nAllianz Risk Transfer (ART) is the center of competence for alternative risk transfer business within the Allianz Group offering tailor-made insurance, reinsurance and other non-traditional risk management solutions to industrial and financial clients worldwide.

      "text": "The x86 seems to be the only way to extend the Windows Phones validity and Microsoft itself is believed to be following the same path with its Surface Phone. There were reports that Dell is working on the x86 Windows Mobile 10 Phone to tackle several markets simultaneously. The device is supposed to serve as a phone, tablet and a desktop. Dubbed as Dell Stack, the device was designed in 2014 and was slated to hit the shelves in 2017.\nIt was believed that both Microsoft and Dell gave up on the project focusing on other devices. But thanks to known tipster Evan Blass, we now have an idea of how the Dell Stack will look. The image reveals the device along with its dock and will also support Continuum and offer charging at the same time. Both companies are yet to announce the release of the phone.\nimage: Twitter\nIf the leaks are to be believed, the Dell Stack will sport a 6.4-inch display and will ship in different hardware configurations and will be paired with 4GB or 8GB of RAM. There is a possibility that users can get up to 256GB of internal storage and support for MicroSD card is also possible. As for the processor, Dell wanted the Slack to come with a choice of three different Intel Kaby Lake Y x86 processors, including m3, m5 vPro, and m7 vPro.\nSince Dell planned to launch the device in 2017, so there is still chance that we may get high-end device by next year. The x86 seems to be the only way to extend the Windows Phones validity and Microsoft itself is believed to be following the same path with its Surface Phone.",

      "text": "Microsoft Fixed Surface Pro 3 Battery Issue With New Firmware Update; Error Caused The Charge Problem? By Richard Ricks , Parent Herald November 14, 06:30 am Microsoft finally solved the Surface Pro 3 battery issue with a new firmware update. (Photo : Techiebond/ YouTube) \nMicrosoft finally solved the Surface Pro 3 battery issue with a new firmware update. In order for the battery capacity to accurately report, the tech giant's solution acts as a fuel gauge of the tablet. But how massive the battery issue was, Microsoft did not disclose. But what was the underlying cause? Advertisement \nWhat was the cause and extent of the battery issue? \nThe error was causing the battery charge to fail to be reported to the device firmware and OS. The new firmware update was immediately released following reports filed by Microsoft Surface Pro 3 users. \nAccording to a report , Microsoft did not reveal how widespread the problem was, but only a \"limited number.\" This battery issue could have caused a major setback for the company as they recently unveiled the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. However, there were more users facing the same Surface Pro 3 battery issue. \nOne of the tablet's users complained that the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 seemed fine when it was plugged in, but the battery would run out quickly once it was not being charged. So, the tech giant and their team took to great heights to solve the battery issue. \nHow did Microsoft respond to the Surface Pro 3 battery issue? \nMicrosoft released a statement to the media acknowledging the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 battery issue. \"We are aware of a battery issue that is affecting a limited number of Surface Pro 3 users. We can confirm that the issue affecting these customers was not caused by the software updates issued on August 29th. Our team is actively looking into the issue to determine the cause and identify a fix. We will post an update as soon as we have more information to share.\" \nIs the new firmware update effective in solving the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 battery issue? \nMicrosoft released the System Firmware Update last Nov. 7, 2016, after the new firmware update passed testing and QA process. Yet, according to a Windows Report , the update v38.11.50.0 somehow corrects the battery issue that occurs on a limited number of Surface Pro 3 devices. https://t.co/IToE5ZjQnr : #SurfacePro3 #Windows10 - Surface Pro 3 Battery Issue Will No Longer Be A Problem Thanks To a Firmware Update pic.twitter.com/cn389VCkh5 \n— SndyAaron (@SndyAaron) November 14, 2016 \nMicrosoft advises users to make sure that before updating, plug the Surface Pro 3 first and disconnect any USB device or external monitors, if connected. Update once the Surface Pro 3 has reached at least 40%. \nFor the time being, Microsoft Surface Pro 3 battery issues are still around. The good news is users could go to Microsoft's support agents and accept the $450 out of warranty exchange. The bad news is that there's no guarantee users will receive a device that won't develop issues after the short warranty on it expires. \n© 2016 ParentHerald.com All rights reserved.

      "text": "SHOW LESS This program is a Microsoft Access program that performed statistical analysis of the colony counts from assays performed on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) spacecraft to determine the bioburden density, 3-sigma biodensity, and the total bioburdens required for the MSL prelaunch reports. It also contains numerous tools that report the data in various ways to simplify the reports required. The program performs all the calculations directly in the MS Access program. Prior to this development, the data was exported to large Excel files that had to be cut and pasted to provide the desired results. The program contains a main menu and a number of submenus. Analyses can be performed by using either all the assays, or only the accountable assays that will be used in the final analysis. There are three options on the first menu: either calculate using (1) the old MER (Mars Exploration Rover) statistics, (2) the MSL statistics for all the assays, or This software implements penetration limit equations for common micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) shield configurations, windows, and thermal protection systems. Allowable MMOD risk is formulated in terms of the probability of penetration (PNP) of the spacecraft pressure hull. For calculating the risk, spacecraft geometry models, mission profiles, debris environment models, and penetration limit equations for installed shielding configurations are required. Risk assessment software such as NASA's BUMPERII is used to calculate mission PNP; however, they are unsuitable for use in shield design and preliminary analysis studies. The software defines a single equation for the design and performance evaluation of common MMOD shielding configurations, windows, and thermal protection systems, along with a description of their validity range and guidelines for their application. Recommendations are based on preliminary reviews of fundamental assumptions, and accuracy in predicting experimental impact test results. The software is programmed in Visual Basic for Applications for installation as a simple add-in for Microsoft Excel. The user is directed to a graphical user interface (GUI) that requires user inputs and provides solutions directly in Microsoft Excel workbooks. This work was done by Shannon Ryan of the USRA Lunar and Planetary Institute for Johnson Space Center. Further information is contained in a TSP (see page 1). MSC- 24582-1 Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD) Shield Ballistic Limit Analysis Program Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas Commercially, because it is so generic, Enigma can be used for almost any project that requires engineering visualization, model building, or animation. Models in Enigma can be exported to many other formats for use in other applications as well. Educationally, Enigma is being used to allow university students to visualize robotic algorithms in a simulation mode before using them with actual hardware. This work was done by David Shores and Sharon P. Goza of Johnson Space Center; Cheyenne McKeegan, Rick Easley, Janet Way, and Shonn Everett of MEI Technologies; Mark Manning of PTI; and Mark Guerra, Ray Kraesig, and William Leu of Tietronix Software, Inc.

MSC-24211-1 Spitzer Telemetry Processing System NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California The Spitzer Telemetry Processing System (SirtfTlmProc) was designed to address objectives of JPL's Multi-mission Image Processing Lab (MIPL) in processing spacecraft telemetry and distributing the resulting data to the science community. To minimize costs and maximize operability, the software design focused on automated error recovery, performance, and information management. The system processes telemetry from the Spitzer spacecraft and delivers Level 0 products to the Spitzer Science Center. SirtfTlmProc is a unique system with automated error notification and recovery, with a real-time continuous service that can go quiescent after periods of inactivity. The software can process 2 GB of telemetry and deliver Level 0 science products to the end user in four hours. It provides analysis tools so the operator can manage the system and troubleshoot problems. It automates telemetry processing in order to reduce staffing costs. This work was done by Alice Stanboli, Elmain M. Martinez, and James M. McAuley of Caltech for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. For more information, contact iaoffice @jpl.nasa.gov.

NASA Tech Briefs, September 2013 29 This rapid response computer program predicts Orbiter Wing Leading Edge (WLE) damage caused by ice or foam impact during a Space Shuttle launch (Program \"IMPACT2\"). The program was developed after the Columbia accident in order to assess quickly WLE damage due to ice, foam, or metal impact (if any) during a Shuttle launch. IMPACT2 simulates an impact event in a few minutes for foam impactors, and in seconds for ice and metal impactors. The damage criterion is derived from results obtained from one sophisticated commercial program, which requires hours to carry out simulations of the same impact events. The program was designed to run much faster than the commercial program with prediction of projectile threshold velocities within 10 to 15% of commercial-program values. The mathematical model involves coupling of Orbiter wing normal modes of vibration to nonlinear or linear springmass models. IMPACT2 solves nonlinear or linear impact problems using classical normal modes of vibration of a target, and nonlinear/ linear time-domain equations for the projectile. Impact loads and stresses developed in the target are computed as functions of time. This model is novel because of its speed of execution. A typical model of foam, or other projectile characterized by material nonlinearities, impacting an RCC panel is executed in minutes instead of hours needed by the commercial programs. Target damage due to impact can be assessed quickly, provided that target vibration modes and allowable stress are known. This work was done by Robert Clark, Jr., Paul Cotter, and Constantine Michalopoulos of The Boeing Company for Johnson Space Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas (3) the MSL statistics for only the accountable assays. Other options on the main menu include a data editing form and utility programs that produce various reports requested by the microbiologists and the project, and tools to generate the groupings for the final analyses. The analyses can be carried out in three ways: Each assay can be treated separately, the assays can be collectively treated for the whole zone as a group, or the assays can be collected in groups designated by the JPL Planetary Protection Manager. The latter approach was used to generate the final report because assays on the same equipment or similar equipment can be assumed to have been exposed to the same environment and cleaning. Thus, the statistics are improved by having a larger population, thereby reducing the standard deviation by the square root of N. For each method mentioned above, three reports are available. The first is a detailed report including all the data. This version was very useful in verifying the calculations. The second is a brief report that is similar to the full detailed report, but does not print out the data. The third is a grand total and summary report in which each assay requires only one line. For the first and second reports, most of the calculations are performed in the report section itself. For the third, all the calculations are performed directly in the query bound to the report. All the numeric al results were verified by comparing them with Excel templates, then exporting the data from the Planetary Protection Analysis program to Excel.",

      "title": "Microsoft is bringing Visual Studio to the Mac - The Verge",
      "text": "share Image composite by The Verge Microsoft has announced it’s launching its primary coding interface, Visual Studio, on Mac computers. The news may sound uninteresting, but it’s been a long time coming, and is a big shakeup for the company, which has previously preferred to lock developers into its platform by keeping coding tools Windows-only. The change comes as Microsoft shifts its focus to its money-making cloud operation. While programming tasks in the past might have been carried out on local servers, they’re now increasingly using platform-agnostic cloud services like Azure (from Microsoft) and AWS (from Amazon). By making Visual Studio cross-platform, Microsoft will be hoping to retain professional users that want to work on their projects from any operating system they like. The software is based on app development platform Xamarin Studio, and the change could encourage Mac and iOS developers to make more apps for Windows, as these users will no longer have to buy a Windows computer or set up a virtual machine to access Visual Studio. \nThe news follows a similar announcement from earlier this year, when the company announced it would be adding native support for Linux command line Bash to Windows for the first time ever. As Microsoft's Scott Hanselman said at the time , adding Bash support was \"brilliant for developers that use a diverse set of tools\" — launching Visual Studio for Mac is a similar move. \nA preview of the software will be unveiled at Microsoft’s Connect(); conference later this week. For more information including technical details, head over to Microsoft’s blog post announcing the news. How Visual Studio looks on a Mac. (Image credit: Microsoft) More From The Verge",

      "title": "Microsoft announces largest wind energy purchase to date",
      "text": "\nOn Monday, Microsoft Corp. announced its largest purchase of wind energy to date with the signing of two agreements. Combined, these agreements represent 237 megawatts of wind energy, which brings Microsoft’s total investment in wind energy projects in the U.S. to more than 500 megawatts.\n“Microsoft is committed to building a responsible cloud, and these agreements represent progress toward our goal of improving the energy mix at our datacenters,” said Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer at Microsoft. “Our commitment extends beyond greening our own operations because these projects help create a greener, more reliable grid in the communities in which we operate.”\nMicrosoft has contracted with Allianz Risk Transfer (ART) to fix its long-term energy costs and purchase the environmental attributes connected with the new, 178-megawatt Bloom Wind project in Kansas. The project is the first to use a novel structure developed by ART and designed to offset high upfront costs associated with the creation of large-scale wind projects. Microsoft is the first buyer to participate in this structure, which has the potential to bring clean energy projects online at a faster pace.\n“It is important for investors in renewable energy projects to secure long-term, stable revenues, and our structure does just that,” said Karsten Berlage, managing director of ART. “We are thrilled to be partnering with Microsoft on this groundbreaking project.”\nIn addition, Microsoft has contracted with Black Hills Corp. subsidiary Black Hills Energy, under a long-term agreement, to purchase 59 megawatts of renewable energy certificates from the Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind projects, which are adjacent to Microsoft’s Cheyenne, Wyoming, datacenter. The combined output of the Bloom and Happy Jack/Silver Sage projects will produce enough energy on an annual basis to cover the annual energy used at the datacenter.\n“Our longstanding partnership with Microsoft productively led to this landmark collaboration. This collaboration provided them the opportunity to utilize significantly more renewable energy while still ensuring the reliability they’ve come to expect through our energy infrastructure and generation resources,” said David R. Emery, chairman and CEO of Black Hills Corp. “We are proud to be a strong supporter and partner in their mission to power their datacenters with increased renewable energy resources, and look forward to our continued collaboration in the years ahead.”\nMicrosoft and Black Hills Energy also worked together to create a new tariff, available to all eligible customers, that allows the utility to tap the local datacenter’s backup generators, thereby eliminating the need for Black Hills Energy to construct a new power plant. The tariff received approval from the Wyoming Public Service Commission in July.\n“We are constantly looking for new ways to approach energy challenges and avenues of engagement with our utility partners,” said Christian Belady, general manager of cloud infrastructure strategy and architecture at Microsoft. “The team worked closely with ART to come up with a completely new model to enable faster adoption of renewables. Likewise, the tight engagement with Black Hills created the opportunity for Microsoft’s datacenter to become an asset for the local grid, maintaining reliability and reducing costs for ratepayers. This kind of deep collaboration with utilities has great potential to accelerate the pace of clean energy, benefitting all customers — not just Microsoft.”\nThese are Microsoft’s third and fourth wind energy agreements, joining the 175-megawatt Pilot Hill wind project in Illinois and 110-megawatt Keechi wind project in Texas. In March, Microsoft also signed an agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia and Dominion Energy Inc. to bring 20 megawatts of solar energy onto the grid in Virginia. These projects are in addition to the renewable and carbon-free energy Microsoft purchases from the grid mix in the markets in which it operates.\nMore information about this announcement is in the Microsoft on the Issues blog post by Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith.\n",

      "text": "0 0 \nIf you don’t use locally installed Office 2016 apps and you are being harassed by Microsoft’s upgrade notifications, we might be able to provide some assistance in the matter. \nUsers who are currently Office 365 subscribers using Office 2013 have definitely noticed the pop up add that appears from time to time, on their notification tray in the taskbar, inviting them to upgrade to Office 2016 . The three options it offers are “ Upgrade ,” “ Later ,” and “See what’s new ”. \nSelecting “Later” (if you don’t want the update), would not dismiss the notification permanently and the ‘”Upgrade” option takes you to the installer for upgrading to Office 2016, which may or may not be free – based on your actual Office 365 subscription plan. Whereas, the “Learn more” option will redirect you to a website which elaborates the new aspects of Office 2016. \nThe ad can be bothersome for a few reasons, one being – it is nagware and the other that it is clingy and won’t go away easily. Moreover, it is illusive and in some cases, even after subscribing to the Office 365 Business Essentials plan , it still does not authorize users to the locally installable Office 2016 apps, instead provides them with Exchange access. \nComing towards the solution of the vexatious pop-up ad dilemma, what you need is an easy fix file , run it, then follow the steps described by the wizard. \nWhen Microsoft was asked to provide insight on the problem they responded: \nThe notification is meant to provide existing Office 365 subscribers who are using an older version of Office an easy way to upgrade to Office 2016. The team is actively working to identify the right frequency and are also evaluating ways to make adjusting the notification simple based on customer feedback. In the meantime, customers can turn off the notification by first clicking here. Then, in the File Download dialog box, click Run or Open, and follow the steps in the fix wizard. \nBut don’t worry, as the fix will not affect your subscription, and users who are on the older, locally installed versions of Microsoft’s office apps, can continue to use it and still get security fixes from Microsoft for free. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft Authenticator was inaugurated earlier this year, initially with versions compatible with iOS and Android platforms only, which raised quite a lot of grumbles from Windows users. It is now that they are finally getting the client app for themselves , as the beta version for Windows 10 Mobile was under development for over five months. \nThe new Microsoft Authenticator app for Windows 10 Mobile, holds the same features as it does on other platforms. Apart from giving an extra layer of protection to users on sign in , that is often referred to as two-step verification or multi-factor authentication, it also sports the following aspects: Provides enterprise users the facility to log in via certificates instead of passwords . The user experience refresh makes the app extremely simple and secure at the same time. One-click push notifications feature delivers the best in breed MFA experience – spares users the need of going through the entire login system and just requires them to press “approve” to get on with the login process. Sports a new user interface . Provides support for wearables so users can use their Apple Watch or Samsung Gear device to approve MFA challenges. For any other user account, or if any of them is offline – the built-in code generator does the trick with no hassle. \nAnother gripping fact about the Microsoft Authenticator is that it is an update for the old Azure Authenticator app. Though not just for Windows, the update is a part of Android and iOS versions of the app as well. What users say \nThere are some pleased consumers who are satisfied with the update, suggesting that the latest update has “made the app better than it was before”. As good as it might sound, there has also been a wave of complaints reported, from long term users of the app. \nThe most frequent ones recorded are related to ‘push notifications’ that reportedly do not work and fail to generate any response. The bug is triggered by several events, even the upgrade from Azure Authenticator seems to be causing trouble, but in some cases – it just does not work at all . \nMicrosoft has also been receiving a lot of bashing from users, for focusing more towards non-Windows platforms, given the late release of Windows 10 version for instance. The iOS and Android versions of the app seem to be receiving updates more often than the Windows one. \nThe constant crashes and freezes, incompatibility of several features on Windows 10 , trouble with adding accounts, glitches with Touch ID and the persistent issues even when installing the app, have left users infuriated. Let’s hope Microsoft is going to address these widely reported issues and roll out an update with fixes soon. \nIn the mean time, check out the app and tell us if you face any trouble while using the app that we have not mentioned. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "\nThis week, Microsoft will be hosting its Connect(); conference in New York but the announcements at the event are coming out a bit early. The company has announced today that they will be bringing Visual Studio, to the Mac.\nThe Mac version of Visual Studio looks similar to that of the Windows version and is complemented by Visual Studio code. But, the similarities are far deeper than the UX, Visual Studio for Mac uses IntelliSense and for refactoring, Roslyn Compiler Platform gets the call.\nCompatibility was a key initiative for the first release of this platform and while Visual Studio for the Mac doesn’t support every project type, for those that are common across the two operating systems, it uses the same MSBuild solution and project format. Meaning, you can easily share compatible projects from Mac to Windows without any issues.\nVisual Studio for the mac is based on Xamarian Studio which means the application already has mature support for C#-based iOS, Android, and Mac development. This shouldn’t come as a major surprise as Microsoft has been making the most of its Xamarian acquisition and this is the latest step of integrating that technology into its development stack.\nThe fact that Microsoft is bringing Visual Studio to the Mac shouldn’t come as a major surprise, considering how the company has been open-sourcing many of its technologies and also building applications for Linux like SQL Server , this is simply another step in the journey to being a more open software vendor. With Visual Studio coming to the Mac, Microsoft is trying to assert that it has the best development tools on any platform and because the Visual Studio name is well known to developers, this will give them a leg-up when trying to court developers who bounce between PCs and Macs.\nThe post Microsoft Is Bringing Visual Studio To The Mac appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "text": "Microsoft has announced it’s launching its primary coding interface, Visual Studio, on Mac computers. The news may sound uninteresting, but it’s been a long time coming, and is a big shakeup for the company, which has previously preferred to lock developers into its platform by keeping coding tools Windows-only.\n\nThe change comes as Microsoft shifts its focus to its money-making cloud operation. While programming tasks in the past might have been carried out on local servers, they’re now increasingly using platform-agnostic cloud services like Azure (from Microsoft) and AWS (from Amazon). By making Visual Studio cross-platform, Microsoft will be hoping to retain professional users that want to work on their projects from any operating...",

      "text": "on Monday November 14, 2016 @07:30AM from the setting-the-bar-low dept. A new white paper from Microsoft claims that \"devices running Windows 10 are 58% less likely to encounter ransomware than when running Windows 7\". But an anonymous reader brings more news from Windows-watcher Paul Thurrott: in a separate blog post, it also makes its case for why Windows 10 version 1607 -- that is, Windows 10 with the Anniversary Update installed -- is the most secure Windows version yet . Improvements in this release include: Microsoft Edge runs Adobe Flash Player in an isolated container, and Edge exploits cannot execute other applications... [And] the Windows Defender signature delivery channel works faster than before so that the in-box anti-virus and anti-malware solution can help block ransomware, both in the cloud and on the client. Additionally, Windows Defender responds to new threats faster using improved cloud protection and automatic sample submission features, plus improved behavioral heuristics aimed at detecting ransomware-related activities. Interestingly, the paper also touts Microsoft's \"Advancing machine-learning systems in our email services to help stop the spread of ransomware via email delivery.\"",

      "text": "Reddit \nMicrosoft is hoping to persuade more developers to create Windows apps by bringing its main coding environment – Visual Studio – to the Mac for the first time. Previously, developers had to use a Windows machine or run a virtual machine on a Mac to write Windows software. \nThe company seemingly intended to make the announcement at its Connect() developer conference on Wednesday, but The Verge spotted that Microsoft accidentally released the information early in a now-deleted blog post. \nMicrosoft said that Visual Studio for Mac was designed to be a direct counterpart to the Windows version, though it would not fully achieve this aim from the outset … \nIf you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home. Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor. \nCompatibility is a key focus of Visual Studio for Mac. Although it’s a new product and doesn’t support all of the Visual Studio project types, for those it does have in common it uses the same MSBuild solution and project format. If you have team members on macOS and Windows, or switch between the two OSes yourself, you can seamlessly share your projects across platforms. There’s no need for any conversion or migration. \nThe company said that the Mac version uses the same under-the-hood tools of the Roslyn Compiler Platform and MSBuild, and it seemingly leans heavily on app development platform Xamarin Studio. It supports both C# and F# languages. Guides",

      "text": "Microsoft on Monday said it has inked its biggest deals yet to acquire renewable wind energy to power two of its massive U.S. data centers. Its two new contracts represent 237 megawatts of generating capacity, bringing Microsoft’s wind power total in the United States to more than 500 megawatts, the company said.\nMicrosoft msft signed with Allianz Risk Transfer to acquire energy from a new 178-megawatt Bloom Wind project in Kansas. Second, it inked a long-term deal with Black Hills Energy to buy 59 megawatts of energy “certificates” from two wind projects near Microsoft’s Cheyenne, Wyoming, data center site. The combined output of those two sites should produce enough energy per year to supply its Cheyenne facility with all the energy it needs, Microsoft said.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune 's technology newsletter. \nCloud computing, despite its ethereal name, depends on lots of power-slurping data centers. Which is why companies like Facebook fb , Amazon amzn , Google goog , Salesforce.com crm , and Microsoft like to find--and publicize--green or renewable energy sources. A few weeks ago, Amazon Web Services announced plans for a 189-megawatt wind power farm in Ohio slated to come online in December 2017.\nMicrosoft and Black Hills Energy have worked out a new tariff that will enable the energy company to, as needs dictate, use the local data center's backup generators, thereby eliminating the need for Black Hills Energy to construct a new power plant.\n“These agreements represent progress toward our goal of improving the energy mix at our data centers,\" Microsoft president Brad Smith said in the company statement announcing the latest deals.\nAmazon to buy wind power from North Carolina facility \nMicrosoft said it has already contracted with the 175-megawatt Pilot Hill wind project in Illinois and 110-megawatt Keechi wind project in Texas and signed a pact with the Commonwealth of Virginia and Dominion Energy to bring 20 megawatts of solar energy onto the grid in Virginia.\nFor more on renewable energy, watch \nIt was unclear from the Microsoft statement regarding the two latest deals when that power will actually be available to power its data centers.",

      "text": "Microsoft has announced Visual Studio for Mac at the Connect(); conference this month.\nFor the first time in its history, Microsoft is bringing its Visual Studio development tool to the Mac. As Microsoft explains in its blog, “At its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio.” The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is designed to feel familiar to a macOS user, while still offering the cross-platform and cloud-based development capabilities of its Windows counterpart.\nThis IDE will reside alongside Visual Studio Code for macOS, which is a stand-alone, cross-platform text editor for developers.\nMicrosoft’s sudden interest in cross-platform development seems to stem from a deeper desire to connect with developers, regardless of their OS of choice, and offer them a common, connected platform to work on.\nMicrosoft has shown tremendous interest in cross-platform development this year, notably with their acquisition of Xamarin. Xamarin started out as a cross-platform development tool for developing iOS, Android, Windows and Mac apps. With its acquisition, Microsoft integrated its workflows into Visual Studio itself.\nAs TechCrunch suggests , Microsoft has realised that the future depends on cloud-based tools and services like Azure and that’s also where the company is making its money. If more developers start using Visual Studio, more developers will inevitably start using Microsoft’s Azure cloud services.\nFor developers, this is a win-win anyway.\nThe post Microsoft has announced that it will be bringing the entire Visual Studio IDE to macOS this month appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "The latest Ecosystem Report Enterprise Ready Startups 2016 report released by Microsoft Accelerator reveals a push towards digital transformation amongst enterprises due to increasing adoption of startup technologies. Ravi Narayan (Global Director, Microsoft Accelerator ), unveiled the report along with Jayanta Dey (Vice President & CTO Manufacturing and Technology SBU at Wipro), Peter Gartenberg, (General Manager, Enterprise and Partner Group, Microsoft Corporation India), Ben Mathias (Managing Director & India Head at Vertex Ventures) and Vinod Muthukrishnan (CEO, CloudCherry), at Microsoft Accelerator in Bangalore.\n\nBanking, retail, and healthcare are said to be among the top adopters based on growth potential and willingness to adopt startup solutions. Alongside the report, a periodic table has been released showcasing the top 151 enterprise-ready startups in India and the sectors that have shown tremendous growth.\nSome of the key highlights include that 50 percent enterprise-ready startups are in healthcare, retail and banking sectors. Data sciences and security startups find it easiest to find customers. Disruption of technology has helped these businesses to build deep expertise and position them uniquely compared to other companies in multiple sectors and domains.\nEdTech is another sector that is booming, owing to lack of consistent education standards across all levels of education. There is a lot of action happening in the healthcare space, but it is limited to preventive healthcare, fitness bands and patient awareness, driven by the rise of digitization in healthcare and patient records, and the proliferation of discovery platforms for doctors and healthcare practitioners, the report adds.\nThe report also points out that startups catering to Banking sector find it easiest to raise funds. The study was conduced on a pool of over 500 enterprise focused startups that were founded post 2000 and are headquartered in India. Microsoft works with partner accelerators, VCs and ecosystem enablers to support technological innovation, specialist verticals and a mentoring network.

Combined, Microsoft said it was tapping into about 237 megawatts of wind power, which brings its total investments in U.S. wind to more than 500 MW.\n\"We are constantly looking for new ways to approach energy challenges and avenues of engagement with our utility partners,\" Christian Belady, a general manager of cloud infrastructure strategy and architecture at Microsoft, said in a statement .\nMonday's announcement marks Microsoft's third and fourth wind energy agreements, the largest of which is associated with a 175 MW facility in Illinois.\nMicrosoft joins a growing list of U.S. companies tapping into a growing renewable energy market. Michigan automaker General Motors in September set a goal of getting all of its power across its entire global sector of operations from renewable energy by 2050.\nThe Detroit company said it expects to have around 3.5 percent of its electricity use come from renewable energy resources this year and is on pace to meet some of its 2020 objectives with the addition of wind-power projects deployed at four manufacturing operations.\nAmazon Web Services, the technology infrastructure division of retailer Amazon, contracted Iberdrola Renewables to help build and operate a 208 megawatt wind farm in North Carolina last year and committed itself to getting 100 percent of its electricity needs from renewable resources, with the aim of meeting 40 percent of that goal by the end of this year.\nApple Inc. advanced its renewable energy footprint in tech-heavy North Carolina, pioneered by a solar-powered data center in 2013. The Solar Energy Industries Association said retailers from Verizon to IKEA have combined to provide one of the most solar-centric technology sectors in the country.\nIn March, Microsoft signed an agreement with the government of Virginia and utility company Dominion Energy to help put more solar power on the state grid.\n Nearly two dozen tremors recorded in Oklahoma in a week Australia's LNG sector is booming Shifting focus leaves mixed bag for German utility RWE",

      "text": "Join a chat \nThe MSDN blog post heralding the launch of Visual Studio for MacOS has since been deleted, which suggests that it may have been announced prematurely. \nIn recent years, Microsoft has been playing nicely with other platforms. In 2014, it launched a port of the .Net Core Framework to MacOS and Linux. And earlier this year, it stunned the tech world by bringing the BASH shell , which is most commonly found on UNIX-like systems, to Windows 10. \nIf anything, this move is indicative of a significant culture change within Microsoft. It suggests that the company knows that the old strategy of locking in its users to Windows is no longer tenable. \nThe long-term success of initiatives like Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform will depend on whether it can sustain developer interest in the face of fierce competition from Amazon’s AWS, Heroku, and Docker. By bringing Microsoft’s solid developer tools to MacOS – a platform favored by many developers – it’s got a chance of doing that.",

      "title": "Russia to investigate Microsoft after Eugene Kaspersky says Windows Defender is anti-competitive",
      "text": "November 14, 2016, 8:30 AM TechSpot \nMicrosoft is facing investigations into anti-competitive practices after Eugene Kaspersky filed complaints with Russian and EU watchdogs over Windows 10. The anti-virus developer claims the Defender security software that comes bundled with the OS tramples over similar third-party products. \nKaspersky says his biggest issue with Microsoft is the fact that the company has cut the amount of time given to developers for Windows compatibility testing from two months to six days. Should Windows 10 detect incompatible security software, the OS will shut it down and run Defender instead. \nIn a lengthy blog post , titled “That’s it. I’ve had enough!,” Kaspersky wrote that this is a deliberate tactic on Microsoft’s part to stop people using third-party anti-malware programs. Microsoft, on the other hand, says the shorter time is due to it releasing more builds at an increased frequency. \nIn his complaint, Kaspersky asks regulators to force Microsoft to \"provide new versions and updates of Windows to independent developers in good time so they can maintain compatibility of their software to Windows.\" \nKaspersky also wants Windows to inform users that their security software is incompatible and will be removed before an upgrade takes place, rather than after the upgrade is complete - which is the case now. \nEven when a program is compatible, warnings will appear informing users that Defender is off – along with a button to turn it back on. Once it is activated, third-party products are disabled. Kaspersky says that both developers and Windows users suffer because of this behavior. \nAnatoly Golomolzin, deputy head of the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), said that Microsoft has \"unjustified advantages\" when it comes to pushing people toward Defender, and his agency will be investigating the matter. “Our task is to ensure equal conditions for all participants on this market,” he said. \nMicrosoft said in a statement that it hasn’t yet received a notification from FAS. The company didn't comment on the EU complaint. \nMicrosoft Russia and Kaspersky Lab. has a long history of cooperation in different areas. Microsoft is committed to work in full compliance with Russian law. The company hasn't received an official notification from [antitrust regulator] FAS. As soon as we get it, we will review it carefully. Related Reads",

      "text": "Read More \nIn July, Microsoft counted 58 million attempts to use email to infect customers with ransomware, while its SmartScreen Filter blocks on average 200,000 automated attacks over the web from so-called exploit kits that deliver ransomware, according to Microsoft. \nBetter overall security has been one of Microsoft's main arguments for users to upgrade to Windows 10, but the company highlights a number of additional security improvements unique to the Anniversary Update. \nMicrosoft hopes better protection from ransomware motivates Windows 7 users to upgrade even though it now costs $120 to do so, after its free update period expired in August. \nEdge on the Anniversary Update works to prevent exploits from downloading and running malware, such as ransomware, on the device, Microsoft says. \nIn other words, if hackers find the first zero-day exploit for Edge, it will still be difficult to run malware on the compromised device. \nEdge now also places Adobe's frequently-targeted Flash Player in an application container to shield attacks on it from having an effect on the browser itself. \nMicrosoft has in addition added new protections for the Windows kernel to prevent attacks on Edge reaching the core of Windows. \n\"In the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, we limited the ways in which system calls can be used by Microsoft Edge, which increases the likelihood that a successful Microsoft Edge exploit will not escape the browser's sandbox and harm the rest of the system, including your important data,\" Microsoft notes. \nWindows Defender has also been upgraded over the past six months, in particular in blocking and analyzing malicious attachments. According to Microsoft, it's reduced Windows Defender's miss rate \"considerably\" and so improved its ability to protect inboxes. \nMicrosoft doesn't quantify how much it's improved, but Windows Defender hasn't always performed well in tests by antivirus testing firm AV-Test. Russian antivirus firm Kaspersky drew attention to Windows Defender results in a complaint to Russia's competition authority over Microsoft allegedly giving preference to Windows Defender over superior rival security products. \nMicrosoft says Windows Defender is now faster at responding to previously unseen malware and that it doesn't need a definition for each piece of malware to react. This capability was enabled with a feature called Block at First Sight , introduced with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. \n\"By improving these behavioral heuristics, we more effectively protect against ransomware, blocking 15 percent of ransomware threats detected in July 2016 this way. The remaining 85 percent were blocked using traditional signatures and cloud-based protection,\" Microsoft says. Read more about Windows 10",

      "title": "Microsoft Office 365 (2016): New Features for Business",
      "text": "Microsoft Office 365 (2016): New Features for Business By Brett Nuckles, Business News Daily Tech Editor November 14, 2016 08:22 am EST MORE Microsoft says that extensions will help you do more from right within the Office suite. / Credit: Microsoft \nThe latest iteration of Microsoft's web-connected Office 365 suite is packed with new, productivity-boosting features. Here's a rundown of the additions that will help you do your job. \nExtensions \n\nOne of the most interesting new features is the ability for developers to build extensions — small programs that run alongside Office — to let you do more without juggling multiple applications. \nMicrosoft demonstrated the new functionality by showcasing some extensions for Outlook, the company's email and calendar application. For example, the Uber application will let you set a reminder to book a cab directly within your Outlook calendar. When the time comes, you will automatically be reminded with a notification on your desktop, and have the option to book a ride with one click — the extension can even automatically grab time and destination information from corresponding emails in your inbox. \nYou also will get the ability to send money directly from your inbox using the PayPal add-on, or draft emails and schedule them for a later delivery with the Boomerang add-on. \nAnd there are add-ons planned for other Office apps, too, like DocuSign for Word, which provides a secure authentication panel in which to digitally sign documents, or the PicHit.me pictures library for PowerPoint, which gives you access to a huge online photo library to help you build visually striking presentations. \nSecurity features \nMicrosoft is also beefing up the security options for the 2016 Office apps. That includes the introduction of Data Loss Protection (DLP) functionality to Word, Excel and PowerPoint. DLP lets you set parameters on Office documents, ensuring that users do not send sensitive information outside of a company network by accident. Another noteworthy new security feature is two-factor authentication for Outlook, to ensure that only you can access your inbox. \nInsights for Office \n\nThe new Insights for Office can help you polish your documents by bringing outside resources right into Microsoft Word. When reviewing a document, you can highlight a word to instantly access resources like images, definitions and other references in a sidebar. The feature is powered by Bing, Microsoft's search engine. \nUniversal office apps \n\nMicrosoft wants to blur the line between the mobile and desktop devices with Windows 10, so the company is prepping a new \"universal\" version of Office 2016 that will launch alongside the desktop suite. The universal apps are touch-optimized and feature scaling interfaces. That means they'll work equally well whether you're running them on your desktop workstation, your tablet or even your smartphone. \nChromebook Support \nOffice 2016 is now available on Chromebooks -- with some caveats. The first thing you need to know is that Google is updating the Chrome OS operating system to allow you to install and run Android apps on all Chromebooks -- and that includes the Android version of Office 365 apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint.. (Note that the feature is rolling out slowly to specific Chromebook computers, so not all systems support it just yet.) Additionally, you'll need to be an Office 365 subscriber to be able to create, edit or print documents when using the Office 365 apps on a Chromebook. Non-subscribers will still be able to view Office documents using the apps, though. \nIntegrated group chat \nIf you already use Microsoft Office 365 to do your job every day, why settle for a third-party app to communicate with your team? That's the question Microsoft is posing with the introduction of Teams, a chat app that's set to be integrated into Office 365 and take on rival apps like Slack and HipChat. It even offers some features you won't find in those apps, including threaded chats, integrated Office document collaboration, and multi-person video chat. The feature is set to launch early in 2017. \nDatabase tools \nMicrosft is also prepped to add Access -- its personal database-building software -- to the Office 365 Business and Business Premium plans.The app was already available in some other Office 365 subscription packages, including the ProPlus plan. The update will allow more small business owners to use the software as part of their existing subscription. \nBrett Nuckles \nBrett Nuckles has been a working journalist since 2009.

      "text": "Microsoft Launching 'Visual Studio' Coding Platform for Mac This Week Monday November 14, 2016 6:09 AM PST by Mitchel Broussard Microsoft plans to launch its integrated developer environment Visual Studio for the Mac later this week, turning its cloud-first development program into a cross-platform experience that developers can use on both Mac and Windows. Although the official press release has since been deleted , TechCrunch spotted the news and noted that the launch of Visual Studio on the Mac is expected to happen during the Connect() conference this week. Visual Studio for Mac will allow developers to create Windows apps on Apple's macOS platform, with the use of cloud platforms like Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services to keep work stored across devices. Microsoft called Visual Studio for Mac a \"counterpart\" to its Windows version, and said that any Windows user \"should feel right at home.\" At its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio. If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home. Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor. Visual Studio on the Mac is said to run Microsoft's .NET software framework and include the programming language of C#. The Microsoft Connect() 2016 developer conference is set to run later this week, from November 16-18, so an official announcement from Microsoft about Visual Studio on the Mac is likely to happen sometime during the event.",

Microsoft has announced that Visual Studio is coming to MacOS, and will be unveiled later this week at the Microsoft Connect() conference in New York City. Visual Studio for Mac will be based on Xamarin Studio, which is a popular C# IDE for OS X. Earlier this year, Microsoft acquired Xamarin in a deal believed to be worth between $400 and $500 million. The MSDN blog post heralding the launch of Visual Studio for MacOS has since been deleted, which suggests that it may have been announced prematurely. In recent years, Microsoft…\n\n ",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 10 minutes ago with 2 comments \nLater this week, Microsoft will be hosting its Connect() developer conference in New York City , but one of its major announcements has already been revealed, thanks to an apparent slip-up by the company. \nA blog post appeared on the MSDN site earlier today titled \"Visual Studio for Mac - Introducing Visual Studio for Mac\"; the post was quickly removed, although a cached version is available to view here , which suggests that the announcement went out a bit earlier than intended. \n\"At its heart,\" Microsoft explained, \"Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio... Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS.\" \nIt also describes the new offering as \"evolving the mobile-centric Xamarin Studio IDE into a true mobile-first, cloud-first development tool for .NET and C#\", adding: \nBelow the surface, Visual Studio for Mac also has a lot in common with its siblings in the Visual Studio family. Its IntelliSense and refactoring use the Roslyn Compiler Platform; its project system and build engine use MSBuild; and its source editor supports TextMate bundles. It uses the same debugger engines for Xamarin and .NET Core apps, and the same designers for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android. \nMicrosoft acquired Xamarin earlier this year , strengthening its commitment to cross-platform software development, so it's no great shock to see the company putting that acquisition to greater use with new integration of those tools into its portfolio, and by extending its popular Visual Studio offering on Apple computers. Microsoft had already made its Visual Studio Code editor available for Macs last year .",

      "text": "Microsoft Announces Visual Studio for Mac 2:38 pm By Roland Hutchinson \nMicrosoft has announced that it is launching Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio is Microsoft’s primary coding interface. \nAt its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio. If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home. Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor. \nBelow the surface, Visual Studio for Mac also has a lot in common with its siblings in the Visual Studio family. Its IntelliSense and refactoring use the Roslyn Compiler Platform; its project system and build engine use MSBuild; and its source editor supports TextMate bundles. It uses the same debugger engines for Xamarin and .NET Core apps, and the same designers for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android. \nVisual Studio will be made available for the Mac later this month, you cna find out more information over at Microsoft at the link below.",

It gives you all the tools you need to develop the rich, native mobile app experiences that users expect today, and the cloud-based server back ends to power them.\n\nThe preview release of Visual Studio for Mac is just Microsoft's latest cross-platform move for developers.

      "title": "Microsoft Faces Russian Antitrust Scrutiny Following Kaspersky Windows 10 Rant",
      "text": "by Paul Lilly — Monday, November 14, 2016 Microsoft Faces Russian Antitrust Scrutiny Following Kaspersky Windows 10 Rant Third-party antivirus developers aren't happy with the way Windows 10 seemingly goes to great lengths to kick AV programs to the curb in favor of Microsoft's own built-in Defender software, and that has led to an antitrust investigation in Russia. Among the various complaints, the Russian antitrust authority will see if Microsoft abused its position of dominance by rushing the OS to market. Russia's antitrust suit echos the complaints Eugene Kaspsersky shared in a lengthy blog post blasting Microsoft for how it treats Defender versus third-party AV programs. Kaspersky, who is the CEO of Kaspersky Lab in Russia, said his feelings on the matter are shared throughout the security industry but most are too afraid to say anything publicly. \"Despite Microsoft slowly killing off the independent security industry, so far, we’re the only ones who have bitten the bullet and decided to say something about this publicly. There are dozens of other very unhappy companies in the industry but, alas, they’ve only expressed their dissatisfaction in informal groups, where a lot of correct things have been said, but nothing of significance actually done,\" Kaspersky said. The Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) will now look to see if Microsoft is violation of Part 1 Article 10 of the Federal Law 'On Protection of Competition' (PDF), which prohibits companies in a dominant position from performing actions that might hurt or otherwise eliminate competition.\"Since 'Microsoft' itself develops antivirus software—Windows Defender that switches on automatically if third-party software fails to adapt to Windows 10 in due time, such actions lead to unreasonable advantages for 'Microsoft' on the software market. Our task is to ensure equal conditions for all participants on this market,\" Anatoly Golomolzin, Deputy Head of FAS, said in a statement.One of the many complaints against Microsoft is that it \"significantly\" reduced the time it gave third-party developers to make their AV software compatible with Windows 10, shortening the period from two months to just six calendar days.Kaspersky also complained that third-party AV software is disabled when upgrading to Windows 10 while Defender gets turned on by default.",

      "text": "Ann Hermes | The Christian Science Monitor | Getty Images University of Pennsylvania GroupMe, the Microsoft -owned messaging app that was used for a racist cyberbulling attack last week at the University of Pennsylvania, said it removed the messages instantly and is investigating the case. \nA number of black freshman students at Pennsylvania was targeted on Friday from a GroupMe account in Oklahoma. Multiple publications, including Philly.com , said the students were added to a list that referenced lynching in the subject and came from users with names like \"Daddy Trump.\" \nGroupMe, which is part of Microsoft's Skype unit, lets users send out group messages from their phones for free. \n\"As soon as we became aware of the chats taking place on GroupMe which violated our terms of service, we took action and removed the chats,\" a Microsoft representative said in an e-mailed statement Sunday night. \"We're investigating to determine which user accounts will be suspended.\" \nSince Republican Donald Trump , a graduate of Penn's Wharton School of Business, won the presidential election, there have been numerous protests across the country, opposing his expressed views on immigrants, minorities and women. \nAt the same time, racist and bigoted attacks have been extensively reported in schools and communities, leading Trump to tell CBS \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday that his supporters should \"stop it.\" \nUniversity of Pennsylvania officials including President Amy Gutmann said in a statement on Sunday that three GroupMe users in Oklahoma were linked to the attack. One attends the University of Oklahoma and has been suspended. \n\"Penn Police continue to work with the FBI and law enforcement in Oklahoma,\" the statement said \"Our hope is that the full investigation into this terrible incident will be concluded shortly.\"",

      "text": "Microsoft Announces Visual Studio for Mac LIKE MORE Posted 9 minutes ago by iClarified · 400 views · Translate Microsoft has announced that it is launching a preview of Visual Studio for Mac at Connect(). In a blog post which appears to have been published a little early, Microsoft says Visual Studio for Mac evolves the mobile-centric Xamarin Studio IDE into a true mobile-first, cloud-first development tool for .NET and C#. At its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio. If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home. Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it’s complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don’t need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor. Visual Studio for Mac's IntelliSense and refactoring use the Roslyn Compiler Platform; its project system and build engine use MSBuild; and its source editor supports TextMate bundles. It uses the same debugger engines for Xamarin and .NET Core apps, and the same designers for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android.Although Visual Studio for Mac is a new product and doesn’t support all of the Visual Studio project types, for those it does have in common it uses the same MSBuild solution and project format. If you have team members on macOS and Windows, or switch between the two OSes yourself, you can seamlessly share your projects across platforms.The preview of Visual Studio for Mac should be available later this week.

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft has announced today the purchase of 237 megawatts of wind energy from Allianz Risk Transfer and Black Hills Corp., its largest purchase of wind energy to date. These new contracts, which will make Microsoft’s wind energy investments reach 500 megawatts in the US, will allow the company to power its Cheyenne, Wyoming datacenter entirely by wind power. \nIn a separate blog post , Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith reiterated that Microsoft’s commitment to build a greener cloud : \nThis investment in wind energy keeps us on pace to meet the energy goals we set last spring. We announced earlier this year that roughly 44 percent of the electricity consumed by Microsoft’s datacenters comes from wind, solar and hydropower, and we committed to raising this to 50 percent by 2018 and to 60 percent by early in the next decade. Microsoft’s investments in wind energy projects in the U.S. have now reached more than 500 megawatts. \nWith these latest wind energy investments, the company has also “structured the purchase and partnered with the local utility in novel ways to make it easier and more affordable for cities and states to move to a cleaner energy grid,” added Brad Smith. Specifically, Microsoft has partnered with Black Hills Energy to create a new tariff that will be available to all eligible customers in Cheyenne, allowing the utility to use the company’s datacenter’s back up generators. With this new solution, Black Hills no longer needs to pursue its plans to build a new power plant in the area. \n“We’re focused on building a cloud that serves the broader good, a cloud that is trusted, inclusive and responsible,” explained Brad Smith. “By thinking creatively about our energy needs and the assets at our datacenters, we’re able to deliver an innovative solution in Wyoming that does just that — and serves as a model from which we all can learn,” he added.

      "text": "  \nVisual Studio, Microsoft’s integrated development environment, has long been used by developers in the process of making computer programs for Microsoft Windows, as well as websites, web applications, and web services. A new leak spotted by petri.com , coming from a cached Microsoft blog post , however, suggests that Visual Studio may soon be coming to the Mac. \nAs the cached blog post suggests, The MacOS version of Visual Studio is planned to be unveiled during Microsoft’s Connect() conference later this month in New York. It will apparently also be a counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio, will feature a UX very similar to the Windows version, but will also feel like a native citizen of the MacOS experience. \nWhile compatibility is the focus, the MacOS version is a new product, so it will reportedly not support all Visual Studio project types. It will, however, use the MSBuild solution, which means that developer can share projects and switch between the two operating systems without conversion or migration. \nThe MacOS version of Visual Studio will be based on Xamarain Studio, which was purchased by Microsoft back in February of this year. It also marks Microsoft’s next steps towards evolving the mobile-centric Xamarin Studio IDE into a true mobile-first, cloud-first development tool for .NET and C#. For the complete details on what to expect from the MacOS version of Visual Studio, you can check out the cached version of Microsoft’s blog post on the subject.

      "title": "Schiller: Apple tried touch screen MacBooks but doesn’t work for iMacs, landed on Touch Bar instead",
      "text": "Reddit \nDespite what companies like Microsoft may be doing and what some customers continue asking for, Apple is really confident that you wouldn’t like a touch screen on your MacBook. Here’s Phil Schiller explaining Apple’s view on touch screen Macs to Backchannel ‘s Steven Levy: \nApple came to this conclusion by testing if touch screens made sense on the Mac. “Our instincts were that it didn’t, but, what the heck, we could be wrong—so our teams worked on that for a number of times over the years,” says Schiller. “We’ve absolutely come away with the belief that it isn’t the right thing to do. Our instincts were correct.” \nOf course, Apple is slowly introducing multi-touch to Macs with the release of new MacBook Pros that replace function keys with a dynamic touch panel… \nThe reviews are starting to come in this morning and reception is mixed when it comes to the utility of the Touch Bar so far, and Schiller is confident that it’s the best approach for the notebook form factor. \n“Watch, iPhone, iPad, Macbook, iMac,” he said. “They really are all computers. Each one is offering customers something unique and each one is made with a simple form that perhaps is eternal. People in the industry may question them — we don’t, for some very simple reasons.” \nTranslation: don’t expect an iPad/MacBook hybrid anytime soon like Microsoft’s convertible Surface products. Part of the reason may be that Apple wants a unified experience between notebooks and desktops. \n“We think of the whole platform,” he says. “If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn’t be enough — then the desktop wouldn’t work that way.” And touch on the desktop, he says, would be a disaster. Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd.” \nFor Microsoft’s part, they’re launching what they call the Surface Studio — a giant iMac-like touch screen display that lowers into a giant iPad-like panel for artists. Apple’s take is that you can’t design the desktop operating system to be best for both touch and mouse input. \nHe also explains that such a move would mean totally redesigning the menu bar for fingers, in a way that would ruin the experience for those using pointer devices like the touch or mouse. “You can’t optimize for both,” he says. “It’s the lowest common denominator thinking.” \nThe messaging for now seems clear: don’t expect the Touch Bar to creep up to the display any time soon (if ever); instead, I’d expect iPads to get more powerful and dynamic in form factor (like Smart Keyboard for example) as Apple’s answer to this request from customers. \nFor now, Touch Bar sounds more like Apple’s answer to a static row of function keys that may not get as much use as keys that could replace them. Multi-touch gestures on the trackpad may feel closer to touch — just not directly. \nSchiller’s reasoning here does suggest to me that iMacs will see the Touch Bar arrive in some form sooner or later. Can’t do touch screen MacBooks because it doesn’t work for iMacs, so Touch Bar can right? \nSchiller isn’t the only Apple exec to detail the company’s previous experimentation with touch screen MacBooks either. Craig Federighi hinted at the past experiments in recent interviews as well. Bottom line is don’t hold your breath on touch Macs in any form anytime soon if ever. \nSteve Jobs, of course, also spoke against the idea of touch screen Macs when selling the iPad: \nWe’ve done tons of user testing on this, and it turns out it doesn’t work. Touch surfaces don’t want to be vertical. It gives great demo but after a short period of time, you start to fatigue and after an extended period of time, your arm wants to fall off. it doesn’t work, it’s ergonomically terrible. Touch surfaces want to be horizontal, hence pads. Guides",

      "title": "Microsoft is Bringing Visual Studio To Mac",
      "text": "on Monday November 14, 2016 @09:40AM from the new-Microsoft dept. Microsoft will finally bring Visual Studio, a \"true mobile-first, cloud-first development tool for .NET and C#,\" to Mac later this month , the company has said. From a report on TechCrunch: The IDE is very similar to the one found on Windows. In fact, that is presumably the point. By making it easy for OS X users to switch back and forth between platforms, Microsoft is able to ensure coders can quickly become desktop agnostic or, barring that, give Windows a try again. From the release: \"At its heart, Visual Studio for Mac is a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio. If you enjoy the Visual Studio development experience, but need or want to use macOS, you should feel right at home. Its UX is inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS. And like Visual Studio for Windows, it's complemented by Visual Studio Code for times when you don't need a full IDE, but want a lightweight yet rich standalone source editor.",

      "text": "Video of What the Microsoft Surface Studio Will Do for Design Drawing Dialing it in U 1 38 Views A couple of weeks ago, we asked for your thoughts on Microsoft's forthcoming designer-targeted Surface Studio . (Response was generally positive, with a couple of haters.) There's still a month to go before it hits store shelves, and they're not sending out media tester units, but now's as good a time as any to think about what it will do for design sketching. Let's look at some of the drawing app developers Microsoft's working with: Enter a caption (optional) Well, I gotta say that looks pretty darned alluring, and my hat's off to both Microsoft and the app developers. I figured that Dial might be a gimmick, but after seeing it in action, I suspect that when you go back to sketching on regular paper, your hand will be subconsciously reaching for the Dial. The only downside I can see is, everyone in the office wanting to get their greasy mitts on your Dial while you go over projects together. You're gonna be Purell'ing that thing constantly!

      "text": "Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter \nWhile the allegations are that this testing period has been reduced to days, the complaint doesn't detail why developers can't test their applications against early builds of Windows released under the Windows Insiders program, which are often released months in advance of being pushed to end users. One counterpoint could be that software that runs on early builds of Windows 10 released under the Windows Insider program won't necessarily be compatible with the build released to end users. \nThe CEO of Kaspersky Lab also complained to the FAS about Windows 10's practice of uninstalling unsupported anti-virus software and setting Microsoft's Windows Defender as the system default if a user upgrades to Windows 10 from an older OS. He wants Windows to notify users that unsupported third-party software will be uninstalled before the upgrade takes place and to recommend compatible versions of third-party software after the upgrade. \n\"Users have the right to choose the best; freedom of choice enables the development of competition; and competition leads to technical progress. We intend to fight for such freedom, even if we have to do so alone,\" says Kaspersky in an online post , where he mentions filing a similar complaint with EU regulators. \nExplaining why the FAS was looking into the complaint that Microsoft has violated Part 1 Article 10 of Russian Federal Law 'On Protection of Competition', deputy head of FAS Anatoly Golomolzin said: \"Since \"Microsoft\" itself develops antivirus software - Windows Defender that switches on automatically if third-party software fails to adapt to Windows 10 in due time, such actions lead to unreasonable advantages for \"Microsoft\" on the software market. Our task is to ensure equal conditions for all participants on this market.\" \nMicrosoft has previously faced criticism for Windows 10 changing the default browser to Microsoft Edge when users upgrade to the OS . \nThe US tech giant could also fall foul of a law introduced in Russia earlier this year that prohibits government departments from buying software and services from foreign providers when there is a viable Russian alternative available. \nTo this end, Moscow City Hall has announced it will transfer employee email from Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook to the Russian-built MyOffice Mail and is considering shifting as many as 600,000 PCs and servers away from Microsoft.

      "text": "0 0 \nIt seems that Microsoft is now trying to improve the software side of Windows 10 Mobile . The company is currently working with partners on building devices that will run its OS. While there are no big companies now rushing to adopt this new platform, there are some smaller ones from Asia that want to do it. \nFor example, KEYEVER AO, a company from China, has announced a candybar phone that will feature a 3.5-inch AMOLED screen andl support a resolution of 960×540 pixels. The handset will come with touch support and a physical keyboard. According to leaked images, it seems that the new device will come with a typical number keyboard, but it seems that there are plans to release a version of the device with a QWERTY keyboard . \nThe handset will feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 chipset and a battery of 3000 mAh which will be able to keep the handset going for at least one day. To make sure that the device will sell well, the Chinese company wants to sell the device for only $155. \nWe’re pretty sure that this upcoming device reminds you of BlackBerry-powered devices , which came with a QWERTY keyboard and a touchscreen. For example, the BlackBerry Q10 was released with similar mentioned features, but had a Snapdragon S4 processor. \nIt is good to know KEYEVER AO is still working on the Windows 10 Mobile smartphone , which means that there is a high chance some of its features will change before being released to the public. \nThe company hasn’t specified any release date yet, but it is planning to launch it as soon as possible. \nWhat are your thoughts about QWERTY type of smartphones? Do you think that the public will go back to those types of devices? \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "title": "Microsoft Claims Windows 10 Version 1607 Is Its Most Secure Operating System To Date",
      "text": "by Paul Lilly   Microsoft Claims Windows 10 Version 1607 Is Its Most Secure Operating System To Date Anyone who is looking for a reason to install the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (build1607) need only consider that there has never been a more secure version of Windows. So says Microsoft, which made the claim in conjunction with a new white paper detailing the ways in which the latest version of Windows protects users from ransomware. According to Microsoft, an increasing number of cybercriminals are turning to ransomware in search of a quick buck. The Redmond software giant points out that the number of ransomware variants has doubled in the last 12 months alone. \"Its premise is deceptively simple: infect users' devices, and then deny them access to their devices or files unless they pay a ransom. However, the methods and means attackers are using to perpetrate ransomsware attacks are increasingly varied, complex, and costly,\" Microsoft said. Armed with that knowledge, Microsoft made a concerted effort to improve built-in defenses against ransomware in Windows 10 with its Anniversary Update. Part of that included toughening its Edge browser to be more resilient towards ransomware, as six of the top 10 ransomware threats use browser or browser-plugin exploits. \"Adobe Flash Player is a common browser plug-in that has been used by exploit writers to download ransomware, so we updated Microsoft Edge to run Flash Player in an isolated container. We have also locked down Microsoft Edge so that an exploit running in the browser cannot execute another program. These improvements block malware from silently downloading and executing additional payloads on customers’ systems,\" Microsoft added.Microsoft also tapped into machine learning capabilities to enhance its cloud infrastructure so that its researchers can identify ransomware much quicker. Before the Anniversary Update, Microsoft said the process of collecting a suspicious program for analysis could take hours. Now it takes minutes.The blog post amounts to a lot of chest thumping, followed by a recommendation to update to the latest build and accept the default security settings. What Microsoft doesn't bring up is that updating Windows can muck with third-party AV programs by disabling them in favor of its own Defender software. Security outfit Kaspersky recently raised a ruckus over how Windows 10 treats third-party AV programs, which in turn led to Russia's antitrust arm opening a case against Microsoft.",

      "text": "The Biggest Flops in Microsoft's History These five products will go down as Microsoft's worst. Jamal Carnette Nov 14, 2016 at 10:16AM Microsoft's Zune is on the list. Image source: Flickr user Robert Nelson . \nEvery successful company has a few products it would rather forget. Many remember New Coke, McDonald 's Mighty Wings, Crystal Pepsi, Harley-Davidson cologne, Apple 's Newton, and Ford 's Edsel were among a few products that flopped while the companies went on to huge successes. \nFor Microsoft ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) , the company under former CEO Steve Ballmer has been characterized as the \"lost decade\" when the company missed out on the shift to mobile. It makes sense, then, that many of the failures I'll explore here occurred on his watch. Here are Microsoft's five biggest flops. Surface RT \nMicrosoft's Surface tablets have been a recent success. In fact, the Surface has been so effective as a brand that the company has extended the name to laptops, with the Surface Book, and desktops, with the recently unveiled Surface Studio. Excluding Microsoft's Xbox, Microsoft's Surface line may be the company's first true hardware success. \nIt's hard to imagine now, but the Surface tablet played a role in the departure of longtime CEO Steve Ballmer. The company's new Surface line (Surface Studio pictured) has been hardware success. Image source: Microsoft. \nDuring the initial rollout, Ballmer and Windows President Steven Sinofsky enthusiastically sold the Surface Pro. Unfortunately, the company introduced the lower-priced Surface RT as well. The RT version, although cheaper, never caught on with shoppers. The biggest issue was that the unit ran on ARM processors and wasn't backwards capable with Windows apps. The RT app store was very limited and led to a poor consumer experience. In a little over a year, both Sinofsky and Ballmer were gone and the company declared a $900 million writedown, primarily because of Surface RT sales. Windows Vista \nWhile many of Microsoft's flops came from when the company moved outside its competency of software, there have been more than a few times when Microsoft released substandard versions of its Windows OS. Many remember Windows 8 and the disappearing (then reappearing) Start button, or the crash-prone Windows ME the company replaced within a year. However, none of them were quite as bad as Windows Vista, which ended with a dismissed class action lawsuit. \nReleased in early 2007, Windows Vista had as its primary goal to upgrade the operating system's security. Well, Microsoft overcorrected on the security front. Vista's prime criticism was that the company's prompt-prone user-access control function was an extreme annoyance. \nAdditionally, the rollout was extremely problematic, with ominous hardware and licensing requirements affecting a large portion of users. Later, Microsoft received a black eye when leaked emails from company execs surfaced in the class action lawsuit, revealing that the company lowered the requirements for incompatible Intel chips to help its primary chipmaker make quarterly earnings estimates. Zune \nPerhaps the failure of Ballmer could best be encapsulated by the company's Zune. Microsoft launched its first-gen Zune device in 2006, a full half-decade after Apple released its iPod. After poor reception for the device, Microsoft released its last version, the Zune HD, in late 2009. The company discontinued its support for Zune devices in 2015. \nThe failure of Zune was not simply hardware related. By its release, Apple had become the de facto gatekeeper for digital downloads, a distinction the company owns to this day. However, the iPod provided Cupertino the prototype for mobile dominance, as the company was, unbeknownst to Microsoft, heavily at work on the iPhone. Microsoft Phone \nIf Zune represented a falling behind of Microsoft's mobile fortunes, Windows Phone has cemented Microsoft's mobile fortunes. Originally, the company decided to work with hardware partners, much as it does with its Microsoft OS, and merely provide the ecosystem. However, after a poor response from most hardware partners, Ballmer's Microsoft purchased the only strong ally by buying Nokia 's phone business for $7.2 billion in 2014. Image source: Microsoft. \nLast year, Microsoft announced its plans to cut 7,800 jobs in the division and write down roughly $7.6 billion owing to its Nokia business. Additionally, the company sold the feature (non-smart) phone business to Chinese assembler Foxconn for $350 million. While the rumored high-end Surface smartphone keeps getting bandied about, but never confirmed, it's safe to say Microsoft's foray into smartphones is a costly bust thus far. \nAdding insult to injury, Ballmer initially reacted about the iPhone's release with a laughing shrug. aQuantive \nIn an attempt to compete with Google in the digital advertising space, Microsoft paid $6.3 billion to buy display-ad company aQuantive. Microsoft seemed quite assured of the company's value by inking the deal with an 85% acquisition premium and by consummating the offer in cash. \nAfter five years and $10.4 billion in ongoing online services losses, Microsoft took a $6.2 billion write-off on the acquisition. Many reasons were blamed for the failure -- Microsoft's insistence that aQuantive move into search to augment its Bing search engine, a culture-clash between the two companies, and brain drain among aQuantive staff hurting innovation -- but in the end, Microsoft lost out on the search and display business to its nimbler competitor. \nJamal Carnette owns shares of Apple.

      "text": "Microsoft Set to Release Visual Studio for Macs Posted by Evan Selleck on Nov 14,   \nMicrosoft has its own developer environment called Visual Studio — one that’s been absent from Macs. \nBut that looks to be changing, as reported by The Verge . The publication notes that Microsoft may have published its unveiling a bit early, as the company quickly pulled the blog post from public eyes after it went live. It’s likely that Microsoft planned on announcing the new software for Macs at this year’s Connect() developer conference, which is scheduled to take place on Wednesday, November 16. \nThe developer environment was previously only available on Macs that ran a virtual machine to support the Windows desktop operating system, or on Windows-based computers entirely. Microsoft’s change here isn’t a sign that everything is tumbling down, though, but instead an expansion of Microsoft’s goal to make its services available across platforms. \nThere won’t be any need for conversion or migration, either, even as developers switch between desktop operating systems (if that’s how they get work done), or if multiple team members use different platforms. \nAs for when Visual Studio for Mac will be available, that still remains to be seen. However, if the announcement is planned for Wednesday, it could arrive soon after.",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft to deliver Visual Studio for Mac Microsoft is readying a preview of Visual Studio for Mac, which is an 'evolution' of the Xamarin Studio IDE. | Topic: Developer \nMicrosoft plans to launch a preview of Visual Studio for Mac this week at its Connect() conference, according to an MSDN Magazine article which Microsoft published and then pulled. \nThe article described Visual Studio for Mac as \"a macOS counterpart of the Windows version of Visual Studio,\" with a look and feel \"inspired by Visual Studio, yet designed to look and feel like a native citizen of macOS.\" \nAs Tim Anderson of ITWriting noted, this isn't actually a port of the Windows version of Visual Studio to Mac; instead, it's a rebranding of Xamarin's technology . Microsoft bought mobile-tool vendor Xamarin in February 2016. \nThe MSDN article describes Visual Studio for Mac as an evolution of the Xamarin Studio integrated development environment (IDE). \nVisual Studio for Mac will include IntelliSense and refactoring via the Roslyn Compiler platform . It will use MSBuild and the same debugger engines for Xamarin and .NET Core apps, as well as the same designers for Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android. \nThe preview will be available for download from VisualStudio.com , the article says. \nA second MSDN Magazine article , which also appears to have been published erroneously, focused on another Connect() announcement, the availability of the Release Candidate for the next version of Visual Studio for Windows. Codenamed VS'15, that release will be christened Visual Studio 2017, according to that article. \nMicrosoft's Connect() 2016 developer conference kicks off on Wednesday, November 16, and runs through November 18. Microsoft will be live streaming the event . \n(Thanks to the readers who sent me the links to the two articles.) Join Discussion",

      "title": "Microsoft Azure's Kubernetes support demonstrates growing importance of containers",
      "text": "Microsoft Azure's Kubernetes support demonstrates growing importance of containers Microsoft announced improved support for kubernetes container management showing the fast adoption of container technology By Keith Townsend | November 14, 2016, 5:58 AM PST Google Plus \nMicrosoft recently announced a new Kubernetes on Azure Containers preview. Why is this of any value outside of the limited organizations running containers within Azure, or any environment? \nThe Microsoft announcement demonstrates the fast growing support around containers and, by proxy, shows the business value of containers in the enterprise. \nSEE: Why Kubernetes could be crowned king of container management Time to value \nOne of the themes of digital transformation is the need for agility. Outside of the term \"digital transformation,\" time to value is a common buzzword. Time to value indicates the time it takes to procure resources and reap the benefits of the resource. It can take months to years to realize value from a traditional IT resource once procured. The promise of containers is to help reduce that time to value metric. \nContainers allow developers to program to an uninformed abstraction. The underlying data center resources are not of relevance to the developer. Without modification, the code run on a laptop will run on cloud instances, VMs, or bare metal servers. \nContainers reduce overall development time, which helps reduce the time to value metric. While the data center is abstracted, there's a level of effort to support containers at the data center level. Concepts such as storage, compute, and networking require experienced management. Data center orchestration \nAny solution will break when adding scale, and containers are no exception. While the code may remain unchanged, the stress on the underlying system increases. Transactions that worked within service levels on a laptop may not function as well when multiplied by the hundreds or thousands, or even millions, in production. \nJust placing the containers on available compute infrastructure becomes a difficult computer science problem. At the core, data center managers deploying containers require a management system that orchestrates the infrastructure running the containers at scale. Kubernetes along with Mesos, and Docker Swarm are examples of container orchestration tools that provide the Day 2 operational ability needed for scale. \nKubernetes also leverages the concept of consistent API. A developer knows that his or her containers deployed to a Kubernetes managed infrastructure will have consistent attributes. On the operations side, data center managers have a tool by which to normalize different infrastructure components. The result is that a developer calling persistent storage doesn't need to know if the physical storage is cloud-based or an enterprise array. The operations team can seamlessly deploy applications on the infrastructure best suited for the workload. Kubernetes on Azure \nThe deeper the integration of infrastructure and Kubernetes, the better the resulting operations. Microsoft has worked to ensure Azure networking, storage, and compute all work well within the Kubernetes management system. The hope is a better performing experience of applications and support. More importantly, it's a validation that containers are a critical component of the future data center, and the market is quickly maturing. Click here to subscribe to our Cloud Insights newsletter.

      "text": "Microsoft bringing Visual Studio to the Mac November 14, 2016 - 18:45   Microsoft has announced it’s launching its primary coding interface, Visual Studio , on Mac computers. The news may sound uninteresting, but it’s been a long time coming, and is a big shakeup for the company, which has previously preferred to lock developers into its platform by keeping coding tools Windows-only, The Verge reports. \nThe change comes as Microsoft shifts its focus to its money-making cloud operation. While programming tasks in the past might have been carried out on local servers, they’re now increasingly using platform-agnostic cloud services like Azure (from Microsoft) and AWS (from Amazon). By making Visual Studio cross-platform, Microsoft will be hoping to retain professional users that want to work on their projects from any operating system they like. The software is based on app development platform Xamarin Studio, and the change could encourage Mac and iOS developers to make more apps for Windows, as these users will no longer have to buy a Windows computer or set up a virtual machine to access Visual Studio. \nThe news follows a similar announcement from earlier this year, when the company announced it would be adding native support for Linux command line Bash to Windows for the first time ever. As Microsoft's Scott Hanselman said at the time, adding Bash support was \"brilliant for developers that use a diverse set of tools\"— launching Visual Studio for Mac is a similar move. \nA preview of the software will be unveiled at Microsoft’s Connect(); conference later this week. For more information including technical details, head over to Microsoft’s blog post announcing the news. Related links:",

      "text": "Read More \nBut the system for alerting IT admins and security pros about the content of those bulletins hasn't kept pace. \nAs of November 2016, the Security Bulletins index runs for a daunting 57 pages, with a list of updates that goes back to 2008. Each individual bulletin in turn includes details about that patch for each software package it affects, with links to Knowledge Base numbers that in turn contain additional details. \nIt's a rabbit hole that even security experts can quickly get lost in, and the entire concept of an index page of static documents is increasingly old-fashioned. \nSo, beginning in early 2017, Microsoft says it will scrap that entire system in favor of a new \"single destination for security vulnerability information\" called the Security Updates Guide . \nThe new security portal is driven by an online database. Instead of having to poke through an index of documents, you can sort, search, and filter the database to find details about a specific security bulletin and its associated updates. \nCurrently, the portal is in a preview, with bulletins for November 2016 through January 2017 being published to both the old index and the new guide. After January 2017, new bulletins will be published only to the new guide. \nRefactoring the security guide as a database allows IT admins and security professionals to quickly turn that sprawling index into a manageable list. \nIn the new guide, for example, you can filter by product category to find all updates that apply to browsers, or combine criteria to display a list of only Critical updates for Windows 10 version 1607. \nThe new security portal is driven by a database instead of being a static index. \nSearch results appear in a grid that you can filter directly using a text box or sort by clicking column headings. Details about the vulnerability (including CVE numbers, severity ratings, and impact) are hidden by default but can be revealed with a click or two of the checkbox. \nEach entry in the grid contains links to the associated KB article and to details about the vulnerability and affected products. \nYou can also search by CVE number or KB article to quickly learn details about a specific vulnerability. \nFinally, and most importantly, the entire list or any filtered subset can be downloaded as an Excel worksheet in CVE format, allowing IT pros to integrate security information into their own infrastructure without having to manually scrape the index. \nThis is just the latest in a wave of changes Microsoft has made to the way it delivers updates. The biggest change, of course, is the decision to package updates into cumulative packages instead of delivering individual updates that can be accepted or discarded. \nThat decision has inspired some grumbling among both Windows users and IT pros, who are concerned about the disruptive impact of flawed updates on productivity. This change, while it will affect some ingrained work habits, should be a net positive for most IT pros. Join Discussion",

      "text": "Microsoft to bring Visual Studio to Mac later this week By Monday, November 14, 2016, 07:44 am PT (10:44 am ET) Microsoft is bringing its Visual Studio development tool to the Mac, launching it during this week's Connect() conference starting on Wednesday, according to a quickly deleted announcement. The software is a \"mobile-first, cloud-first\" suite focusing on C# and .NET, Microsoft said . It described the Mac version as a \"counterpart\" to the one on Windows, with an interface modified to better suit the macOS environment. TechCrunch noted that while Microsoft has traditionally tried to steer developers towards using Windows, the global shift towards cloud computing means that developers are less tied to a single OS or piece of hardware. It can still make money off, however, off of software and its own cloud platform, Azure. Indeed under current CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has become increasingly Mac- and iOS-friendly, content to have people on non-Windows platforms so long as they're using Microsoft services. At the same time it has also been diving more deeply into hardware, expanding its Surface line with products like the Surface Book and the Surface Studio , and experimenting with its own augmented reality technology, HoloLens.

      "title": "Microsoft signs deal to power data center entirely by wind power",
      "text": "Join a chat \nMicrosoft has contracted Bloom Wind farm in Kansas to provide 178 megawatts, and the Silver Sage and Happy Jack farms in Wyoming to provide an additional 59 megawatts. \nThis isn’t the only clean energy deal Microsoft has inked in recent years. It already has a 75-megawatt agreement with a wind farm in Illinois, and a 100-megawatt agreement with one in Texas. In total, Microsoft has purchased 500 megawatts of energy from wind power sources. \nInterestingly, Microsoft has also revealed that the site’s backup generators will be used as a “secondary resource” for the local grid. This means they will actually provide energy to the local community during periods of high demand. \nThese backup generators will burn natural gas, which, despite being a fossil fuel, is far less ecologically damaging than diesel. \nMicrosoft hopes that by 2018, it will use around 50 percent renewable energy. This deal shows that the company is on the right track.",
