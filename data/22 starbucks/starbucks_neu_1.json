      "title": "What Happened In My \"Month Without Starbucks\"",
      "text": "food Share this article \nSomewhere within my first month at CLU, I had a shocking realization: coffee is needed even more in college than it is in high school. That shouldn’t have been shocking, since the workload is harder and the nights are later, but it still came as a bit of a surprise since I had already been a bit excessive on the caffeinated drinks train. What was a lot less of a shock was that, naturally, most of those drinks were coming from Starbucks, which was conveniently located in the middle of campus. \nMy friends Kaitlyn, Hayley and I began spending so much on Starbucks that we began to wonder what would happen if we suddenly stopped drinking it. For a few days? A week? A month? Yes, for a month. As you can read on below, here’s what we learned in the month we decided to give up Starbucks: \n\nThe thought behind the idea: We would get Starbucks even when we weren’t hungry or thirsty. Maybe it was a want instead of a need? Just a nice comfort in a stressful, often frightening world. You can always depend on Starbucks. So what would happen if we stopped depending on it? \nWeek 1: Midterms week. Hayley succumbed to pressure and got Starbucks almost instantly due to the stress. We decided ordering food from Starbucks was okay (which we should have recognized as the start of our downfall). On a rather overwhelming night of studying, we all decided to get the bottled Starbucks’ coffees from a vending machine in the Student Union. Since we mostly study and hang out in the campus Starbucks between classes, it tempted us at every turn. But mostly, we made it through the week. \nWeek 2: The start of occasional cheating. How many times had Hayley had Starbucks by this point? Who knew. Kaitlyn and I were trying to stay strong, but our resolve was already weakening. Why weren't we letting ourselves indulge in the comfort of a nice, warm drink again? It was hard to be brave during the busiest time of the semester, when Starbucks is there for you through the blood and tears that come with constant papers, late night geology study sessions, and early morning group presentation practices. We each cheated several times during the course of the week. \nWeek 3: Where was our strength? Why was it so hard to say no to Starbucks? At one point, I told Kaitlyn I needed Starbucks, and she just said “do it” instead of saying “no” like she would have in week one. But the problem is, I still didn't need it. I know I didn't need it. I just wanted it. But knowing that was not enough for me not to buy it. Although occasionally we still didn't drink Starbucks, throughout the week we continued cheating and excusing it more and more. \nWeek 4: Our strength was officially gone. We gave up. Starbucks won its war against three college students who should be putting their money towards student loans rather than chai tea lattes. \n\n\nThe lesson learned: Although it was too hard to completely resist Starbucks, we did learn several things over the course of the month. Be sure to keep these in mind if you’re ever trying to save money on Starbucks or stop yourself from constantly indulging in it: \nDetermine if you want coffee or if you just want Starbucks. Other brand coffee drinks (whether you make it yourself or get it from the nearest 7/11) are typically a lot cheaper than the more complex Starbucks’ orders. \nIt’s a lot easier to not get Starbucks if you’re not in Starbucks. As soon as you’re in there, your internal alarms start going off and not getting a Starbucks becomes highly improbable. \nDelete your Tapingo so easy cheating becomes less easy. The early morning lines can help scare you off. \nIf you do want Starbucks, think about why you want it. If you have a test next period, a paper to spend hours working on, or it’s just a nice rainy day and you’re really craving it, then get your Starbucks. If you can find something to justify it, then you’re in the clear. \nWho are we kidding? Drink your Starbucks. It’s a sure way to feel good even when you question why you ever decided to take two lab classes in the same semester. You Might Also Enjoy",

      "text": "How Starbucks Is Honoring Our Nation's Heroes This Veteran's Day (and How You Can, Too!) November 7, 2016 by Sarah Siegel 11 Shares \nIf you're a veteran who can't get enough Starbucks, you're in for a treat this Veteran's Day. Starbucks has decided to honor the people who bravely serve our country with some caffeinated treats. \nBetween Nov. 1 and 11, you can help our veterans by purchasing a Starbucks gift card over $5. Starbucks will then donate $5 to three Veterans Service Organizations ( The Mission Continues , Team Rubicon and Team Red White and Blue ). \nIf you're a fan of instant coffee, be sure to buy your Starbucks VIA packets online. Any online purchase of Starbucks VIA packets will be matched and sent to American military units overseas. \nOn Veteran's Day itself (Nov. 11), veterans, active duty military, and any military spouse can go to Starbucks and received a free tall coffee. Cheers! Related:",

Caption \nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz speaks at an event celebrating a new partnership between Starbucks and non-profit groups in New York City and Los Angeles to assist in offsetting government funding cuts to programs for children and education on October 4, 2011 in New York City. \nCopy link to share with friends Copy link The Daily Dose NOV 09 2016 \nU.S. presidential elections attract billionaires like Learjet moths to a flame. In the 2016 contest, it was hard not to throw a stone without hitting one. Look, there’s Mark Cuban courtside at the presidential debate and Peter Thiel defending Donald Trump. And then there’s George Soros, the Koch brothers, Tom Steyer , Robert Mercer and many more pulling donor strings from the shadows. \nBillionaires always had the money and the power to influence politics, but, of course, the real story of the 2016 election is that while we were awaiting the stealthy approach of big-money barbarian donors at the gates of American democracy, a big-money candidate with a big mouth strolled right through the front door, hijacking the election as if it were a congressional subcommittee. And now that Trump has blazed a scorched-earth path to the presidency, how many billionaire political players will decide to place themselves behind the wheel of the candidacies they have been driving for years from the backseat of the limo?

George Washington was a prosperous plantation owner and one of the young nation’s richest men. And in recent years, more than half the members of Congress have been millionaires. But truly prodigious wealth and formal political power, particularly the presidency, are rarely paired, despite the best efforts of mega-wealthy candidates like Nelson Rockefeller , Ross Perot and Steve Forbes to mount America’s iron throne. \nWill the scions of American industry be willing to submit to such a rough-and-tumble sport? \nTrump’s unprecedented ascent in this election mirrors a broader, and disturbing, trend across the world. According to Darrell West, the director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, billionaires have sought public office in 13 countries over the past decade, and most have been successful, from Silvio Berlusconi in Italy to hotel magnate turned Prime Minister Bidzina “Boris” Ivanishvili in Georgia to telecommunications tycoon turned Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra in Thailand. \nSuch moguls who portray themselves as men of the people — and they are almost exclusively male — are not without popular appeal, especially in America, where there’s a tendency to commingle wealth and virtue and worry about candidates being bought by special interests. There is something refreshing about an unbossed and unbought plutocrat with the financial independence to spurn the establishment and speak truth from power. Trump, like Michael Bloomberg and Ross Perot before him, has harnessed it well. Source Drew Angerer/Getty \nCombine that appeal with built-in advantages that benefit presidential candidates — name recognition, media experience and a healthy ego, says Northeastern University professor Daniel Urman — and it’s not hard to imagine a trend toward more billionaire-celebrity politicians, starting with Cuban. In fact, before he soured on Trump, the Dallas Mavericks owner and Shark Tank judge praised him as a trailblazer. “I love the fact that he has changed the game,” Cuban told Politico in 2015. “The idea of imperfect candidates with forceful ideas opens the door for a lot of people [who] would not have previously run.” \nWho else might make a run for that door? The American billionaires club now boasts 540 members with a combined net worth of almost $2.4 trillion, according to Forbes . Perhaps the most political among them, Bloomberg, decided against a presidential run this year, and, at 74, the former New York City mayor may be past his “best by” date for a presidential bid come 2020. Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, who made Clinton’s long list of potential VP nominees, along with former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and California hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, has some name recognition and significant experience in the political arena but has yet to show any desire to run for office. \nSeveral moguls have already sought office or flirted with a run in the past. Mega-donor David Koch was a Libertarian Party vice-presidential candidate in 1980; Paychex founder Tom Golisano lost three independent bids for New York governor; and CNN founder Ted Turner has said he has “very seriously” considered presidential bids over the years. All three men, however, are in their mid- to late 70s. \nTo be sure, there are other considerations besides age that could cause these heavyweights to hesitate to follow in Trump’s footsteps. And, in some ways, this year’s Republican nominee may have made running for high office more difficult and less appetizing to the mega-wealthy. “After Trump, billionaires will think thrice about entering politics,” says Iowa State politics professor Steffen Schmidt, who points out that most would not enjoy the intense scrutiny of their personal and professional lives that Trump has endured. Depending on the outcome, Schmidt says, Trump’s brand could end up suffering terribly from this campaign. \nWill the scions of American industry, accustomed to getting their way on the playing fields of business, be willing to submit to such a rough-and-tumble sport? Or will they play it safe and remain on the sidelines? Maybe, like Trump, it will be a case of self-selection, and only the political billionaires with the biggest egos and the most bravado will make the jump. When the billionaire class sends its people, it may not deploy its very best. The magnates will send candidates who have lots of problems — the tax evaders, the narcissists, the gropers. And some, we assume, will be good people.",

Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz attends the 2016 Starbucks Partner Family Forum at Shangri-La Hotel on January 12 in Chengdu, China. Credit: VCG via Getty Images Most Popular \nStarbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz, who voiced his support for Hillary Clinton in September, reacted to the election results in a note to the coffee company's staff Wednesday. \nMr. Schultz, in a letter shared by the company, said he was stunned by the outcome and urged people to take care of each other. Related Stories Trump's Win Has Big Potential Impact on Marketers, Corona to AT&T \n\"As Americans, we must honor the democratic process. We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together,\" Mr. Schultz said in the message, which was posted online . \nThe thoughts were an extension of a letter shared on Sunday, two days before the election, when Mr. Schultz wrote \"I woke up this morning feeling a bit anxious about Tuesday's election. Regardless of the outcome, our nation will feel divided,\" in a message entitled \"The Promise of America.\" \nHere is the letter Mr. Schultz sent on Thursday: \nDear Partners, \nLast night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans – both Democrats and Republicans – I am stunned. \nWe cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season. \nAs Americans, we must honor the democratic process. We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together. \nWhether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice. Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores. \nWe can choose to answer the challenges of the day with kindness and compassion. We can choose to listen, to understand and to act with respect. We can choose to live by the values that reside in each of us, and honor our commitment to nurture the human spirit with love, and offer everyone in our stores and communities a place of inclusion and optimism. \nToday, I trust you, and I trust all that is good in our country. Let's take care of each other and the people in our lives. I believe we will each find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve. Together is where our collective power lies, as partners, and as Americans. \nI am so very proud to be your partner. \nOnward,",

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • Starbucks will be unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year with what look to be snowflakes and reindeer, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. The coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. Starbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. VIDEOS",

It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now   suggested boycotting the chain. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10. \nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.",

But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10. \nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.",

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) Posted: Wednesday, November 9, 2016 3:15 pm | Updated: 4:12 pm, Wed Nov 9, 2016. Snowflakes, Santa look to be back on Starbucks holiday cups Associated Press | \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10. \nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.",

(Photo: Eli Blumenthal, USA TODAY) \nNEW YORK -- It might not sound like that big of a deal, but Starbucks has rolled out the latest edition of what has become a tradition -- its holiday cup designs. \nDon't look now, but the holidays are almost upon us. And one way to tell, besides colder days and holiday decorations going, will be the colorful cups. Starbucks is bringing them on in a bid to spread some holiday cheer and to ring up sales. \nStarting Thursday. the Seattle-based coffee giant will begin serving its beverages in one of 13 “distinct cups” created by artists from around the world. \nPaper cups aren't usually the kind of thing that instill customer loyalty, but Starbucks has learned the hard way. When the company came out with its green pre-holiday cup last week, the Internet was outraged. Thinking it was a replacement for the famous red cup, users took to Twitter to voice their complaints. The uproar even made it into a segment on CBS' The Late Show with Stephen Colbert . \n\"The holidays don't start until you've had your first red cup at Starbucks, \" says Nancy Poznoff, Starbuck's vice president of marketing \nThe new cups are a twist on Starbucks usual red cup holiday design which feature a red background behind the Starbucks logo. \nAfter last year’s red cups inspired customers to draw on them, the company launched an Instagram campaign looking to encourage people to share their work with the world. In just eight days 1,200 designs poured in from 13 different countries. The company took 13 submissions and made them into this year’s cup collection, company officials say. The cups will be offered in all 25,000 Starbucks locations around the world. \nStarbucks new line of red cups. (Photo: Starbucks) \nIn addition to releasing the red cups on Thursday, the company will also be launching its annual \"buy one, share one\" promotion where those that buy a drink between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. will get a second one free. The promotion will run through Monday. \n\"I think they are emblematic of the relationship our customers have with our baristas,\" Poznoff says. about why the cups are so popular. \"And they're really the beacon of the holiday season.\" \nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "title": "STARBUCKS Schultz 'Stunned'...",
      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz Is ‘Stunned’ by Donald Trump’s Win \nStarbucks sbux CEO Howard Schultz has made no secret of his disdain for Donald Trump. \nIn a letter to staff on Wednesday, Schultz said he was gobsmacked by the president-elect’s victory but said Americans had to respect the results. \n“Like so many of our fellow Americans—both Democrats and Republicans—I am stunned,” Schultz wrote . “We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.” \nEchoing the conciliatory tone of Trump’s opponent, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton , and President Barack Obama in speeches Wednesday afternoon, Schultz said people needed to give Trump a chance to govern well. \nIn September, the politically outspoken Schultz endorsed Clinton for president , saying he remained optimistic about the country’s future, despite what he saw as an effort by politicians and the media to paint the nation with “cloudiness and despair.” Earlier in the year, he had decried the Republican primaries as “a circus.” \nIn his staff letter Wednesday, Schultz called on his employees to be kind with other people and to to “find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve.” \n\nThis election isn’t the first time Schultz waded into political territory at the risk of angering his clientele. A few years ago, he became a target of the gun lobby for asking gun owners to leave their weapons in their cars when coming to a Starbucks. And last year,Schultz quickly backed off an effort to have Starbucks baristas talk to customers about the state of race relations. The company itself has also been targeted for seemingly innocuous efforts like monochromatic coffee cups during the holiday season. \nBelow is Schultz’s letter in full: \nDear Partners, \nLast night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans – both Democrats and Republicans – I am stunned. \nWe cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season. \nAs Americans, we must honor the democratic process. We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together. \nWhether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice. Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores. \nWe can choose to answer the challenges of the day with kindness and compassion. We can choose to listen, to understand and to act with respect. We can choose to live by the values that reside in each of us, and honor our commitment to nurture the human spirit with love, and offer everyone in our stores and communities a place of inclusion and optimism. \nToday, I trust you, and I trust all that is good in our country. Let’s take care of each other and the people in our lives. I believe we will each find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve. Together is where our collective power lies, as partners, and as Americans. \nI am so very proud to be your partner. \nOnward,",

      "text": ". \nAs we enter November, the holiday season is right around the corner. \nWhich traditionally means Starbucks releases its holiday cup. But this year, it’s not just one design, but 13. \nThe company officially released all of the designs Wednesday and the cups will begin to be available Thursday. \nFor the first time as well, this year’s designs were created by 13 customers from six countries. \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nLast year, the company was the focus of controversy as some panned their plain red cups claiming they were ‘christmas-y’ enough. \nStarbucks also received mixed reviews last month over their green ‘unity’ cups . ©2016 by 10TV.com.

      "text": "Starbucks turns to customers for annual holiday cup designs By Joseph Pisani, AP Business Writer Posted: # Comments \nNEW YORK (AP)  Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. \nThe company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. \nOver the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nThe cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. Advertisement \nStarbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup  bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below  drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. \nThat controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nStarbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. \nOnce again, though, people took to social media to make it known  they wanted red cups.",

      "text": "11/10/16 12:24 am EST . \nStarbucks has responded to last year's red cup controversy with all the subtlety of an ice-packed snowball to the face. \nA year after taking plenty of holiday heat for producing plain red cups to celebrate the season, the coffee giant unveiled this year's red cup designs - all ten of them. \nStarbucks took input from creative coffee drinkers over the past year, asking for handmade designs to adorn this year's drinkware. The ten finalists come from all over the world, featuring classic and even slightly overdone wintertime images including snowy trees, reindeer, ornaments and Christmas lights. \nTo celebrate the correction of last year's gaffe, the chain is offering a \"buy one holiday drink, get one free to share\" promotion through Monday (November 14) from 2-5 p.m. each day (at participating stores). \nSo there you have it, coffee drinkers of the world. You got your wish. \nTimes ten. \nCollect them all, it will be December 26 before you know it. Filed under: ",

      "text": "Timeline on World Cup Violence NEW YORK (AP) -- Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. Over the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. The cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. Starbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup - bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below - drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. Thousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. That controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \"It's just a cup,\" he joked. Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. Once again, though, people took to social media to make it known - they wanted red cups.",

Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. Once again, though, people took to social media to make it known - they wanted red cups.",

Show Caption Previous Next \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will be unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year with what look to be snowflakes and reindeer, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. \nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.

Show Caption Previous Next NEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. Over the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. The cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. Starbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. Thousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. That controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \"It's just a cup,\" he joked. Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. Once again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) Joseph Pisani Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Previous Next NEW YORK (AP) — Instead of looking to its creative team, Starbucks turned to its latte-sipping customers to design its latest holiday red cups. The company asked people to post their designs on Instagram last December, and 1,200 ideas came in from customers who've made it clear on social media they care about the holiday cups Starbucks has brought out each year for nearly two decades. Over the next several months, company executives narrowed down the options to their favorites, Starbucks said Wednesday. They settled on 13 overall, which focus on traditional holiday themes like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. The cups will hit stores around the world Thursday, with eleven of them available in U.S. locations. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. The company declined to say if the customers were compensated for the designs. Starbucks' return to more overt holiday imagery comes after a tempest last year when a more subdued cup — bright red on top, shading to a darker cranberry below — drew criticism from some who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. Thousands of people sounded off on Twitter and other social networks. Donald Trump, now president-elect, even suggested perhaps people should boycott the chain. That controversy came as a surprise to the company, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the new designs were displayed. \"It's just a cup,\" he joked. Starbucks Corp. has released holiday cups every year since 1997. Last week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" It features a mosaic of more than 100 people, including a coffee farmer and barista. Once again, though, people took to social media to make it known — they wanted red cups. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "PICS: Starbucks' New Holiday Cups! Just now share \nStarbucks has unveiled 13 different holiday cups for this year that will start being available in stores starting today (November 10th). After some critics slamming Starbucks for having a plain red cup last year, claiming it was part of a supposed \"war on Christmas,\" this year's cups have images of things like snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, with the company saying Wednesday (November 9th) that it had narrowed them down from 1,200 designs that were received in all.

      "text": "Follow Us ® 2016 Bustle What Do The 2016 Starbucks Holiday Red Cups Look Like? You Have 13 Designs To Get Excited About This Year By Kaitlyn Wylde just now \nIf you were hoping to wake up today with a little bit of winter cheer, you're in luck — Starbucks' holiday red cups are back. And, once you see what the new Starbucks red cups look like , you'll have something to look forward to on your next coffee run. As you know, every year Starbucks switches from its standard white cup to its once-a-year red cup around the holiday time. But this year, for some extra special festivity, Starbucks is releasing 13 different cups, each with their own design. \nAs a part of a holiday cup design contest that began last year, artists from around the world participated in a project that allowed them to share their artistic conceptualization of the holidays, using the cup as their canvas. Winners of the contest came from six different countries around the world including U.S., Canada, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, and Russia, proving that yes, everyone around the world loves Starbucks and has some serious holiday cheer. \nAnd if you're the kind of person who likes to take that annual \"red cups are here\" selfie, you've got 13 different options to pose with. The designs range from traditional holiday lights to whimsical birch trees and every reindeer and snow scene in-between. Here's a sneak peak at what you have to look forward to this holiday season at Starbucks: Those Classic Holiday Lights, Though \nThis cup was designed by Maria Lauren of New York, N.Y. She tells Starbucks she “was looking around my home for inspiration and when I looked at my tree I thought about how beautiful the lights were.” The iconic decoration looks like a festive vine in this festive depiction. Some Good Ol' Reindeer Magic \nSamantha, a hair stylist and hobby artist from Bromell, Pennsylvania, created this wintry and wonderful woodland deer sketch while her daughter was napping! Sometimes the best doodles come from the moments we're not even trying to create them. It's Totally Snowflake Sweater Weather \nAlisa is from St. Petersburg, Russia and was inspired to create her design while sipping on a Gingerbread Latte. She merely began doodling on her cup and the design came to her. *Goes to Starbucks to get Gingerbread Latte to find inspiration* = me RN. A Placid Winter Forest Scene \nBronwyn, a college student from Moscow, Idaho , was inspired to create her design after a December hike along her favorite trail. Seeing the stark contrast of the white snow on the dark branches was enough to get her creative juices flowing for this awesome design. Birds And Flowers \nThis cup was designed by Florencia, who lives in Bandung, Indonesia. Florencia wants people to know that \"The magnolia symbolizes friends and love and the hedge sparrow represents faith and creativity. I hope that my design inspires people to joyfully love life and be creative, even when faced with tough times.” Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy \nThis cup's designer, Anna, might live in Canada, but she was born in the Soviet Union and was trained in petrykivka , an ancient Ukrainian decorative folk art that inspired this cup. A Quiet Birch Forest \nChloe, from Plainfield, Illinois, created this cup with home in mind . When she thinks of winter, she thinks of snow-covered birch trees. The Candy Cane Can \nJennifer from Seattle created this cup with a lot of whimsy in mind. Inspired by the geometric swirling botany of wreaths , Jennifer mixed in some candy canes and seasonal shapes to make this look as natural as possible. Deck The Halls \nThis cup was created by Anz Soza, from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. She's a long-time Starbucks cup decorator , having drawn nearly 100 designs in past holiday seasons. Now she can share her ornament patterns with everyone. Graphic Design \nThese beautiful and trippy graphic swirls were created by Erica from Markham, Ontario, Canada. She, too, is a long-time Starbucks cup doodler ! Winter Blooms \nChristina from Bakersfield, California chose to draw some winterized poinsettias , which from far away look like beautiful intricate snowflakes. Ho! Ho! Ho! \nThis picturesque iconic scene was created by Eun Joo from Daejeon, South Korea. To describe her design inspiration , she says “There are many people — like different patterns of overlapping circles — but everyone can have happy memories with a cup of coffee at Starbucks.” Don't Forget That Iced Coffee \nThis wooden wreath was created by Tracy from Los Angeles, California. Her design really comes to life with a full glass of iced cold coffee behind it! \nCheck out all the cups at your local Starbucks starting Nov. 10. The cups will be available in more than 25,000 Starbucks stores across 75 different countries, and will last through the holiday seasons or while supplies last. \nImages: Courtesy of Starbucks ",

Associated Press Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Red paper cups, for hot drinks, are stacked next to plastic cups at a Starbucks coffee shop in the Pike Place Market, Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2015, in Seattle. It's as red as Santa's suit, a poinsettia blossom or a loud Christmas sweater. Yet Starbucks' minimalist new holiday coffee cup has set off complaints that the chain is making war on Christmas. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) \nNEW YORK (AP) – Starbucks will be unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year with what look to be snowflakes and reindeer, after last year’s more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. \nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. Share this: ",

      "text": "1. A woman from Snohomish shared this heartwarming story on Facebook. She was working at Starbucks this week, and the coffee shop was pretty empty except for a table with a mother and her three young children, one of them wearing a spiderman sweatshirt. Well two soldiers (Edgar Gonzalez and Pedro Cordoba) walked into the shop in all of their gear and the kids went silent, in awe of the men. So after placing their order, one of the soldiers went over to the boy in spiderman gear and they talked for a bit (about their favorite super heroes) and then both soldiers gave the boy the American flag patches from their uniform. The mom gushed her thanks & the boy even stood to do his best salute. The soldiers said that they find doing kind things helps them alleviate the stress and anxiety they’ve experienced, post-deployment. (Q13) \nThis embed is invalid\n2. This presidential election was a tough one, and people are looking for a break. A lot of travel companies are offering discounts for those who need a good post-election “detox. Everyone from airlines to hotels are taking advantage. Spirit Airlines is even offering a 75 percent discount on any flights to Canada. According to reports, one-way flights to Canada jumped 133 percent after the election, compared to the last four weeks. (Mashable) \n3. Snap, the recently-rebranded company formerly known as Snapchat, announced in September that it will roll out camera-equipped sunglasses called Spectacles. But consumers won’t be able to buy the glasses in stores, or even online. Instead, they’ll get them from giant, futuristic vending machines called “Snapbots” that will be placed in a rotating roster of U.S. locations throughout the fall, with the first machine popping up in Venice Beach. In a nod to the limited life span of Snap’s namesake self-deleting image app, the machines will only be available for about a day before they’re moved to a new location. The company will add the locations of the bots to a map on its home page 24 hours before one lands. The glasses, which record 10 second of video at a time and send the recording to a user’s phone, cost $129.99.

In a picture posted on Instagram yesterday, Hill had her bandaged foot propped up and she was reading the December issue of “InStyle,” featuring Dolly Parton and Reese Witherspoon. Hill explained in the caption, “Catching up on some reading while I recover from a foot surgery that I finally decided to have from a past injury. Gettin’ stage ready for 2017.” Tim and Faith will launch their Soul2Soul World Tour on April 7th in New Orleans.",

Well this time they’ve put a twist on their “red cup.”\nStarting today you can purchase one of the 13 distinct holiday cups that feature snowflakes, reindeers, pine trees and more!!\nAccording to USA Today , in addition to purchasing your holiday cup the company will be launching its annual “buy one share one” promotion. People that buy a drink between 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. will get a second one free.\nThe promotion will run through Monday.\nWe crafted coffee. You made it art. Cups warm a hand, beauty warms the heart. #RedCups pic.twitter.com/3QmdvoNM0S \n— Starbucks Coffee (@Starbucks) November 10, 2016 \n\n",

They came from France!\" he said. The CEO recalled that the young Michel et Augustin employees arrived at the Seattle headquarters with a fresh batch of cookies. \n\nGetty Images Starbucks Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz. \"I have such a big heart for any entrepreneurial person that's trying to do something against all odds,\" he continued. \"And I get a call saying, 'Howard, it's a crazy thing. These two people have arrived from France and all they want to do is give you a sample of their cookie.'\n\"How could I say no to that? It's impossible. So I left my office, I ran to the front desk … and I fell in love with these two French kids.\" \nSchultz brought them into his office and tasted the cookies with a few colleagues. \n\"Everybody liked [the cookies],\" he told Sorkin. \"And I said [to the couriers], 'You know what? This is your day. You are going to have your cookies in every Starbucks store in 30 days.' And that's what happened.\" \nSeems like 80% of success really is just showing up ... with cookies.",

      "title": "Do you like Starbucks' new red cups?",
      "text": "Starbucks just revealed 13 different designs for its annual holiday red cup, following last year's controversial effort to create a more inclusive cup . The designs were picked from over 1,200 individual submissions across 13 different countries. The cups are far more festive and \"Christmas-y\" this year, but with so many variations, some think the new cups lack a memorable design. Others preferred the simplicity of last year's cups. What do you think? Vote below! PERSPECTIVES\nThe cups were designed by 13 different women and are far more festive than last year's cup. It's the first time in 24 years that Starbucks will offer more than one type of holiday cup.\nWhy Starbucks' Christmas Cups Are Special This Year :\n\"This year, [...] we decided to do something quite different,\" said CEO Howard Schultz to a crowd at the official launch in Manhattan on Wednesday. \"With everything that's going on in the world, and everything that's going on in our country, we have a lot to be thankful for.\" Some java junkies love the new cups and think Starbucks finally nailed the festive look. What's not to love?\nI'm honestly in love with Starbucks' #RedCups 😍\n— t. 🎌 (@bbydoll_tay) November 10, 2016",

      "text": "Instagram Downloads \nSingles' Day in China has become one of the world's biggest shopping days, and today (November 11) Starbucks is marking the occasion with exclusive merchandise and a special beverage in China. \nIt's believed the Singles' Day tradition originated in China in the early 1990s when a group of Nanjing University students organized activities for those tired of the loneliness and boredom of single life. The holiday has evolved significantly since that time and is now a special occasion for all people to enjoy. Observed each year on November 11, consumers are offered deals through sites including Alibaba’s Tmall and Taobao on Singles' Day. Exclusive Merchandise \n“To give our customers more options to share their gestures of love, or as a reward for themselves after a year of hard work, we have designed and curated a series of special Starbucks merchandise. The items are available exclusively on the Starbucks Tmall e-Flagship store,” said Molly Liu, vice president, Digital Venture, Starbucks China. \nStarbucks Coffee Brewing Gift Sets: Two Starbucks Coffee Brewing Gift Sets curated specially for the home and on-the-go Starbucks customer. \n\n11.11 Starbucks Cards: Four exclusively-designed limited-time Starbucks gift cards packaged with a special 11.11-themed card carrier. \n\nMy Starbucks Rewards Cards: A limited-edition, metal and crystal My Starbucks Rewards card available in two colors, champagne and silver. It is paired with a Starbucks Moleskin Notebook in red or black. \nSingles' Day Beverage \nStarbucks locations across China will mark Singles' Day with the Cocoa Java Mocha beverage, offered exclusively on November 11. Premiering for the first time in the country, this beverage features a rich and refreshing blend of dark mocha, sweet caramel and warm hazelnut, punctuated with chocolatey mini-cubes. It can be served either hot or as a Frappuccino® blended beverage. \n ",

      "text": "  Favorite \nListen, I’m no snob when it comes to fast food. Starbucks knows who I am by my frequent mobile order, and I might as well apply at Chick-fil-A for the corporate discount. When the CFA line is too long, I’ve been known to swing through the McDonald’s drive-thru for some all-day breakfast sandwiches and those delicious, greasy fries that are completely worth breaking out over. With that said, there are a few places even I won’t touch when it comes to my fake, processed fast food order. Fish sandwiches get a pass, as well as any eggs that come in the shape of a square. However, there’s now one new item that you couldn’t pay me to touch with a ten-foot pole, and that’s the new Nutella burger at McDonald’s. \nNow available at McDonald’s Italy locations is the “Sweety con Nutella” which is literally just a giant wad of Nutella sandwiched between a hamburger bun, and no, I’m not kidding. If the photo of this menu item doesn’t turn your stomach, I’m honestly not sure what will. Eating a giant gob of Nutella by itself is bad enough, but spreading it on a hamburger bun so you can shovel it down faster? I’m not sure why they’re testing this in Italy instead of in the States because that’s probably one of the most American things I’ve ever heard. \nThe strangest part about all of this is that my repulsion is apparently not the most common response when told about the Nutella burger. McDonald’s Facebook post announcing its arrival has over 50,000 shares, and when I pitched this to the PGP writing staff, they all seemed unbelievably enthusiastic about it as well. While I could maybe see myself ordering this in a seriously drunk and/or hungover state, I doubt I’d ever willingly place this order in a state of fully functioning mental capacity. For now, I’ll be glad this isn’t a menu item at my disposal at the moment, but for my friends across the pond, pick one of these up the next time you want to consume 10000% of your daily fat in 30 seconds, and let us know how it goes, ok?",

Show Caption Previous Next \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will be unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year with what look to be snowflakes and reindeer, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. \nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.

That provided the Winston-Salem, N.C.-based operator a 133-percent jump in market share compared with an average Tuesday. \n• Starbucks , which offered a free tall coffee. The Seattle-based coffeehouse operator saw a 7.9-percent lift in market share compared with an average Tuesday. \n• Chick-fil-A , which offered a free chicken sandwich at a number of its 1,400 locations. The Atlanta-based operator had a 7.8-percent lift in market share compared with an average Tuesday. \nLess successful at driving visits, according to Sense360’s data, were: \n• White Castle , which offered a free gallon of iced tea with the purchase of a Crave Case of 30 Original Sliders. “This did nothing, as they actually had a lower market share on Election Day than they average on Tuesday,” Portnoy said of the Columbus, Ohio-based quick-service operator. \n• Firehouse Subs , which offered a free medium drink. The Jacksonville, Fla.-based operator saw “no lift in market share versus an average Tuesday,” Portnoy said. \nNote: Data represents times, not overall comparative traffic \n“It does look like there was a slight decline in QSR traffic on Nov. 8, but I can't say for sure just yet until we get in the last trickles of data,” Portnoy said Friday. “The rest of the analysis is on a relative basis or looking at market share, so we have enough data to conclusively present that.” \nContact Ron Ruggless at",

      "text": "Creative inspiration \nWhether you like them or hate them, you gotta admit the Starbucks holiday cups are marketing gold. Last year, their red cups sent people over the edge when they ditched the traditional Christmas imagery. This year, they went green (literally), causing another round of outrage with their unity cups. And now they’ve pulled an official “haha, j/k” and announced their “real” 2016 holiday cups, which bring Christmas back in full force. 2015 holiday cups 2016 unity cups 2016 holiday cups \nA holiday marketing campaign can help keep your brand in the hearts and minds of consumers at a time of year that’s full of cheer, joy, and—lets face it—lots of consumerism. Here are our top 3 ways to keep your brand shining through the holiday season: 1. Winter colors — \nPsychologists have done loads of research into the complexities of how human beings respond to color. Branding experts then take this information and attempt to make it actionable. One common endeavor has been to define a color palette for each of the four seasons. Many “winter” schemes are quite intriguing, and present interesting alternatives to the typically saccharine holiday palette. \nAccording to Dose of Tonik , the above mood board (left) represents the winter-specific qualities of “cool, strong, clear colors,” replete with “luxury and drama,” “power and confidence.” This color scheme could ring in the holidays for many a luxury brand. The Brand Stylist has a similar characterization for winter. Its colors are “bright, intense, clear, cool;” general attributes include drama, opulence and precision. They offer the above right image as an illustration. Both of these schemes pair cool, dark colors with a pop of bright, warm red, pink or orange. \nWant to run a holiday marketing campaign for your brand? Consider choosing colors for your collateral that are luxurious and dramatic, and highlight them with a rich, warm accent. This will evoke the feelings of long nights and warm hearths. \nNeed some more inspiration? We’ve got you covered. Holiday packaging — \nStarbucks isn’t the only company to get its packaging into the holiday spirit. Indeed, many others have realized the potential for seasonal winter branding to establish emotional connections with customers. Refreshing your packaging not only connects with buyers’ nostalgia around the season, but also allows you to create perceived scarcity, either around a limited holiday release of a product (à la a holiday flavor), or simply around a beautiful and unique box (which buyers may keep and use even after the product inside has been consumed, keeping your brand top-of-mind). Clever ads — \nIt probably won’t come as news to you that the link between Christmas and shopping is holding strong. Facing a sea of mostly obvious, sentimental holiday-themed advertisements, some design firms have taken to a more wry, humorous approach. You can make your brand stand out by playing on holiday tropes or creating visual puns, thereby positioning yourself as a seasonal mainstay that customers will remember. But you don’t have to take our word for it… \nA true classic at this point is Jim Beam’s intelligently simple and strikingly typographic print ad: \nVisual puns are also popular. While christmas tree cognates are a dime a dozen, we find this Adidas effort particularly well done: \nThe subtle imagery in this ad by AB InBev, the beer distributor, eluded us the first few times around: \nEven if you choose to be a bit (tastefully) naughty with your holiday marketing campaigns, you can position your brand for nice rewards. The key to remember is to be true to the season and true to your brand. Find the connection between the joy and nostalgia of the season and your own brand values and you’ll find your proverbial stocking stuffed with the rewards. If you’re lucky, maybe you’ll find the next Starbucks’ red cup under your tree or menorah. What is your approach to holiday branding?

Starbucks coffee drinkers and fans alike started to doodle on the cups — and the 2016 designs were born! \nThis year the Starbucks red cups will feature designs created by customers with 13 distinct cups — and they include Candy Cane, Lights, Ornaments, Reindeer, Trees, Love and Joy, and more. \nCheck out some other designs in the promo video below!

      "text": "  A barista pours steamed milk into a red paper cup while making an espresso drink at a Starbucks coffee shop in the Pike Place Market, Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2015, in Seattle. It's as red as Santa's suit, a poinsettia blossom or a loud Christmas sweater. Yet Starbucks' minimalist new holiday coffee cup has set off complaints that the chain is making war on Christmas. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) \nNEW YORK (AP) – Starbucks will be unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year with what look to be snowflakes and reindeer, after last year’s more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. \nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.  ",

      "text": " 05 AM EST Real Estate Agent Matthew Jehle Joins Keller Williams PRWeb \nWorking at Starbucks as a shift supervisor, waiting tables 5 days a week, and performing as a DJ for weddings on the weekends. This was Matthew's reality back in 2014 and 2015. He did this all without the luxury of a car. \nIt was all about wanting to save as much money as possible with what he knew he could achieve. \n\"I knew that one of my biggest expenses in starting my life over again would be a car, so I chose not to have one.\" \nAfter suffering from depression and feeling very lost, Matthew found guidance from a self help book. Matthew wrote down his goals and set the bar high for himself. Apart from wanting to write a novel about his late fathers life, one of his breakthrough goals was to become a real estate agent. For years Matthew was able to save half of his income every month, an average of one thousand dollars. Matthew also changed the way he spoke and the way he thought about life. He began to ask himself, \"What do I have to offer this world?\" It was this question that sparked his path to becoming more grounded and motivated on working towards his goals. \n\"My mission is to use my personality and creativity to educate and inspire others to freely express their talents in a colorful synchronization of love and peace.\" \nHe came to a realization that if he could control his mind, he could control his surroundings and the people he wanted to work with. Well, it paid off and Matthew got his big first break. He received an assistant management position at a mortgage office and learned how the loan process worked. Matthew also got himself a car and commuted down to Irvine from Woodland Hills for his new job, and for seven months he worked diligently and studied for his real estate license. After Matthew finished his exam he walked to his car with the results, his heart was pumping with nervousness as he opened the letter. It said, \"Congratulations on passing your real estate exam\". He read this line three times to make sure he wasn't reading it incorrectly. Matthew had been studying and working so hard for this moment. \n\"I called my girlfriend first with tears in my eyes, and then I called my big brother to tell him the news. I have my brother to thank for my opportunities.\" \nIt was shortly after this that Matthew bumped into a friend at the gym and told him the good news. Matthew's friend referred him to someone that was an agent with Keller Williams and helped them get connected. Now Matthew is working with the number one brokerage in the world and continues to set his goals high. If you or a friend are looking to buy a house or sell a house, contact Matthew, he would be more than happy to represent you. \nMatthew Jehle",

      "title": "Starbucks gives us 13 reasons to celebrate the holiday season",
      "text": "By Karen Graham 10 mins ago in Business Starbucks learned their lesson last year - Don't fix something if it's not broken. Instead of the plain red holiday cup they tried to foist on the public last year, we are being treated to 13 different designs on the iconic red cups this year. And not only are the holiday cups back, but they seem to be redder than ever. And while there are 12 days of Christmas, the coffee chain has gone one better, creating 13-holiday cups, each with a special design remembering the season. A few days ago, Starbucks debuted 10 of the hot coffee vessels, each one featuring unique designs from customers around the world. There are holiday lights, Santas flying through the sky with reindeer, snowflakes, candy canes, ornaments and other iconic symbols of the holiday, reports the New York Daily News . Many Starbucks customers weren't fans of 2015's subtle red ombre cup design. (Courtesy Starbucks) Starbucks Last year, Digital Journal reported that Starbucks choose their holiday season cup to embrace the simplicity of the season. But the cup's minimalist design was questioned by a lot of customers because snowflakes or other simple holiday designs were missing. On their website, though, Starbucks said, \"It was designed to give people a piece of calm.” The one good thing to come out of the social media backlash over the plain cups last year was that Starbucks had an epitome. Many baristas noticed that customers were marking their cups with holiday designs of their own, and this was enough to get the ball rolling. One of 2016's new red cups titled \"Loved and Joy\" designed by a customer in Toronto, Canada. Starbucks Last December, Starbucks asked people to post their designs on Instagram. Over 1,200 ideas came in from customers who made it clear on social media they really cared very deeply about the iconic holiday cups. It took several months to whittle down the entries, but finally, 13 designs were chosen, with 11 of them to be released in the U.S. All the red cups with white designs are for hot drinks, and there is also a clear cup for iced drinks with a wreath wrapped around the mermaid logo. Fox News says the company declined to say if the customers who created the chosen designs were compensated. Hopefully, they will get free Starbucks coffee drinks, anyway.",

      "text": "travel Share this article \nAh, Starbucks. A staple part of most university student’s lives. Whether it’s a hard core double espresso the morning after a night out, or a cavity-inducing chocolate Frappuccino whilst basking in the early summer sun, we all gratefully part with our cash as soon as we see the oddly drawn mermaid inside the green logo. However, Starbucks, whilst it does seem to be everywhere, is not actually the same everywhere. Whilst we eagerly rejoice the return of the seasonal red cups, here are some of the top things us Brits are missing out on: \nCaramel Waffle Cone Frappuccino - USA \nThis carnival delight blends waffle cone-flavoured syrup with dark caramel sauce before topping it off with whipped cream and real waffle pieces! However, with this American treat weighing in at 510 calories for a large, it’s probably best we leave this one to our friends across the pond. \nToffeedoodle Cookie – Canada \nDerived from the ‘Snickerdoodle’, this baked treat is made with rich butter toffee before being topped with cinnamon and sugar. Meanwhile, we make do with the original milk choc chip. At least we have the nutella-stuffed oats cookie, so we don’t feel *too* hard done by. \nChocolate Tuxedo Cake - Malaysia \nYes, you read that right. They are serving up giant slabs of this decadent delight that combines mousse, cream and brownie over in Southeast Asia, alongside their standard lattes and cappuccinos. Who’s planning their next trip right now to include a visit to one of these chain stores? \nGreen Tea Latte – Hong Kong \nTo go alongside their tradition with incorporating green tea into every other western product (think KitKats and Oreos), Hong Kong also mix it into their lattes. Combine this with their famous red cups around Christmas time and you’ve got a visually perfect holiday treat. \nMacarons – Australia \nHowever bizarre this may seem, down under they offer a range of this French originating light and chewy confection. Available in raspberry, chocolate or salted caramel, they’re the perfect little accompaniment to your morning coffee run - and something the UK Starbucks really needs to introduce. \nWith more than 24,000 Starbucks stores spanning 70 countries, this coffee company of course wants to tailor their treats to suit each customer base. However, we’d just appreciate it if they could possibly start selling pretty much everything listed here (and the rest) in the UK stores. Thank you! \nEdited by: Amy Hawthorne",

      "text": "Starbucks Red Cup Share this article \nLast week, if you went into a Starbucks, your coffee, tea or hot chocolate likely came in a green cup. People were freaking out, wondering why Starbucks’ holiday cups were green instead of their usual red. Part of the cup’s design includes drawings of people, and some were shocked that they did not include religious figures. \nFor the past few years, Starbucks cups have caused controversy. Last year and the year before, the cups were plain red—no wintery designs like the cups of prior years. When they had the designs, people complained that they were \"too Christmasy.” But when there weren’t any designs, they were “too boring.” And now green cups have confused everyone; just why were they green? Why aren’t they green anymore? \nI went into a Starbucks and the barista told me that these were not the holiday cups. They were simply meant to create unity the week before the presidential election. I think it’s a nice idea; it’s inclusive, secular and not offensive in any way. However, in such a stressful time, I feel it is unfortunate that many people did not recognize this message. I wasn’t sure exactly what the green cups meant, or what they were, but I could tell they spread a nice message and with a really nice design. \nI am very sad that a cup could create such controversy when there were so many larger issues that we should have been worrying about. People were busy getting annoyed over the cups, but they had no idea Trump would win the election. There are protests about the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock, and people still got annoyed about cups. These cups were meant to create unity, not inspire arguments. \nI don’t understand why these cups have such a pattern of creating dissent. Even though it’s not an extreme issue, even the little things count, and in a small way this contributes to the conflicts going on in our country. I think it’s so sad that something meant to create unity and kindness pulled people apart. The cup controversy reveals that there is so much dissent in this country that people get upset over something so small and well-intentioned. \nThe holiday cups, which were released on November 10, are red, but they have several different designs—designs that people invented and drew by hand. This is Starbucks’ most inclusive, kind and creative effort yet, and I admire this immensely. You Might Also Enjoy",

      "text": "Posted by Claire Thompson \nTarget : Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks \nGoal : Demand Starbucks keep its word on making all cups reusable, recyclable, or compostable as soon as possible. \nProtesters in Seattle recently gathered just a few blocks from the original Starbucks in Pike Place Market to demand recyclable cups. The activists, from Stand, a forest advocacy group, are calling on Starbucks to recommit to its 2008 goals of making 100 percent of cups recyclable and serving 25 percent of its beverages in reusable mugs or tumblers. \nThe paper used to produce coffee cups must be made waterproof by lining it with some type of wax or plastic (Starbucks uses a thin lining of food-grade polyethylene plastic). It’s this lining that complicates the recycling process. A solution would be to switch to PLA (polylactic acid, a compostable plastic) or some type of heat-resistant wax so that the cups could be safely composted. \nConsumer preference presents another problem. Starbucks serves about 4 billion disposable paper cups every year, despite promises and attempts to incentivize reusable containers. Starbucks does provide mugs for in-store coffee drinkers, and also offers a 10-cent discount for customers who opt for a reusable tumbler. However, the single-use coffee cup remains the default. \nSo, what more can Starbucks do? If the company is truly committed to advancing sustainability, a good step would be re-framing language in stores to catch customers’ attention. For instance, making it a policy to ask customers at the register whether they’ll be needing a to-go cup, instead of simply defaulting to this option. Baristas could also ask if customers would like to purchase a reusable tumbler, and be sure to communicate the benefits of using one at Starbucks. Starbucks can, and should, to more to improve its business model on behalf of the environment. Sign the petition to tell Starbucks CEO to get serious about reducing waste and influencing customer preferences to do the same. \n  Mr. Schultz, \nI am writing to ask Starbucks to recommit to its 2008 goals of making all cups recyclable or compostable, and aiming for 25 percent of beverages to be served in reusable containers. I understand that there are obstacles to these measures, but I believe your company can and should hold itself to a standard of sustainability leadership. \nRecyclable and compostable options do exist, and Starbucks should be able to use these. A U.K. inventor has developed a coffee cup, dubbed Green Your Cup, in which the waterproof plastic liner separates cleanly from its paper shell, so that both pieces may be recycled without the need for special technology. Alternatively, in areas where municipal compost is available, using PLA (a compostable plastic) or wax and encouraging consumers to compost the cups could be effective. \nWith regards to reusable containers, I believe there is more Starbucks could do to influence consumer preference in this area. We have already seen that consumers can be weaned off of plastic shopping bags and water bottles, and to-go cups may be the next step. For customers who are carrying out, instituting a practice of asking how they would like their coffee (have they brought their own tumbler, would they like to purchase a reusable tumbler, or will they be needing a paper cup) could remind customers that they have options. It would also be helpful to remind people that there is a discount incentive for bringing a reusable mug. \nStarbucks prides itself on sustainability initiatives, and I hope that this is one where the company can have a reason to be proud. I urge you to transition as soon as possible to 100 percent recyclable or compostable cups, and institute new practices to encourage reusable options. \nSincerely,",

      "text": "Save Money! Make your Own Starbucks Spinach Feta Wrap November 14, 2016 Print Recipe \nStarbucks Spinach Feta Wrap is a great breakfast that you are going to love. This can be found on one of the Starbucks coffee shops, or you can make one at home. \nWho doesn’t love to grab breakfast out and enjoy a great cup of coffee? Sometimes I really like to treat myself with a coffee and breakfast sandwich. It’s hard to find a breakfast sandwich that is healthy and tastes good. Starbucks knows how to make a great breakfast sandwich, and if you are looking for a protein packed breakfast this will be the one you want to try. \nThis sandwich is made with egg whites, spinach, feta cheese and tomatoes inside a whole wheat wrap, then toast it to perfection. Vegetarian and protein-rich, it’s a great way to start your breakfast. You can find whole wheat wraps in your grocery store, if you can’t find them, you can use whole wheat tortillas. I have even found tasty gluten free options as well, so if you need to go gluten free you may want to pick up one of those. \nStarbucks makes their sandwich with egg whites, you could use a whole egg if you like, it’s really up to you. Sometimes I buy cartons of egg whites and pour a couple of tablespoons of egg whites and combine 1 whole egg together when I want volume but I don’t want a lot of calories. You may want to try this. When I make this sandwich I like to use a small non-stick skillet. \nI hope you give this great breakfast option a try. You may want to make several up and heat them up during the week and enjoy on your commute. \nLove Starbucks? Try these treats!",

      "text": "This Is Starbucks' Plan to Get Even More of Your Coffee Dollars newsfeedback@fool.com (Jeremy Bowman) 0 \nMore than a decade ago, Starbucks' (NASDAQ: SBUX) ubiquity was often the butt of jokes. The Onion wrote that a Starbucks had opened in the bathroom of an existing Starbucks, and comedian Lewis Black said he had seen the end of the world -- a Starbucks across the street from another Starbucks. \nThough it seems that the leading coffee chain long ago reached cultural saturation, it keeps finding new ways to grow. The company's taking over China, where CEO Howard Schultz said he expects there to one day be more stores than in the U.S. It's grown profits through its channel development segment, which includes consumer products such as K-cups and bagged coffee, and it continues to find new ways to expand its footprint even in its home market. Its partnerships with Target (NYSE: TGT) , for example, now has 1,300 Starbucks cafes inside its stores. The company is also licensing its brand in places like college campuses and expanding to new neighborhoods that it might have avoided earlier in its history. The menu at a Starbucks Reserve bar in New York. Image source: Author photo. \nNow Starbucks is undertaking a novel strategy to attract even more customers to its cafes. It's begun fragmenting its brand, offering Express stores for on-the-go customers and higher-end Reserve cafes that have a luxurious ambiance and an additional menu. It's what Schultz calls the premiumization of the Starbucks experience. The Reserve cafes are an extension of the Starbucks Reserve Roastery, the first of which opened two years ago in Seattle. Starbucks goes upscale \nDiscussing the Reserve brand on the recent earnings call, Schultz noted that the response to the Seattle Roastery has been especially strong as comparable sales jumped 24% last year, and the average transaction has been more than four times that of a typical Starbucks cafe. The roastery has also served as a lab for developing new drinks such as Nitro, a cold-brewed coffee made with nitrogen, which gives it an \"ultra-creamy texture,\" and Starbucks' own version of affogato, the Italian combination of espresso and gelato. \nFor Starbucks investors, however, the biggest impact of the Roasteries is likely to be their support of a new chain of Reserve cafes. Schultz said he expected those stores to deliver double the profits of a traditional Starbucks store, representing a \"significant new growth opportunity for the company domestically and around the world.\" \nThe company hopes to open up 1,000 or more Reserve stores and add Reserve bars to 20% or more of existing Starbucks locations. While Starbucks won't open any Reserve cafes until next spring, it has already added Reserve bars to a handful of locations, most of which are in New York. A selection of Reserve coffees at the Reserve bar. Image source: Author photo. \nOn a recent visit, I saw a Starbucks that seemed to borrow from a classy hotel bar rather than the typical cafe. Leather banquettes and chairs offered customers cozy places to sit. Baristas came around to tables offering water and other beverages. Walls were decorated in a gold palette, adding to the upscale theme, and at the Reserve bar customers could order drinks including a smoked butterscotch latte and a selection of Nitro cold brew beverages. Never standing still \nPart of the reason why Starbucks has been able to overcome the old stigma of oversaturation is its constant innovation. The company has leveraged digital payments like no other retailer. 21% of U.S. sales are made through the Starbucks app, and 6% of domestic transactions are through Mobile Order & Pay, which allows customer to come in and pick up their orders seamlessly. \nStarbucks has boosted its food offerings with the acquisition of La Boulange, and recently teamed with high-end Italian bakery Princi to supply its Reserve Roasteries and cafes. The company has also extended its platform through Starbucks Evenings, which offer wine, beer, and tapas to hundreds of stores. Similarly, it has extended its consumer packaged goods business with products like K-cups, Via instant coffee, and the Verismo single-cup brewing system. \nThe Reserve cafes should be a powerful addition to that innovation pipeline, as they will allow the company to continue penetrating mature markets and expanding its profit margin in the process. \nAt the end of 2014, Starbucks outlined a goal of growing revenue from $16 billion in 2014 to $30 billion in 2019. Two years in, the company seems well on its way to that goal after hitting $21.3 billion in fiscal 2016. The Reserve brand is a key component of that growth along with mobile commerce, store format diversification, and global and channel expansion. \nWhile much of the domestic restaurant industry suffers under a \"restaurant recession,\" innovations like the Reserve brand have made Starbucks consistently one of the top performers in the industry. Even as the company has expanded to more than 25,000 stores worldwide, it should continue finding new ways to grow. 5 charts that predict the Fed's intentions on interest-rate hikes \nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Starbucks \nDonald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

      "text": "By David Emery Updated August 14, 2016 . \nA viral message circulating since May 2004 accuses Starbucks of refusing to donate coffee to U.S. Marines on the grounds that the company has taken a stand against the Iraq war \"and anyone in it.\" This viral rumor is false. Assessment of the Starbucks Coffee Donation \nIt's unclear whether Starbucks ever actually refused to donate coffee to U.S. Marines who asked for it, but if they did it wasn't because they don't support the war and anyone in it, as claimed. Starbucks' company policy restricts giving corporate donations to beneficiaries that fall under the definition of \"public charities,\" which the military does not. Moreover, Starbucks as a company has not at any time taken a stand for or against the Iraq War. \nMarine Sgt. Howard C. Wright, who authored the original email in May 2004, issued a subsequent statement in which he took back his words and apologized: Almost 5 months ago I sent an email to you, my faithful friends. I did a wrong thing that needs to be cleared up. I heard by word of mouth about how Starbucks said they didn't support the war and all. I was having enough of that kind of talk and didn't do my research properly like I should have. This is not true. Starbucks supports men and women in uniform. They have personally contacted me and I have been sent many copies of their company's policy on this issue. So I apologize for this quick and wrong letter that I sent out to you. \nIn its own official response to the rumor, Starbucks explains that while the company has \"the deepest respect and admiration for U.S. military personnel,\" corporate policy prohibits direct donations to U.S. troops because the military doesn't fall under the strict definition of a public charity. Individual employees are free to donate their weekly pounds of take-home coffee, however, and according to Starbucks' statement many have done so. \nOn a related note, a 2007 variant of this rumor claims that wiener manufacturer Oscar Mayer refused to supply hot dogs to U.S. Marines. Starbucks Coffee Donation Email \nHere's sample email text about the Starbucks viral rumor, contributed by D. Fuller on July 22, 2004: \nPlease pass this along to anyone you know; this needs to get out in the open. \nRecently Marines over in Iraq supporting this country in OIF wrote to Starbucks because they wanted to let them know how much they liked their coffee and try to score some free coffee grounds. Starbucks wrote back telling the Marines thanks for their support in their business, but that they don't support the war and anyone in it and that they won't send them the coffee. \nSo as not to offend them we should not support in buying any Starbucks products. As a War vet and writing to you patriots I feel we should get this out in the open. I know this War might not be very popular with some folks, but that doesn't mean we don't support the boys on the ground fighting street to street and house to house for what they and I believe is right. If you feel the same as I do then pass this along, or you can discard it and I'll never know. Thanks very much for your support to me, and I know you'll all be there again here soon when I deploy once more. \nSemper Fidelis,",

      "title": "Worried About Starbucks? Try This Approach (SBUX)",
      "text": "Another Way to Play SBUX (SBUX) By Dan Moskowitz | November 15, 2016 — 7:24 PM EST \nInvestor and analyst fears are mounting on Starbucks Corporation ( SBUX ), based on the notion that Starbucks might have alienated a portion of its customer based due to chief executive officer Howard Schultz taking a political side prior to the election, and because of Brazil’s severe drought. Brazil is the biggest coffee producer in the world, and the drought in Brazil has led to significantly increased costs for beans. If the drought continues, this could lead to Starbucks having to pass on those increased costs to consumers. The fear is that this would lead to reduced demand. The only possibility is margin contraction. \nThese fears might very well become reality, but there are some bullish factors to consider as well. One, caffeine is the most addictive drug on the planet. Two, Starbucks is constantly innovating, including Starbucks Evenings. Three, Schultz believes that China will be a major growth avenue for decades to come. \nThe aforementioned fears and potentially bullish factors both play roles. While we know that Starbucks is one of the most well-run companies in the world, and that it has proven to be a highly profitable investment since its initial public offering , if you fear what might happen in the near- to medium-term, then you might want to consider a more diversified approach to investing in Starbucks. \nThat diversified approach would come in the form of Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLY ). This isn’t to say that XLY will prove to be a quality investment, either. It’s simply another option. What might make XLY appealing to some investors is a low expense ratio of 0.14%. Net assets are $9.24 billion, the average daily trading volume over the past three months is 5.7 million, and the current dividend yield is 1.56%. As far as performance goes, XLY has appreciated 1.41% over the past 12 months. That isn’t very impressive considering the S&P 500 has appreciated 5.41% over the past 12 months and currently yields 2.11%, but SBUX has slid 11.06% over the past 12 months. SBUX represents 3.45% of XLY assets. The asset percentage breakdown for XLY can be found in the chard below. 1-year stock performance and dividend yield have been included for each company for your convenience. % of Net Assets",
