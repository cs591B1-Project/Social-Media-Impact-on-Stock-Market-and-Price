      "text": "Buy Now \nLocked-out worker Tom Simpson, front, and Robert Beduhn, back, waive to a motorist on Monday outside the Honeywell Aerospace plant in South Bend. Tribune Photo/TED BOOKER \nSOUTH BEND — Some locked-out union members have already decided to vote against Honeywell Aerospace's new contract offer, which they say includes a better health insurance plan but fails to address other issues. \nThose members of the United Auto Workers Local 9 say they'd rather continue the six-month-long lockout than vote in favor of the five-year contract proposal — even though their unemployment insurance will expire later this month. \n\"We've been out here for too long to cave for something like this,\" said UAW member Tom Simpson, who was at a picket post Monday outside the South Bend plant, where airplane brakes and wheels are made. \"I think the majority are going to vote no. … But a lot of them might vote yes because they can't afford to stay out here any longer.\" \nLocal 9's current 314 members will have a chance to vote on the proposal from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday at the union's hall on South Michigan Street. \nA vote on the same proposal will also be held this week for 39 UAW members from Honeywell's plant in Green Island, N.Y. Locked-out workers at that plant are covered under the same contract as those in South Bend. \nFor the lockout to end, the offer would need to be approved by a majority vote. Meetings will be held Thursday at Local 9's hall for members to ask questions about the proposal, which is available at https://goo.gl/0t2sQN . \nThe lockout began on May 9, after union members rejected Honeywell's original contract by a 9-to-1 margin. That came after the previous five-year contract expired. \nChanges in the new proposal are only health-care related. It would guarantee that weekly premiums for health and dental insurance would not increase by more than 15 percent per year. Honeywell would also contribute more to employees' health savings accounts to offset health care costs. Those proposed changes, however, would be rescinded by Honeywell if its proposal is rejected. \nA six-member bargaining committee, including UAW officials from both plants, has not recommended members to approve the proposal. But Todd Treder, vice president of Local 9, said committee members decided it was still important to allow the membership to vote on it. \n\"If they really want us back to work, I think they could have come up with more than they did and helped us in other areas of the contract to offset costs,\" Treder said. \"We probably could have blocked it from being voted on, but we have members who deserve the right to vote. Because it's all we're going to get at this time, and with unemployment benefits running out, we figured we should give our members that option. I feel Honeywell has more to offer, but that's up to members to decide.\" \nHoneywell said in a statement that the \"company made substantial moves to try and reach an agreement with the union, particularly on health care. We worked hard to provide the union with our best offer in return for their commitment to give our employees a chance to vote on it and get back to work.\" \nUAW members remain concerned about other items in the proposal that include changes to overtime eligibility, the removal of paid absence allowance days to curb absenteeism, and the freezing of contributions to a long-standing “legacy” pension plan. \nUAW member Robert Beduhn said he's spoken with about 15 other members who are against the proposal and doesn't know any in favor of it. He said he is \"about 95 percent sure\" he'll vote against it. \nIt remains to be seen how many UAW members will vote on Saturday. \"Over 100 have dropped off the picket lines over the past four months,\" said Beduhn, who estimated that at least 25 union members won't return to Honeywell because they've taken other jobs. A handful, for example, have been hired at Federal Mogul in South Bend. \nUAW member Matt Pizana, 30, said he'll vote against the proposal. \"I'm concerned about overtime provisions, seniority rights and the things that protect us from the company using favoritism to do what they want,\" he said. \"They want to take a lot away from us that we wouldn't get back.\" \n574-235-6070",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nHoneywell, the operator of a nuclear security campus in Kansas City, plans to lease more office space to make room for its expanding workforce. \nThe multinational conglomerate has added 300 employees to its south Kansas City operation so far in 2016, bringing its number of employees serving the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Security Campus to 3,000. It also maxed out its current office space at 14520 Botts Road, where it makes non-nuclear parts for nuclear weapons. \nHoneywell is now looking to lease an additional 60,000 square feet of existing office space near where it operates the National Security Campus. \nThe company has limited its search region to the southern reaches of the Kansas City metro area. \nIn Missouri, the search parameters are generally Missouri 58 to the south, Missouri 50 to the north, State Line Road to the west and Ward Road to the east. That’s an area that covers portions of Belton, Raymore, Grandview, Lee’s Summit and south Kansas City. \nOn the Kansas side, Honeywell is looking at a north boundary of 103rd Street, State Line Road to the east, Metcalf Avenue to the west and 159th Street to the south. In other words, mostly Overland Park. \nThe company has given preference to office locations near food services. ",

      "text": "Honeywell's Connected Performance Services to Help PetroVietnam Improve Refinery Efficiency and Productivity [November 09, 2016] Tweet \nDES PLAINES, Ill. , Nov. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that a subsidiary of PetroVietnam will use its new IIoT-based Connected Performance Services (CPS) offering to improve the performance of its manufacturing operations in Quang Ngai City, Vietnam . \nBinh Son Refining and Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (BSR) will use Honeywell's CPS technology which integrates Honeywell UOP's deep process knowledge to improve refinery and plant performance at its naphtha complex. CPS is part of Honeywell's Connected Plant initiative, which leverages IIoT technologies, services and domain expertise to improve all aspects of industrial operations from supply chain efficiency to asset optimization. \n\"Honeywell's CPS technology uses the plant's own process data with cloud-based optimization and reliability solutions to ensure the operation runs at peak efficiency,\" said Zak Alzein , vice president for Honeywell UOP's CPS business. \"Honeywell will be in a position to use plant-specific information to provide BSR with actionable recommendations that can significantly improve its profitability.\" \nCPS gives refineries and petrochemical and gas processing plants greater visibility into their operations. Problems that reduced plant efficiency and productivity and that persistently avoided detection can be quickly identified and resolved using recommendations from CPS. As a result, plants can produce more and avoid unplanned shutdowns for maintenance and repair, resulting in millions of dollars per year in increased productivity. \nThe service continuously monitors streaming plant data and applies UOP process models and best practices, big data analytics, and machine learning to find latent and emerging performance problems, alert plant personnel and make specific operational recommendations. These recommendations are reported simultaneously to a dedicated Honeywell UOP process advisor, who also monitors performance an provides additional direction and resources. \n\"The CPS system is an important tool to help our refinery produce more gasoline and consume less energy,\" said Tran Ngoc Nguyen , President and CEO of Binh Son Refining & Petrochemical Co. \"We believe it will improve our staff's capabilities so they can keep our operation running at peak performance.\" \nThe service also can also help manage energy consumption to maintain compliance with regulatory standards, and also bridge knowledge gaps among personnel by leveraging the full breadth of Honeywell UOP's troubleshooting expertise, available at their fingertips. Taken together, the features of CPS allow refineries to operate more efficiently and make the best use of every barrel of feedstock. \nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Vietnam produced an estimated 355,000 barrels per day of petroleum and other liquids in 2015. While it is a net exporter of crude oil, without additional domestic conversion capacity, it will need to import significantly more oil products. Vietnam currently has oil reserves of about 4.4 billion barrels, giving it the third-largest reserve of crude oil in Asia , after China and India , even though its offshore reserves remain largely unexplored. \nBinh Son Refining and Petrochemical Co., Ltd. Produces, refines trades crude oil and finished petroleum products, bio-fuel, polypropylene pallets, and other products.

      "text": "Honeywell's Connected Performance Services To Help PetroVietnam Improve Refinery Efficiency And Productivity  57   DES PLAINES, Ill. , Nov. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that a subsidiary of PetroVietnam will use its new IIoT-based Connected Performance Services (CPS) offering to improve the performance of its manufacturing operations in Quang Ngai City, Vietnam . Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (BSR) will use Honeywell's CPS technology which integrates Honeywell UOP's deep process knowledge to improve refinery and plant performance at its naphtha complex. CPS is part of Honeywell's Connected Plant initiative, which leverages IIoT technologies, services and domain expertise to improve all aspects of industrial operations from supply chain efficiency to asset optimization. \"Honeywell's CPS technology uses the plant's own process data with cloud-based optimization and reliability solutions to ensure the operation runs at peak efficiency,\" said Zak Alzein , vice president for Honeywell UOP's CPS business. \"Honeywell will be in a position to use plant-specific information to provide BSR with actionable recommendations that can significantly improve its profitability.\" CPS gives refineries and petrochemical and gas processing plants greater visibility into their operations. Problems that reduced plant efficiency and productivity and that persistently avoided detection can be quickly identified and resolved using recommendations from CPS. As a result, plants can produce more and avoid unplanned shutdowns for maintenance and repair, resulting in millions of dollars per year in increased productivity. The service continuously monitors streaming plant data and applies UOP process models and best practices, big data analytics, and machine learning to find latent and emerging performance problems, alert plant personnel and make specific operational recommendations. These recommendations are reported simultaneously to a dedicated Honeywell UOP process advisor, who also monitors performance and provides additional direction and resources. \"The CPS system is an important tool to help our refinery produce more gasoline and consume less energy,\" said Tran Ngoc Nguyen , President and CEO of Binh Son Refining & Petrochemical Co. \"We believe it will improve our staff's capabilities so they can keep our operation running at peak performance.\" The service also can also help manage energy consumption to maintain compliance with regulatory standards, and also bridge knowledge gaps among personnel by leveraging the full breadth of Honeywell UOP's troubleshooting expertise, available at their fingertips. Taken together, the features of CPS allow refineries to operate more efficiently and make the best use of every barrel of feedstock. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Vietnam produced an estimated 355,000 barrels per day of petroleum and other liquids in 2015. While it is a net exporter of crude oil, without additional domestic conversion capacity, it will need to import significantly more oil products. Vietnam currently has oil reserves of about 4.4 billion barrels, giving it the third-largest reserve of crude oil in Asia , after China and India , even though its offshore reserves remain largely unexplored. Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical Co., Ltd. Produces, refines trades crude oil and finished petroleum products, bio-fuel, polypropylene pallets, and other products. The company also provides maintenance and technical consultation, training and manpower, marine, and port services in the oil refining and petrochemical field and develops oil and gas projects and bio-fuel. The company was founded in 2008 and is based in Quang Ngai, Vietnam . It operates as a subsidiary of Vietnam National Oil and Gas Group (PetroVietnam). Honeywell UOP ( www.uop.com ) is a leading international supplier and licensor of process technology, catalysts, adsorbents, equipment, and consulting services to the petroleum refining, petrochemical, and gas processing industries. Honeywell UOP is part of Honeywell's Performance Materials and Technologies strategic business group, which also includes Honeywell Process Solutions ( www.honeywellprocess.com ), a pioneer in automation control, instrumentation and services for the oil and gas, refining, petrochemical, chemical and other industries.

      "text": " Honeywell\nDES PLAINES, Ill. , Nov. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that a subsidiary of PetroVietnam will use its new IIoT-based Connected Performance Services (CPS) offering to improve the performance of its manufacturing operations in Quang Ngai City, Vietnam .\nBinh Son Refining and Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (BSR) will use Honeywell's CPS technology which integrates Honeywell UOP's deep process knowledge to improve refinery and plant performance at its naphtha complex. CPS is part of Honeywell's Connected Plant initiative, which leverages IIoT technologies, services and domain expertise to improve all aspects of industrial operations from supply chain efficiency to asset optimization.\n\"Honeywell's CPS technology uses the plant's own process data with cloud-based optimization and reliability solutions to ensure the operation runs at peak efficiency,\" said Zak Alzein , vice president for Honeywell UOP's CPS business. \"Honeywell will be in a position to use plant-specific information to provide BSR with actionable recommendations that can significantly improve its profitability.\"\nCPS gives refineries and petrochemical and gas processing plants greater visibility into their operations. Problems that reduced plant efficiency and productivity and that persistently avoided detection can be quickly identified and resolved using recommendations from CPS. As a result, plants can produce more and avoid unplanned shutdowns for maintenance and repair, resulting in millions of dollars per year in increased productivity.\nThe service continuously monitors streaming plant data and applies UOP process models and best practices, big data analytics, and machine learning to find latent and emerging performance problems, alert plant personnel and make specific operational recommendations. These recommendations are reported simultaneously to a dedicated Honeywell UOP process advisor, who also monitors performance and provides additional direction and resources.\n\"The CPS system is an important tool to help our refinery produce more gasoline and consume less energy,\" said Tran Ngoc Nguyen , President and CEO of Binh Son Refining & Petrochemical Co. \"We believe it will improve our staff's capabilities so they can keep our operation running at peak performance.\"\nThe service also can also help manage energy consumption to maintain compliance with regulatory standards, and also bridge knowledge gaps among personnel by leveraging the full breadth of Honeywell UOP's troubleshooting expertise, available at their fingertips. Taken together, the features of CPS allow refineries to operate more efficiently and make the best use of every barrel of feedstock.\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Vietnam produced an estimated 355,000 barrels per day of petroleum and other liquids in 2015. While it is a net exporter of crude oil, without additional domestic conversion capacity, it will need to import significantly more oil products. Vietnam currently has oil reserves of about 4.4 billion barrels, giving it the third-largest reserve of crude oil in Asia , after China and India , even though its offshore reserves remain largely unexplored.\nBinh Son Refining and Petrochemical Co., Ltd. Produces, refines trades crude oil and finished petroleum products, bio-fuel, polypropylene pallets, and other products. The company also provides maintenance and technical consultation, training and manpower, marine, and port services in the oil refining and petrochemical field and develops oil and gas projects and bio-fuel. The company was founded in 2008 and is based in Quang Ngai, Vietnam . It operates as a subsidiary of Vietnam National Oil and Gas Group (PetroVietnam).\nHoneywell UOP ( www.uop.com ) is a leading international supplier and licensor of process technology, catalysts, adsorbents, equipment, and consulting services to the petroleum refining, petrochemical, and gas processing industries. Honeywell UOP is part of Honeywell's Performance Materials and Technologies strategic business group, which also includes Honeywell Process Solutions ( www.honeywellprocess.com ), a pioneer in automation control, instrumentation and services for the oil and gas, refining, petrochemical, chemical and other industries.\nHoneywell ( www.honeywell.com ) is a Fortune 100 diversified technology and manufacturing leader, serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services; control technologies for buildings, homes, and industry; turbochargers; and performance materials.

      "text": "Printer-friendly version \nDES PLAINES, Ill. , Nov. 9, 2016 / / -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that a subsidiary of PetroVietnam will use its new IIoT-based Connected Performance Services (CPS) offering to improve the performance of its manufacturing operations in Quang Ngai City, Vietnam . \nBinh Son Refining and Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (BSR) will use Honeywell's CPS technology which integrates Honeywell UOP's deep process knowledge to improve refinery and plant performance at its naphtha complex. CPS is part of Honeywell's Connected Plant initiative, which leverages IIoT technologies, services and domain expertise to improve all aspects of industrial operations from supply chain efficiency to asset optimization. \n\" Honeywell's CPS technology uses the plant's own process data with cloud-based optimization and reliability solutions to ensure the operation runs at peak efficiency, \" said Zak Alzein , vice president for Honeywell UOP's CPS business. \"Honeywell will be in a position to use plant-specific information to provide BSR with actionable recommendations that can significantly improve its profitability.\" \nCPS gives refineries and petrochemical and gas processing plants greater visibility into their operations. Problems that reduced plant efficiency and productivity and that persistently avoided detection can be quickly identified and resolved using recommendations from CPS. As a result, plants can produce more and avoid unplanned shutdowns for maintenance and repair, resulting in millions of dollars per year in increased productivity. \nThe service continuously monitors streaming plant data and applies UOP process models and best practices, big data analytics, and machine learning to find latent and emerging performance problems, alert plant personnel and make specific operational recommendations. These recommendations are reported simultaneously to a dedicated Honeywell UOP process advisor, who also monitors performance and provides additional direction and resources. \n\"The CPS system is an important tool to help our refinery produce more gasoline and consume less energy,\" said Tran Ngoc Nguyen , President and CEO of Binh Son Refining & Petrochemical Co. \"We believe it will improve our staff's capabilities so they can keep our operation running at peak performance.\" \nThe service also can also help manage energy consumption to maintain compliance with regulatory standards, and also bridge knowledge gaps among personnel by leveraging the full breadth of Honeywell UOP's troubleshooting expertise, available at their fingertips. Taken together, the features of CPS allow refineries to operate more efficiently and make the best use of every barrel of feedstock. \nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Vietnam produced an estimated 355,000 barrels per day of petroleum and other liquids in 2015. While it is a net exporter of crude oil, without additional domestic conversion capacity, it will need to import significantly more oil products. Vietnam currently has oil reserves of about 4.4 billion barrels, giving it the third-largest reserve of crude oil in Asia , after China and India , even though its offshore reserves remain largely unexplored. \nBinh Son Refining and Petrochemical Co., Ltd. Produces, refines trades crude oil and finished petroleum products, bio-fuel, polypropylene pallets, and other products. The company also provides maintenance and technical consultation, training and manpower, marine, and port services in the oil refining and petrochemical field and develops oil and gas projects and bio-fuel. The company was founded in 2008 and is based in Quang Ngai, Vietnam . It operates as a subsidiary of Vietnam National Oil and Gas Group (PetroVietnam). \nHoneywell UOP ( www.uop.com ) is a leading international supplier and licensor of process technology, catalysts, adsorbents, equipment, and consulting services to the petroleum refining, petrochemical, and gas processing industries. Honeywell UOP is part of Honeywell's Performance Materials and Technologies strategic business group, which also includes Honeywell Process Solutions ( www.honeywellprocess.com ), a pioneer in automation control, instrumentation and services for the oil and gas, refining, petrochemical, chemical and other industries. \nHoneywell ( www.honeywell.com ) is a Fortune 100 diversified technology and manufacturing leader, serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services; control technologies for buildings, homes, and industry; turbochargers; and performance materials.

      "title": "Honeywell Lyric T6 Smart Home - Review",
      "text": "Review Price: £172.00 What is the Honeywell Lyric T6? \nWith its Lyric T6 smart thermostat, Honeywell has created a heating system that's exceptionally easy to control,. \nAs with the rival Tado Smart Thermostat, the Lyric T6 is largely controlled by your location, turning your heating off when you're out and back on when you're home. It's also the first Honeywell thermostat to hit the UK with Apple HomeKit support. \nRelated: Apple will save the smart home dream from itself Honeywell Lyric T6 – Design and Build \nHoneywell has designed the T6 to be timeless and classic. It resembles a keyboard key, only it's larger, with its plain black plastic body letting the thermostat blend neatly into the background. \nThere are funkier smart thermostats out there – such as the Nest – but the question is, are you going to be so enamoured of the design in years to come? With the Lyric T6, you get a clean and neat thermostat that won't age. And, over the past few weeks, its looks have certainly grown on me. \nA secondary bridge box hooks up to your boiler – or, it can control a second zone – and triggers the heating to come on when the thermostat requests it. This is a heating-only relay, and there's no option to control hot water at the moment. \nHow you hook up the thermostat to the bridge will depend on the version you buy, since Honeywell has two Lyric T6 models available. \nThe regular Lyric T6 model replaces an existing wall-mounted thermostat, using the existing wires for power and control. The second model, the Lyric T6R, costs around £20 and connects wirelessly to the bridge. With this model, the thermostat is mounted on a stand and is powered by an external power adapter. All models of the Lyric have built-in Wi-Fi to connect to your home network. Honeywell Lyric T6 – Features \nSetting up the Lyric T6 is straightforward, although you should get a heating engineer to install it since the relay box uses mains power. Once the relay is in place, the app takes you through setting up the thermostat and connecting it to your Wi-Fi. It's a straightforward process, and I had mine working within 10 minutes. \nOne of the first jobs is to set up geofencing, so the heating knows when to turn on and off based on your location. I like the way that the geofence radius can be set manually, rather than using an automatic range, so you can make the system work the way you want. \nHoneywell offers support for multiple users, so that you can kit out everyone in your house with the app and a user account. It means that your heating won't turn off just because one person has left. \nBy default, the Lyric dumps complicated scheduling for simple control using three modes: Home, Away and Sleep. \nFor Home and Away you set the temperatures you want, but the mode is activated by your location only. \nSleep mode lets you set a temperature and define an on/off time, so you can have the heating turn down when it's time for bed. Running in this way, the Lyric T6 should be set-and-forget, so you should have to touch the thermostat or app rarely, letting the automatic settings deal with your heating. \nAlternatively, you can create your own schedule, choosing when the heating comes on and off, just as with a regular thermostat. There are options to have the same schedule every day, a different schedule for weekdays and the weekend, or you can set each day individual. \nFrustratingly, choosing the scheduled mode disables geolocation. It seems a little unfair that you can't have customisation and convenience. Tado, in comparison, lets you set a schedule and turn on geofencing. Honeywell Lyric T6 – Performance \nHoneywell has made the Lyric app simple to use, with a big temperature dial dominating the interface. Spinning the dial turns the temperature up. \nWith geofencing turned on, temperature changes are kept until the next state change, such as Sleep or Away modes being activated. If you've turned on a full schedule, temperature changes are kept, by default, until the following morning, but you can set changes to be permanent or configure them to run on a timer. Again, it's a shame that you don't get the same flexibility when the geofenced mode is enabled. \nYou can also turn your heating on and off, and manage temperature directly from the thermostat. Its touchscreen is quick to respond to commands, and the simple, clear display makes it both the set temperature and the current temperature obvious. \nI like the Holiday mode, which allows you to input into the thermostat when you're away, when you'll be back, and the temperature you want to keep your house at while you're away. You won't have to remember to turn the heating back on on your return, so you'll be met by a nice, warm home. \nOver time, the Lyric T6 learns how long your home takes to warm up. If you turn on Optimised Start, the Lyric T6 can use this information to turn on your heating early, so that your house is warm by the start time you've set. For cold winter mornings, this is a great option, as you can ensure that your house is warm by the time Sleep mode ends and you get out of bed. Honeywell Lyric T6 – HomeKit, Siri, Echo and IFTTT \nSince the Lyric T6 is HomeKit-enabled, you can set the thermostat's temperature using your voice by talking to Siri. As of iOS 10, you can also use the Home app for control. From the Home app, you can change temperature, but the controls are a little clunky and nowhere near as neat as those in the Lyric app itself. \nUsing voice commands with Siri is better and more natural, with the thermostat changing temperature almost instantly after I'd issued my commands. The downside of Siri is that to use it, you have to have your phone out and available. Newer iPhone models listen out for the \"OK Siri\" wake command, but this only works if the phone's screen isn't covered. \nAmazon Echo (Alexa) and IFTTT support are due to come online soon. Echo support, in particular, makes much sense as you can just ask for a temperature change without having to fish your phone out of a pocket, with the system always on and ready to respond to voice activation. Should I buy the Honeywell Lyric T6? \nHoneywell has done a good job with the Lyric T6 and T6R. They're quick to respond, and the geofencing worked well in my tests. \nCompetition is stiff, however, and the Tado Smart Thermostat is the closest rival. The Tado's scheduling is more flexible and you can upgrade the system with smart radiator valves for room-by-room control. It also supports HomeKit, Echo and IFTTT. That said, it's more expensive (£199 for the kit, plus £79 if you need the Extension bridge to connect to your boiler). \nGiven that Honeywell's T6 kit includes the bridge, it's excellent value. If you just want a smart thermostat that you can largely set-and-forget, with a bit of manual control to tweak temperature, then the T6 is a great choice. However, more flexible scheduling in combination with geofencing would improve this product. Verdict \nA neat and responsive thermostat, the Honeywell Lyric T6 has a great app and geofencing, but scheduling isn't very flexible. Overall Score Best Deals for Honeywell Lyric T6 0 shares",

      "text": "SHOW LESS Research was conducted on the qualification of Honeywell platinum resistance thermometer (PRT) bonding for use in the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL). This is the first time these sensors will be used for Mars-related projects. Different types of PRTs were employed for the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) project, and several reliability issues were experienced, even for a shortduration mission like MER compared to MSL. Therefore, the development of a qualification process for the Honeywell PRT bonding was needed for the MSL project. Reliability of the PRT sensors, and their bonding processes, is a key element to understand the health of the hardware during all stages of the project, and particularly during surface operations on Mars. Three extreme temperature summer season cycles and three winter season cycles (total: 1983 thermal cycles) were completed, and no Honeywell PRT failures associated with the bonding process were found. Seventy-eight PRTs were bonded onto six different substrate materials using four different adhesives during the thermal cycling, which included a planetary protection cycle to +125 C for two hours, three protoflight/qualification cycles (-135 to 70 C), 1,384 summer cycles (-105 to 40 C), and 599 winter cycles (-130 to 15 C). There were no observed changes in PRT resistances, bonding characteristics, or damage identified from the package evaluation as a result of the qualification tests.",

      "text": "Lyric Gateway Delivers a “Mobile First” Connected Home MELVILLE, N.Y. \nNov. 10, 2016 – Honeywell (NYSE: HON), a global leader in connected homes, announced a new addition to its Lyric™ Security and Home Control platform that seamlessly allows consumers to control their home security and automation systems on their personal devices. The Lyric Gateway is designed for the mobile lifestyle and opens up new markets¬ – including renters, condo and second home owners, and those who frequently move – to security dealers and integrators. \nThe Lyric Gateway, which can be placed anywhere in the home using the included desk stand, serves as the central hub for controlling the entire Lyric wireless connected platform. Through the Honeywell Total Connect® Remote Services app, consumers can control all aspects of their Lyric connected home system including the Lyric Round™ Wi-Fi Thermostat, Total Connect video cameras and Z-Wave enabled devices. \n“Many people prefer to manage their lives through their mobile device – and controlling their home is no different,” said David Paja, president of Security and Fire, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. “The Lyric Gateway provides these customers with a wireless, flexible and connected system that’s ideal for life on the move. It gives consumers, such as renters and condo owners, the opportunity to have a professionally installed and monitored security system without the need to drill holes and snake wires.” \nEasy to set-up, the Lyric Gateway installs quickly with either Ethernet or Wi-Fi connectivity. It also uses radio communications as a backup, which removes the need for an urgent dealer response to communication protocol changes. The radio is user-replaceable, which puts more power in the hands of the consumer and therefore helps reduce the need for a dealer to dispatch a service technician. \n“Security solutions are evolving quickly, particularly in the residential market,” said Paja. “The Lyric Gateway will enhance dealers’ business models by enabling them to reach new customers, increase their RMR, and provide a great customer experience while reducing their operational costs.” \nThe entire Lyric Security and Home Control platform, including the encrypted Honeywell SiX™ Two-Way wireless sensors, is supported by the AlarmNet 360™ online dealer platform, which simplifies business management for systems integrators and dealers. \nFor more information, please visit www.lyricgateway.com .

Encycle is Honeywell's first smart thermostat partner to focus exclusively on solutions for commercial and industrial consumers. Encycle has already integrated Honeywell thermostats into its EASE (Energy as a Service by Encycle™) solution for a nationwide restaurant and entertainment business. With customer satisfaction being a top priority, it was crucial that Encycle's solution lower electricity costs while ensuring patrons' comfort. What started out as a 6-site pilot program has now developed into a 17-site portfolio with over 300 thermostats. In 2016 alone, Encycle added over $80,000 in utility cost savings to the customer's bottom line. The benefits of integrating Encycle's patented Swarm Logic™ technology with the leading features of Honeywell's thermostats have been so effective that the chain has standardized this platform for every one of their new locations. Continue Reading Encycle Logo (PRNewsFoto/Encycle Corporation) Encycle's newest solution, the SwarmStat™ service, provides all the benefits of EASE using only IoT enabled thermostats. Honeywell's WiFi thermostat family is the first deployment platform offered. One of Encycle's largest nationwide retailers is piloting SwarmStat to confirm that it meets their performance and payback criteria in utilities with very low tariffs and no demand response programs. This could lead to a rollout of approximately 1,500 thermostats from one customer alone. \"SwarmStat is our first 'Swarm in a Cloud' product, where we are working with major thermostat and building management system OEMs,\" said Bob Chiste , Encycle's CEO.

      "text": "Encycle Announces SwarmStat and its Honeywell Total Connect Comfort Partnership Encycle now offers its cloud-based Swarm Logic to OEM energy control vendors November 14, 2016 07:00 AM EST Blog This \nSAN MARCOS, Calif. , Nov.   Encycle ( www.encycle.com ) proudly announces its collaboration with Honeywell as a Total Connect Comfort partner . Encycle is Honeywell's first smart thermostat partner to focus exclusively on solutions for commercial and industrial consumers. \nEncycle has already integrated Honeywell thermostats into its EASE (Energy as a Service by Encycle™) solution for a nationwide restaurant and entertainment business. With customer satisfaction being a top priority, it was crucial that Encycle's solution lower electricity costs while ensuring patrons' comfort. What started out as a 6-site pilot program has now developed into a 17-site portfolio with over 300 thermostats. In 2016 alone, Encycle added over $80,000 in utility cost savings to the customer's bottom line. The benefits of integrating Encycle's patented Swarm Logic™ technology with the leading features of Honeywell's thermostats have been so effective that the chain has standardized this platform for every one of their new locations. \nEncycle's newest solution, the SwarmStat™ service, provides all the benefits of EASE using only IoT enabled thermostats. Honeywell's WiFi thermostat family is the first deployment platform offered. \nOne of Encycle's largest nationwide retailers is piloting SwarmStat to confirm that it meets their performance and payback criteria in utilities with very low tariffs and no demand response programs. This could lead to a rollout of approximately 1,500 thermostats from one customer alone. \n\"SwarmStat is our first 'Swarm in a Cloud' product, where we are working with major thermostat and building management system OEMs,\" said Bob Chiste , Encycle's CEO. He added, \"Our goal is to enable energy management hardware vendors to enjoy the benefits of our cloud-based Swarm Logic™ service.\" \nAbout Encycle \nEncycle provides unique benefits to a number of Fortune 500 companies. The Energy as a Service by Encycle (\"EASE\") solution maximizes the performance of HVAC systems to save commercial and industrial companies money while reducing their carbon footprint. Based on patented Swarm Logic technology, Encycle's platform uses biomimicry techniques to reduce HVAC energy costs, participate in Demand Response programs and gain valuable insight into HVAC performance. EASE is simple and easy to install, optionally integrates with leading IoT solutions, and delivers ROIs that far exceed most solar, storage and lighting initiatives. \nEncycle's offices are located in Toronto ( Canada ), San Marcos ( California ), and Taunton (UK). Encycle, Energy as a Service by Encycle, Swarm Logic, Swarm Energy Management, SwarmStat, OpenStat, Swarm Open, and Swarm Logic Open are registered or pending trademarks of Encycle Corporation.",

      "text": "Digital ID and Access Control One-Click Hot/Cold Calls Enhancing access & comfort at Eagle Brook Church Lifting experiences at Virgin Money Go to all assets \nThe new app provides digital identification and integrates with core building functions, including access and comfort control, to enhance building occupants’ experience with the touch of a screen. The app’s access control capability eliminates the need for physical cards or fobs and gives users secure access via their smart phones. In addition, occupants can quickly and easily communicate temperature discomfort to prompt real-time adjustments instead of the more time-consuming process of seeking out a facility manager. \nFacility managers benefit from immediate insight into where and how comfortable occupants are so they can make adjustments more quickly and easily. And the app’s digital identification and access control capabilities make it easier to manage occupant credentials, eliminating the need to keep track of and replace misplaced access cards. \n“Occupant engagement is an increasingly important aspect of intelligent building solutions,” said Casey Talon, principal research analyst with Navigant Research , contributing to its Building Innovations program. “The smart phone app is an innovative new platform for gathering insight that can refine environmental conditions to optimize workspaces.” \nBacked by a cloud-based architecture and enabled by HID Global’s Seos ® credential technology, the Honeywell Vector Occupant App works independently of underlying building systems, enabling widespread use and adoption. Facility administrators can use the app to manage user identification and credentials. Users who download the app must receive an invitation from the administrator in order to gain access to its features. \nThe app features: Digital Identification – Eliminates the need for plastic badges or temporary tags and solves the issue of outdated photo IDs by providing an up-to-date photograph. Convenient Access Control – Builds on the app’s digital identification feature, offering mobile-based access control that can easily be managed by a facility and eliminate the need to track and replace cards or fobs. Occupants have one less item to carry and can open doors from greater distances than traditional key cards and fobs. One-Click Hot/Cold Calls – Provides a quick and direct way for occupants to indicate when their work areas are too hot or too cold, and to receive confirmation that their issues are being addressed. Facility managers are alerted to occupants’ discomfort right away and can view the location of the call, identify patterns, and quickly make adjustments to satisfy occupants. \nThe Honeywell Vector Occupant App is part of Honeywell’s approach to connected services, which leverages the connectivity of buildings to improve how they operate and the experiences they offer for those who visit and work within them. The app is also the latest addition to Honeywell’s mobile software strategy, a significant part of the company’s efforts to provide the latest technology innovations to help keep facilities safe, secure, comfortable, productive and energy efficient. Future enhancements and capabilities are planned for the app that will take advantage of building connectivity. The Honeywell Vector Occupant App currently works with Apple and Android products and is available on iTunes ® and Google Play ™ . # # # \nAbout Honeywell Home and Building Technologies Honeywell Building Solutions is a part of Honeywell Home and Building Technologies (HBT), a global business with more than 44,000 employees worldwide.

      "text": "Tweet 0 \nEcobank Nigeria Limited has asked the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice Ibrahim Auta, to re-assign a suit filed against it by Honeywell Flour Mills Plc and its sister companies – Anchorage Leisures Limited and Silaom Global Services Limited – to another judge. \nThe bank said it no longer had confidence that it would receive a fair justice from Justice Muhammed Idris who is currently handling the case. \nIn a letter to the CJ by the bank’s Company Secretary/Chief Legal Counsel Denike Laoye and Kehinde Dawodu of its Legal and Regulatory Unit, the bank said various events led it to conclude that the case should be better handled by another judge. \n“The bank states unequivocally that it no longer has confidence that it will fairly and dispassionately receive justice in the subject case in light of the various events showing the court’s apparent bias against the bank and its retained firm of solicitors. \n“We, therefore, sincerely pray that the subject suit be re-assigned to any other judge of the Federal High Court, Lagos,” the bank wrote. \nThe bank said while ruling on contempt a contempt charge filed by Honeywell and others, the judge allegedly threatened to the “deal with” the bank when the plaintiffs’ counsel properly invokes the court’s disciplinary jurisdiction. \n“In determining the initial committal processes, His Lordship Idris J, went beyond the possibility of innocence or the presumption of innocence as required by law,” the bank said. \nThe bank said the judge, without hearing from it, held that a ruling delivered on July 1, in which he refused to grant the bank’s application for stay of proceedings, was still pending. \nBesides, Ecobank said the judge allegedly refused to countenance its appeal before the Supreme Court and a pending motion for stay of proceedings. \n“Our senior counsel informed the court that in deference to the hierarchy of courts, particularly since the issue at hand is jurisdiction, His Lordship ought to adjourn the trial pending the decision of the Supreme Court on the same issue, which appeal is ripe for hearing. \n“Despite all these, His Lordship relied on the plaintiff’s sole affidavit and the ruling of 1 st July, 2016 to adjourn for definite hearing the subject suit, shutting the bank out from traversing the narration by the plaintiffs’ counsel,” the bank said.",

Forces in Motion , an award-winning hip-hop educational experience, to Texas ; marking the final stop of its 25 th tour of the program since its inception in 2004. Starting Monday, FMA Live! will perform before five schools in Laredo, TX including Louis J. Christen Middle School , Dr. Joaquin G. Cigarroa Middle School , Memorial Middle School, John Z. Leyendecker Elementary School and Mirabeau B. Lamar Middle School. The tour will then conclude with shows at Pleasanton Junior High School in Pleasanton, TX on Friday.\nSince the program's 2004 launch, FMA Live! has traveled nearly 110,000 miles to more than 1,200 schools and performed for 460,000 students in 48 contiguous U.S. states, as well as in Mexico and Canada . The one-of-a-kind show incorporates hip-hop music, dancers, student volunteers, and on-stage, interactive science experiments to demonstrate how physics is part of everyday life.\n\"The astronauts of 2025 are sitting in our middle schools today,\" said Donald James , NASA's associate administrator for Education \"There is no better time to get students excited about STEM topics. Alongside Honeywell, we have created a program that provides students with an early look into the career possibilities that exist in these fields.\"\nEach performance focuses on Newton's law of universal gravitation and three laws of motion. FMA Live! is named after Newton's second law of motion [Force equals Mass times Acceleration] and uses music videos and interactive scientific demonstrations to teach and inspire students to pursue STEM careers.\n\"In each school we visit during the tour, we bring to life the importance of subjects like science and math and encourage students to explore careers that will ultimately change the world we live in,\" said Mike Bennett , president, Honeywell Hometown Solutions. \"The popularity of FMA Live! is a testament to its ability to both entertain and inspire students.\"\nThe FMA Live! Forces in Motion experience also features an online \"Teachers' Lounge\" that includes National Science Standards-based teaching resources including downloadable streaming videos, music from the show, and a comprehensive educational guide with lesson plans. This digital tool maintains post-show momentum and can be incorporated into classroom learning objectives throughout the school year.

      "text": "Forte Oil, Honeywell, Cadbury, 19 others lose N64bn November 15, 2016 tweet Stanley Opara The Nigerian equities market closed on a negative note on Monday as Forte Oil Plc, Honeywell Flour Mill Plc, Cadbury Nigeria Plc, Nascon Allied Industries Plc and Oando Plc led a N64bn loss at the close of trading on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. The NSE market capitalisation dropped from N9.009tn recorded on Friday last week to N8.945tn, while the All-Share Index slid to 25,986.81 basis points from 26,170.88 basis points. A total of 160.908 million shares worth N1.115bn were traded in 2,431 deals. The share price of Forte Oil dropped to N94.32 from N104.50, shedding N10.18 (9.74 per cent), while Honeywell shares closed at N1.14 from N1.20, losing N0.06 (five per cent). Similarly, Cadbury shares lost N0.05 (4.95 per cent) to close at N10.57 from N11.12, while the share price of Nascon dipped by N0.37 (4.90 per cent) to close at N7.18 from N7.55. Oando share price also closed at N4.09 from N4.30, losing N0.21 (4.88 per cent). The NSE ASI opened the week 0.7 per cent lower, dropping below 26,000 points for the first time in six months, as all key sectors closed negative. The oil and gas sector led the market declines, down by 2.40 per cent following losses in the shares of Forte Oil and Oando. The financial services sector followed suit on the back of declines in Zenith Bank Plc, Diamond Bank Plc and Guaranty Trust Bank Plc by 4.16 per cent, 2.97 per cent and 2.23 per cent, respectively. The consumer goods and industrial goods sectors also closed lower amid declines in PZ Cussons Nigeria Plc, Guinness Nigeria Plc and Cap Plc by 4.37 per cent, 0.11 per cent and 4.66 per cent, respectively. Market breadth remained negative with 10 advances and 22 declines. On what would shape the next trading session, analysts at Vetiva Capital Management Plc said, “We highlight that investor sentiment remains bearish as revealed by the sell-off across sectors. On this note, we believe ASI could shed more points in the coming session.” On the global scene, European markets traded higher whilst most Asian markets slipped as investors continued to react to the results of the United States presidential election. However, the Nikkei closed higher, buoyed by a weaker yen and better-than-expected economic data (Japan’s Q3 Gross Domestic Product grew at an annualised 2.2 per cent year-on-year beating a forecast of 0.9 per cent year-on-year). The Dow opened at a record high driven by gains in financial stocks. Meanwhile, the interbank call rate moderated a slight 67 basis points to 25 per cent amid a relatively unchanged system liquidity. At the foreign exchange interbank market, the naira depreciated N0.50 against the dollar to close at N305.25 at week open in the spot market whilst the one year forward remained unchanged at N355. The fixed income market traded bearish on the first trading day of the week as market participants responded to the rise in inflation to 18.3 per cent in October (September: 17.9 per cent).  ",

      "text": "Facebook, Bank Of America, Honeywell: Fast Money Picks For November 11 \nIt’s critical to know whether a stock you plan on buying has an ex-dividend status, because in case it does, the dividend would be paid out to the seller. The person who owns the stock on the ex-dividend date will be awarded the payment, which means that you’ll have to wait for the next dividend cycle to receive your first dividend payout from the company. \nOn the other hand, share prices typically decline just after the ex-dividend date is declared, and usually by an amount equal to the expected dividend. So, this may give you the opportunity to identify a good entry point. If you’re planning on selling shares on or after the ex-dividend date, you'll receive the dividend payout from the company. \nHere is the list of stocks going ex-dividend on Wednesday. 3M Co (NYSE: MMM ) - $1.1100 dividend, 2.6158 percent yield. 3M, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, operates as a diversified technology company worldwide.

Visa shares have dropped 0.66 percent over the past 52 weeks, while the S&P 500 index has gained 5.41 percent in the same period.

      "text": "Facebook, Bank Of America, Honeywell: Fast Money Picks For November 11 \nIt’s critical to know whether a stock you plan on buying has an ex-dividend status, because in case it does, the dividend would be paid out to the seller. The person who owns the stock on the ex-dividend date will be awarded the payment, which means that you’ll have to wait for the next dividend cycle to receive your first dividend payout from the company. \nOn the other hand, share prices typically decline just after the ex-dividend date is declared, and usually by an amount equal to the expected dividend. So, this may give you the opportunity to identify a good entry point. If you’re planning on selling shares on or after the ex-dividend date, you'll receive the dividend payout from the company. \nHere is the list of stocks going ex-dividend on Wednesday. 3M Co (NYSE: MMM ) - $1.1100 dividend, 2.6158 percent yield. 3M, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, operates as a diversified technology company worldwide.

Visa shares have dropped 0.66 percent over the past 52 weeks, while the S&P 500 index has gained 5.41 percent in the same period.

      "text": "Honeywell's Connected Performance Services to Help PetroVietnam Improve Refinery Efficiency and Productivity   9, 2016 \nDES PLAINES, Ill., Nov. 9, 2016 - Honeywell (NYSE: HON) today announced that a subsidiary of PetroVietnam will use its new IIoT-based Connected Performance Services (CPS) offering to improve the performance of its manufacturing operations in Quang Ngai City, Vietnam. \nBinh Son Refining and Petrochemical Co., Ltd. (BSR) will use Honeywell's CPS technology which integrates Honeywell UOP's deep process knowledge to improve refinery and plant performance at its naphtha complex. CPS is part of Honeywell's Connected Plant initiative, which leverages IIoT technologies, services and domain expertise to improve all aspects of industrial operations from supply chain efficiency to asset optimization. \n\"Honeywell's CPS technology uses the plant's own process data with cloud-based optimization and reliability solutions to ensure the operation runs at peak efficiency,\" said Zak Alzein, vice president for Honeywell UOP's CPS business. \"Honeywell will be in a position to use plant-specific information to provide BSR with actionable recommendations that can significantly improve its profitability.\" \nCPS gives refineries and petrochemical and gas processing plants greater visibility into their operations. Problems that reduced plant efficiency and productivity and that persistently avoided detection can be quickly identified and resolved using recommendations from CPS. As a result, plants can produce more and avoid unplanned shutdowns for maintenance and repair, resulting in millions of dollars per year in increased productivity. \nThe service continuously monitors streaming plant data and applies UOP process models and best practices, big data analytics, and machine learning to find latent and emerging performance problems, alert plant personnel and make specific operational recommendations. These recommendations are reported simultaneously to a dedicated Honeywell UOP process advisor, who also monitors performance and provides additional direction and resources. \n\"The CPS system is an important tool to help our refinery produce more gasoline and consume less energy,\" said Tran Ngoc Nguyen, President and CEO of Binh Son Refining & Petrochemical Co. \"We believe it will improve our staff's capabilities so they can keep our operation running at peak performance.\" The service also can also help manage energy consumption to maintain compliance with regulatory standards, and also bridge knowledge gaps among personnel by leveraging the full breadth of Honeywell UOP's troubleshooting expertise, available at their fingertips. Taken together, the features of CPS allow refineries to operate more efficiently and make the best use of every barrel of feedstock. \nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Vietnam produced an estimated 355,000 barrels per day of petroleum and other liquids in 2015. While it is a net exporter of crude oil, without additional domestic conversion capacity, it will need to import significantly more oil products. Vietnam currently has oil reserves of about 4.4 billion barrels, giving it the third-largest reserve of crude oil in Asia, after China and India, even though its offshore reserves remain largely unexplored. \nBinh Son Refining and Petrochemical Co., Ltd. Produces, refines trades crude oil and finished petroleum products, bio-fuel, polypropylene pallets, and other products. The company also provides maintenance and technical consultation, training and manpower, marine, and port services in the oil refining and petrochemical field and develops oil and gas projects and bio-fuel. The company was founded in 2008 and is based in Quang Ngai, Vietnam. It operates as a subsidiary of Vietnam National Oil and Gas Group (PetroVietnam). \nHoneywell UOP ( www.uop.com ) is a leading international supplier and licensor of process technology, catalysts, adsorbents, equipment, and consulting services to the petroleum refining, petrochemical, and gas processing industries. Honeywell UOP is part of Honeywell's Performance Materials and Technologies strategic business group, which also includes Honeywell Process Solutions ( www.honeywellprocess.com ), a pioneer in automation control, instrumentation and services for the oil and gas, refining, petrochemical, chemical and other industries. \nHoneywell ( www.honeywell.com ) is a Fortune 100 diversified technology and manufacturing leader, serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services; control technologies for buildings, homes, and industry; turbochargers; and performance materials.

      "text": "Honeywell Partners with Encycle, HECO Reaps the Benefits   7, 2016 \nHoneywell and Encycle Development teams collaborate to prepare for OpenADR 2.0b rollouts \nSAN MARCOS, Calif., Nov. 7, 2016 - Encycle ( www.encycle.com ) and Honeywell Smart Energy joined forces to ensure that the details of OpenADR 2.0b implementations are production ready for their collective utility and C&I customers. \nYvette Maskrey, District Manager of Honeywell's Smart Energy business said, \"The Honeywell and Encycle development teams worked collaboratively through the details to seamlessly integrate our OpenADR 2.0b systems. This will ensure ease of participation for Hawaiian Electric's customers in demand response programs, and allows other Honeywell utility clients using this standard the flexibility to connect to additional distributed energy resources.\" \nThe key new feature of the OpenADR 2.0b standard is the ability for facilities to provide live telemetry data to utilities. This helps utilities better manage their demand response activities, requesting the minimal load shed from customers, thereby avoiding demand response fatigue. \nBarry Haaser, Managing Director of the OpenADR Alliance stated, \"Collaboration between key technology providers such as Honeywell and Encycle helps utilities and consumers adopt the 2.0b standard, knowing that the systems have been tested thoroughly. This will benefit not only Hawaiian Electric, but ultimately, utilities and consumers across the globe.\" \n\"The OpenADR 2.0b collaboration between our development teams represents a major milestone for Encycle, where we worked closely with Honeywell's Smart Energy group to benefit the industry at large. This enhances our relationship with Honeywell as we team up on other efforts, including integration with their Total Connect Comfort Ecosystem for our upcoming SwarmStat platform,\" said Mark Kerbel, Encycle's CTO and co-founder. \nAbout Encycle \nEncycle provides unique benefits to a number of Fortune 500 companies. The Energy as a Service by Encycle (\"EASE\") solution maximizes the performance of HVAC systems to save commercial and industrial companies money while reducing their carbon footprint.

      "text": "Email Brent Honeywell has allowed one run on six hits in 10 2/3 innings over his last three AFL starts. (Buck Davidson/MiLB.com) \nBrent Honeywell went to the Arizona Fall League without any specific agenda items from his parent club, but the young right-hander didn't view that as a negative. \n\"I'm pitching,\" Honeywell said. \"So I'm having fun.\" \nTampa Bay's No. 2 prospect is nearing the end of his AFL time with the Peoria Javelinas and finishing another sterling year on a strong note, having allowed just one run on six hits in 10 2/3 innings over his last three starts. \n\"I'm seeing some hitters I've never seen before, seeing guys who have more professional at-bats than anyone I've seen,\" said Honeywell, who is slated to start the Javelinas' regular-season finale Friday. \"I'm seeing how my stuff plays, seeing where my stuff plays. I think I've figured it out, and all in all, it's been a lot of fun.\" \nMLB.com's No. 39 overall prospect is coming off his best professional season. In 20 combined starts between Class A Advanced Charlotte and Double-A Montgomery, Honeywell went 7-3 with a 2.34 ERA and 117 strikeouts in 115 1/3 innings. That showing earned him Rays Minor League Pitcher of the Year honors , and after the breakout campaign, Tampa Bay gave him an opportunity to continue that run. \n\"I kind of felt disoriented when I came out here,\" said the 72nd overall pick in the 2014 Draft. \"I hadn't seen a hitter in a little while, and then I get out here and see hitters. I'm excited to face hitters. That's why I went and threw up eight runs in the first [4 1/3] innings I threw out here. I wasn't happy about it, so I had to do something different. That's the fun part about pitching.\" \nAfter two rough outings to begin his Fall League stay, Honeywell got himself figured out. The 21-year-old allowed just one hit over four shutout innings in an Oct. 24 win over Salt River. After following that with a scoreless three-frame start at Mesa on Oct. 29, Honeywell yielded a run on two hits over 3 2/3 innings against Salt River on Nov. 11. \n\"That's my normal pitching,\" he said. \"After the first two starts, I kind of kicked myself in the tail and said, 'Look, man, what are you doing? Let's go. Pitch.' I went out and tallied up some starts like that one after that one. That's all I wanted to do. I was looking to get guys out, and I was able to do that.\" \nHoneywell has commanded the ball well for Peoria to continue his 2016 trend, striking out 14 while walking four in 15 innings, and opponents are batting just .204 against him despite the length of his season. \n\"November's late,\" he said. \"I'm not tired. My arm's not tired, but I feel like I've stayed in pretty decent shape since I've been out here.\" \nThe AFL isn't just an opportunity for extra work. Honeywell knows extra eyes are on him in baseball's showcase offseason circuit. \n\"I'm going out and pitching for 29 other teams out here, too,\" he said. \"It's one of those things where you're not pitching for one team. You're pitching for a lot of them out here. A lot of guys are out watching. These scouts out here watching, they do write-ups, and they send them just like everybody else does. In my opinion, that's really good. It's always good to play more baseball.\" \nWhen the AFL campaign comes to a close Saturday, Honeywell will head into the offseason with an eye on what's ahead in three short months -- while staying cautious with his expectations. \n\"I'm looking forward to going to big league camp, I'm assuming,\" he said. \"I probably shouldn't assume stuff like that, but it's one of those things that hopefully I can contribute to the big league club sometime next year.\" In brief \nClosing in: With two days remaining in the season, only Scottsdale has been eliminated from contention for the league's title game Saturday. Salt River and Mesa are even atop the East Division standings, while Surprise leads Glendale by half a game and Peoria by a full game in the West. \nChasing the crown: Honeywell's Peoria teammate Zach Vincej is locked in a tight race for the league batting title with Scottsdale's Gleyber Torres. Vincej, a Reds prospect, went 2-for-5 on Wednesday to boost his average to .379, level with the mark of No. 2 Yankees prospect Torres. Tyler Maun is a contributor to MiLB.com.

      "text": "  \nAnyone who works in a shared office space knows all too well the small challenges that comes with large complex spaces. From maintaining the perfect temperature in your workspace to accessing various secure portions of said workspace, a lot of otherwise productive time can be spent finding ways to mitigate these tasks. \nImagine the hassle of coming to work only to discover you have forgotten your personalized security access card. You then must either return home to retrieve the card or seek out someone who can replace it. \nHoneywell, a leader in innovative smart technologies, has come up with a quick solution. The Honeywell Vector Occupant app syncs with a building’s smart systems so that occupants can simply use their smart phone. \nJohn Rajchert, the president of Honeywell Building Solutions, stated, “Smartphones and apps continue to enhance our lives. Buildings are alive and teeming with opportunities for users to interact with them — if you can make the right connections.” \nMore: Smart home cost of entry dipped with Honeywell Lyric T5 Smart Thermostat \nIts new app is making just those connections. It allows for individualized identification which eliminates the need for special badges or fobs to move about the building. Because everything is digital, management can easily oversee credentials of all the buildings occupants. Imagine never needing to replace a security card again. \nFinally, since the app is intended to interface directly with the building, maintenance staff can monitor occupants comfort levels in real time. Employees can quickly and easily report a problem with the temperature of their workspace directly through the app. \nThe app works independently of the buildings underlying systems which makes it widely accessible and easy to adapt to your current system. The entire program is backed by a cloud-based architecture and enabled by HID Global’s Seos credential technology. All users must be invited by an administrator before downloading and using the app. \nThe Honeywell Vector Occupant app is designed to make buildings more secure and more comfortable for the people who work and visit them. The company is always expanding and improving so who knows what’s in store next for building connectivity.",

      "text": "Published on November 18th, 2016 | by Joshua S Hill 0 \nNovember 18th, 2016 by Joshua S Hill Honeywell, a global leader in the Internet of Things, has launched a new mobile software application that allows building occupants to tap into the Internet of Things to control common building issues like temperature controls and building access. The Honeywell Vector Occupant App has been launched this week by Honeywell Building Solutions, a part of Honeywell Home and Building Technologies, an Internet of Things company creating software and products found in more than 150 million homes and over 10 million buildings worldwide. The new app serves to solve common issues faced by building occupants, such as how to change the temperature in their particular area, or how to gain access to a building if an access card has gone missing or been left at home. Instead, bypassing the need for access cards or key-fobs, as well as the time-consuming process of finding and speaking to the right facility manager to adjust the temperature, the new Honeywell Vector Occupant App needs only a smartphone. “Smart phones and apps continue to enhance our everyday lives, from allowing us to hail a cab to giving us direct insight into where we stand on a restaurant waiting list,” said John Rajchert, president, Honeywell Building Solutions . “We’re now applying these same concepts of insight and control to how one interacts with a building. Buildings are alive and teeming with opportunities for users to interact with them—if you can make the right connections. The Honeywell Vector Occupant App facilitates these interactions so users can create their best experiences.” “Occupant engagement is an increasingly important aspect of intelligent building solutions,” added Casey Talon, principal research analyst with Navigant Research , contributing to its Building Innovations program. “The smart phone app is an innovative new platform for gathering insight that can refine environmental conditions to optimize workspaces.” Drive an electric car?

      "text": "…Won’t compel disclosure of story’s source \n\nJustice Mohammed Idris of the Federal High Court in Lagos Friday refused to disqualify himself from adjudicating a N5.5billion debt case between Honeywell Flour Mills Plc, its sister companies and Ecobank Nigeria Limited. \nEcobank’ had written the Chief Judge, Justice Ibrahim Auta, asking that the case be re-assigned to another judge. \nThe bank said it no longer had confidence in the judge to do justice. \nPraying the court to recuse himself from adjudicating the case, Ecobank’s lawyer Mr Kunle Ogunba (SAN) said his client had several reasons to believe that it would not get justice from the judge. \n“The court’s rules allow My Lord to transfer the case on his own. This is the first time we’re asking in this suit that the case be re-assigned,” Ogunba said. \nOgunba said the application to transfer the case was not an attack on the judge’s integrity. \n“Since a party has shown that it does not harbour the confidence in your Lordship to handle the case dispassionately, your Lordship should wait on the CJ to respond or for My Lord to recuse himself so that parties can go before any other judge. This is our client’s grievance. \n“Their (plaintiffs’) conduct has been as if they own the court. It accords with the best judicial tenets for your Lordship to await the CJ’s decision or recuse himself,” Ogunba said. \nBut Honeywell’s lawyer Bode Olanipekun argued that Ecobank’s application was a ploy to delay the case. \n“It’s an application to stymie, waylay and ambush proceedings. This type of application portends very grave danger to the judiciary,” he said. \nAccording to him, if Ecobank had any issues with the judge’s rulings, it ought to go on appeal. \n“This application is not based on any law. I urge your Lordship to dismiss the application,” Olanipekun added. \nRuling, Justice idris refused to recuse himself from the case. He said he would stick to his judicial oath in determining the case. \nHis words: “It is always tempting for a judge against whom criticisms are made to say he would prefer not to hear further proceedings in which the critic is involved. \n“But it is important for a judge to resist the temptation to recuse himself simply because it’ll be comfortable to do so. The danger is that we’ll soon reach a position in which litigants were able to select judges to hear their cases simply by criticising all the judges that they do not want to hear their cases, whether the criticism is justified or not. \n“These issues are either for the appellate court or appealable issues and the defendant can exercise the right of appeal if it so desires. The application for the judge to recuse himself from this matter is most frivolous and it is refused. \n“This court shall abide by the decision of the Honourable the Chief Judge whenever it is made. The application is refused and the matter shall proceed accordingly.” \nThe judge earlier refused Olanipekun’s application to compel this reporter to step into th dock and disclose the source of his report on Ecobank’s letter to the CJ. The story, published in the Tuesday edition of this newspaper, was based on the letter. \nOlanipekun said: “We only got hint of that application by a publication in The Nation of November 15, 2016 in an article authored by one Joseph Jibueze. Coincidentally, he is in court. I take this issue very seriously. \n“I refer to the National Judicial Council (NJC) policy on complaints against judicial officers. Section 2.2 (4) to section 2.2 (9) bars any party from leaking any allegation of judicial misconduct against any judge in the press. \n“May I apply that Mr Jibueze comes into the dock to tell the court how he came about the story. Let him tell us the origin and how he came to know about it.” \nOgunba, who spoke in the journalist’s defence, describing Olanipekun’s application as “bizarre”. \nHe said: “This application is shocking. Mr Jibueze is not a party to this suit. On what basis will he enter the dock? Olanipekun has not cited any rule of procedure that allows that. Mr Jibueze did not report what was not in existence. I urge my Lord to discountenance my learned friend’s application.” \nIn a short ruling, Justice Idris asked Mr Olanipekun to “drop” the application and to “leave Mr Jibueze out of it”. \nJustice Idris said: “I urge counsel to drop it. Let’s leave Mr Jibueze out of it. Let’s leave Mr Jibueze alone. Let’s leave Mr Jibueze and go to the substance. We’ll leave the press out of it. They’re doing their work.” \nThe judge said his attention was also drawn to the story, but that he was not surprised by Ecobank’s letter to the CJ. \n\nHe said: “I was asked: ‘have you read the report?’ I said: ‘What matter?’ They said: ‘Ecobank.’ I said I expected that they would write the DSS (Department of State Services). I expected that they would write the EFCC (Economic and Financial Crimes Commission). \n“I expected that they would write the ICPC (Independent Practices and other related offences Commission). I expected that there would be a sting operation in my house on Monday the 14th of November. I expected and I was waiting. And I am waiting. \n\n“I said it on the last date and I’m saying it today: Nobody, no matter who you are can threaten me. Nobody, no matter who you are can intimidate me. Idris can never be intimidated. Never! This is a court a court of law. You don’t do politics in Justice Idris’ court. \n\n“No matter how rich you are, you can’t influence Justice Idris – no matter how powerful you are. Keep your money in your pockets. Don’t come here with your money, I’ll not accept it. Keep your influence where they are, you cannot influence Justice Idris whoever you are. I’m saying it openly and I am declaring it. \n\n“Let’s go to the issues. I’m prepared. Justice idris is prepared. Ogunba SAN knows me very well in practice. So let’s leave the issue of Jibueze. Let’s go to the substance. We’ll leave the pressmen out of it. We do law in this court. Let’s talk law.” \n\nThe judge adjourned until December 1 for hearing.",

The Bad The high price seems inappropriate for a device that isn't waterproof and integrates with hardly any other gadget.

And the fact it isn't waterproof is a major problem. 6.8 Overall",

      "text": "Home » News » Justice in Honeywell, Ecobank suit assures of impartiality Justice in Honeywell, Ecobank suit assures of impartiality On 8:20 am In News by Ikenna Comments \nBy Onozure Dania \nLagos—Justice Mohammed Idris of a Federal High Court, Lagos, has told counsel to Ecobank, Mr Kunle Ogunba, SAN, that he will not be intimidated nor influenced in the discharge of his judicial duties. \nJustice Idris said this when the matter between Honeywell and Ecobank came up for trial before the court. \nMeanwhile, the court has adjourned further hearing in the matter till December 1, 2016. \nPrior to Justice Idris’ comments, counsel to Ecobank, Mr Ogunba, had applied to the Judge to either excuse himself from adjudicating on the matter or await the decision of the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice Ibrahim Auta, in respect of Ecobank’s petition against Justice Idris. \nAs reported in the media, Ecobank wrote to the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court asking that the matter between it and Honeywell be withdrawn from Justice Idris, citing a lack of confidence and bias against Justice Idris. \nIn response, counsel to Honeywell, Bode Olanipekun informed the court that he only became aware of the petition written by Ecobank in the media on November 16, 2016. \nJustice Idris stated that if all judges were to excuse themselves from cases simply because litigants criticized their rulings and judgments, the judiciary would soon find itself in a situation where litigants choose the judges to adjudicate on their matters and this was not in the interest of the law. \nJustice Idris adjourned the matter to December 1, for trial.

      "text": "Honeywell announces next-gen solutions for thermal insulation DUBAI, 1 days ago \nHoneywell, a technology and manufacturing leader, has announced the availability of next-generation solutions for thermal insulation that can help Middle Eastern countries meet energy efficiency requirements. To meet its Montreal Protocol commitments, the region’s foam industry is phasing out the use of polyurethane foam containing hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), chemicals that are ozone-depleting and have high global-warming-potential (GWP), said a statement from the company. Further, in mid-October, more than 150 countries, including many from the Middle East, met in Rwanda and expanded the Montreal Protocol to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are non-ozone-depleting but have high GWPs, it said. Honeywell has commercialised a new hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) blowing agent that is both non-ozone-depleting and also low GWP, it added. Honeywell gathered regulators, contractors, foam insulation manufacturers, regional stakeholders and global industry experts in an exclusive workshop to review how environmentally preferable foam-blowing agents like Honeywell’s Solstice Liquid Blowing Agent (LBA) can help the Middle East meet its Montreal Protocol commitments and also energy efficiency requirements, said a statement. Solstice LBA is non-ozone-depleting and has a GWP of 1, which is 99.9 percent lower than the HCFC and HFC blowing agents it replaces, and equal to carbon dioxide, it stated.“The Middle East is making tremendous effort to meet its energy efficiency and Montreal Protocol commitments, including phasing out HCFC-141b in the polyurethane foam sector,” said Khaled Klaly, programme officer, United Nations Environment Program.“The UNEP is working with these countries to help them successfully transition to more low-GWP blowing agent technology that reduces emissions and achieves energy goals as required under the Montreal Protocol and in close partnership with other implementing agencies like Unido,” he said. Solstice LBA is a critical ingredient in closed-cell foam used for spray foam, panels and appliances, allowing it to expand and providing much of its excellent insulating properties. It increases the thermal performance of conventionally-processed polyurethane (PUR) and polyisocyanurate (PIR) foam in both continuous and discontinuous panel operations, it said.“We use the most innovative blowing agent technology available to provide our customers with building materials that make their homes and offices as energy-efficient as possible,” said Muhammad Asghar, managing director, Water Seal.“Solstice LBA meets the standards set by regional and global environmental policies, and is a top choice for a cost-effective, near drop-in replacement to previous-generation blowing agents,” he added. Solstice LBA is being adopted by rigid insulation manufacturers worldwide to reduce their environmental footprint and comply with environmental and energy efficiency regulations.“The recent amendment to the Montreal Protocol in Kigali, Rwanda in mid-October, accelerates demand for low-GWP solutions like our fourth-generation blowing agent technology,” Amir Naqvi, regional marketing manager, Honeywell.“Solstice LBA requires little to no retrofitting of existing equipment, making it an important solution for regions like the Middle East that seek to smoothly adapt to new environmental regulations,” he added. Worldwide adoption of Solstice has resulted in the reduction of more than 32 million metric tonnes of greenhouse gases to-date, equal to eliminating emissions from more than six million cars. Solstice LBA is non-flammable (ASTM E-681) and is not a volatile organic compound per US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It is listed under the US EPA’s Significant New Alternatives Policy (Snap) Programme and is also registered under the European Union’s Reach programme. Honeywell’s new world-scale production capacity manufacturing plant for Solstice LBA started up in May 2014, it stated. – TradeArabia News Service",

      "text": "Amazon Dash Replenishment Adds New Device Makers and Launches New Products GeniCan, Honeywell, Nestle and WePlenish are the latest device makers to join the Dash Replenishment program Newest products to be integrated with Dash Replenishment are Whirlpool Smart Dishwasher and PUR Ultimate Bluetooth Enabled Faucet Filtration System The latest Dash Replenishment devices available to preview at the Amazon Web Services re:Invent conference in Las Vegas starting November 29 November 22, 2016 09:00 AM   \nSEATTLE- (NASDAQ: AMZN)—Amazon today announced that a new set of diverse device makers joined the Amazon Dash Replenishment program ( www.developer.amazon.com/drs ), including GeniCan, Honeywell, Nestle and WePlenish. Dash Replenishment lets device makers enable their connected devices to automatically reorder physical goods from Amazon using a simple set of APIs—for example, a washer that reorders laundry detergent when supplies run low, or a coffee maker that reorders coffee when needed. \n“More and more customers are experiencing the magic of automatic reordering with Dash Replenishment. They avoid the hassle of tracking their household stock of essentials like dishwasher detergent, printer ink, and water filters—when they’re about to run out, Amazon automatically delivers a package to their doorstep,” said Daniel Rausch, Director of Amazon Dash. “We’re delighted by the momentum of the program and the feedback we’re hearing from device makers and developers—Dash Replenishment is simple to integrate and brings an innovative new customer benefit and business model to their connected devices.” \nAmazon also introduced the latest devices available with Dash Replenishment—the Whirlpool Smart Dishwasher and PUR Ultimate Faucet Filtration System. Available starting today, PUR’s new Ultimate Bluetooth enabled faucet filtration system tracks water consumption, filter usage and more straight from your smartphone, while providing healthier, cleaner, great-tasting water straight from your faucet. With Amazon Dash Replenishment, replacement filters are ordered automatically when needed. Also, available starting in December, the new Whirlpool Smart Dishwasher features Dash Replenishment and will automatically reorder dishwasher detergent when supplies run low. \n“Our newest Bluetooth enabled faucet mount filtration system is certified to reduce over 70 contaminants, including 99% of lead, 96% of mercury and 92% of certain pesticides,” said Deb Mudway, VP of Marketing, PUR at Helen of Troy. “To ensure customers always have healthier water and that the system is performing at an optimal level, we’re utilizing Dash Replenishment to track the filter’s status and provide replacement filters automatically—right when customers need them.” \nThere are dozens of brands already in the Dash Replenishment program—from global appliance manufacturers like Whirlpool and GE Appliances, to start-ups like Petcube and STYR Labs—which launched last year and has grown quickly. Amazon also recently announced the availability of Dash Replenishment in Europe with device makers Beko, Bosch and Siemens home appliances, Grundig, KYOCERA, Samsung and Whirlpool. Getting started is simple—device makers can use as few as 10 lines of code to start an integration. Today, the following device makers join the program: GeniCan – GeniCan installs directly in a customer’s recycle bin or garbage can and allows everyone in the home or office to add items to the household or office shopping list via barcode scanning and voice recognition. With Dash Replenishment, popular household and office supplies placed in the recycle bin or garbage will be reordered and delivered automatically. “GeniCan’s mission is to simplify the lives of busy families. GeniCan creates shopping lists easily and automatically, saving them time and money. Dash Replenishment saves our customers even more time by automatically ordering items. Now they can reorder items directly from their garbage can and recycle bin at the perfect time: the moment the item is being disposed of.” – Rob Griffin, Co-Founder, GeniCan Honeywell – Honeywell Connected Devices will calculate when a new air filter is needed and automatically reorder from Amazon, taking away the need for the homeowner to keep track of this intermittent and important replacement cycle. “Honeywell believes that the Internet of Things exists to provide conveniences like Dash Replenishment that make customers’ lives easier and ensures their systems are being maintained effortlessly.” – Jeremy Eaton, Vice President, Connected Home, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies Nestle – The BabyNes system is Wi-Fi enabled and syncs with a smartphone to allow parents to track a baby’s nutrition or get an alert when a caregiver feeds the baby. Once integrated with Dash Replenishment, parents can replenish their formula capsules automatically. “BabyNes advanced nutrition system combines Nestle expertise in infant formula and its know-how in system development. We are excited to enrich this experience with Dash Replenishment and one of the first IoT projects within the company, allowing parents to track their baby nutrition automatically and simplify their formula purchase.” – Florian Jacquier, Marketing Manager, BabyNes US, Nestle WePlenish – WePlenish Java stores coffee-capsules, learns coffee drinkers’ consumption patterns, and—with Dash Replenishment—automatically reorders fresh coffee when supplies are low. Additionally, WePlenish Fetch stores pet food, learns pets’ consumption patterns, and—with Dash Replenishment—automatically reorders fresh pet food when needed. “We at WePlenish are thrilled at the overwhelmingly positive reaction we’ve received for our smart devices that take the guesswork out of keeping household staples, like coffee and pet food, in-stock. And we’re especially excited to team up with Amazon to leverage the Internet of Things technology and Dash Replenishment to bridge the gap between people’s busy lifestyles and their ongoing need to replenish every-day consumable products automatically.” – Ro Grosman, CEO, WePlenish \nAs Amazon and device makers innovate on the next generation of unique customer experiences built around Dash Replenishment Service, developers can enter an open challenge at www.hackster.io/contests/DRS to create something that helps advance the vision of automatic or low-friction replenishment. The grand prize is a 27” iMac 5K, $1500, and a personalized trophy. Project submissions are due December 31, 2016 at 11:59pm PT and winners will be announced by January 13, 2017. \nDash Replenishment APIs are open and available for integration into any device that can connect to the Internet. To get started integrating with Dash Replenishment Service, developers can use the easy-to-use quick-start wizard which helps configure devices or services and enable it to place orders from Amazon at www.developer.amazon.com/drs . \nAttendees at re:Invent, Amazon’s annual AWS conference in Las Vegas, can see Dash Replenishment-enabled devices from Brita, Behmor, Brother, Cleverpet, GE, Petcube, Samsung, and Whirlpool at booth #2440 in the Sands Expo November 29 – December 1. \nAbout Amazon \nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

      "text": "GeniCan, Honeywell, Nestle and WePlenish are the latest device makers to join the Dash Replenishment program\nNewest products to be integrated with Dash Replenishment are Whirlpool Smart Dishwasher and PUR Ultimate Bluetooth Enabled Faucet Filtration System\nThe latest Dash Replenishment devices available to preview at the Amazon Web Services re:Invent conference in Las Vegas starting November 29\nSEATTLE --(BUSINESS WIRE) (NASDAQ: AMZN)—Amazon today announced that a new set of diverse device makers joined the Amazon Dash Replenishment program ( www.developer.amazon.com/drs ), including GeniCan, Honeywell, Nestle and WePlenish. Dash Replenishment lets device makers enable their connected devices to automatically reorder physical goods from Amazon using a simple set of APIs—for example, a washer that reorders laundry detergent when supplies run low, or a coffee maker that reorders coffee when needed.\n“More and more customers are experiencing the magic of automatic reordering with Dash Replenishment. They avoid the hassle of tracking their household stock of essentials like dishwasher detergent, printer ink, and water filters—when they’re about to run out, Amazon automatically delivers a package to their doorstep,” said Daniel Rausch, Director of Amazon Dash. “We’re delighted by the momentum of the program and the feedback we’re hearing from device makers and developers—Dash Replenishment is simple to integrate and brings an innovative new customer benefit and business model to their connected devices.”\nAmazon also introduced the latest devices available with Dash Replenishment—the Whirlpool Smart Dishwasher and PUR Ultimate Faucet Filtration System. Available starting today, PUR’s new Ultimate Bluetooth enabled faucet filtration system tracks water consumption, filter usage and more straight from your smartphone, while providing healthier, cleaner, great-tasting water straight from your faucet. With Amazon Dash Replenishment, replacement filters are ordered automatically when needed. Also, available starting in December, the new Whirlpool Smart Dishwasher features Dash Replenishment and will automatically reorder dishwasher detergent when supplies run low.\n“Our newest Bluetooth enabled faucet mount filtration system is certified to reduce over 70 contaminants, including 99% of lead, 96% of mercury and 92% of certain pesticides,” said Deb Mudway, VP of Marketing, PUR at Helen of Troy. “To ensure customers always have healthier water and that the system is performing at an optimal level, we’re utilizing Dash Replenishment to track the filter’s status and provide replacement filters automatically—right when customers need them.”\nThere are dozens of brands already in the Dash Replenishment program—from global appliance manufacturers like Whirlpool and GE Appliances, to start-ups like Petcube and STYR Labs—which launched last year and has grown quickly. Amazon also recently announced the availability of Dash Replenishment in Europe with device makers Beko, Bosch and Siemens home appliances, Grundig, KYOCERA, Samsung and Whirlpool. Getting started is simple—device makers can use as few as 10 lines of code to start an integration. Today, the following device makers join the program:\nGeniCan – GeniCan installs directly in a customer’s recycle bin or garbage can and allows everyone in the home or office to add items to the household or office shopping list via barcode scanning and voice recognition. With Dash Replenishment, popular household and office supplies placed in the recycle bin or garbage will be reordered and delivered automatically. “GeniCan’s mission is to simplify the lives of busy families. GeniCan creates shopping lists easily and automatically, saving them time and money. Dash Replenishment saves our customers even more time by automatically ordering items. Now they can reorder items directly from their garbage can and recycle bin at the perfect time: the moment the item is being disposed of.” – Rob Griffin, Co-Founder, GeniCan Honeywell – Honeywell Connected Devices will calculate when a new air filter is needed and automatically reorder from Amazon, taking away the need for the homeowner to keep track of this intermittent and important replacement cycle. “Honeywell believes that the Internet of Things exists to provide conveniences like Dash Replenishment that make customers’ lives easier and ensures their systems are being maintained effortlessly.” – Jeremy Eaton, Vice President, Connected Home, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies Nestle – The BabyNes system is Wi-Fi enabled and syncs with a smartphone to allow parents to track a baby’s nutrition or get an alert when a caregiver feeds the baby. Once integrated with Dash Replenishment, parents can replenish their formula capsules automatically. “BabyNes advanced nutrition system combines Nestle expertise in infant formula and its know-how in system development. We are excited to enrich this experience with Dash Replenishment and one of the first IoT projects within the company, allowing parents to track their baby nutrition automatically and simplify their formula purchase.” – Florian Jacquier, Marketing Manager, BabyNes US, Nestle WePlenish – WePlenish Java stores coffee-capsules, learns coffee drinkers’ consumption patterns, and—with Dash Replenishment—automatically reorders fresh coffee when supplies are low. Additionally, WePlenish Fetch stores pet food, learns pets’ consumption patterns, and—with Dash Replenishment—automatically reorders fresh pet food when needed. “We at WePlenish are thrilled at the overwhelmingly positive reaction we’ve received for our smart devices that take the guesswork out of keeping household staples, like coffee and pet food, in-stock. And we’re especially excited to team up with Amazon to leverage the Internet of Things technology and Dash Replenishment to bridge the gap between people’s busy lifestyles and their ongoing need to replenish every-day consumable products automatically.” – Ro Grosman, CEO, WePlenish As Amazon and device makers innovate on the next generation of unique customer experiences built around Dash Replenishment Service, developers can enter an open challenge at www.hackster.io/contests/DRS to create something that helps advance the vision of automatic or low-friction replenishment. The grand prize is a 27” iMac 5K, $1500, and a personalized trophy. Project submissions are due December 31, 2016 at 11:59pm PT and winners will be announced by January 13, 2017.\nDash Replenishment APIs are open and available for integration into any device that can connect to the Internet. To get started integrating with Dash Replenishment Service, developers can use the easy-to-use quick-start wizard which helps configure devices or services and enable it to place orders from Amazon at www.developer.amazon.com/drs .\nAttendees at re:Invent, Amazon’s annual AWS conference in Las Vegas, can see Dash Replenishment-enabled devices from Brita, Behmor, Brother, Cleverpet, GE, Petcube, Samsung, and Whirlpool at booth #2440 in the Sands Expo November 29 – December 1.\nAbout Amazon\nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

      "title": "Smart Home For The Holidays: Honeywell Offers Tips To Maximize Connected Home Technology While Enjoying The Season",
      "text": " Honeywell\nHoneywell's Lyric™ platform helps homeowners simplify preparations and enjoy a comfortable holiday at home, or secure their homes while traveling\nMINNEAPOLIS Whether you are hosting family and friends or traveling to gatherings with loved ones this holiday season, Honeywell's ( NYSE: HON ) growing Lyric™ family of connected devices is built to keep your home cozy and your mind at ease. Honeywell Lyric products – from the Lyric T5 Wi-Fi Thermostat and Lyric Water Leak and Freeze Detector to the Lyric Security and Home Control System – make home security, comfort, and control simple whether you are there or on the road.\nTo help you maximize what smart, connected home technology can do during the holidays and year-round, the experts at Honeywell have a few tips and tricks:\nLower temps can be a crowd-pleaser. Between hectic moments in the kitchen and dining room and all the people moving from spot to spot, consider lowering the temperature more than usual – two degrees for every 10 people. Even though it may be cold outside, body and cooking heat can make normal heat settings feel warmer. Welcome guests with open arms. Hosting that relative who's always cold? Build scenes and shortcuts in the Lyric app to customize the performance of the thermostat for specific family members or events. Your guests will appreciate the extra hospitality, and you can save the settings for the next time they visit. Sleep soundly while away. Enjoy a holiday vacation on the road while knowing your home is safe and sound. Honeywell's Lyric thermostats can be set to vacation mode for further cost and energy savings while you're away. To mitigate potential damage that could result from frozen or burst pipes, place the Lyric Water Leak and Freeze Detector around high-risk areas to catch issues when they start, not after you get home. Shorter commands, longer parties. Honeywell's Lyric Security and Home Control System offers convenient voice control. A simple \"Hello, Lyric\" can get the home ready for holiday gatherings in no time. Adjust the lights, lock the back door, drop the shades, turn on cameras, and more; the Lyric system means you don't have to sacrifice comfort for security. Plus, the system's carbon monoxide and smoke detection provides additional peace of mind. \"With the hustle and bustle of the holiday season, the comfort of having a secure and controlled home can truly allow homeowners to relax and enjoy this time with friends and family,\" said Ted Booth , design director, Connected Home, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. \"Smart devices like the Lyric Water Leak and Freeze Detector or the Lyric Security and Home Control System give you the confidence that your home is safe while you're away, and the versatile Lyric T5 Wi-Fi Thermostat and Lyric Round Wi-Fi Thermostat also give you control wherever you might be. They are all expertly designed so you're never out of reach to check on the status of your home.\"\nHoneywell's family of Lyric products are also compatible with a number smart home ecosystems such as Apple HomeKit, Amazon Echo, Samsung SmartThings, and others so you can build and combine products to fit your needs.

      "text": "GREEN ISLAND, N.Y. (NEWS10) – Honeywell workers locked out of the Green Island facility appreciate the support of the community as the holiday season approaches.\nIt’s been six months since Honeywell workers in Green Island have been locked out of their jobs for what they called “corporate greed.” Workers have been rallying for a fair contract and to be able to return to their jobs.\nBut as the holidays approach, it’s taking a toll on them.\nWorkers said its been too cold for rallies, so they set up a tent also known as a “strike kitchen.” It’s where the locked out workers stay to keep warm. They’ve also received support from the community in the form of donations and food to help them get through.\nTimmy Vogt is one of the 40 locked out workers in New York. He and three other workers have stayed camped out in the test to lift each other’s spirits up.\n“The support has just been overwhelming,” he said. “That’s what keeps us going.”\nThey have been locked out since May 9, and they said they’re going to stand their ground until they get a fair contract. But they said what Honeywell offered is far from it.\n“I mean, it was a high deductible healthcare plan, but no more pensions, no more supplemental employment insurance, no more cost of living allowances, and no wage increases to help us with the high deductible healthcare plan,” Vogt said.\nA total of 360 workers have been locked out: 40 in New York and 320 in South Bend, Ind. Honeywell’s unionized workers in Green Island voted to approve a contract offer, but the offer was rejected by the workers at Honeywell’s plant in Indiana.\nAs a result, workers in Green Island will remain locked out with no planned negotiations. Honeywell is currently operating its plant using nonunion workers.\nVogt has been a loyal employee for close to 30 years. He said workers have always maintained a good relationship with the company and extended their contracts.\nWorkers got their last check a few months ago, and in the meantime, they’re finding ways to still celebrate the holidays like everyone else.\n“A lot of cash donations,” Vogt said. “We just got these harvest baskets from a local UAW – everything you can possibly imagine for Thanksgiving.”\nComparing Honeywell to Momentive and Verizon, Vogt said corporate greed has gotten the best of big companies.\n“I think Honeywell is one of the richest companies in the country right now, and they want us to pay these high deductible healthcare plans, and they don’t need to,” he said.\nThe locked out workers said they plan to have food pantries and toy drives. Anyone interested in helping the workers get through the holidays can send donations to the following address:\nUAW Local 1508\nP.O. BOX 1508\nGreen Island, N.Y. 12183",

(Paul Buckowski / Times Union) Honeywell workers remain locked out after vote 1 / 2 Back to Gallery \nGreen Island \nAlthough Honeywell Aerospace workers in Green Island voted to approve a new contract earlier this month, they remain locked out by the company after workers at a sister plant in Indiana voted down the proposal. \nHoneywell's unionized workers at its Green Island plant voted 30 to 6 to approve the contract offer after the company made concessions on health care costs and other issues. \nBut the offer was rejected overwhelmingly by union workers at Honeywell's South Bend, Ind., plant, which has more than 260 workers. \nThat means workers in Green Island will still be locked out of the plant, with no new negotiations planned. \nHoneywell sent a letter to Green Island workers, who are represented by United Auto Workers Local 1508, on Friday to thank them for their vote to approve the contract. \n\"I know this has been a difficult period and I appreciate you considering the facts in making your decision,\" the Nov. 18 letter states. \n\"Unfortunately, your colleagues in South Bend rejected the proposal and that means, at this time, you will not be able to return to work.\" \nlrulison@timesunion. com • 518-454-5504 • @larryrulison",

(NYSE: PHM ) has a bright future ahead. He is a buyer of the stock because he expects a big buyback from the company. \nDan Nathan believes that iShares Russell 2000 Index (ETF) (NYSE: IWM ) rallied too far and too fast. He wants to sell the stock. \nGuy Adami said that Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON ) is going to close the gap from when it preannounced a few months ago. © 2016 Benzinga.com.

      "text": " Honeywell\nHoneywell's Lyric™ platform helps homeowners simplify preparations and enjoy a comfortable holiday at home, or secure their homes while traveling\nMINNEAPOLIS , Nov. 22, Whether you are hosting family and friends or traveling to gatherings with loved ones this holiday season, Honeywell's ( NYSE: HON ) growing Lyric™ family of connected devices is built to keep your home cozy and your mind at ease. Honeywell Lyric products – from the Lyric T5 Wi-Fi Thermostat and Lyric Water Leak and Freeze Detector to the Lyric Security and Home Control System – make home security, comfort, and control simple whether you are there or on the road.\nTo help you maximize what smart, connected home technology can do during the holidays and year-round, the experts at Honeywell have a few tips and tricks:\nLower temps can be a crowd-pleaser. Between hectic moments in the kitchen and dining room and all the people moving from spot to spot, consider lowering the temperature more than usual – two degrees for every 10 people. Even though it may be cold outside, body and cooking heat can make normal heat settings feel warmer. Welcome guests with open arms. Hosting that relative who's always cold? Build scenes and shortcuts in the Lyric app to customize the performance of the thermostat for specific family members or events. Your guests will appreciate the extra hospitality, and you can save the settings for the next time they visit. Sleep soundly while away. Enjoy a holiday vacation on the road while knowing your home is safe and sound. Honeywell's Lyric thermostats can be set to vacation mode for further cost and energy savings while you're away. To mitigate potential damage that could result from frozen or burst pipes, place the Lyric Water Leak and Freeze Detector around high-risk areas to catch issues when they start, not after you get home. Shorter commands, longer parties. Honeywell's Lyric Security and Home Control System offers convenient voice control. A simple \"Hello, Lyric\" can get the home ready for holiday gatherings in no time. Adjust the lights, lock the back door, drop the shades, turn on cameras, and more; the Lyric system means you don't have to sacrifice comfort for security. Plus, the system's carbon monoxide and smoke detection provides additional peace of mind. \"With the hustle and bustle of the holiday season, the comfort of having a secure and controlled home can truly allow homeowners to relax and enjoy this time with friends and family,\" said Ted Booth , design director, Connected Home, Honeywell Home and Building Technologies. \"Smart devices like the Lyric Water Leak and Freeze Detector or the Lyric Security and Home Control System give you the confidence that your home is safe while you're away, and the versatile Lyric T5 Wi-Fi Thermostat and Lyric Round Wi-Fi Thermostat also give you control wherever you might be. They are all expertly designed so you're never out of reach to check on the status of your home.\"\nHoneywell's family of Lyric products are also compatible with a number smart home ecosystems such as Apple HomeKit, Amazon Echo, Samsung SmartThings, and others so you can build and combine products to fit your needs.

      "text": "Stockbyte \nLetter opener resting on air mail envelope \nIt took courage to reject the Honeywell contract offer (Tribune, Nov. 13). Knowing unemployment is running out with bills to pay, United Auto Workers Local 9 had the courage to take a stand. I retired in ‘96 after close to 42 years as a union employee. We have a chance to restore unions to an important part of society. My brothers and sisters showed that when they took that stand. \nHoneywell can claim all they want they bargain in good faith. I knew better back in my day (we were a powerful union then) and I know better now. Big companies tell salary employees they cannot discuss their salaries or they will lose their job. They do that because there is a definite difference in pay. I was told that by salary friends, who also told me they loved when we negotiated new contracts. They gained some as well. \nI strongly support my union’s effort to get a fair contract. I have watched Honeywell’s stock always doing well. They could work with our government to develop a good health care plan for all people, rather then use it as an excuse to bargain. I hope good can come from the courage they have shown. Barbara Kubisiak Niles Bias \nOn Oct. 11 The Tribune featured an article about City Clerk Kareemah Fowler wanting a $14,000 raise just after winning the job. Wow, more government workers wanting more money, while private sector job holders are hurting. \nBut the real reason I’m writing is the comment Regina Williams-Preston, a council member, brought up. Williams-Preston said, “If the person were a white male, I’m not sure it would be front page news ...” \nThis lady is unfit to serve as her true colors were shown. She interjects race and gender, when that doesn’t matter one bit. Her obvious bias is unacceptable. Gary Bednarek South Bend Beautiful \nThe article in Thursday’s Tribune missed an important nuance of the Notre Dame walkout gathering, which was that a noticeable number of staff and faculty joined with the students to provide their heartfelt support for undocumented students, and for Notre Dame to become a sanctuary campus. The thoughtful petition and peaceful gathering were organized and led by a small group of students but the community that came together was a beautifully diverse group of compassionate individuals of all ages. Liz Zapf South Bend SPEAK OUT \nThe Tribune invites readers to express their views in the Voice of the People column and in Viewpoint. \nLetters to the Voice of the People are limited to 200 words. Viewpoint columns should be no more than 700 words. \nBoth Viewpoint and Voice of the People submissions are subject to editing. All submissions must include the writer's full name, which will be printed. \nLetters, including e-mail, which do not include the writer's street address and telephone number will not be considered for publication. This information is kept confidential but is necessary for verification purposes. \nLetters may be mailed to the Editorial Department, South Bend Tribune, 225 W. Colfax Ave., SouthBend IN 46626; emailed to , faxed to 574-236-1765, or submitted through our online form here . \nDue to volume, it is not possible to print all submissions. Except in special circumstances, we do not print poetry or thank-you letters. We do not print letters announcing events to come, extensive quotations from other material, open letters or form letters. Most Popular",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) \nGREEN ISLAND, N.Y. (NEWS10) – Honeywell workers locked out of the Green Island facility appreciate the support of the community as the holiday season approaches. \nIt’s been six months since Honeywell workers in Green Island have been locked out of their jobs for what they called “corporate greed.” Workers have been rallying for a fair contract and to be able to return to their jobs. \nBut as the holidays approach, it’s taking a toll on them. \nWorkers said its been too cold for rallies, so they set up a tent also known as a “strike kitchen.” It’s where the locked out workers stay to keep warm. They’ve also received support from the community in the form of donations and food to help them get through. \nTimmy Vogt is one of the 40 locked out workers in New York. He and three other workers have stayed camped out in the tent to lift each other’s spirits up. \n“The support has just been overwhelming,” he said. “That’s what keeps us going.” \nThey have been locked out since May 9, and they said they’re going to stand their ground until they get a fair contract. But they said what Honeywell offered is far from it. \n“I mean, it was a high deductible healthcare plan, but no more pensions, no more supplemental employment insurance, no more cost of living allowances, and no wage increases to help us with the high deductible healthcare plan,” Vogt said. \nA total of 360 workers have been locked out: 40 in New York and 320 in South Bend, Ind. Honeywell’s unionized workers in Green Island voted to approve a contract offer, but the offer was rejected by the workers at Honeywell’s plant in Indiana. \nAs a result, workers in Green Island will remain locked out with no planned negotiations. Honeywell is currently operating its plant using nonunion workers. \nVogt has been a loyal employee for close to 30 years. He said workers have always maintained a good relationship with the company and extended their contracts. \nWorkers got their last check a few months ago, and in the meantime, they’re finding ways to still celebrate the holidays like everyone else. \n“A lot of cash donations,” Vogt said. “We just got these harvest baskets from a local UAW – everything you can possibly imagine for Thanksgiving.” \nComparing Honeywell to Momentive and Verizon, Vogt said corporate greed has gotten the best of big companies. \n“I think Honeywell is one of the richest companies in the country right now, and they want us to pay these high deductible healthcare plans, and they don’t need to,” he said. \nThe locked out workers said they plan to have food pantries and toy drives. Anyone interested in helping the workers get through the holidays can send donations to the following address: \nUAW Local 1508 ",

      "text": "Honeywell names Burj Khalifa as the 'smartest' building in the UAE By Published Thursday, November 24, 2016 \nHoneywell named the Burj Khalifa as the UAE’s “smartest” building at the Middle East’s first-ever smart building awards presentation at the Innovation Live! Summit today in Dubai. \nThe world’s tallest structure also received the award for the Middle East’s smartest “high-rise residential” building. \nThe summit, an official anchor event of the widely celebrated UAE Innovation Week, held in association with Dubai Chamber, addressed initiatives that are being spearheaded in the UAE to drive forward the National Innovation Strategy and UAE Vision 2021. \nUAE buildings, Latifa Maternity and Paediatric Hospital and City Centre Deira were also named at the event as the ‘Region’s Smartest Hospital’ and the ‘Region’s Smartest Retail Facility’ respectively. \nThe Honeywell Smart Building Score Awards program, developed by Honeywell, a Fortune 100 global technology and Internet of Things (IoT) leader, assessed the smartness of buildings across the region based on three key indicators – how green, safe and productive they are. \nThe awards recognize the leading smart buildings in the UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and assessed hotels, hospitals, educational and retail facilities as well as the leading high-rise office and residential buildings across the region. \nThe awards are designed to help drive innovation and the ‘smart cities’ agenda in the UAE and across the Middle East in line with regional development strategies. \nThe Burj Khalifa achieved the highest evaluation amongst all entries from the UAE, with impressive scores across all three smart building categories. \n“The UAE continues to make progress toward fulfilling its long-term sustainability and smart cities goals, and will continue to do so in line with the National Innovation Strategy and UAE Vision 2021,” said Norm Gilsdorf, president for Honeywell’s Middle East, Russia and Central Asia regions. \n“For us at Honeywell, a smart building is one that is connected, safe, energy efficient and, ultimately, helps improve the quality of life for its occupants and users. We are very pleased to recognize Burj Khalifa, City Centre Deira and Latifa Hospital’s dedication and investment in smart building solutions, and to highlight these best practice cases as an example to be followed around the region and the world.” \nThe 2016 awards are the culmination of the Middle East’s first Honeywell Smart Building Score (HSBS) – the first-of-its-kind universal framework designed for the comprehensive assessment of any building – launched in March of this year. \nThe HSBS framework was used to evaluate 620 buildings across seven major Middle East cities: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Doha, and Kuwait City. \nAs well as buildings in the UAE, the Honeywell Smart Building Score™ Awards also recognized smart building successes across the region, including: \n· Qatar: DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel – Winner, Region’s Smartest Hotel; Aspire Zone – Winner, Region’s Smartest Educational Facility; \n· Kuwait: Al Hamra Business Tower and Luxury Center – Winner, Smartest Building in Kuwait; \n· Saudi Arabia: King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC) – Winner, Smartest Building in Saudi Arabia. \nMajed Al Fahim, mall manager, City Centre Deira added: “We are delighted City Centre Deira has received the award for the ‘Region’s Smartest Retail Facility’. At Majid Al Futtaim our sustainability mission is to enhance people’s lives through sustainable real estate. We want to lead by example by applying international best practices across our shopping mall portfolio, and in so doing we hope to transform the economic and social development of the region. As Majid Al Futtaim strives to ‘create great moments for everyone, every day,’ we have a sustainability focus at the core of our business to help ensure that current and future generations continue innovating in developing and maintaining more environmentally-friendly buildings.” \n“It is exciting to see cutting-edge building technologies being adopted across the Middle East, putting the region at the forefront of global smart city development,” said Pete Costa, vice president, Honeywell Building Solutions, High Growth Regions. \n“There is a growing demand from building operators across the region for closer integration of building management systems such as energy control, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, access control, security and fire safety, to help meet their smart building objectives.”  ",

      "text": "Honeywell Creates Aircraft Controlled by Brain Power Honeywell Creates Aircraft Controlled by Brain Power November 25, 2016 \nAerospace engineers and neuroscientists use thought power to control aircraft. \nThe future of aircraft control may not depend on new controls, but the brain of the pilot instead. In a feature from Wired Magazine , aerospace and defense manufacturer Honeywell debuted their latest invention: an aircraft fitted to be controlled by thought. \nThe fitted Beechcraft King Air 90 had one set of standard controls along with the mind control software. Once airborne, a pilot fitted in a special cap consisting of 32 electrodes can give commands to the aircraft through the process of “event-related potential.” With the assistance of a display in the aircraft, the thought-powered pilot turns his focus on one of several visual commands, including climb, dive and turn. The software analyzes the brain activity and completes the corresponding command based on the pilot’s thoughts. \nWhile the technology is being tested now, scientists acknowledge that it is only in its infancy. Currently, the “fly-by-thought” technology is limited to updating commands in an autopilot system and could not be applied to more technical approaches, like commercial or combat flight. However, the technology shows potential for other uses in flight, including keeping pilots focused on controlling the aircraft through all phases of flight. \n“We know there are limitations to human performance,” researcher Santosh Mathan told Wired. “We hope to create more robust technologies to monitor cognitive states that might affect pilots.” \nThe new technology also backs previous research completed by the technology conglomerate. In April, Honeywell’s Thea Feyereisen published a paper about using cognitive research to help pilots in the air. \n“If we are able to make a prediction that the pilot is not paying attention or is potentially confused, we can engage an intelligent alerting system to reengage the pilot,” Feyreisen wrote in her paper. “Or in some cases, have the aircraft’s automation take over temporary control.” \n[Photo: agsandrew/Shutterstock]  ",

      "title": "Review: Honeywell Lyric T5 brings HomeKit and touchscreen control to an entry-level smart thermostat",
      "text": "Reddit \nHoneywell Lyric T5 is the company’s second take at a Wi-Fi thermostat with support for Apple’s HomeKit framework for smart homes. The latest member of Honeywell’s Lyric family of smart thermostats introduces a new design that now includes a touchscreen. \nPriced at $149.99, Lyric T5 is currently $50 cheaper than Honeywell’s Lyric Round HomeKit thermostat and $20 under ecobee’s budget version of its HomeKit thermostat. Read on for our full review of Honeywell’s new Lyric T5 Wi-Fi thermostat to see how it compares… \nHomeKit support for thermostats generally means the same thing across different models from various companies: you can control and automate heating and cooling with Siri and Apple’s new Home app . But there are differences in other aspects like price, appearance, and smart features that you control from accessory apps outside of HomeKit’s scope. \nHoneywell highlights four specific features with Lyric T5: 7-day scheduling or location-based temperature control Smart alert push notifications for extreme indoor temperatures and reminders to change your air filter Auto change from heating to cooling Smart response for setting heating and cooling temperatures at optimal times \nThese are fairly standard features for smart thermostats now so Lyric T5’s appeal is mostly in price and appearance if it fits your taste. \nMy summary of Honeywell’s pricier Lyric Round thermostat is that it hides HomeKit support in a rather traditional looking product; it doesn’t scream “smart gadget” and a lot of people like the ergonomics of rotating the dial to adjust the temperature. \nLyric T5 takes a different approach. \nI would describe Lyric T5 as much more gadget-y on the surface. It’s a mini computer display on your wall for controlling your indoor climate. \nIn this way, Lyric T5 is more comparable to ecobee ( reviewed ). The cheaper Lyric T5 features a slightly larger build with a noticeably bigger display. Both Honeywell HomeKit thermostats use the same Honeywell Lyric app . \nMy first complaint, however, is that the display quality is underwhelming. When off, the display is more reflective and further from black than ecobee’s. The black bezel around it especially emphasizes this, but it may not be noticeable if you’re upgrading from a very basic thermostat. \nInstallation and setup is on par with other smart thermostats; no major complaints to report. \nPriced on the lower end for Wi-Fi thermostats, Lyric T5 generally has a just-average build quality all around: it feels super light in your hand and the metallic-looking casing feels plasticky. \nI can imagine this same design in a pricier version that uses more premium materials, but it gets the job done for a reasonable price. \nWhen powered on, the display lights up to present dynamic on-screen controls. The body of Lyric T5 is fixed in place. No rotating a dial to change the temperature; instead you tap on-screen plus or minus buttons to raise or lower the target temperature. \nLyric T5 will display the current time plus Wi-Fi connection status on the top row, followed by target temperature and mode schedule. \nThe middle row includes buttons for lowering and raising the target temperature on either side. The current temperature is the largest number and totally centered. Labels for current mode (cooling, heating, auto) and fan (on, off, auto) sit in between. \nAlong the bottom you’ll find buttons for changing the mode and fan activity plus a centered menu button for changing settings. It’s a lot to read on a single screen (I could live without the Wi-Fi status symbol and use more icons and fewer words) and a totally different direction than the basic display on the Lyric Round. \nAccess to the menu from the thermostat is a welcomed change over Lyric Round. Other smart thermostats do this well but Lyric Round required most setting tweaks to happen in the smartphone app. Lyric T5 offers plenty to tinker with right on the thermostat. One thing I did find odd though is text truncation; it’s a reasonably large display so waiting for text to vertically scroll by didn’t feel too smart. \nLyric T5 does have one handy feature that I haven’t discovered on other smart thermostats: the ability to easily lock controls with a passcode. This could be useful if you don’t want your kids (or in-laws?) to bother the temperature. That scenario aside, I could see it being especially useful for public places where Lyric T5 is used. \nDid I mention that the display picks up fingerprints? OK, it’s not really a problem but you will notice fingerprints accumulating in the spots that you tap most often (like temperature up and down). Honeywell’s solution is a menu item for locking the screen for several seconds while you clean the display. This lets you remove any fingerprints without making it snow or boil inside. \nBeing a smart thermostat means you don’t actually have to interact with it that much. You can control temperature and modes from Apple’s Home app or Siri, and automation lets you schedule different temperatures and modes based on whether or not you’re at home, away, or time of day. \nYou can also set vacation schedules for specific dates into the future so Lyric T5 can take a break while you’re away and prepare your house for you before your return. \nWhen you’re not interacting with Lyric T5, the display hides the screenful of text and simply displays the current temperature and time. Where ecobee uses a presence sensor to detect that you’re near, Lyric T5 requires a tap of the display to bring back the full controls. \nLyric T5 and ecobee do share one flaw in common here: the display is just too bright when viewed from the side (like when walking by it down a hallway). The ecobee display leaks light from the top left while Lyric T5 is just generally bright. \nOne solution to this is to change the display brightness. The menu lets you choose between one of five brightness settings. I settled on the medium setting. \nOverall, Honeywell Lyric T5 is a decent entry-level smart thermostat and one of the more affordable ways to get into HomeKit and home automation. It’s priced below other HomeKit thermostats and delivers the same basic features like Siri control, setting scenes, scheduling activity, and remote access. \nThe more affordable price tag comes at the cost of build quality — specifically the display — but Lyric T5 is likely an upgrade over most basic thermostats that it will replace. Lyric T5 carries the same regular price tag as the much more basic iDevices Thermostat which makes it the best option in its price category (before considering sale prices). \nHoneywell Lyric T5 retails regularly for $149.99 from Amazon , Best Buy , Apple , and Honeywell.com . \n[Check out 9to5Toys for all the best Black Friday deals on electronics today as well.] Guides HomeKit \nHomeKit is Apple's home automation framework that lets you control connected accessories from your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and even Siri.",
