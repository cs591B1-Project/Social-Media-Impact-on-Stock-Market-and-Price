      "text": "Daniel Strohl on at 8:00 am Share \nHackaday, which normally focuses on Arduinos and other hardware hacking projects, recently examined the Lotus Seven and decreed it one of the most hackable cars . It’s always encouraging when the DIY/Maker movement discovers hot rodding. \n* Henry Ford might have been against replacing the four-cylinder engine in his mass-appeal cars during the Twenties, but that didn’t mean he stopped experimenting with alternative engine configurations, as we can see from Mac’s Motor City Garage’s recent look at the X-8 experimental engine that Ford tinkered with. \n* Here in the States, we’ve seen plenty of rebadging disasters, and it seems that scourge is just as bad if not worse in Australia. The Garage of Awesome recently ran down a few of the more egregious examples . \n* Usually, a Ferrari engine swap becomes a car’s most noteworthy feature. Not so with the Zlatko Cosmopolit , which, well, was certainly different. \n* Finally, for those who think that Rambler pioneered in-car sleeping, an entry in The Old Motor’s recent Nothing New Under the Sun series points out an early predecessor.",

      "title": "Fantasy NASCAR: Ford EcoBoost 400 Quick Picks",
      "text": "Yahoo / Fox / NASCAR: Quick Picks The 2016 Sprint Cup season comes to a close this weekend, which means it is go- or go-home time for fantasy owners in season-long leagues. The strategy you adopt for Sunday's season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway depends on where you stand in your league, but no matter how you approach the race, you will have the entire offseason to live the decision. If you are lucky enough to be at or near the top of your league, the decision is a little easier. Stick with the popular picks, and you should be able to be able to secure a strong final ranking. If you have some significant ground to make up, you have to decide if you want to roll the dice with a high-risk, high-reward lineup. In the Yahoo game, this means loading up on high-upside alternatives in each of the three driver tiers. If you pick the obvious choices, you might have a good week, but you have no chance of gaining ground. You have to go out on a limb and hope the popular picks have trouble. In the NASCAR game, your best chance to make a move is to score as many points as possible in the laps led and fastest laps run categories. Of course, this is the basic strategy most weeks, but you need to take it the next level. Consider punting two roster spots to load up on three drivers with a realistic chance to dominate the race. The biggest opportunity to gain ground comes in the FOX game. With the main source of bonus points coming through place differential, any driver starting deep in the field has the chance to be a high scorer. The problem is that many of the drivers who start in the back end up staying there. It's a risk that could be worth taking, and you could end up posting a huge score if you happen to hit on multiple sleepers. Check out a complete look at my season-long fantasy NASCAR lineups, and make sure to check out the Ford EcoBoost 400 from Homestead-Miami Speedway Sunday at 3:00 p.m. ET on NBC. Yahoo! Sports Fantasy Auto Racing Joey Logano (A) You can make a strong argument for Jimmie Johnson or Kyle Busch and even Kevin Harvick for that matter. However, Logano has momentum after his win at Phoenix, and he has been the best at 1.5-mile tracks down the stretch. He has three top-three finishes in four races at 1.5-mile tracks during the Chase, and he led the most laps at Texas a couple of weeks ago. Logano also led 72 laps and finished fourth at Homestead last year. Carl Edwards (B) Even if Edwards weren't running for the title, he would be a great option this weekend. He has finished 12th or better in nine of his last ten starts at Homestead, winning twice during that span. Starting in the top 10 with a title on the line, I'll be shocked if he doesn't end up in the top five. Kyle Larson (B) I'm going all out in the season finale, and Larson offers race-winning upside this weekend. He has cracked the top 15 in all three starts at Homestead, logging a top five finish last year. I'm not too worried about his 24th-place starting spot. He started 23rd last year before charging to a top five finish. Alex Bowman (C) I've used up all of my starts for Chase Elliott, but fortunately, Bowman has been running as well as any C-List driver has all year. He nearly won last weekend at Phoenix, and he has been a consistent top 10 driver at the 1.5-mile tracks. Expect him to end the year on another high note. NASCAR.com Fantasy Live Kevin Harvick ($28.00) Harvick grabbed the pole for Sunday's race, and two of the last three drivers to start on the pole at Homestead have led well over 100 laps. Harvick himself owns a series-leading 6.1 average finish in the last ten races here, and he has led 40-plus laps in both starts with Stewart-Haas Racing, winning in 2014 and finishing second last year. Don't be surprised if Harvick dominates the laps led and fastest laps run categories on his way to being the top scorer. Martin Truex Jr. ($26.75) He has been a force at the 1.5-mile tracks all year, leading by far the most laps in the series. Truex has also been excellent at Homestead throughout his career, so another dominant showing is a real possibility, especially after his sixth-place run in qualifying. Kasey Kahne ($23.50) I was tempted to focus solely on the laps led and fastest laps run categories, but Kahne looks like a slam dunk pick thanks to his upside through place differential. He starts 29th, but he has cracked the top 10 in all four races at 1.5-mile tracks during the Chase, posting a +13.5 average place differential in those races. Kahne could easily gain 20-plus spots and finish as one of the top scorers. Ty Dillon ($13.25) Going with a mid-priced option like Kahne allows me to spend up a bit on my cheaper drivers, and Dillon is a safe bet to post a solid scorer. He qualified back in 34th, but he has been able to run in and around the top 20 in a majority of his starts. He should provide an excellent point total for the price by the time place differential is factored in. Regan Smith ($7.00) He doesn't have a huge ceiling by any means, but Smith is as cheap as they come, and he should be able to finish with a modest point total. He starts 35th, but he finished inside the top 30 in the last three races at 1.5-mile tracks, finishing 26th or better twice. At the very least, I know he isn't going to lose a bunch of points. FOX Fantasy Auto Racing Kyle Larson ($11,500) In three starts at Homestead, Larson has never finished outside the top 15 while posting a +12.3 average place differential. After qualifying 24th, he should fall right in line with those averages again this weekend. He should be one of the bigger movers, and 40-plus fantasy points is well within reach. Joey Logano ($11,400) Logano doesn't start deep in the field, but his 13th-place qualifying run does give him some room to pad his score through place differential. He finished fourth at Homestead last year, and he has finished third or better in three of the races at 1.5-mile tracks during the Chase. Kasey Kahne ($10,500) There is a good chance Kahne finishes as the top scorer this weekend. He qualified back in 29th, but he has cracked the top 10 in all four races at 1.5-mile tracks in the Chase, posting a combined place differential of +54 in those starts. Kahne is one the short list of drivers who could surpass 50 fantasy points this weekend. Jimmie Johnson ($10,300) He struggled a bit in qualifying, but starting 14th simply gives Johnson some added upside through place differential. He has seven top 10s in the last ten races at Homestead, including three straight, and I expect him to have one of his best runs at the track with a championship hanging in the balance. Alex Bowman ($5,000) For the minimum price, Bowman is a worthwhile option based only on his potential for a solid finish. The fact that he starts 19th and has some upside through place differential only bolsters his value. He has been a top 10 driver on a weekly basis as a sub for Dale Earnhardt Jr., especially at 1.5-mile tracks. Share on Facebook",

      "text": "Latest revision as of 16:02, November 19, 2016 Needles' F-150 4x4 nearly hits a Rolls-Royce. \nThe Ford F-150 was part of the F-Series of vehicles manufactured by Ford . Note: The following section is considered non-canon or is disputed in canonicity . \nIn 1984 , Douglas J. Needles mocked Marty McFly over the fact that he owned a 1978 Ford F-150 4x4, and Marty didn't even own a car. \nHis intention was to anger Marty so that he would try to steal the DeLorean DMC-12 that Doc had hidden in his garage . Needles had hoped to get Marty to unlock Doc's garage so he could steal the car himself. Non-canon or disputable information ends here. \nIn 1985 , Needles and his gang wanted to drag race his F-150 against Marty and Jennifer Parker in Marty's Toyota Hilux . In the original timeline , Marty crashed into a Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud I . In an amended timeline , Marty decided not to race Needles, and realized that he would have hit the Rolls-Royce if he had.

      "text": "Ford tells Trump no Lincoln SUV production going to Mexico Fri Nov 18, 2016 12:34am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy David Shepardson \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move a Kentucky plant to Mexico, but the firm said it informed him the decision was to keep one vehicle in U.S. production. \nOn Thursday, Trump posted on Twitter: \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" \n\"He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,\" the President-elect tweeted. \nBut Ford has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019. \nThis is not the first time Trump's comments about Ford production have been called into question. Last year, he took credit for Ford moving work from Mexico to Ohio, while the automaker had already made the decision in 2011 - long before Trump announced a run for president. \nSpokeswoman Christin Baker said Ford \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky\". \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she added, in a statement. \nThe company builds both the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky, which Trump refers to as the \"Lincoln plant\" and where Ford employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. Continued... ",

      "text": "  \nOn Thursday night, President-elect Donald Trump tweeted to his 15 million followers that Ford would no longer move a plant from Kentucky to Mexico. He portrayed it as a breakthrough in which he played a decisive role. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nThe reality was far more nuanced. The Washington Post's economic policy correspondent Jim Tankersley followed up with Ford to see what was going on; within an hour and a half, he had written an article and tweeted what he knew. So:*Ford never planned to move Ky. plant to Mex*It did plan to move one product line there*It won't do that now*Trump overstated this. \n— Jim Tankersley (@jimtankersley) November 18, 2016 \nWhile Tankersley took the time to consult Ford on the matter, partisan blogs didn't bother with such reporting niceties. \"Gateway Pundit\" ran the President-elect's claims promptly and uncritically with a headline proclaiming \"The Trump Effect: Ford Calls Donald Trump - Says Plant Will Not Move to Mexico will Remain In Kentucky.\" \nWorryingly, this version spread widely. According to data extracted from Buzzsumo, at the time of writing the Gateway Pundit story had received 29,700 Facebook engagements — almost twice as many the most popular article that actually bothered to include Ford's version of the events, a piece by ABC News. \nOn Thursday night, Jesse Singal of New York Magazine found this all \"really really scary.\" In a tweetstorm that was widely shared, Singal wrote that the mixture of a President-elect making up that he saved a plant and hyperpartisan sites reaching huge audiences by carrying the misleading claim made this a \"completely post-truth\" moment. 1/ Something really really scary appeared to have just happened and I hope people understand why it matters amidst all the other chaos. \n— Jesse Singal (@jessesingal) November 18, 2016 \n\"Obviously it isn't new for a politician to lie about what s/he did or didn't do,\" Singal told Poynter. \"But the speed with which those lies can now spread through filter-bubbled social media is new, and it's scary.\" \nMany people agreed with his conclusion. Even more boiled down this message further. Trump distorting the facts was proof perfect of this being a post-truth era, as a Twitter search makes clear: \nThese tweets come after months of post-truth headlines across the world and at the end of a week when the Oxford Dictionaries elected the term its word of the year . \nPerhaps due to my own confirmation bias, I am quite unimpressed with the post-truth trope. It implies there was once a golden age when politics and the media were dominated by facts (ignoring almost identical terms popularized 11 years ago ), falsely presumes that people will never change their minds when fact-checked on a partisan issue and absurdly reduces political action to purely rational choices. \nTo misquote something Voltaire never said , however, while I disagree with the post-truthers, I will defend their right to use that term. \nYet they should try to be coherent. Invoking post-truth at every turn risks negating the underlying warning. In the process of doing so, its proponents risk further sullying any shared sense of how we call out misleading political claims. \nSnopes founder David Mikkelson wrote this week that there is a difference between fake and misleading news — and that conflating the two makes fighting either much harder. In a useful taxonomy of misinformation , Claire Wardle of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism lists six different categories of \"fake news.\" \nThe tendency to call everything inaccurate \"fake news,\" however, seems to be rising. And the consequences risk being devastating, as John Herrman writes for The New York Times. \n'Fake news' as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold. The fake news narrative, as widely understood and deployed, has already begun to encompass not just falsified, fabricated stories, but a wider swath of traditional media on Facebook and elsewhere. Fox News? Fake news. Mr. Trump’s misleading claims about Ford keeping jobs in America? Fake news. The entirety of hyperpartisan Facebook? Fake news. This wide formulation of 'fake news' will be applied back to the traditional news media, which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things true, even when they are. \nIt appears that we are in a similar position with the post-truth sobriquet. \nSure, Donald Trump was misleading about the Ford decision; but The Washington Post Fact Checker, which hasn't shied away from calling out Donald Trump's whoppers, didn't even dole out the full \"Four Pinocchios\" at its disposal for this claim. \nWhile not a committed post-truther, Singal says that \"things are worse than they've ever been from a fact-checking standpoint ... there have always been rumors and conspiracy theories, but no, things have never been this bad in the United States.\" \nSingal also notes that disagreement has boiled down to the most basic of facts, like the actual election result. \"If we can't even forge agreement on something as simple and straightforward as who won the popular vote,\" he says, \"we're screwed.\" \nThe combined force of hyperpartisan pages with enormous audiences and the erosion of trust no doubt made 2016 a turning point for fact-checking in the United States. \nYet the almost nihilistic message of post-truth (if it were a gif, it would be this one ) requires more evidence than a lying President and a sprawling universe of misleading news sources. \nThe ratings that fact-checking sites like PolitiFact and The Washington Post Fact Checker use are far from scientific. But they do force journalists to abide by a method that recognizes truth ought to be evaluated on a spectrum. \nA method should also apply to calling out post-truth. If the term aims to capture the brazen rejection of reality when faced with indisputable evidence of the exact opposite, then Trump's braggadocious tweet does not qualify. A more convincing example may be the transition's team denial that President-elect Trump has called for a registry of Muslim-Americans despite videos of him saying just that. \nPost-truth is not a synonym for \"inaccurate.\" Worse, using it in that way is an aggression to the very concept — truth — that is the object of contention.

In this capacity he writes about fact-checking, trains fact-checkers (online and offline) and organizes conferences on fact-checking. He previously served as Managing Editor of Pagella Politica and FactCheckEU, respectively Italy's main political fact-checking website and the EU's first multilingual crowd-checking project. He has presented fact-checking segments on Italian TV and led seminars on fact-checking around the world. Before becoming a fact-checker he worked for the United Nations and the Italian Institute for International Political Studies.",

      "text": "This week’s race: Ford EcoBoost 400 Traditional Name: None Other Notable Names: Ford 400Homestead-Miami Speedway has been on the schedule since 1999, but the first four races were essentially on a completely different track. This course began as a 1.5-mile version of Indianapolis Motor Speedway before getting transformed into a true oval. Both of those configurations had flat banking.In 2003, Homestead became the first 1.5-mile track to employ progressive banking and even though Las Vegas Motor Speedway has since added it, this track stands alone without a comparative because of its shape as a true oval.Since it is one of NASCAR’s unique tracks, it is a fitting venue for the Championship finale.For the longest time, 500-mile races were standard. In order to fit races into a more comfortable three-hour timeframe, these events have slowly been lowered to 400 miles and most of the new events have been added with that as their upper limit. All in all, the Ford EcoBoost 400 is a well-rounded test of a driver’s ability. 10 best drivers at Homestead Over the past three races, these drivers have the best average finish on this track, (current configuration only).Last three races average finish at Homestead: 4.00Career avg. finish: 13.5 in 8 attemptsKeselowski is one of five drivers entered this week with a three-race string of top-10s. What is most notable about that streak is that those are his only results in that range. He flipped the right switch in 2013.Last three races average finish at Homestead: 4.33Career avg. finish: 6.2 in 13 attemptsAnchored by a victory in 2014 that also gave him the championship, Harvick has been almost perfect in the past two years at Homestead. He finished second in this race last year, and that is part of an eight-race streak of top-10s.Last three races average finish at Homestead: 5.00Career avg. finish: 12.0 in 13 attemptsKenseth scored his worst result in three years last season; he was seventh after starting 19th. Prior to that, he had two more top-10s in three starts so this has been one of his better tracks in recent years. It did not start that way, however, because it took four attempts to crack the top 20.Last three races average finish at Homestead: 6.00Career avg. finish: 10.7 in 11 attemptsLast year was the first time in his career that Hamlin failed to finish better than he started at Homestead. It would have been impossible since he won the pole, but he had plenty of room to fall with a 10th-place finish.Last three races average finish at Homestead: 9.00Career avg. finish: 13.7 in 13 attemptsJohnson has never won at Homestead and common opinion is that is because he never had to. On the other hand, he had nothing to lose in his last two efforts but still managed to finish only ninth. Add one more of those in 2013 and he has a three-race streak at that mark.Last three races average finish at Homestead: 9.33Career avg. finish: 17.7 in 7 attemptsLogano joins Johnson as the only two Chasers in the top 10, three-year averages this year. It bears noting that their numbers are almost identical, but Logano has a pit row mistake in 2014 to mar his results. Last year he was fourth after starting second. 7. Kyle Larson (tied with Truex) Last three races average finish at Homestead: 11.00Career avg. finish: 11.0 in 3 attemptsTop-10s in inaugural attempts on this track are hard to achieve. Most of the drivers listed below with strong starts came in the first race on this configuration in 2003, so that puts Larson’s 15th in perspective. He has only improved with time. 7. Martin Truex Jr. (tied with Larson) Last three races average finish at Homestead: 11.00Career avg. finish: 10.2 in 11 attemptsTruex has been great on 1.5-mile tracks this year and there is no reason to believe he will stumble this week. He needs a solid top-five to secure his position on this list next year, however, because his last two races ended outside the top 10.Last three races average finish at Homestead: 11.67Career avg. finish: 16.6 in 13 attemptsNewman’s last six races have alternated top-10s with results in the mid-teens. Only one of those top-10s came in the past three races, but it was one position shy of a championship when he finished behind Harvick in the inaugural knockout-style championship in 2014.Last three races average finish at Homestead: 13.33Career avg. finish: 19.5 in 12 attemptsBusch was an all or nothing racer for the first six years on this configuration with top-fives in alternating years with results outside the top 35. His last four efforts have been more consistent with three efforts of eighth through 11th.Last three races average finish at Homestead: 15.67Career avg. finish: 21.1 in 11 attemptsBusch falls outside the top 10 in three-yea averages this week because of a broken axle in 2014 that sent him home 39th. He deserves to be treated as a favorite, however, on the strength of last year’s championship finale victory.Last three races average finish at Homestead: 19.00Career avg. finish: 9.3 in 12 attemptsEdwards has the worst three-year average finish among the Chasers, but like his teammate in the No. 18, he had one bad race in 2014. He finished 34th with crash damage, but every other effort on this track ended in a top-15.",

      "text": "Ford production in Kentucky is at the center of controversy after Donald Trump tweeted that he spoke with Ford chairman Bill Ford \"will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico.\" But Ford quickly released a statement clarifying that Trump was referencing the production of a specific vehicle, not the entire plant. (Photo: By Michael Clevenger/The CJ)\nPresident-elect Donald Trump tweeted Thursday that a Kentucky Ford Motor Co. assembly plant would not be moving to Mexico, but the company released a statement clarifying that the messages were referencing the production of a specific vehicle.\nIn two tweets sent out around 9 p.m. Thursday night, Trump said that Ford Motor chairman Bill Ford had told him the company would not be moving one of its Kentucky plants to Mexico.\n\"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,\" the first tweet read.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 Ford, which makes the Ford Escape compact SUV and the MKC in Louisville, said last year it planned to move MKC production to another plant so it could increase production of the Escape, the Detroit Free Press reported . The automaker said at the time that no jobs would be lost in Louisville because of plans to boost Escape production.\nTrump doubled down on his claim in a second tweet 15 minutes later, writing, \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great state of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\"\nFord sent out an official statement late Thursday night clarifying Trump's statement, saying that the tweets were in reference to continuing production of a specific Lincoln vehicle in Kentucky, not an entire assembly plant.\n\"We continue to engage with President-elect Trump’s team – and the new Congress – as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the U.S. and creating American jobs – building on the $12 billion we have invested in our U.S. plants and the nearly 28,000 U.S. jobs Ford has created in the past five years. Ford continues to employ more American autoworkers and produce more American made vehicles than anyone.\nToday, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky. We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\nWe will have more details to share on our future plans at the appropriate time.\"​\nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker said Ford's plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico was the \"likely\" location for the MKC in 2019, the Free Press reported. Baker did not say why the automaker changed its plans for the Lincoln SUV. She did confirm that Bill Ford spoke with President-elect Trump yesterday.\nOn Friday, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer's office bypassed questions about Trump taking credit for the Lincoln production line staying in the city.\nBut Fischer \"is glad to see Ford continuing its commitment to Louisville,\" spokesman Chris Poynter said.\n► ON THE GO? Download the CJ app for iPhone, Android and iPad\nFord operates two plants in Kentucky, both located in Louisville — the Kentucky Truck Plant and the Louisville Assembly Plant. It is unclear which plant Trump was referring to in his tweets, since both locations manufacture Lincoln automobile parts. The Courier-Journal previously reported that the Louisville Assembly Plant would be temporarily shut down for two weeks in October to keep production levels in line with demand.\nAt 10 p.m. Thursday, Kentucky governor Matt Bevin tweeted, \"2 days ago, @RealDonaldTrump told me he was working w/ @Ford to keep smaller vehicle production in KY & USA. Tonight they delivered... TY!\"\nFord has repeatedly denied that it was planning to close any U.S. plants that would result in workers losing their jobs. Since July 2015, the automotive maker has disputed Trump's comments about its investments.\n2 days ago, @realDonaldTrump told me he was working w/ @Ford to keep smaller vehicle production in KY & in USA..Tonight they delivered...TY!\n— Governor Matt Bevin (@GovMattBevin) November 18, 2016 ► READ MORE: St. Matthews to consider billboard moratorium\n► READ MORE: Churchill Downs plans more homestretch suites\n► READ MORE: Woman who killed dog wins damages for car\n► READ MORE: CJ names new executive editor\n► READ MORE: Reputations ride on Wake Forest ‘security breach’\nReporter Danielle Lerner can be reached at dlerner@courier-journal.com or 502-582-4042.

      "text": "Sprint Cup Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead: Preview and prediction By Ted Fleming/Fansided Nov 19, 2016 at 2:01p ET 0Shares The NASCAR season finale at Homestead promises a lot of drama with a number of championships on the line, not to mention the most important of all, the Sprint Cup title. \nThe 2016 NASCAR season will officially come to an end late Sunday afternoon at Homestead-Miami Speedway and there could be three different celebrations after the Ford EcoBoost 400, a race winner, and owner’s title, and the one that will garner the most attention, a Sprint Cup champion. \nKevin Harvick, who was eliminated from the Chase last week, sits on the pole and being thought of as a possible spoiler, but at this stage of the game what he does is irrelevant. He can finish first or dead last because the highest finisher of the Championship Four will wear the crown. \nJoey Logano, Carl Edwards, Kyle Busch and Jimmie Johnson are on a mission. Logano and Edwards are out to win their first Sprint Cup title while Busch is looking to be the first back-to-back titlist since Johnson ran off five in a row from 2006 to 2010. Johnson, on the other hand is out for history because this would be his seventh overall and tie him with legends Dale Earnhardt and Richard Petty for the most in the history of the sport. \nLogano (No. 22 Ford) has the lowest season driver rating at 83.5 and comes into the finale with three wins, 15 top-5 and 25 top-10 finishes although he has the best average finish at 10.7. \n“Just making sure the car is able to move around, do different things,” Logano said about what he needs to do in Sunday. “We want to run the top and bottom because we need to pass some cars here so that is the main thing on the agenda now.” \nEdwards (No. 19 Toyota) holds the best rating at 109.4 (tops in Sprint Cup overall) with three victories, 9 top-5s and 18 top-10s with a 13.1 average finish. \n“I don’t think any of us really want to start that far back,” said Edwards about all four title hopefuls being bunched together at the start. “We probably had a lot better hopes than that. It is what it is. But yeah, I don’t know what to think of it, really.” \nBusch (No. 19 Toyota) is Edwards’ teammate and made it into the Championship Four on points whereas the other three had wins. His stat line: 95.5 rating, four wins, 17 top-5, 24 top-10 and 11.6 average finish. \n“We are all pretty tight,” Busch added about the closeness of the Championship Four. “Throw a blanket over each other, we’re all right there. At least one camera can probably catch us all when we turn off into Turn 1.” \nJohnson (No. 48 Chevy) was the first to qualify for the championship and comes into Homestead-Miami with a 96.8 rating tied for the most wins with Busch. He has an average finish of 14.3 with 10 top-5 and 15 top-10 finishes. \n“From 14th to fifth it seems pretty easy to pass, week in and week out,” Johnson said about starting back in the field. “It’s those last four or five cars that are always so tough to pass. It’s no different this week than the others, but at least the first half of the race would have been easier in starting up front.” Next: Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead Miami Speedway: Kevin Harvick wins pole \nWHAT TO LOOK FOR: The Grand Marshall for the Ford EcoBoost 400 is actor Justin Hartley while NCIS Star Wilmer Valderrama is the Honorary Starter. \n“I’ve always been a fan of racing so being an Honorary Starter for a NASCAR race is incredible,” said Valderrama. “I’m looking forward to waving the green flag and hearing the cars fly by as they compete for the 2016 Sprint Cup Series championship.” \nTRACK INFO:",

      "text": "facebook Ford CEO Mark Fields claimed the company would move all small car production to Mexico, and since then, President-Elect Donald Trump has trumpeted the claim that he will keep those jobs in America, specifically when campaigning in states that house Ford plants currently. (The Washington Post and David Ramos/Stringer via Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   5:50 PM \nThroughout this year's presidential primaries and general election, President-elect Trump repeatedly criticized companies for moving factories, production and jobs to Mexico. He specifically called out Ford Motor Company for a plan to move automotive production and jobs there and threatened to impose a 35 percent tariff on those vehicles. This shows a misunderstanding not only of the actual facts in the Ford plant case, but of how tariffs work. \nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE. \nCertainly, Ford did itself no favors in September when company President and CEO Mark Fields remarked on CNN and in a statement that, long-term, Ford would move all small car production to Mexico with an unclear message about why and how there would be no net loss of American production and jobs. This announcement also may have had an effect on the political winds in the Rust Belt, and particularly in Ohio and Michigan, two states intertwined both with presidential cycles and the auto industry in equal measure. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nThe confusion came to a head when Ford announced this week that the auto giant would not move Lincoln MKC production from its Louisville, Kentucky assembly plant to Mexico, seemingly at odds with its own best business interests. This decision, in turn, gave President-elect Trump enough ammunition to close out this little automotive and political passion play. \nTrump hit the Twitter machine Thursday night, claiming credit for turning around Ford Motor Company's plans to ship production and jobs off to Mexico. Trump's tweet, identical to his misleading narrative begun earlier this year, implied that Ford's entire Louisville Assembly Plant – he incorrectly called it a \"Lincoln\" plant – was under threat of closing with jobs leaving. He then claimed credit for saving the plant and the jobs therein. \nThis was, and is, untrue. The uncolored facts Ford builds the Escape SUV and Lincoln MKC, which share a common platform, at the Kentucky plant that Trump mentioned in his tweet. The problem for Ford has been that Escape production has fallen behind demand while MKC production has exceeded it. (Bloomberg via Getty Images) \nFord builds both the Escape and Lincoln MKC SUVs at its Louisville, Kentucky plant, though at a ratio of twelve Escapes to every one MKC. \nFord is having trouble keeping up with Escape demand while the public's appetite for the MKC is meager. Solution? Shift that MKC production capacity to a plant that can produce the incremental volume so that Louisville can build more Escapes. \nThe plant with the extra volume just so happens to be in Mexico. Ford's overall production picture is so brisk that no other Ford plants that produce medium-sized SUVs in North America can handle it. This is a good problem to have. \nBut President-elect Trump chose to use this tiny morsel of misrepresentation as a whip to flog Ford Motor Company as a poster boy for an American jobs-and-manufacturing exodus narrative. \nTo be crystal clear, Ford never planned to move or close the plant. Or lose any jobs. At the time of the initial announcement on the MKC and Escape production shift, United Auto Workers official, Jimmy Settles, even stated to the Detroit Free Press that the Louisville plant \"will not lose employment.\" \nBut let's step back a bit, and understand how long-range plans work within the automotive industry. How the auto industry works Despite the President-Elect's reports of jobs being shipped overseas, Ford has put $12 billion into its U.S. plants and added roughly 28,000 jobs in the past five years and makes more vehicles on U.S. soil than any other company. (Bloomberg via Getty Images) \nBusiness and government operations are not changed with a phone call. Or a tweet. Car companies function with 5-, 10-, and 20-year operational timelines where the variable factors like currency fluctuations, labor law, technology shifts, legislative change and compliance all swim upstream against the vicissitudes of the market like fuel prices, design trends and what vehicle Taylor Swift will be caught driving home from the gym next Tuesday. \nYet, the planning of a car factory is like a giant ship. One does not turn around a 1,000-foot long cruise vessel in mere minutes. \nWith this change in Ford's Louisville Plant plan and Trump's taking credit for it, no American jobs, nor any American production has been saved. In fact, Ford has put $12 billion into its U.S. plants and added roughly 28,000 jobs in the past five years and makes more vehicles on U.S. soil than any other company. But Ford's been lax in stating so publicly during a period of open tension between themselves and candidate, now President-elect Trump.. Globalization is irreversible Like it or not, globalization in the auto industry is both inevitable and irreversible. Have you ever stopped to consider how 'American' your car or truck really is? Turns out that in many circumstances, heading to a Japanese dealership like Toyota or Honda may get you a more 'American' car than at your local GM or Ram dealership. (Bloomberg via Getty Images) \nWe also need to understand definitions better, especially the definition of an “American” car. Based on an index created by the Kogod School of Business at American University, the Honda Accord , a Japanese brand and nameplate, has more domestic content – is more American – than Jeep's Wrangler Unlimited and Cherokee ; Ford's Taurus, Explorer and Mustang; and Chevy's Colorado pickup and Camaro. \nIn a similar vein, would you be shocked to learn that the American-built Mercedes-Benz GLS SUV has more American content than the Ford Fusion ? Between the Chevy Silverado and Toyota Tundra pickup trucks, which is more American? The “Japanese” one. \nThe globalization of the automotive production universe is well under way and started before NAFTA, before Clinton, even before Reagan. Volkswagen started U.S. production of Rabbits (later named Golfs) and other models at an ill-fated Westmoreland, Pennsylvania plant, a former Chrysler facility, in 1978. (Its quality was sub-standard and the factory was shut down in 1988, but that's beside the point.) Car companies struggle to profitably build small vehicles in America Ford is hardly the first to shift small car production out of America because of declining or non-existent profits due to the SUV craze, but they're using the space freed up by these assembly lines to invest in more jobs and equipment building vehicles Americans actually want to buy: trucks and SUVs. (Ford) \nFord does, indeed, plan to shift all of its small-car production for this North American market to Mexico, as it cannot build small cars profitably in the United States, but neither can most manufacturers. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has also stated that all of its small passenger car production in the United States will soon end. Production of vehicles with larger profit margins, including pickup trucks and SUVs, remains or will be added in America, however. \nAnd that's the story of all manufacturing. Price-sensitive sectors of every market have moved production to where the cost of labor and various materials used allow a lower cost per unit and therefore a palatable margin to market the product within the U.S. But medium and high-priced sectors continue to employ American factory workers. \nFord also plans to move the small Focus and C-Max production to Mexico from Wayne, Michigan. But that is only to make room for the new, additional upcoming Ranger pickup and the new Bronco SUV to start production in 2019 in that same Wayne, Michigan plant. There will be no net loss of jobs – the 4,500 workers at Wayne are staying – and projected sales of the Ranger and Bronco are less swayable to fuel price whims as Focus and C-Max models. Those jobs in Michigan, therefore, are likely a bit more stable over the long run. \nChairman Bill Ford Jr. specifically met with President-elect Trump over the summer to explain Ford's position on its plans, but Trump either cannot understand the simple economics of such decisions, or he willingly misleads the public about them. Either way, his response and self-aggrandizing claim of credit for keeping MKC production in Kentucky is bad for America. Ford is actually one of the best-managed car companies in the world Ford's shift to build profitable vehicles in America as opposed to small cars that would do better elsewhere has been a successful one, and will continue to be in the forseeable future. In fact, in terms of American automakers keeping jobs stateside, Ford is best in the business, so perhaps the President-Elect is best off turning his scorn elsewhere. (Bloomberg via Getty Images) \nFord's decision to favor truck, SUV and larger car production in its U.S. facilities makes sense. Small vehicles simply aren't as profitable as large vehicles and building them in the U.S. is vastly more expensive. Switching U.S. facilities over to higher-profit and more stable product segments ensures that those manufacturing jobs will stay in the U.S. Between final assembly plants, engine production, stamping, and all manufacturing, Ford operates 24 plants within the United States. \nThis all comes at a time when Ford is looking deep into a future with new modes of transport and much greater shared vehicle use, combined with the ever-present requirement to stay profitable. \nRegardless, it looks as though President-elect Trump and Ford's Chairman, Bill Ford, spoke this week. The company stated \"we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky. We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.” \nMeanwhile, we remember what Bill Ford said to reporters –including this one –in September, \"Ford is everything that [Trump] should be celebrating about America. We pulled ourselves up by our bootstraps, we paid back our [loans], we're healthy again, we’ve been adding jobs in the U.S. and we are the largest manufacturer of cars and trucks in the U.S.\" \nSo, did Ford cave this week to hot political winds emanating from 5 th Avenue? We won't likely ever really know. But keeping Lincoln MKC production in Kentucky rather than cranking out more copies of the hotter selling Ford Escape seems like a bad business decision. \nAnd Trump is taking credit for it. Tags:",

      "text": "The real story behind that exaggerated Ford tweet from Donald Trump The Washington Post 3 hrs ago Jim Tankersley © Nicholas Kamm/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump speaks to the media following a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in Washington on Nov. 10. During a conference call with analysts Thursday morning, Ford Motor Company Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks was asked how President-elect Donald Trump's trade policies might affect the automaker's decisions on investing in Mexico or in the United States.\nShanks said that he couldn't speculate on trade. He pivoted, instead, to Trump's plans to cut taxes and spend more on infrastructure, saying they could “build a stronger, more vibrant, growing economy and provide an environment where it makes economic sense to build back up manufacturing jobs here.”\nLess than 11 hours later, Trump was bragging on Twitter that he helped stop Ford from moving an entire factory from Kentucky to Mexico.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016\nThe tweets were exaggerated: Ford's contract with the United Auto Workers prevents it from shutting down the factory in question, the Louisville Assembly Plant, or from laying off workers there without engaging further talks with the union. The company clarified that it had merely decided not to move production of a single vehicle, the Lincoln MKC, out of Kentucky.\nAt the same time, the company said Friday that the coming Trump presidency did give it an incentive to keep Lincoln MKC in Kentucky. “We are encouraged the economic policies he will pursue will help improve U.S. competitiveness,” Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said, “and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S.”\nThe events stirred a flurry of confusion on social media that lasted through Friday, and they underscored two fast-emerging realities for U.S. business in the coming Trump era. It appears that large companies such as Ford could, at least to some degree, be set to invest more domestically if Trump and Congress cut its taxes. It also appears that Trump will seize opportunities to claim credit for those investments, and to cast them as victories even if they result in no new U.S. jobs.\nIn the case of Ford in Louisville, “No one really thought that plant would close,” said Bernard Swiecki, a senior automotive analyst at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, who tracks North American automakers' investment decisions. “These moves are not at all akin to saving the plant. That was never under consideration by anyone.”\nWhat was known publicly before Thursday's developments was that Ford had already announced plans to move production of the Lincoln MKC out of Louisville. Its contract with the UAW called for it to make up that lost production — and ensure no jobs would be lost in Louisville — by producing more Ford Escapes, the other vehicle assembled in the plant. The Escape is the far more popular model: Ford has sold more than 258,000 of them this year through October, compared with just under 21,000 MKCs.\nThe contract does not say where the MKC production would go. Ford officials said late Thursday that they had intended to move it to Mexico. Union officials said Friday that the company had never indicated that to them. Reports last year suggested a plant in Chicago might pick up the MKC production.\nFord did announce plans to move a different line of production — small cars, including the Ford Focus — from Michigan to Mexico. It said it would ramp up other production in Michigan to ensure no workers lost their jobs from the move. Trump criticized that decision repeatedly on the campaign trail, but the company reaffirmed this week that it is going forward with that move.\nSo why did Ford cancel a relatively modest, previously unannounced plan to move Lincoln production to Mexico, while maintaining its larger-scale plan to move small-car production there?\nPrivately on Friday, Ford officials suggested that their decision to keep Lincoln production in Louisville was influenced in part by the likelihood that Trump will sign a large cut in corporate income tax rates and move to scale back fuel-economy standards issued under President Obama, which automakers have called onerous. Those policies would affect the financial calculus the company uses when deciding which cars to produce and where to produce them.\nSwiecki suggested another factor: Ford's softening sales growth. The company is on track to sell fewer vehicles this year than it did in 2015, a demand reduction that could mean there was no need to move the MKC production to enable the plant to churn out more Escapes.\nA joint letter to Louisville plant workers from UAW and Ford officials on Friday seemed to hint at that.\n“The company's plan has been to balance out the current model of the Lincoln MKC to allow for additional capacity for the Escape,” it read. “The company has since reevaluated that plan based on changing business conditions.” The letter said the company's chairman, Bill Ford, had spoken with Trump on Thursday and “let him know of the change in plans.”\nSome automotive writers suggested that with the move, Ford officials were offering Trump concessions in hopes of dissuading him from following through with a campaign threat to levy tariffs of up to 45 percent on imports from countries such as Mexico and China. In his call with analysts, Shanks, the company chief financial officer, suggested the company does not know how seriously to take those threats.\n“I don't want to speculate” on the impacts of Trump's trade policies, Shanks said. “I just don't know, we don't know, none of us know.”\n“So,” he continued, “I just keep coming back to the fact that it's clear that at least from the campaign positions that Mr. Trump took that they are focused on growth, they are focused on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., they are focused on building a stronger, more competitive infrastructure, which I think that's great for the country, as well.”\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Ford tells Trump no Lincoln SUV production going to Mexico Reuters News Share Tweet \nBy David Shepardson \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday Ford Motor Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr told him the automaker would not move production at a Kentucky plant to Mexico. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" Trump posted on Twitter. \"He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico.\" \nFord has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019. \nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker said late on Thursday the automaker \"confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky.\" \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she added, in a statement. \nThe U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border. \nThe company builds the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville assembly plant in Kentucky, where it employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. \nFord has endured scathing criticism from Trump over its Mexican investments for nearly 18 months. \nThe Republican candidate repeatedly said during his long presidential campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs on any Ford vehicles made in Mexico. \nFord said in April 2015 it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. \nIn September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. \nFord has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move - and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars. \nIn October, Bill Ford said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive attacks on the automaker's investments in Mexico. \nFord said Trump's criticism was \"infuriating\" and \"frustrating\" because of the company's extensive investments and employment in the United States. \n(Reporting by Eric Beech and David Shepardson; Editing by Sandra Maler and Bill Rigby)",

      "text": "Not since Ford's Theater has so much furor erupted from a politician attending a play. With Vice President-elect Mike Pence, an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage who has supported diverting federal funding from HIV and AIDS groups to conversion therapy, seated in the audience for Friday night's performance of Hamilton, certain lines resonated even more than usual.\nUSA TODAY\nTrump asks 'Hamilton' cast who 'harassed' Mike Pence to apologize\nAudience member Christy Colburn tweeted that when Alexander Hamiton and the Marquis de Lafayette quipped, \"Immigrants, we get the job done during The Battle of Yorktown , the crowd gave them a standing ovation. And later, during the song What Comes Next? , King George III actor Rory O'Malley had to stop the song briefly after the crowd \"went nuts\" at the line \"When your people say they hate you, don't come crawling back to me\" and ask them to stop booing.\nI'm at #Hamilton and so is Mike Pence. Crowd booed him like crazy, and gave a standing O at the line \"immigrants we get the job done\" 1/2\n— Christy Colburn (@christymoose) November 19, 2016 By now, you've likely seen the video from the curtain call, when Brandon Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr, addressed Pence on behalf of \"diverse Americans who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us\" and asked the vice president-elect to \"uphold our inalienable rights and work on behalf of all of us.\"\nPresident-elect Donald Trump demanded the cast apologize for harassing Pence, but by all accounts, both Dixon and the vice president-elect were respectful of one another. In fact, Dixon even thanked the Indiana governor for listening to what he had to say.\n@realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen.\n— Brandon Victor Dixon (@BrandonVDixon) November 19, 2016 Mike Pence actually stood and listened. It is Trump who took to Twitter with his foolishness - typical. #BoycottHamilton\n— Ella-Writer (@Ella_writer) November 19, 2016 None of it persuaded Trump, who jumped on Twitter again Saturday night after a day of meetings with his transition team and high-profile guests at his golf club in New Jersey. \"Very rude and insulting of Hamilton cast member to treat our great future V.P. Mike Pence to a theater lecture. Couldn't even memorize lines!\" Trump wrote. But within minutes, he deleted it.\nThe president-elect of the United States just deleted a tweet going after a Broadway play for the 12th hour straight https://t.co/SU17q2pMBd pic.twitter.com/DPTyZsG2Q8\n— Marlow Stern (@MarlowNYC) November 20, 2016 Even creator Lin-Manuel Miranda weighed in during a break from doing Moana interviews in the U.K., complimenting the cast for how they handled the situation and agreeing with Trump that everyone should be welcome at the theater.\nProud of @HamiltonMusical . Proud of @BrandonVDixon , for leading with love.\nAnd proud to remind you that ALL are welcome at the theater.\n— Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) November 19, 2016 And original cast member Christopher Jackson, who gives his last performance as George Washington Sunday , summed up his cast's statement as \"citizens appealing to their future VPOTUS with respect and clarity.\"\nJust LISTEN to the words! Ain't nothing but Citizens appealing to their future VPOTUS! WITH RESPECT and CLARITY! #AMENandAMEN https://t.co/J6UhrwW1FP\n— Christopher Jackson (@ChrisisSingin) November 19, 2016 But social media has not settled down since, erupting with hashtags like #BoycottHamilton . (Proponents of that movement will have to be very patient: the show is sold until September 2017.)\nHere is a sampling of the most viral comments on Twitter.\nDesperate times, desperate measures Frozen star Josh Gad , who originated the role of Elder Cunningham in The Book of Mormon , provided some context in a Twitter statement. \"I know the booing upsets some of you,\" he wrote. \"But this is what happens when you run on a platform of hate.\" While he says he personally wouldn't boo someone at a theater, \"this feels different. There are swastikas popping up everywhere, a cabinet of civil-rights offenders and deniers being built, and a leader who has placed a white nationalist by his side. These aren't attempts at unity. These are warning shots to everyone who isn't white, straight and extreme.\"\nIf we're talking about apologies ...

      "text": "SHARE \nIn early 2009, when GM and Ford were stumbling toward uncertainty and the Detroit auto show had all the glitz of an insurance convention, no one could have imagined that the Motor City would ever again produce cars like the GT350 and the Grand Sport . But it’s well known that car companies can be at their best when they’re anxious about keeping the lights on. Both of these cars came from a hunger to prove that world-class virtue can be more than marketing talking points. And so, eight years after the doom and gloom, we have these two unimaginably good V-8 machines and a $64,000 question. \nBelieving that there’d only be space for one of these cars on the list, our staff was divided, with the GT350’s backers on one side and the Grand Sport’s on the other. In the final summation, each car had the votes to clinch its spot, but the rift helped us arrive at a deeper understanding of both. \nLast year, the Corvette missed the 10Best cut after the C7’s two-year run. Perhaps the intoxicating influence of the 650-hp Z06 would have helped the Corvette gain enough votes for another year, yet by then GM had raised the price above our $80,000 cap. Enter the Grand Sport, which mates the regular Corvette powertrain to the chassis of the mighty Z06 while avoiding a major price increase. You can park a GS in your driveway for as little as $66,445, exactly $10,000 more than the base car and nearly $15,000 less than the Z06. \nTo keep the price semi-attainable, the Grand Sport uses the Corvette’s naturally aspirated small-block V-8. A dry-sump 6.2-liter unit with 460 horsepower, this pushrod engine spins to its 6600-rpm rev limiter with ferocity. It has gobs of power. Every stomp on the accelerator requires you to take in a lungful of air to counteract the shove of the V-8’s fierce torque and instant response. Celebrate it. Hear it transform organic molecules into motion, warmth, and smooth purrs. It’s a welcome reprieve from a world turning to narcoleptic turbo fours that refuse to redline. \nNo one wrote a single paean to the Z06’s absent supercharger because no one missed it. It’s telling that no staffer suggested that the Grand Sport could use more horsepower. With a seven-speed manual, 60 mph is only 3.9 seconds away and the quarter comes up in 12.3 seconds at 117 mph. A pull through the first two gears is all that’s necessary to understand how and why Chevrolet has built more than 10 million small-blocks. Effortless power is as persuasive today as it was in 1955. \nFord’s take on the modern V-8 has four cams and 32 valves, and it revs to an implausible 8250 rpm. This engine completely transforms the Mustang. And while no one will mistake the GT350’s V-8 for crooner Michael Bublé, we have to acknowledge that it’s coarse by design. Testing director Don Sherman called it “two 2.6-liter four-cylinder engines with no balance shafts but a common crankshaft.” The car’s most vocal detractor continued: “Hanging six tuned mass dampers under the car is not effective at turning this 8250-rpm Voodoo into a smooth, sweet V-8.” \nWe all heard it: The GT350 busts through its first two gears quickly enough that the raspy moans it makes at low revs are fleeting spine tinglers. Running to 60 mph takes only 4.3 seconds. But rev it out in higher gears, and the engine sounds as if it’s munching on itself, ready to rocket some pistons through the hood. None of that comes through the exhaust, however. From outside, the GT350 sounds the way a Jackson Pollock painting looks. It’s a splattering of sound—fiery, shocking, angry, and somehow perfect. \nBelow 4000 rpm, the GT350 lacks the Corvette’s deep well of torque. Swing the needle past 8000 rpm and tap the 526 horsepower, though, and it’s hard not to think that maybe that Chevy V-8 belongs in a pickup. Double the GT350’s $56,770 price, and there’s still nothing as exotic as this Romeo, Michigan–built engine. \nPainted red with big white stripes running down the center, the Grand Sport and the GT350 might as well be draped in Old Glory. Both models differ from their lesser kin with broader fenders that cover up wider tires. Neither car has many surprises inside. We’re accustomed to both, from the Corvette’s smell of polyester resin to the Mustang’s huge touchscreen and toggle switches. Ford uses standard Recaros that fit as if they’re custom-made. Chevy asks $1995 for its Competition Sport seats, but we prefer the standard chairs. \nWhile some seats may be optional on the Grand Sport, the serious hardware—magnetorheological dampers, an electronically controlled differential, and the Z06’s larger brakes—comes stand­ard. For the rare occasions when Michelin Pilot Super Sports aren’t enough, the track-ready Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires and carbon-ceramic brakes of the Z07 package will knock your cochlea into the creek. Even without the Z07 package, stops from 70 mph take 136 feet, and grip on the skidpad is an unbelievable 1.13 g’s. These are supercar numbers that move into the hypercar realm when the Vette is equipped with the Z07’s exotic rubber and brakes. In the real world, it’s nigh on impossible to regularly tap the Grand Sport’s potential. \nA GT350R is a 1.10-g car, but the plain GT350 that Ford sent us this year has less cling, just 0.98 g. But this “low-grip” GT350 has more than enough stick to eviscerate our 13.5-mile loop. Its handling limits are approachable and usable. Perhaps you’ve seen videos of Mustangs leaving car shows with disastrous results. Chalk it up to lack of skill. If you know what you’re doing, there’s simply no treachery to this chassis (or that of any new Mustang); it does what you expect of it safely, predictably, and obediently. \nPart of the appeal of the 10Best loop is that it’s as unsettling as stepping on a Hot Wheels in the dark. In short order, the lumpy and bumpy asphalt exposes chassis-tuning compromises. To get a Mustang to 0.98 g, Ford fits stiff springs and adjustable dampers and steamroller-wide rubber. The resulting ride is impossible to ignore in this setting. Deputy editor Daniel Pund, who placed the GT350 just outside his 10Best list, said: “I may have been more willing to accept the GT350’s overly stiff ride when it was the hot new thing last year. But I can’t ignore that it was actively trying to throw me off the road.” \nEven with a 1.13-g chassis, the Corvette’s magnetorheological dampers and spring rates offer more compliance and a slightly calmer experience. It’s gifted—possibly too gifted—with grip and composure that can make it seem aloof. Throwing this supercar down a narrow byway like our 10Best loop requires a frustrating amount of restraint. The solution is to go faster, but what this car really needs is a track. It’s the complete opposite of a narrow-tire car like the Mazda MX-5 Miata, which slips and grips and remains engaging even at lower speeds. “Too much for the road,” became a common refrain as editor after editor stepped out of the Corvette. Life beyond 1.10 g’s is both a blessing and a curse. \nFor some staffers, the Grand Sport was on the bubble. Deputy online editor Dave VanderWerp called it “a little too extreme and track-oriented for something that is probably mostly used for ­Sunday morning, back-road drives. Megacapable, yes—see its Lightning Lap performance —but it just didn’t flow down the 10Best roads like some of the more fun cars, including the Miata, or, frankly, the Shelby GT350.” \nHowever, senior editor Jared Gall had the opposite take: “The only reason not to put it on the list is that it is too fast and too capable to exploit on public roads. To leave it off the list would be to ­punish Chevrolet for making it too good.” Enough staffers agreed with Gall’s logic for the Grand Sport to secure its position on the list because, although its performance borders on being unusable, criticizing it for being a supercar means ignoring the fact that it’s the greatest performance deal available today. \nThe GT350 also found its spot on our 10Best roster because it is a transcendent machine that looks like a Mustang. Senior technical editor and GT350 advocate K.C. Colwell summed it up: “There are arguments for both, but the GT350 is by far the most complete car. I drove the Grand Sport and the GT350 back to back twice to come to that conclusion. The Ford is more desirable, more practical, and cheaper.” It’s okay with enough of us that the engine isn’t “easy listening.” You don’t want a car like that to make the equivalent of elevator music anyway. As unnecessary as it is wonderful, this engine transforms the Mustang into something esoteric. \nIf all this means that we have two V-8 cars with similar missions and pricing, so be it. We’re living in halcyon days for performance cars, and our votes reflect that. After all, the big V-8 deserves its own place next to jazz and the television sitcom as a uniquely American art form. ",

      "text": "The real story behind that exaggerated Ford tweet from Donald Trump The Washington Post 8 hrs ago Jim Tankersley © Nicholas Kamm/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump speaks to the media following a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in Washington on Nov. 10. During a conference call with analysts Thursday morning, Ford Motor Company Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks was asked how President-elect Donald Trump's trade policies might affect the automaker's decisions on investing in Mexico or in the United States.\nQuote: s in the article Ford Motor Co F\n▼ 11.76 -0.11 -0.93% Shanks said that he couldn't speculate on trade. He pivoted, instead, to Trump's plans to cut taxes and spend more on infrastructure, saying they could “build a stronger, more vibrant, growing economy and provide an environment where it makes economic sense to build back up manufacturing jobs here.”\nLess than 11 hours later, Trump was bragging on Twitter that he helped stop Ford from moving an entire factory from Kentucky to Mexico.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016\nThe tweets were exaggerated: Ford's contract with the United Auto Workers prevents it from shutting down the factory in question, the Louisville Assembly Plant, or from laying off workers there without engaging further talks with the union. The company clarified that it had merely decided not to move production of a single vehicle, the Lincoln MKC, out of Kentucky.\nAt the same time, the company said Friday that the coming Trump presidency did give it an incentive to keep Lincoln MKC in Kentucky. “We are encouraged the economic policies he will pursue will help improve U.S. competitiveness,” Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said, “and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S.”\nThe events stirred a flurry of confusion on social media that lasted through Friday, and they underscored two fast-emerging realities for U.S. business in the coming Trump era. It appears that large companies such as Ford could, at least to some degree, be set to invest more domestically if Trump and Congress cut its taxes. It also appears that Trump will seize opportunities to claim credit for those investments, and to cast them as victories even if they result in no new U.S. jobs.\nIn the case of Ford in Louisville, “No one really thought that plant would close,” said Bernard Swiecki, a senior automotive analyst at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, who tracks North American automakers' investment decisions. “These moves are not at all akin to saving the plant. That was never under consideration by anyone.”\nWhat was known publicly before Thursday's developments was that Ford had already announced plans to move production of the Lincoln MKC out of Louisville. Its contract with the UAW called for it to make up that lost production — and ensure no jobs would be lost in Louisville — by producing more Ford Escapes, the other vehicle assembled in the plant. The Escape is the far more popular model: Ford has sold more than 258,000 of them this year through October, compared with just under 21,000 MKCs.\nThe contract does not say where the MKC production would go. Ford officials said late Thursday that they had intended to move it to Mexico. Union officials said Friday that the company had never indicated that to them. Reports last year suggested a plant in Chicago might pick up the MKC production.\nFord did announce plans to move a different line of production — small cars, including the Ford Focus — from Michigan to Mexico. It said it would ramp up other production in Michigan to ensure no workers lost their jobs from the move. Trump criticized that decision repeatedly on the campaign trail, but the company reaffirmed this week that it is going forward with that move.\nSo why did Ford cancel a relatively modest, previously unannounced plan to move Lincoln production to Mexico, while maintaining its larger-scale plan to move small-car production there?\nPrivately on Friday, Ford officials suggested that their decision to keep Lincoln production in Louisville was influenced in part by the likelihood that Trump will sign a large cut in corporate income tax rates and move to scale back fuel-economy standards issued under President Obama, which automakers have called onerous. Those policies would affect the financial calculus the company uses when deciding which cars to produce and where to produce them.\nSwiecki suggested another factor: Ford's softening sales growth. The company is on track to sell fewer vehicles this year than it did in 2015, a demand reduction that could mean there was no need to move the MKC production to enable the plant to churn out more Escapes.\nA joint letter to Louisville plant workers from UAW and Ford officials on Friday seemed to hint at that.\n“The company's plan has been to balance out the current model of the Lincoln MKC to allow for additional capacity for the Escape,” it read. “The company has since reevaluated that plan based on changing business conditions.” The letter said the company's chairman, Bill Ford, had spoken with Trump on Thursday and “let him know of the change in plans.”\nSome automotive writers suggested that with the move, Ford officials were offering Trump concessions in hopes of dissuading him from following through with a campaign threat to levy tariffs of up to 45 percent on imports from countries such as Mexico and China. In his call with analysts, Shanks, the company chief financial officer, suggested the company does not know how seriously to take those threats.\n“I don't want to speculate” on the impacts of Trump's trade policies, Shanks said. “I just don't know, we don't know, none of us know.”\n“So,” he continued, “I just keep coming back to the fact that it's clear that at least from the campaign positions that Mr. Trump took that they are focused on growth, they are focused on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., they are focused on building a stronger, more competitive infrastructure, which I think that's great for the country, as well.”\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "November 18, 2016 Trump on Twitter: Ford won’t move Lincoln assembly to Mexico Associated Press \nDETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won’t be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn’t have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn’t know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It’s possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,” Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Pin it Share DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co <F.N> Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told investors on Thursday it is too early to assess the impact of the election of Donald Trump U.S. president on its business over the next several years. Shanks said that Ford officials are communicating with the Trump transition team and that he was encouraged by the \"change in tone\" in Trump's comments since his election last week. Shanks, speaking with Wall Street industry analysts in New York, said he expects that the North American Free Trade Agreement will be revised in a Trump administration. He said, however, that he is encouraged that the president-elect has said it wants the U.S. economy to grow, and that any changes to NAFTA would be \"pro-growth, overall.\" The Ford CFO said the automaker also expects a Trump administration to alter regulations on fuel economy and emissions, adding that while Ford still expects those regulations to stiffen in the next few years, that the pace toward more stringent fuel economy and emissions targets may slow. The market's reaction to Trump's election has not been overly dramatic, which tells him, Shanks said, that there are expectations of positive effects on the U.S. economy. \"Look at how people seem to be responding, acting, now that (Trump) needs to govern as opposed to campaign. I think it's different. So let's just wait and see,\" said Shanks. (Reporting by Bernie Woodall; editing by Chizu Nomiyama, G Crosse) Reblog",

      "text": "By Christina Rogers and John D. Stoll\nOne of the U.S. auto industry's best-known figures extended an olive branch to President-elect Donald Trump, saying the car maker won't move certain production to Mexico -- the latest business leader to thaw tension stemming from concerns about the incoming administration's stance on trade.\nBill Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford and chairman of Ford Motor Co., called Mr. Trump on Thursday to tell him the company was reversing course on a plan to eventually relocate Lincoln sport-utility production from Kentucky to a factory south of the U.S. border, the company confirmed.\nThe largely symbolic change of plans signals Ford's willingness to work with Mr. Trump on making U.S. manufacturing more attractive to multinational companies, even as the auto maker sticks with its $1.6 billion construction of a new small-car plant in Mexico.\nMr. Trump overplayed Ford's decision in a tweet about the conversation he posted to his Twitter account Thursday night, suggesting Ford would no longer relocate a Lincoln plant from Louisville to Mexico. The Dearborn, Mich., company only wanted to move one model to Mexico in this case, and it never intended to close the Kentucky plant or cut jobs, according to company and union officials.\nOfficials working on Mr. Trump's transition team didn't respond to requests for comment.\nMr. Ford's outreach reflects a broader move by business leaders to mend fences with the president-elect after a brutal campaign. Following the election, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields sent a congratulatory letter to Mr. Trump, despite the New York businessman's repeated criticisms of the auto maker's plan to relocate Ford Focus production from Michigan to Mexico.\nOther companies made similar pushes. International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty published an open letter to Mr. Trump this week offering support for his policies, even after the president-elect criticized IBM and other companies for moving U.S. jobs overseas.\nDish Network Corp. Chief Executive Charlie Ergen has said a Trump administration would bring a \"lot of positives for business,\" including infrastructure spending and reduced corporate-tax burdens. Caterpillar Inc., a maker of construction and mining equipment, applauded Mr. Trump's pledge to boost infrastructure spending.\nSome of the outreach has come with a downside. Sneaker maker New Balance Athletic Inc. publicly backed the president-elect's antitrade stance, welcoming Mr. Trump's election as a reprieve from the policies of President Barack Obama. That support, however, incited a social-media backlash, with hundreds of consumers posting that they would throw out their sneakers.\nMr. Trump's complaints concerning Ford reflect broader criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which some blame as the culprit for job losses in manufacturing sectors like automobiles. Mr. Trump has proposed a 35% tariff on autos and other products imported from low-cost countries such as Mexico.\nMr. Fields said earlier this week the tariffs would hurt his industry and the broader economy, but said he and the president-elect share the same objective of boosting the U.S. economy.\nThe tariff \"would be harmful, I think, to the entire industry and the economy and therefore we want to engage in a very productive set of discussions,\" he said. He noted Nafta has increased the interwoven connections shared by auto industries in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nMany in the auto industry say untangling the trade pact would be costly and complicated because of the multilayered connections between U.S. and foreign suppliers and assembly points. The tens of thousands of parts that make up any vehicle often come from multiple producers in different countries and travel back and forth across borders several times.\nMore than half the parts in the Ford Focus, for instance, are made outside the U.S. and Canada, including 20% in Mexico. Ford also ships in some of the car's engines from Spain and transmissions from Germany.\nWorries over Mr. Trump's Nafta stance are shared outside the auto industry. Martin Richenhagen, CEO of farm-equipment maker Agco Corp., said he is concerned about Mr. Trump's repeated support for trade protectionism.\n\"That would be a nightmare if we make life difficult for imports and exports,\" Mr. Richenhagen said.\nIn making the Lincoln decision, Ford said it was \"encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nFord's change of plans is similar to arrangements it has been making with the United Auto Workers for decades as the union lost members amid perpetual restructuring efforts by Detroit's Big Three.\nThe auto maker had planned to move the Lincoln MKC, a small sport-utility sold in low volumes that shares components with the popular Ford Escape.\nThe factory wasn't in danger of closing or shedding jobs. Rather, Ford was moving MKC production to make room for building more Escape crossovers, the company's second-best selling model.\nStill, keeping the Lincoln output in Kentucky means Ford will make future investments in tooling or other factory enhancements needed to make the MKC in the U.S., rather than reroute that capital to Mexico. And it offers reassurance for its hourly workers, about one-third of whom are estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump, according to preliminary UAW figures.\nEven though Ford builds more than 10 Escapes in Kentucky for every Lincoln that rolls down the assembly line, keeping the MKC nameplate in an American factory is meaningful to the UAW, which has sided with Mr. Trump's Nafta position. Mr. Trump's ability to identify with concerns held by workers in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio helped propel him to victory on election day in early November.\nThe UAW appeared reluctant to declare Ford's change in plans a victory. In a joint statement with the company, UAW officials reiterated that moving Lincoln output would have allowed for more Escape production but the company \"has since re-evaluated that plan based on changing business conditions.\"\nFord Escape sales have slumped in recent months and the once-booming U.S. auto market is cooling off, with analysts saying industry sales have already peaked.\nFor the union, retaining production of even the lowest-volume of cars is a priority because it provides a hedge if the market shifts away from one of the other products UAW workers assemble. This is an argument UAW officials have repeatedly made as Ford and other auto makers, including Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors Co., sink deeper investments into Mexico for the production of vehicles, including less-profitable small cars.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com and John D.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST):\n11:15 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico.\nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news.\nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015.\nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky.\nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.\n8 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker.\nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon.\nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs.\nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow.\n7:20 p.m.\nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser.\nThat's according to a senior Trump official.\nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition.\nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president.\nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity.\nBy Julie Pace\n7:10 p.m.\nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence.\nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust.\nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details.\n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting.\n6:02 pm\nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up.\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\"\nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process.\nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members.\n4:30 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information.\nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest.\nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team.\nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing.\nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\"\n4:26 p.m.\nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration.\nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies.\nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\"\nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic.\n3:27 p.m.\nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump.\nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced.\nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\"\nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\"\nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump.\n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\"\nBy Julie Bykowicz\n3:15\nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats.\nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington.\nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\"\nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\"\n3:07 p.m.\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill.\nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition.\nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care.\nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can.\nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser.\n2:40 p.m.\nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris.\nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov.\nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\"\nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\"\nThat version was later removed from the website.\nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment\n2:15 p.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists.\nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups.\n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here.\nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair.\n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\"\nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name.\n1:50 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower.\nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union.\nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election.\nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.\n1:40 p.m.\nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump.\nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower.\nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned.\nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\"\n10:47 a.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\"\nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders.\nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray.\n10:44 a.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\"\nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor.\nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs.\nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach.\nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family.\n10:10 a.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon.\nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy.\nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon.\nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\"\nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises.\nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington.\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated.\n8:50 a.m.\nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration.\nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower.\nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country.\n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\"\n8:05 a.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\"\nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency.\n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday.\n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\"\nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.\n ",

      "text": "By David Shepardson\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co , one of Donald Trump's prime corporate targets on the campaign trail, offered the President-elect a chance to claim a victory late on Thursday by informing him it would not shift production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle to Mexico from Kentucky.\nTrump jumped at the chance, claiming in a tweet that he had \"worked hard\" with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to keep the plant in Kentucky, even though Ford had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border.\nIn letting Trump claim a victory, Ford made what appeared to be a calculated, public appeal to the next president in an attempt to soothe concerns about outsourcing jobs and to gain some leverage with the new administration as the automaker pushes for favorable policy changes in Congress.\n\"Ford is not going to make a decision on a purely political basis,\" said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan.\n\"They are going to make a decision that makes business sense, economic sense and if it happens to align with political goals, that's great,\" she said.\nThe No. 2 automaker in the United States is not the only company in Trump's crosshairs working out how to deal with the new political reality in Washington.\nApple Inc , criticized by Trump for not building products in the United States, is studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, Japanese news service Nikkei reported on Thursday.\nApple did not reply to a request for comment on Friday.\nJOBS = VOTES\nTrump campaigned heavily on bringing jobs to the United States and attacking companies such as Ford that plan to take some production overseas, a message that resonated in the economically ravaged center of the country.\nFord gave Trump plenty of ammunition, confirming in September that all of its remaining small-car production in the United States, at its facility in Wayne, Michigan, would go to lower-cost Mexico by 2019.\nFord Chief Executive Mark Fields said no plants would be closed as a result, and no U.S. jobs would be lost as capacity at the Wayne plant would be taken up by two new models.\nThe Mexico plans remain in place, despite the fact that Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop Ford opening a new plant in that country and promised to slap 35 percent tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there.\nFord went further this month, announcing on Election Day a new $195 million investment in India to add 3,000 jobs over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said this week it would import its Ford EcoSport built in India to the United States. Trump has not made any public comment on that plan.\nBOTH CLAIM VICTORY\nOn Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky.\nAs such, nothing changed, but letting Trump announce the decision gave him the opportunity to claim he saved U.S. jobs and cast Ford as a patriotic manufacturer.\n\"Both sides will claim a certain level of victory because nobody wants a significant negative impact on the industry,\" said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research.\nIt was unclear how many, if any, jobs were actually saved by the decision. Ford decided last year to move MKC production by 2019, on the assumption that production of the Ford Escape, a similar vehicle made in the same plant, would grow. But recently Escape demand has slumped, which may have prompted Ford to reconsider.\nAccording to Cole, Ford's olive branch to Trump was a clear indication that it needs help from the next administration as it faces a host of issues from fuel economy standards and the rise of autonomous vehicles to trade and currency.\nCole said Trump, who boasts about his dealmaking skills, may choose to focus on bargaining with companies he has targeted - even if only for small concessions - rather than pursue more punitive measures such as tariffs, which would take time to implement and potentially damage the economy.\nFord nodded to those wider issues in a statement on Friday, saying it was encouraged that Trump's economic policies \"will help improve U.S. competitiveness.\"\nFord, like other global U.S. corporations, agrees with key aspects of Trump's economic plans. It has called for U.S. tax reform and raised concerns about the costs of federal regulations. Ford also shares Trump's concerns about currency manipulation.\n(Editing by Bill Rigby)",

      "text": "New York (AFP) - Ford announced on Friday it will keep producing an SUV model in Kentucky, rather than move it to Mexico, in a decision overplayed by President-elect Donald Trump who claimed he had saved an entire plant from closure.\nTrump repeatedly took aim at Ford and other groups during the White House campaign for moving production overseas in search of cheap labor -- and Thursday night he announced the firm's U-turn as a personal victory.\n\"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,\" Trump tweeted.\n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" added the Republican -- who won 62.5 percent of that state's popular vote.\nTrump's tweets were initially met with derision since Ford had not made public any plans to shift production from Lincoln to Mexico.\nFord on Friday confirmed there was some substance to the claims.\nUnder last year's contract agreement with the powerful United Automobile Workers union, Ford indeed made plans to move production of the Lincoln MKC out of Louisville to make room for expanded production of its Escape model. The Kentucky plant produces both small SUVs.\nThe company said in a statement, \"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky.\"\n\"Cuautitlan plant in Mexico was likely the plant for MKC,\" Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker told AFP.\nBut the billionaire appears to have significantly overstated the impact of the decision -- on several accounts.\n- No impact on jobs -\nWhile Ford confirmed that it was indeed considering moving the one model to Mexico, it certainly had no intention of shuttering the Louisville, Kentucky plant.\nIn addition, the decision will have no impact on jobs.\nBaker said that employment at the Louisville plant would have held steady regardless of any production changes, in accordance with the four-year union agreement.\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the automaker has been in contact with Trump's transition team since his election, and saw the Lincoln move as a relatively painless way to hand him a victory even before he moves into the White House.\nBut the reversal has no impact on Ford's wider decision -- confirmed earlier this week -- to move production of the Focus to Mexico from Michigan, a state Trump narrowly won in last week's election.\nFord already produces the Lincoln MKZ sedan in Hermosillo, Mexico, and in early April announced a $1.6 billion investment in a new site in the country.\n- Rhetoric swung votes -\nOne of the main themes of Trump's campaign was to bring back manufacturing jobs that American companies had moved overseas in search of cheap labor. Ford and the IT giant Apple were his favorite targets for criticism for their overseas operations.\nTrump even threatened to impose a 35 percent punitive import duty on cars produced in Mexico, and to renegotiate the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nHis rhetoric seems to have resonated since several states where the auto industry is strongly represented and that traditionally voted Democratic, such as Michigan and Wisconsin, voted for Trump, tipping the election in his favor.\nFord said of its decision on Kentucky, \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nThe company also defended its record, saying it employs more US auto workers and produces more American-made vehicles than any other firm, has invested $12 billion in US plants in the past five years and created nearly 28,000 US jobs.\n\"We continue to engage with President-elect Trump's team -- and the new Congress -- as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the US and creating American jobs,\" Ford said.",

      "text": "Rec John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports \nThe 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup season wraps up on Sunday with the Ford EcoBoost 400 from Homestead-Miami Speedway. Kevin Harvick won the pole position, but the race's real intrigue lies in the four drivers competing for the Sprint Cup Championship. \nThe four men still left in the Chase for the Cup are Carl Edwards, Kyle Busch, Joey Logano, and Jimmie Johnson. Friday's qualifying run had plenty of intrigue, with the chasers trying to get a leg up heading into the season's final race. But they all slipped up in their own ways. \nEdwards, Busch, and Logano easily cruised to Round 2 of qualifying, but Johnson found himself in trouble after a poor first run, finishing well outside of the top 24. His second run barely got going, as a caution flag was forced after Landon Cassill spun out on the track. Fortunately after the track was cleared, Johnson had a much-improved run and barely got over the cut line, averting complete disaster as he pursues his seventh Sprint Cup title. \nIn Round 2, Logano and Johnson fell below the cut line after two middling runs, eliminating them from Round 3 and putting them well behind Edwards and Busch in the starting lineup. They'll start from the same row at 13th and 14th, respectively. \nThings got even more interesting in the final round when Edwards and Busch stumbled to poor times and missed out on the top five. They'll also be racing in the same row at ninth and 10th place, respectively. Harvick will be starting at pole, with Brad Keselowski joining him in the first row. \nHere's the complete lineup for Sunday's race. Kevin Harvick",

      "text": "Be part of something big 2017 Ford F-450 Super Duty sets Guinness World Record Hide press release Show press release FORD SUPER DUTY SETS GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ TITLE All-new 2017 Ford F-450 Super Duty claims GUINNESS WORLD RECORD ™ title for the World’s Largest Flag Pulled by a Moving Vehicle, pulling a 45 by 92 foot, 4,124 U.S. flag over four laps at Homestead-Miami Speedway’s 1.5 mile track Saturday morning The F-450 will put on an encore performance on Sunday afternoon as part of the pre-race festivities prior to the Ford EcoBoost 400 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship race live on NBC at 2:30 pm (ET). Powered by its 6.7-liter Power Stroke® turbo diesel V8 producing best-in-class 925 lb.-ft. of torque and 440 horsepower, Super Duty delivers maximum gooseneck towing of 32,500 pounds for F-450, class-leading 27,500-pound fifth-wheel towing and class-leading conventional towing of 21,000 pounds; plus a best-in-class maximum payload rating of up to 7,630 pounds . \nHOMESTEAD, Fla., Nov. 19, 2016 – Torque rules when pulling big loads and Ford proved that today, setting the GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ title for the World’s Largest Flag Pulled by a Moving Vehicle with a 2017 Ford F-450 Super Duty pulling a 4,124 square foot U.S. flag. \nThe record eclipses the previous mark set earlier this year by Chevrolet with a 40 by 80-foot flag at Texas Motor Speedway on September 28 th . \nWith its 6.7-liter Power Stroke® turbo diesel V8 producing a best-in-class 925 lb.-ft. of torque and 440 horsepower, the F-450 displayed an exceptional level of towing power that Ford truck owners have come to expect from the top-selling truck series in America. \n“At Ford and with Ford trucks in particular we are used to being number one,” said Doug Scott, Ford Truck Group Marketing Manager. \nTowing the largest banner here today and setting the Guinness World Record in the category certainly fits with our DNA and what we are all about when we talk about Ford trucks and their towing power. This is a great accomplishment, another to add to the list of distinctions. Earlier this week we received the 2017 Motor Trend Truck of the Year award so we will add this to the list.” \nFord is no stranger to patriotic displays at Ford Championship weekend, utilizing the F-Series line of trucks to fly the U.S. flag as part of pre-race activities since 2003. However, Saturday’s practice session for Sunday was special, as the United States flag flown by the F-450 Super Duty for the record-setting drive measured 45’ by 92’ feet. \nTo set the record, the truck had to travel beyond the 100 meters (328 feet) previous record mark, without the flag touching the ground. The F-450 more than exceeded that requirement, officially covering a verified distance of 109 meters (360 feet) and also completing four full laps around the Homestead-Miami Speedway 1.5-mile oval, site of NASCAR’s championship event, Ford Championship Weekend. \nTo accommodate the record setting flag, 45-foot riggings from eyelet to eyelet were constructed \nenabling the F-450 a driving roll-out of the massive flag. A team of 20 launched and retrieved the flag, ensuring it did not touch the ground. \nThe F-450 will put on an encore performance on Sunday afternoon as part of the pre-race festivities prior to the Ford EcoBoost 400 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship race live on NBC at 2:30 pm (ET).

      "text": "  Difference Makers Brad Keselowski ($9,500) Keselowski has been trending in the right direction at Homestead, and his last three starts have yielded finishes of sixth, third and third, respectively. He led a race-high 86 laps in last year's race, and after qualifying second, a similar performance could be on tap this weekend. Keselowski is a great contrarian option to build around. Chase Elliott ($9,000) The rookie has never made a Cup start at Homestead, but his record at 1.5-mile tracks this year speaks for itself. Elliott has six top 10s in 10 races, including four top five finishes. He has also led laps in all four races at 1.5-mile tracks in the Chase, leading 75-plus laps twice. He has been fast on the charts all weekend, so don't be surprised if he contends for the win. Denny Hamlin ($8,600) Qualifying fourth makes him a risky play, but it also gives Hamlin plenty of upside. He is a two-time winner at Homestead, and he is one of the most consistent drivers at the track. If he just runs in the top 10, he will be a decent value for the price, and if he happens to lead his share of laps, Hamlin could be one of the steals of the race. Austin Dillon ($7,900) Dillon isn't an obvious mid-priced play like Kyle Larson and Kasey Kahne, but he does have some upside through place differential after qualifying 17th. He has also shown top 10 upside at the 1.5-mile tracks all year, and he finished 14th at Homestead last fall. He could be a sneaky lineup addition Sunday. Ryan Blaney ($7,700) His top 10 qualifying spot will likely scare off most people, and Blaney is a high-risk, high-reward pick. However, he has shown top 10 upside at the 1.5-mile tracks all year, so there is a decent chance he finishes right around where he starts. He could post a solid score through finishing alone, and a lack of ownership could make him an effective mid-priced alternative in GPPs. Danica Patrick ($6,100) A lot of pieces have to fall in place for Patrick to be worth taking a chance on, but she checks all the boxes of a viable sleeper this weekend. She is priced on the low end of her usual range, and she has some room to pad her score through place differential after qualifying 30th. Patrick owns a 20.7 average finish in three starts at Homestead, and she has never finished outside the top 25. Take a chance on her as an alternative source of cap relief. Drivers to Fade Kurt Busch ($8,400) He has been average at best during the Chase, and although he has been better since joining Stewart-Haas Racing, Homestead has never been his strongest track. Busch starts 16th, so he would have to have outperformed his career numbers here by a big margin to earn a substantial amount of points through place differential. There are too many stronger options in this price range to gamble on Busch. Ryan Newman ($7,800) Newman has shown solid speed this weekend, but his third-place run in qualifying makes him an incredibly risky pick. He does have some strong runs at Homestead, but he has been up or down at the track overall. Even if he cracks the top 15, his negative place differential is going to erase most of the points he will earn. If he has serious trouble, he is going to destroy your entire lineup.

      "text": "(Photo: AP) Not since Ford's Theater has so much furor erupted from a politician attending a play.\nWith Vice President-elect Mike Pence, an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage who has supported diverting federal funding from HIV and AIDS groups to conversion therapy, seated in the audience for Friday night's performance of Hamilton, certain lines resonated even more than usual.\nUSA TODAY\nTrump asks 'Hamilton' cast who 'harassed' Mike Pence to apologize\nAudience member Christy Colburn tweeted that when Alexander Hamiton and the Marquis de Lafayette quipped, \"Immigrants, we get the job done during The Battle of Yorktown , the crowd gave them a standing ovation. And later, during the song What Comes Next? , King George III actor Rory O'Malley had to stop the song briefly after the crowd \"went nuts\" at the line \"When your people say they hate you, don't come crawling back to me\" and ask them to stop booing.\nI'm at #Hamilton and so is Mike Pence. Crowd booed him like crazy, and gave a standing O at the line \"immigrants we get the job done\" 1/2\n— Christy Colburn (@christymoose) November 19, 2016 By now, you've likely seen the video from the curtain call, when Brandon Dixon, who plays Aaron Burr, addressed Pence on behalf of \"diverse Americans who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us\" and asked the vice president-elect to \"uphold our inalienable rights and work on behalf of all of us.\"\nPresident-elect Donald Trump demanded the cast apologize for harassing Pence, but by all accounts, both Dixon and the vice president-elect were respectful of one another. In fact, Dixon even thanked the Indiana governor for listening to what he had to say.\n@realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir. And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen.\n— Brandon Victor Dixon (@BrandonVDixon) November 19, 2016 Mike Pence actually stood and listened. It is Trump who took to Twitter with his foolishness - typical. #BoycottHamilton\n— Ella-Writer (@Ella_writer) November 19, 2016 None of it persuaded Trump, who jumped on Twitter again Saturday night after a day of meetings with his transition team and high-profile guests at his golf club in New Jersey. \"Very rude and insulting of Hamilton cast member to treat our great future V.P. Mike Pence to a theater lecture. Couldn't even memorize lines!\" Trump wrote. But within minutes, he deleted it.\nThe president-elect of the United States just deleted a tweet going after a Broadway play for the 12th hour straight https://t.co/SU17q2pMBd pic.twitter.com/DPTyZsG2Q8\n— Marlow Stern (@MarlowNYC) November 20, 2016 Trump was back at it again Sunday morning: \"The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior\"\nThe cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 The show's creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, weighed in during a break from doing Moana interviews in the U.K., complimenting the cast for how they handled the situation and agreeing with Trump that everyone should be welcome at the theater.\nProud of @HamiltonMusical . Proud of @BrandonVDixon , for leading with love.\nAnd proud to remind you that ALL are welcome at the theater.\n— Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) November 19, 2016 And original cast member Christopher Jackson, who gives his last performance as George Washington Sunday , summed up his cast's statement as \"citizens appealing to their future VPOTUS with respect and clarity.\"\nJust LISTEN to the words! Ain't nothing but Citizens appealing to their future VPOTUS! WITH RESPECT and CLARITY! #AMENandAMEN https://t.co/J6UhrwW1FP\n— Christopher Jackson (@ChrisisSingin) November 19, 2016 But social media has not settled down since, erupting with hashtags like #BoycottHamilton . (Proponents of that movement will have to be very patient: the show is sold until September 2017.)\nHere is a sampling of the most viral comments on Twitter.\nDesperate times, desperate measures Frozen star Josh Gad , who originated the role of Elder Cunningham in The Book of Mormon , provided some context in a Twitter statement. \"I know the booing upsets some of you,\" he wrote. \"But this is what happens when you run on a platform of hate.\" While he says he personally wouldn't boo someone at a theater, \"this feels different. There are swastikas popping up everywhere, a cabinet of civil-rights offenders and deniers being built, and a leader who has placed a white nationalist by his side. These aren't attempts at unity. These are warning shots to everyone who isn't white, straight and extreme.\"\nIf we're talking about apologies ... Americans don't need to apologize-not even to presidents or vice presidents-for the lawful & proper exercise of their constitutional rights. https://t.co/daN147yjkM\n— ACLU National (@ACLU) November 19, 2016 An apology should instead come from President-elect Trump for calling into question appropriateness of @HamiltonMusical cast's statements.\n— ACLU National (@ACLU) November 19, 2016 It's called misdirection Garden State 's Zach Braff chalked the whole controversy up as a win for Trump, who successfully distracted the country from Friday's $25 million Trump University settlement .\nWhen you settle a fraud lawsuit for 25 million dollars but everyone's talking about Hamilton. pic.twitter.com/KFgqMJsxul\n— Zach Braff (@zachbraff) November 19, 2016 Anyway, doesn't the president-elect have better things to do right now? My story on Trump's fight with Hamilton https://t.co/xCX7xoPK35 pic.twitter.com/ahyPWPmNZX\n— Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) November 19, 2016 Psst, that's not how a boycott works Are you going to #BoycottHamilton like you Boycott Starbucks? If so, enjoy the show!\n— Adam Parkhomenko (@AdamParkhomenko) November 19, 2016 But if you're looking to unload tickets you already have, there are plenty of takers So uh if you're gonna #BoycottHamilton , can I have your tickets? I didn't realize speaking with respect was considered harassing in 2016.\n— Mike Burgholzer (@MikeBz15) November 19, 2016 Um #BoycottHamilton ?\nLet me know and I'll have the tickets ! Face value of course.\n— Paul Lewis (@Pmatlack1878) November 19, 2016 Hold up! What if it was all one just of Joe Biden's pranks? Biden: I sent Pence tickets to Hamilton\nObama: Joe..why\nBiden: just watch\nObama: pic.twitter.com/7uxLBiidbL\n— Erika 📎 (@ErikaBuis) November 19, 2016 Contributing: Andrea Mandell",

      "text": "Ford tough tests 2017 Ford F-Series Super Duty cargo box November 20, 2016 Robert Ardent \nFord has tough tested its military-grade cargo box for the 2017 Ford F-Series Super Duty with aftermarket equipment such as glass racks, salt spreaders and ATV carriers on purpose-built potholes and off-road surfaces. \nFord says that the body of the 2017 Ford F-Series Super Duty is made from high-strength aluminium alloy that is more resistant to ding and dent than the outgoing steel cargo box and is also impervious to red rust corrosion. The new fully-boxed frame is also is also 24 times stiffer owing to the composition of 95% high-strength steel. \nBy employing high-strength steel and aluminium alloys, the weight has been reduced by 350 lbs (159 kg) thereby giving users even more towing and hauling capabilities. Supercomputers were also utilised to predict the robustness of the box. Ford body structure engineers ran simulations to predict box load performance to ensure that the all-new model’s cargo box was as tough as that of the previous model. \nDuring the evaluation, the box was also overloaded with certain equipment and the new design was able to cope up with the stress. After completing the evaluation, the vehicles were examined and no concerns were spotted in the supporting structure or the mounting surfaces. \nThe all-new 2017 Ford F-Series Super Duty will be built at the Kentucky Truck Plant and is scheduled to go on sale by late next year.

It will be designed and built around the existing museum, which includes the Motown studio with its \"Hitsville U.S.A.\" facade. \nDesigners and architects are collaborating on details of the expanded space. \nThe museum is located in the house where record company founder Berry Gordy launched his cultural and commercial music empire. The label started in 1959 and scores of stars and hits were created before Motown moved to California in 1972. Tags",

      "text": "Why Donald Trump Wasn't Completely Wrong About Ford's Plans for Mexico newsfeedback@fool.com (John Rosevear) 0 \nPresident-elect Donald Trump said he \"worked hard\" to keep a Ford (NYSE: F) factory from moving to Mexico. But media reports said on Friday that Trump's statement wasn't true, that Ford never intended to move the factory. \nIt's true that Ford never planned to move the factory. But it's also true that there was some basis for Trump's statement. Here's the story. Ford was never going to move this factory to Mexico Ford said that production of the Lincoln MKC will stay at its plant in Lexington, Kentucky. Ford had previously planned to move MKC production to Mexico. Image source: Ford Motor Company. \nFirst, some background. The factory in question is Ford's Louisville Assembly Plant, in Kentucky. The Louisville factory makes two products: the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC crossover SUVs. \nHere's the president-elect's tweet from Thursday night. \nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nIs it incorrect? Technically, yes. Ford had never considered moving the factory to Mexico. Even if Ford wanted to do that (which it doesn't), such a move would effectively be impossible under the company's current agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which represents Ford's hourly workers at the factory. But Donald Trump wasn't exactly wrong, either \nFord did consider moving production of the MKC elsewhere. Not to cut U.S. jobs, but so that it could make more Escapes at the Louisville plant. \nFor a while, Ford was selling all of the Escapes it could make in the U.S., and dealers were clamoring for more. During contract negotiations last year, Ford had given the UAW a heads-up that it might move MKC production out of the country. It didn't say where, but the safe assumption was that MKC production would move to a factory in Mexico. \nFord now says that it had planned to move production of the MKC, and it confirmed that its factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico was the likely destination. But, according to Ford spokesperson Christin Baker, Ford changed its mind. Baker confirmed that Ford told Trump that the MKC would stay in Louisville, and that Bill Ford had spoken to Trump on Thursday. \nLate on Friday afternoon, the UAW and Ford released a joint statement saying that the change in place was due to \"changing business conditions\" and that \"our president-elect tweeted about this on Thursday evening after Bill Ford spoke with him and let him know of the change in plans.\" So what really happened? \nFord concluded that it didn't need the added production capacity for the Escape right now, because the U.S. new-car market is slowing a bit. It decided to let Donald Trump know, probably as a way of extending an olive branch -- and Trump garbled the message somewhat in his tweet. 5 charts that predict the Fed's intentions on interest-rate hikes \nThe real story here is that the president-elect was tough on Ford during his campaign, and the Blue Oval has been working to build a better relationship with Trump and his incoming administration. Ford will want to have Trump's ear when it comes time to r eview U.S. fuel-economy regulations next year -- and if or when Trump tries to deliver on his promise to overhaul or scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would be an expensive mess for Ford . \nLong story short: Things didn't happen quite the way Trump said they did. But I suspect the Blue Oval was happy to hand Donald Trump the appearance of a victory now, in hopes that Trump's administration will hear Ford's concerns later on. \nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Ford \nDonald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up. But here's why you should ignore the election: \nInvesting geniuses Tom and David Gardner have spent a long time beating the market no matter who's in the White House. In fact, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Ford wasn't one of them!

      "text": "Ford made snaps late Monday when it used Snapchat to reveal the EcoSport subcompact crossover in advance of the Los Angeles Auto Show .\nThe use of Snapchat, a social media messaging app popular with millennials and the subsequent Generation Z, to reveal a vehicle was a first, according to Ford, and a clear indictor of the vehicle's intended demographic.\nThe launch was headlined by DJ Khaled—a Miami-based hip-hop producer who has become famous for mini-esoteric discussions on Snapchat.\nIt's also the first time in it's 13-year history the EcoSport will be sold in America.\nFord's decision reflects the growing trend in the U.S. of consumer preferences for crossovers and SUVs. The EcoSport has long been rumored as a vehicle the automaker would eventually bring to the U.S. as fuel economy standards get tougher and the popularity of small crossovers continues to grow.\nThe Dearborn automaker also said the EcoSport is part of four all-new SUVs it plans to launch globally over the next four years. Due up for redesigns are the Ford Explorer, Ford Escape and the return of the Ford Bronco, a nameplate the automaker plans to revive in 2018 .\nFord refuses to confirm what workers know: Bronco, Ranger returning to U.S. Robert Duffer If there's one thing auto lovers can take from this (insert adjective here) election cycle, it's confirmation that Ford is resurrecting the Bronco SUV and Ranger pickup truck.\nThe news break comes from an unlikely source: A plant chairman for United Auto Workers Local 900 responding to Republican...\nIf there's one thing auto lovers can take from this (insert adjective here) election cycle, it's confirmation that Ford is resurrecting the Bronco SUV and Ranger pickup truck.\nThe news break comes from an unlikely source: A plant chairman for United Auto Workers Local 900 responding to Republican...\n(Robert Duffer) EcoSport is Ford's entry to the hot-selling subcomact crossover space that includes the Chevy Trax, Honda HR-V, Mazda CX-3, Fiat 500X and so many more. Ford said without irony that EcoSport suits people who are “choosing to spend their time and money sharing experiences with friends and family instead of buying more stuff.”\nRanking the best subcompact crossovers Patrick Olsen The subcompact SUV category is nearly a brand-new car segment made up of a collection of compromises. While they offer more space than subcompact cars and better fuel economy than compact SUVs, there are trade-offs to these tall hatchbacks. Still, automakers have high hopes for this segment, and...\nThe subcompact SUV category is nearly a brand-new car segment made up of a collection of compromises. While they offer more space than subcompact cars and better fuel economy than compact SUVs, there are trade-offs to these tall hatchbacks. Still, automakers have high hopes for this segment, and...\n(Patrick Olsen) It comes loaded with convenience and safety technology, including two USB ports, a 12-Volt outlet, Sync 3 infotainment, up to 30 storage areas and more. The \"floating\" touchscreen sits in front of the dash instead of embedded in it, and Ford suggested you don't have to touch it as much as put your finger near it.\nIt won't be run on connected car power alone. Two engines will be offered, including the 1.0-liter three-cylinder and 2.0-liter four-cylinder EcoBoost. EcoSport will have four-wheel drive, six-speed automatic transmission, and will be offered in four trim levels. It's expected in dealerships early in 2018.\n2016 Honda HR-V grows into Fit crossover Jim Mateja Based on the success of its CR-V compact crossover, Honda has added a smaller companion to the lineup for 2016 called the HR-V. The subcompact crossover that's 10 inches shorter than the CR-V is part of a new breed of automobile that includes the Chevy Trax, Mazda CX-3, Nissan Juke, Subaru Crosstrek...\nBased on the success of its CR-V compact crossover, Honda has added a smaller companion to the lineup for 2016 called the HR-V.

A second generation of the small utility vehicle launched in Brazil and other global markets in 2012. Ford did not say where it would build the EcoSport that it will sell in the U.S.\nThe EcoSport is built on Ford's global subcompact platform, which is the basis for the Ford Fiesta in the U.S. and Europe. The Dearborn automaker currently makes the Fiesta at its assembly plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The EcoSport also is produced at plants in Brazil, India, Thailand and Russia.\n2016 Mazda CX-3 crossover is small but full of features Jim Mateja Add yet another entry in the segment du jour of the auto industry, the 2016 Mazda CX-3 subcompact crossover utility vehicle (CUV).\nThe CX-3 joins the Fiat 500 X, Honda HR-V, Chevy Trax, Buick Encore, Jeep Renegade, Nissan Juke and Subaru Crosstrek in the small CUV segment, which some estimate will...\nAdd yet another entry in the segment du jour of the auto industry, the 2016 Mazda CX-3 subcompact crossover utility vehicle (CUV).\nThe CX-3 joins the Fiat 500 X, Honda HR-V, Chevy Trax, Buick Encore, Jeep Renegade, Nissan Juke and Subaru Crosstrek in the small CUV segment, which some estimate will...\n(Jim Mateja) In March, Ford said it would spend $217 million to make the Ford EcoSport at its Craiova Assembly Plant in Romania starting in the autumn of 2017.\nBrent Snavely of The Detroit Free Press contributed.\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Automotive Industry Trucks, SUVs and Crossovers Ford Motor Co.",

      "text": "November 20, 2016 — American / Truck & 4x4 / Under $20k | 10 Comments Final Year Highboy: 1977 Ford F-250 4×4 \nThis 1977 Ford F-250 Custom Cab (chassis F26HR023121) is a final year “highboy” model, so-nicknamed for their unusually tall factory lift kit. Though described as highly original, in fact the truck has had a light cosmetic refresh, including respray of its factory two-tone colors. Built in San Jose, it’s been a lifelong California resident thus far, power comes from a 351M/4-speed/NP205 transfer case combo, and the seller says that it runs and drives great. Find it here on eBay in Canyon, California with no reserve. \nHighboys sit higher than other standard 4×4 trucks thanks to a divorced transfer case that necessitated the use of 4″ lift blocks for adequate clearance. Interestingly, they also utilized a narrower (33.5″ vs. 37.5″), stronger frame than what was used on other Ford pick-ups. Paint is described as “better than new,” while sheet metal, chrome, stainless, plastics and wheels all show very well too. \nMinor issues needing attention include a missing lower tailgate trim and an inop latch. Fitted with an optional, auxiliary side-mount tank, 1977 was the final year for an in-the-cab main tank. Inside, carpet is thought to be original, though the radio is missing, the horn button is worn, there’s a small crack in the dash pad, the interior light works only with the passenger door, the dome light lens needs replacing and the driver’s doors rubber and striker need attention. Photos of this area aren’t the best, but from what can be seen, it still looks pretty good despite this handful of relatively minor and mostly easily correctable issues. \nSeams along the bottom of the body are impressively clean, ditto the lower rockers, frame rails and floors. The 161 HP 351M is said to start right up and run well. Backed by an NP435 4-speed transmission with a granny first, the NP205 transfer case splits power front and rear. An open-knuckle Dana 44 axle is fitted up front, while a 30-spline, full-floating, 4.10 geared Dana 60 with a Powr-Lok diff is out back. Reportedly, the transmission shifts smoothly, 4-wheel drive works, and with factory discs up front and drums in the rear it brakes well too. \nAgain things are nice underneath, though we’re not sure that the frame hasn’t been touched up as body mounts, hardware and paint all look a bit too nice to be nearly 40 years old.

The company will re-program the control unit in the operating panel and replace the electronic throttle valve. \nThe authority said that these recalls reassure the consumers of the efforts to ensure road safety and the continuous monitoring of all items and vehicles that enter the Omani market.

Nov. 20, 2016 5:47 p.m. ET \nFord Motor Co. announced late last week that it won’t shift production of its Lincoln MKC to Mexico from Louisville, Kentucky, as planned. This is good news if Ford believes that Donald Trump will make the U.S. more competitive but a bad precedent if it is bending to the President-elect’s political wishes. \nThe U.S. auto maker had intended to move production of its MKC, a luxury crossover SUV, to Mexico to increase output of the higher-volume Escape at its Louisville plant, which is operating at full capacity.

      "text": "Ford plans self-driving car for ride share fleets in 2021 \nThe regulations imposed utility-like oversight of broadband providers in an attempt to ensure the free flow of online content. President Barack Obama and liberal activists strongly backed the tough regulations over intense objections of the industry and many Republicans — including Trump. \n“I think it’s an important thing to remember that taking a fast, fair and open internet away from the public and away from those who use it to offer innovative new services to the public would be a real mistake,” FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler warned Thursday about net neutrality, his signature accomplishment since taking office three years ago. \nA new Republican-led FCC is expected to try to reverse the regulations. Congressional Republicans also could attempt to override the rules with legislation, an effort that stalled in 2013 because of a sure Obama veto. \nBut it could take a while before a Republican-controlled FCC is in position to make any changes. \nThe failure of the Senate so far to confirm Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel to a new five-year term could lead to more upheaval at the nation’s telecommunications regulator. The FCC now has three Democrats and two Republicans. \nBy early next year, it’s possible that that all three Democrats will be gone from the commission. That would leave the two remaining Republicans short of the quorum they would need to enact or reverse regulations until replacements are nominated and confirmed, a process that could take several months. \nWheeler said Thursday he had not yet decided on a departure date. He could stay on as a commissioner until late 2018, but former chairmen rarely do that. Rosenworcel’s term ends when Congress adjourns at the end of the year unless she is reconfirmed. Democrat Mignon Clyburn, whose second term ends in early 2018, could decide to step down as well. She has served since 2009. \nThe presidential election results already have affected the FCC’s operations. \nOn Thursday, Wheeler removed all but one minor issue from the commission’s monthly meeting agenda, after key House and Senate Republicans publicly urged him not to consider any controversial topics with a transfer in power looming after Trump is inaugurated as president on Jan. 20. \nAmong the deleted items was a proposal to overhaul the market for business data services, which was opposed by AT&T Inc. and other large telecommunications companies. \n“Certain of my colleagues identified the items on today’s proposed agenda as controversial and asked that they not be considered today,” Wheeler told reporters after the eight-minute meeting. “I hope that this doesn’t mean that these issues won’t be quickly addressed after the transfer of leadership of this agency.” \nWhat appears to be almost certainly dead is another controversial Wheeler proposal to open up the market for cable and satellite set-top boxes — an effort the pay TV industry strongly opposes. \nTrump gets to designate a new chairman after he takes office and, assuming the departure of Wheeler or Rosenworcel, that appointment will shift the FCC’s majority to the Republicans. \nOnce Republicans are in control, they could try to reverse regulations they opposed. \nOne target could be new rules approved last month requiring high-speed internet service providers to get customer permission before using or sharing sensitive personal data. The privacy regulations, opposed by broadband companies, passed on a partisan 3-2 vote over the objections of Republican Commissioners Mike O’Rielly and Ajit Pai. \nBut the biggest target is net neutrality. \nIn enacting the regulations by a 3-2 vote in 2015, the FCC classified broadband as a more highly regulated service under Title 2 of the telecommunications law. The classification gave the FCC more authority over broadband providers, also opening the door for the agency to enact the privacy regulations. \nRepublicans didn’t oppose the goals of net neutrality — to prohibit broadband companies from slowing internet speeds for some content such as video streams, selling faster lanes for delivering data or otherwise discriminating against any legal online material. But they strongly objected to classifying broadband providers for the same type of regulatory oversight as conventional phone companies. \nWheeler said Thursday that the classification was the difference between “empty net neutrality” and “meaningful net neutrality” backed up by stronger FCC authority. \nAbout 4 million people filed comments with the FCC when it was considering the net neutrality rules, with most asking for strong regulation. \nBut Trump publicly expressed his opposition at the time. \n“Obama’s attack on the internet is another top-down power grab,” he tweeted in November 2014. \nIt’s unclear who Trump would nominate to be FCC chairman and if the new president would push to reverse the net neutrality rules. \nTrump spokeswoman Hope Hicks and Jeffrey Eisenach, who is handling telecommunications issues for Trump’s transition, did not respond to email requests for comment. \nBut Eisenach, a telecommunications industry consultant and visiting scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank, suggested last month that net neutrality could be in trouble. \n“What I don’t think a President Trump would do, and would hope he wouldn’t do, is to intervene to instruct a regulatory agency how to issue a particular regulation,” Eisenach said on C-Span’s “The Communicators” program. “I think in general, taking his broader views on regulation into account, you would expect him to appoint people to the FCC who would be inclined to take a less regulatory position.” \nFor supporters of net neutrality, that signals trouble. \n“They have been very much opposed to net neutrality” and specifically the regulatory reclassification, John Bergmayer, senior counsel at digital rights group Public Knowledge, said of Republicans. “I think they would try to revisit that.” \nBut he and other experts said a reversal might not be that easy. In June, a federal appellate court panel dismissed a lawsuit by AT&T Inc., other telecom companies and industry trade groups that argued the FCC exceeded its authority in approving the regulations. \nSo the FCC would have to conduct a thorough rule-making procedure to justify its reasons for changing course. Former Democratic FCC Commissioner Michael Copps said Republicans would risk a backlash if they take on net neutrality. \n“I think there would be a rising up around the nation from people who were active the first time around,” said Copps, a special adviser on media and democracy reform at public interest group Common Cause.

      "text": "Back to Top Post by badrep on Nov 20, 2016 22:54:32 GMT Right, so here's my first build thread on here - You may know my other car, the bagged Volvo 1800ES that was fortunate enough to win car of the year at the 2015 gathering. I was really supprised to get the award and really felt that I didn't deserve it as there was only a small amount of modification - bags, wheels etc and not the hundreds of hours of engineering that went into many of the other cars there. Obviously I was over the moon though... I never did a build thread as there wasn't really one, so this is why I'm starting this one. The New Project: So I'm taking an MR2 chassis, sticking a (approx) 400bhp Volvo T5 engine in and sticking a group B Ford RS200 - a kit called an MRS200. I looked at a load of different options for kit, but either too expensive, too hard to find, or just not quite right. Anyway - I've ended up with this one and there's, no going back.[photo of completed on from MRS200 facebook It's going to be different though. It's getting a Volvo T5 engine with bucket loads of torque and bhp and it's getting Bagged. It's a rare car that has a double win from air-ride as you get the awesome look then its aired out on the ground, and raised up you get the stiffness and firmer ride for handling and you get that badass group B rally look too. in theory anyway.Here's the target:Not Strictly pre mid 90's as it's a replica with a later MR2 chassis, but it's in the spirit as I'm sure you'll agree.The engine was going into another project but that one sadly died a death, however I did end up with a large number of performance parts that need to go in something. I am FULLY aware that there are more suitbale engines, and also fully aware that there are better turbos that spool faster, but it's what I have and more importantly what I want to put in there, even if it does work out harder, more expensive etc. I've been collecting those parts for years and are a little connected to them. They include:2006 V70 2.4 T5 engine, with 2.3 ported and flowed head (was going to on into an 2002 V70 sleeper so needed single VVT)Lightened pulleys",

      "text": "Rec Photo by Chris Trotman/Getty Images Starting at the back of the pack at Miami-Homestead Speedway after his car failed a prerace inspection, Jimmie Johnson finished at the front 267 laps later to win the Ford 400 and a seventh Sprint Cup Championship title . Johnson joined Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt in the feat. Kyle Larson finished second after being passed on the final restart with two laps remaining, and Kevin Harvick third, however neither were eligible for the series championship. Of the final four standing, Joey Logano finished fourth, Kyle Busch sixth, and Carl Edwards 34th following an outcome changing wreck. Johnson had qualified to start 14th, but NASCAR officials decided his crew had made “unapproved adjustments” after pulling his car from the starting grid before the race. He quickly made his way toward the front, and took advantage of two late-race opportunities to put himself in the position to win. The outcome of the Sprint Cup Championship and race changed dramatically with 11 laps remaining after Edwards -- then leading among the four contenders — tried to block Logano, resulting in a wreck that knocked Edwards out of the race and resulted in Martin Truex Jr’s car barreling down the track like a fireball. After the race was red-flagged for more than 30 minutes, Logano stayed the race, taking new tires and fixing body damage during the ensuing yellow. Larson and Harvick led a majority of the race, with Larson at the front for 132 laps and Harvick there for 79. Logano also led six laps and Edwards 47. Trending",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story HOMESTEAD, Fla. \nJimmie Johnson won Sunday’s Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway, and with it an unlikely seventh and record-tying NASCAR Cup championship. \nJohnson took the lead on a restart with two laps remaining and beat Kyle Larson to the start-finish line, igniting a wild celebration with his No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports team. \nJohnson is now tied for NASCAR’s career championships lead with hall-of-famers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt.

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story HOMESTEAD, Fla. \nJimmie Johnson won Sunday’s Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway, and with it an unlikely seventh and record-tying NASCAR Cup championship. \nJohnson took the lead on a restart with two laps remaining and beat Kyle Larson to the start-finish line, igniting a wild celebration with his No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports team. \nJohnson is tied for NASCAR’s career championships lead with hall-of-famers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt. He had to do it after starting the race at the rear of the field after he was found to have an unapproved body modification in pre-race inspection. \nTo win the title, Johnson had to finish ahead of three other final-four drivers. Joey Logano was fourth, Kyle Busch sixth and Carl Edwards 34th. Edwards and Logano were involved in an accident on a late restart while Edwards was running second, completely changing the complexion of the championship race. \nThe race was red-flagged for 31 minutes, nine seconds after the wreck, which involved seven other cars. \n[ NASCAR Cup results | NASCAR top series schedules | Cup standings ] Turning point \nAfter a wreck involving Ricky Stenhouse Jr. forced a caution on Lap 264, Johnson passed leader Kyle Larson on the restart and led the final three laps of overtime. Chase update \nHow the Chase drivers fared: \nJimmie Johnson: Struggled in qualifying, then was penalized for an unapproved body modification during prerace inspection. All he did was come from the rear of the field to win the race and his record-tying seventh title. Is it too soon to talk about No. 8? \nJoey Logano: Was the victim of a late-race wreck with Carl Edwards. A shrewd pit stop by crew chief Todd Gordon put Logano in position to win his first title, but he didn’t have enough for Johnson. \nKyle Busch: A bad pit stop late in the race cost the 2015 champion and his No. 18 team. That dropped Busch to 12th place and although he rallied, he could only manage a sixth-place finish. \nCarl Edwards: He appeared to be in position to contend for the race victory and, more importantly, the championship until he tried to block Logano on a late restart. That wreck ended the race and the season for Edwards, who finished 34th. Observations \n▪ Busch’s sixth-place finish gave Toyota its first Cup manufacturer’s championship. Toyota drivers from Joe Gibbs Racing and Furniture Row Racing’s Martin Truex Jr. won 16-of-36 races to take the title. \n▪ Three-time champion Tony Stewart, retiring after an 18-year Cup career, finished 22nd. Stewart drove at the head of the field during a ceremonial pace lap before the race and was greeted by crew members of other teams. \n“That was the favorite part of my day,” said Stewart, a three-time champion. \n▪ Larson led a race-high 132 laps but didn’t have enough for Johnson at the end. Harvick led 79 laps, driving a Chevy for the final time. Harvick’s Stewart-Haas Racing is changing manufacturers to Ford next season. They said it \n“So thrilled to be in this moment. So grateful for the opportunity and so thankful and blessed. I am at a loss for words.” – Johnson. N@SCAR",

Larson finished second. \nIt was Johnson's fifth win of the season. \nCarl Edwards was in position to claim his first Sprint Cup after taking second from Joe Gibbs Racing teammate and fellow-championship contender Kyle Busch with 24 laps to go. \nAs Larson led, Edwards maintained his second position in the running order until the yellow flag waved for a Dylan Lupton spin with 15 laps remaining. \nBut when the race restarted with 10 laps to go, Edwards and another Chaser, Joey Logano, made contact that resulted in a larger multi-car wreck that collected the cars of Martin Truex Jr., Brad Keselowski, Kasey Kahne, Chase Elliott and Regan Smith. Truex's car burst into flames. \nAfterward, Edwards accepted blame for the incident. \nOn the restart, Logano made a run and Edwards attempted to block him. Edwards retired from the race, but Logano was able to continue with significant damage to his car after NASCAR red-flagged the race for nearly 31 minutes for track clean-up. \nWhen the race restarted, the yellow flag waved, again, within a lap for a Ricky Stenhouse Jr. wreck. \nIn the short time the race ran green, Johnson got up to second, and Logano moved from eighth to third with the four new tires he took during the previous caution. \nLarson took his first lead of the race when he got by Edwards on lap 118 and took command from lap 144. He led most of the remaining laps over the course of the 267-lap race. \nThe four Championship Four drivers - Busch, Edwards, Logano and Johnson - ran inside the top-10 for most of the race, primarily occupying most of the spots inside the top-five of the running order. \nJohnson started the race in the back, despite qualifying 14th, because of an unapproved body modification. He passed 10 cars on the first lap and was inside the top-10 by lap 30. \nKevin Harvick finished third, Logano was fourth and Jamie McMurray rounded out the top-five. Busch finished sixth. \n(Editing by Larry Fine)",

      "text": "The Jeep B-SUV will target emerging markets like India and will be smaller than the Renegade. \nEarlier this year, at the launch of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Wrangler Unlimited , FCA India had confirmed that the first locally made Jeep (the C-SUV a.k.a. 556) will roll out from Ranjangaon facility in 2017. This will be in the form of Jeep Compass, which made global debut last month. \nInterestingly, Jeep India is also working on an even smaller B-segment derivative to be primarily made in India. Codenamed Jeep 526, the B-SUV is likely to be a sub-4 m crossover which will have mass market products like Maruti Vitara Brezza, and Ford EcoSport in its sights. The C- and B-SUVs are likely to be based on the Renegade but one will be larger and the other will be smaller. \nThe company is hoping to leverage the Make-in-India campaign as far as the C- and B-SUVs are concerned. According to Economic Times’ sources, the Jeep 526 would be a mini Renegade and will be targeting select markets like India. It will also be exported to several RHD markets. \nThe Jeep B-SUV is reportedly being benchmarked against a product from a higher segment. Market positioning will be a notch higher than the mainstream sub-4 crossovers but Jeep will pack its product with best-in-class features to justify the premium tag. The Jeep 526 B-SUV will lock horns with the likes of Maruti Vitara Brezza. \nET also reports that the company is planning annual volumes of 40,000 – 50,000 units from the B-SUV including exports.

      "text": "Close Robert Reich: The Realities Of Free Trade Deals This article o riginally appeared on The Motley Fool.\nWill Donald Trump follow through on his threat to shut down imports from Mexico?\nIt seems pretty clear that he'll try to deliver in some way on one of his most frequently repeated promises: to renegotiate or dismantle the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nIf he succeeds, that will be a costly headache for Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and just about all of the other big global automakers.\nWhat Trump has promised to do about NAFTA First, let's look at what Trump might try to do. In his seven-point trade plan , Trump said that if elected, he would:\nTell NAFTA partners that we intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers. If they don't agree to a renegotiation, we will submit notice that the U.S. intends to withdraw from the deal. Eliminate Mexico's one-side backdoor tariff through the VAT and end sweatshops in Mexico that undercut U.S. workers.\nTrump also, famously, castigated automakers generally and Ford in particular for building new factories in Mexico and not in the United States. He even suggested that he'd try to enact a 35 percent tax on vehicles imported from Mexico.\nOne way or another, it seems clear that Trump will try to end free trade between the U.S. and its southern neighbor. That means (again, if he's successful) that vehicles coming into the U.S. from Mexico would face a tariff, probably a steep one. That would disrupt a lot of commerce, and impact a lot of automakers.\nSince official reports of exports and imports are tallied in terms of financial value, it can be hard to tell exactly how many cars and trucks are imported into the U.S. from other countries.\nBut we know there are a lot of them: According to figures from the Mexican Automotive Industry Association, about 79 percent of the 2.9 million vehicles built in Mexico this year through October were exported. About 86 pcrcent of those exports, just under 2 million, went to North America, and the vast majority of those were sent to the U.S.\nThere are more coming: According to a recent report from the Center for Automotive Research (CAR), new factories that are under construction in Mexico will push the country's total production capacity over 5 million vehicles a year sometime in 2018.\nThose factories are getting built because right now, it makes very good business sense for American automakers to build cars and trucks in Mexico and then import them into the U.S.\nWhy automakers have been building factories in Mexico The list of auto factories in Mexico is a long one, and it has been growing quickly in recent years. Just since 2014, Mazda, Honda, Volkswagen and Audi, and Hyundai and Kia have all opened plants in Mexico. There are more on the way: Ford, Nissan, BMW, Volvo and Toyota all have Mexican factories under construction or in the works now. They'll join GM, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and other vehicle manufacturers that have had factories in Mexico for several years.\nBut why Mexico? Lower-cost labor is part of the story, but there's quite a bit more to it:\nFree trade with other countries: Thanks to free-trade deals, exports from Mexico are exempt from tariffs in 44 other countries, including the European Union (counted as one \"country\"), versus just 20 from the United States. That makes it an appealing base for any company that wants to produce goods (global small-car models, for instance) for export. Free trade with the U.S. and easy shipping: One of those 44 countries is the world's second-largest auto market, the United States. Because it shares a huge border with Mexico, shipping vehicles from Mexican factories to U.S. dealers is relatively simple and inexpensive. Lower-cost, but highly qualified, workers: Yes, Mexican workers are paid less, averaging a little over $8 an hour in wages and benefits while their American counterparts make about $46. But they're also well-qualified: Mexico has made huge strides toward an educated workforce, with more than 90,000 engineers and technicians graduating annually. Robust existing infrastructure: The number of factories already operating in Mexico means that the country has a rich network of suppliers, logistics firms and other resources that automakers seek. Mexico also has good deep-water ports on both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, facilitating longer-distance exports. Long story short: If you're manufacturing vehicles that can be sold in many global markets—in particular, small cars, small SUVs, and heavy trucks—and you do business in the U.S., there's a strong business case for building those vehicles in Mexico.\nA driver leans out the cabin window while waiting in a line for border customs control to cross into U.S. at the World Trade Bridge in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, November 2. Reuters But that business case changes in a hurry if NAFTA goes away and the U.S. imposes tariffs on Mexican-made vehicles.\nHow a tariff would put Mexican-made cars at a huge disadvantage While Mexico's free-trade agreements and established infrastructure are a big part of why automakers are attracted to Mexico, the cost advantage is real. But it might not be as large as you think.\nHere's a real-world example. For a while, Ford built Fusions for the U.S. market in two factories, one in Michigan and one in Mexico. Not everything is cheaper in Mexico: Labor and locally made parts cost less, but some other things (including shipping to U.S. dealers) cost more. Overall, CAR estimated that the Fusions built in Mexico cost Ford $1,200 less per car than the ones built in Michigan.\nThat difference in cost is profit for Ford—or looked at another way, it's margin that Ford can use to price the Fusion more aggressively, as it is doing now.\nAt the moment, competition in the Fusion's segment (midsize sedans) is fierce. The Fusion's average transaction price is about $22,500 right now, according to J.D. Power data made available to The Motley Fool . That's still higher than the average of the Fusion's competitors (about $21,800), reflecting Ford's pricing discipline and the fact that the Fusion was recently revamped.\nBut Ford probably isn't making a ton of money on Fusions at that price, even Mexican-built ones. Profit margins on individual products are closely held secrets, but we can estimate that Ford's overall profit margin on the Fusion is probably around 8 percent right now, or in the neighborhood of $1,800 per car. (Its profit margins on smaller vehicles are almost certainly thinner.)\nA 35 percent tariff would add an average of $7,875 per car, leaving Ford deep in the hole. Ford can't just pass that on to consumers, because the Fusion competes (fiercely) with vehicles made in the U.S. and elsewhere. Even adding a few thousand dollars to its price would drop it out of consideration for a lot of potential buyers.\nSo why can't Ford just live with the $1,200-per-car cost disadvantage and make those Fusions in the U.S.?\nWhy the Detroit automakers don't want to build new U.S. factories The short answer is that Ford doesn't have room: Most of Ford's U.S. factories, and those of its rivals, are running near full capacity. Most are making (more profitable) trucks, SUVs, or luxury vehicles. (Ford no longer makes Fusions in Michigan; that assembly line now builds more-profitable Lincoln Continentals instead.)\nIf Ford was forced to build Fusions in the U.S., it would have to build a new factory. But here's the thing about auto factories: They cost a lot of money no matter how busy they are, and the market for new cars is cyclical .\nIt can cost a billion dollars or more to build a new auto factory—but that's just the beginning. The industry rule of thumb is that an auto factory becomes profitable when it's at or over 80 percent of \"capacity,\" which in the industry's lingo means two shifts working five days a week. Most of Ford's (and GM's, and Fiat Chrysler's) U.S. factories are at or above capacity right now, because the U.S. new-car market is very strong. That's why Detroit's profit margins in North America have been so high.\nBut it won't last. Remember, history shows us that the new-car market is cyclical. In fact, we're probably past the peak of the current cycle , which means that sales (and therefore production) will drop at some point.\nBy limiting the number of factories it operates, and running them flat-out when times are good, Ford (and GM, and the others) can keep most of them above that break-even line when sales drop, as in a recession.\nIf the recession is prolonged or severe enough, some will fall below that 80 percent-of-capacity break-even line. When that happens, a U.S. factory will lose more money per day than a Mexican factory, because its fixed costs (including labor) are higher.\nAlso, because of Mexico's network of free-trade agreements, it's possible that Ford (or whoever) could keep a Mexican factory above break-even during a steep U.S. recession, by building products for export to some of those 43 other markets with which Mexico has free-trade deals. That's harder to do from the United States.\nTo sum up: Right now, if the automakers are going to build factories to supply the U.S. market, it makes much more sense to build them in Mexico instead of the U.S.\nChanging that by taxing vehicles imported from Mexico, as President-elect Trump has said he will do, would force the automakers to spend billions on new U.S. factories, depleting their cash reserves and exacerbating their losses when the economy turns south.\nIt would increase the costs of manufacturing small and midsize mass-market vehicles for the U.S. market. Some of those costs would be passed on to consumers, making the least-expensive new vehicles more expensive than they are now.\nOn the other hand, it would create U.S. manufacturing jobs—assuming the automakers don't find ways to bring the cars in from elsewhere, or to increase the use of automation in their existing factories.\nWill it be worth it? We may find out.\nForget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Ford Donald Trump was elected president, and volatility is up.

This is good news if Ford believes that Donald Trump will make the U.S. more competitive but a bad precedent if it is bending to the President-elect’s political wishes. \n\nThe U.S. auto maker had intended to move production of its MKC, a luxury crossover SUV, to Mexico to increase output of the higher-volume Escape at its Louisville plant, which is operating at full capacity.

      "text": "Model A Ford in Bozeman. Brewster Moseley \n1951 Pontiac Indian Head factory mascot in Livingston. \nFor photographer Brewster Moseley, it was the juxtaposition of rust and chrome that caught his attention – a glimpse of a fast machine caught in slow time. \nMoseley is a photographer who has sometimes photographed Butte, Montana. It was in doing one of those assignments that he came up with the idea for this project. \n“I had been primarily a nature photographer but was struck with the textures and beautiful dilapidated appearance of many of the Butte homes and commercial buildings. I was walking around the city taking pictures one weekend and noticed an old garage that housed a rusty REO Speed Wagon,” Moseley said. \n“Since I was attracted to the decaying beauty of the Butte structures I had been focusing on, I felt the same allure when I encountered the Speed Wagon. At that point I became hooked on rusty, vintage vehicles. \n“I began haunting Montana auto salvage yards. I discovered trashy treasures in Billings, Bozeman, Whitehall, Butte and Helena. I even happened on a family of peacocks living under an overturned car in a Whitehall salvage yard. Like the buildings in historic Uptown Butte, I found beauty in decaying vehicles around the state. And I've come to feel that in almost every piece of what most of us would term ‘junk,’ artistry is to be found. Sometimes one must look closely. But quite often, it's there to be seen and appreciated.” \nIt may be that Moseley’s appreciation for the young lines of old automobiles is older than that day in Butte. \n“In searching my past for obvious and, perhaps, hidden influences on my work as a photographer of rusty, vintage vehicles and the dilapidated buildings of Uptown Butte, I believe two sculptures were the starting point. My grandfather had given me two Masai warrior statues when I was very young. I loved them and began collecting African carvings – especially African blackwood, or mpingo, pieces from Makonde carvers in southern Tanzania. I have admired primitive art ever since: Grandma Moses’ paintings, old automobiles (I had a vintage Jaguar, Austin Healey and Alfa Romeo) and paintings, sculptures and artistically woven textiles from non-industrial cultures. \n“My interest in rusty metal began when I started collecting antique African weaponry. I had 18 th and 19 th century spears, daggers, swords, shields, and currency anklets. Rust enables me to feel a nostalgic connection with a bygone era and an appreciation of the beauty that once was. Rust creates in me a desire to salvage artistic details hidden in decay that I'm able to discern and reveal. Through the medium of photography, I can share the beauty I’ve uncovered with a wider audience.” \nThat’s why he haunts the backyards and scrapyards of Montana cities where horsepower has been put out to pasture. He uses a Canon 60D camera with a Canon zoom EF 17-40 1:4 \"L\" lens. \n“I feel like I’m communicating this message: ‘Appreciate this artistry with me. Don’t pass by without noticing that there is still something to love in what you might have considered forlorn or even repugnant. Acknowledge and value the skill and devotion that went into the making of this object long, long ago,’” Moseley said. \n“This is why I love what I'm doing. This is why I'm a photographer.” Tags",

      "text": "You are at: Home » Weekly » Fast Times » Ford boss encouraging other brands to dispose of used vehicles via car auction Ford boss encouraging other brands to dispose of used vehicles via car auction Tweet \nAuctions are a good way to unload unwanted stuff. These are events designed to sell valuable items to the highest bidders. A common type of auction involves motor vehicles. Overseas, wealthy car collectors are known to occasionally offer a rare automobile or two to willing buyers. The reasons for selling vary, of course. Sometimes the seller just needs funds; at other times he just needs to clear space in his property. \nAnyway, in the Philippines, the more popular kind of car auction is one organized by banks. You see, because banks in this country are way too lenient in providing financial assistance to car buyers—yes, even car buyers who really can’t afford monthly installments—they often end up having to repossess vehicles from clients who default on payments. You know the story: A modestly earning office employee gets enticed by the low-down-payment, zero-interest car promos, and then plunks down the requisite initial cash outlay. Problem is, said impulsive buyer does not take into serious consideration the burdensome monthly amortization. Before he knows it, he’s already behind on payments a couple of months. And then one morning, he finds himself helplessly watching his new sedan being sequestrated by agents of the lending bank. \nAnd that’s how Philippine banks end up with lots upon lots of pre-owned cars—cars they need to sell in order to recoup their investment. Hence, the periodic car auction, invitations to which are privately sent to the banks’ clientele. \nThat’s nice and all, but there’s some uneasy feeling about buying a car from total strangers you won’t even meet. Fortunately, there’s a new type of auction emerging from the business model, and I’ve been made aware of it by Ford Philippines managing director Lance Mosley. According to Lance, his company recently joined a car auction organized by HMR Auctions. Ford was the only carmaker that participated in the event; the other was a bank, as usual. \n“We have a lot of demo vehicles—including press units we loan to journalists—that are just sitting in our parking lot,” Lance told us. “The auction gave us a good opportunity to sell them at good prices. These are units that have very low mileage in them.” \nThe great thing about buying a vehicle from a car company is that you’re sure it has been well-maintained. Also, you can bet they won’t let go of a unit they haven’t thoroughly checked, lest a buyer end up with a problematic vehicle and badmouth the brand on social media. You know how it goes these days. \nAnd now, Lance is inviting his fellow executives from rival automotive brands to join the auction. The next one, I understand, is happening on December 3 at Km. 21 East Service Road along South Superhighway in Sucat. He wants everyone to do well in the auction. \n“It’s a win-win for everyone,” he said. \nYou know what’s good about this whole thing? It’s that the public can finally have access to excellent deals from carmakers’ parking lots. As a longtime motoring journalist, I have regularly been offered nice deals by auto companies. Say, a 10,000km test-drive unit of the latest compact hatchback, or a barely used demo unit of a pickup that merely toured mall shows. If I had the money, I’d get a lot of these vehicles and resell them. The deals are always very attractive. \nNow, regular buyers of secondhand cars are given the chance to snap up these pre-loved units from the auto brands themselves—not banks who pried away the cars from luckless owners unable to cough up the payments. \nI hope the other brands see the benefit of joining these car auctions, and then we can have quarterly selling events featuring various brands and models many of us have been drooling over. \nIf nothing else, go to the live auction and witness the aggressive bidding by prospective buyers. I imagine it’s like watching reality TV in the flesh, if there’s such a thing.",

      "title": "Ford Unveils New EcoSport Subcompact SUV",
      "text": "by tgriffith Ford Unveils New EcoSport Subcompact SUV \nJust this weekend my wife asked about the word ‘nomenclature.’ I explained it by giving the example of Ford’s naming strategy, or its nomenclature, for its line of SUVs. \nThere’s the Excursion , Expedition , Explorer , Edge , and Escape . \nFord likes the letter ‘E’ for its SUVs, with the one exception being the Flex , which could be classified more as a wagon than an SUV. It should be no surprise, then, that Ford’s newest SUV, unveiled over the weekend via Snapchat, will conform to that nomenclature and carry the name EcoSport. \nYes, Ford chose a social network rather than a major auto show to unveil the vehicle to the public, much like it did in 2010 with the new Explorer on Facebook. \nThe EcoSport is a small SUV model that has been available in countries outside the U.S. since 2003. Ford made the call to bring the little ute stateside because subcompact SUVs have suddenly become huge business in the U.S. \nSmall SUVs are already the largest segment of the automotive market and other automakers already sell similar models. Those include the Chevrolet Trax , Honda HR-V , and Jeep Renegade . \nThe new EcoSport, which will go on sale sometime in 2018, is a huge departure as far as Ford SUVs go. Its base engine will be a turbocharged 1.0-liter 3-cylinder motor that’s also used in Ford’s small cars. That should give you an idea of just how diminutive this subcompact really is. A 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine will also be available. \nThe EcoSport will take a page from Honda’s old playbook and use a tailgate that swings out to the side rather than up. Ford says it provides easier access to the cargo area, but the design was long a thorn in the side for Honda drivers. \nSpeaking of design, the EcoSport brings one of the most unfortunate looks in modern vehicle history. Its top-heavy awkward look is punctuated by clunky A-pillars that extend up from fenders and a face framed by triangular headlights and an Escape-inspired grille. \nPrices for the new EcoSport haven’t been announced yet. \nWould a subcompact SUV fit your lifestyle? \n-tgriffith",

      "text": "Twitter 0 \nNew Ford EcoSport facelift , recently, had its world premiere at the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show. Besides this, the American carmaker also showcased the first-ever all-wheel drive (AWD) version of the compact SUV. The Ford EcoSport 4X4 (AWD) variant will be launched only in the North American market. Since the U.S-spec EcoSport facelift will be produced at Ford India’s Chennai facility, there are possibilities that it might arrive in the Indian market as well. \nIn the U.S market, the Ford EcoSport 4X4 (AWD) will be exclusively available with a 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder petrol powertrain boosted with direct injection system. The power and torque outputs of this engine are around 240bhp and 339Nm respectively. The US-spec model will also be available with a 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine with front-wheel drive system. Picture Gallery – 2017 Ford EcoSport \nIn India though, the 2017 Ford EcoSport facelift will retain its existing engine lineup – a 1.5-litre TDCi diesel and 1.0-litre EcoBoost. Transmission options will include a 5-speed manual and automatic. The facelifted model receives comprehensive styling and features upgrades. On the exterior, the car gets a new grille with wider chrome bars, revised headlamp cluster and bonnet, a faux skid plate, new alloys and larger fog lamps. \nInterior updates include a new 8-inch floating screen with Ford’s Sync 3 entertainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, Bang & Olufsen sound system with 10 speakers, a revised dashboard and two fast-charging USB ports.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on Donald Trump's transition to the presidency (all times EST):\n11:15 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump says on Twitter that Ford Motor Co. won't move Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico.\nTrump says in a tweet that Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford called him Thursday evening with the news.\nFord had planned to move the Lincoln MKC out of a factory in Louisville so it could make more Ford Escapes there. The company was considering a move to Mexico in a deal negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015.\nFord confirms in a statement Thursday night that the MKC will stay in Kentucky.\nTrump has been feuding with Ford over plans to move small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election didn't change the company's plan.\n___\n8 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's pick to be his national security adviser built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker.\nWhat set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart after he shed his uniform in 2014 was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon.\nHe took issue with a wide range of national security policies, including the administration's approach to fighting the Islamic State and, more generally, its handling of global affairs.\nIn recent public comments, including his fiery address at the Republican National Convention, Flynn has emphasized his view that the threat posed by the Islamic State group requires a more aggressive U.S. military, as well as his belief that Washington should work more closely with Moscow.\n___\n7:20 p.m.\nDonald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser.\nThat's according to a senior Trump official.\nThe official wouldn't say whether Flynn has officially accepted the job. Flynn has been a close adviser to Trump throughout the presidential campaign and has worked with him on national security issues during the transition.\nThe national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. The job is based in the White House and its occupant has frequent access to the president.\nThe official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly so insisted on anonymity.\n- By Julie Pace\n___\n7:10 p.m.\nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says he is convinced that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is a leader in whom he can have great confidence.\nAbe described his meeting with Trump on Thursday afternoon as \"really cordial\" and said he was convinced that he was able to establish a relationship of trust.\nAbe said during the meeting that he conveyed his views on basic issues, but declined to provide further details.\n\"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations (the) alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr. Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence,\" Abe said following the meeting.\n___\n6:02 pm\nDefense, justice and foreign policy officials say that the Trump transition team has contacted their departments, and that meetings and briefings are being set up.\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement that the department is in contact with Trump's representatives, and that officials \"look forward to supporting their work and preparations in keeping with the president's priority of ensuring a smooth transition.\"\nDefense Department press secretary Peter Cook official said Pentagon leaders received a phone call Wednesday afternoon and they expect to begin briefings on Friday. Eric Rosenbach, chief of staff to Defense Secretary Ash Carter, is heading the department's transition process.\nThe Justice Department also issued a statement that it had been contacted and would begin briefing transition team members.\n___\n4:30 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's transition team has finally finished key paperwork clearing the way for the White House to start sharing information.\nCoordination was on hold until Trump's team submitted documents, including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest.\nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine says the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday. That means agencies can start giving briefings and written materials to Trump's team.\nBut Trump's team still hasn't submitted names for some agencies. The White House isn't saying which agencies are missing.\nHoffine says the White House expects Trump's team will submit names for a \"wider range of agencies.\" She says the White House will process those \"on a rolling basis.\"\n___\n4:26 p.m.\nIsrael's Ambassador to the United States is calling President-Elect Donald Trump a \"friend of Israel\" and says the country looks forward to working with everyone in his administration.\nRon Dermer told reporters gathered in Trump Tower in New York City on Thursday that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence were both strong allies.\nDermer said Israel looks forward to working with the administration, \"including Steve Bannon, in making the US-Israel alliance stronger than ever.\"\nTrump has named Bannon, a far-right publishing executive, as his top White House Strategist. Bannon led the Breitbart website, considered by many to be the alt-right's platform that has been widely condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic.\n___\n3:27 p.m.\nMitt Romney will meet this weekend with Donald Trump.\nThat's according to a source involved with the incoming Republican president's transition, who described it as a \"healing meeting.\" The source requested anonymity because the event has not been officially announced.\nRomney was the 2012 presidential nominee and was an outspoken critic of Trump throughout the election. He slammed the New York businessman as a \"phony\" and a \"fraud.\"\nTrump repeatedly referred to Romney as a \"loser.\"\nBut the two began mending fences after Trump's victory. Romney called to congratulate Trump.\n\"Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Very nice!\"\n-By Julie Bykowicz\n___\n3:15\nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident Donald Trump's administration can find common ground with Democrats.\nPence spoke briefly with reporters after a private meeting with incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. He also met with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California during a busy day in Washington.\nPence says he's looking \"forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward.\"\nHe adds: \"I'm very grateful for the open door, and I look forward to carrying the presided-elect's agenda to all of the members of the Senate and all the members of the House after January 20th.\"\n___\n3:07 p.m.\nHouse Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a \"valued player\" on Capitol Hill.\nPence met with Pelosi and other House leaders Thursday. The former Indiana congressman says they discussed areas where they could work together, and that he and president-elect Donald Trump are \"working briskly\" on the transition.\nPelosi says Pence will be valued in Congress because he \"knows the territory.\" She says they talked about infrastructure and child care.\nShe says Democrats will try to find common ground where they can, and stand their ground when they can.\nA spokesman says Pelosi also has \"deep concerns\" about the appointment of conservative publisher Steve Bannon as a top White House adviser.\n__\n2:40 p.m.\nAmerica's future First Lady Melania Trump \"paused her studies\" to pursue a modeling career in Milan and Paris.\nThat's according to her new biography on President-elect Donald Trump's transition website, GreatAgain.gov.\nThe biography states that Melania Trump \"would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris.\"\nIt's a modified version of an older biography posted on her personal website, which stated that the would-be First Lady began jet-setting between modeling gigs \"after obtaining a degree in design and architecture at University in Slovenia.\"\nThat version was later removed from the website.\nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment\n___\n2:15 p.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence has taken time while on a break between Capitol Hill meetings to offer a personal welcome to some tourists.\nPence was walking through Statuary Hall when he stopped and unlatched the red velvet rope forming a barricade that separated him from some tour groups.\n\"Welcome,\" Pence told a mother and her son - visiting from Brazil. \"So nice to have you all here.\nNext up was a Massachusetts woman, Christine Slavin, and her service dog, Earle. Pence knelt down on one knee to speak with her eye to eye in her wheelchair.\n\"So nice to meet you,\" he told her. Enjoy your day at the Capitol.\"\nSlavin says it's great to meet a future leader, but she says she probably wouldn't have recognized Pence if other people hadn't mentioned his name.\n___\n1:50 p.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has wrapped up a meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Trump Tower.\nTrump's transition team says the incoming president and Kissinger discussed China, Russia, Iran and the European Union.\nIt comes ahead of Trump's meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his first in-person meeting with a foreign leader since his election.\nKissinger was Secretary of State under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.\n___\n1:40 p.m.\nNew York City charter school leader Eva Moskowitz is out of the running to be education secretary for President-elect Donald Trump.\nMoskowitz said Thursday she's taken herself out of the running. She heads New York's largest charter school network and met with Trump this week at Trump Tower.\nShe says she hopes to work with Trump on school choice and suggests there are \"positive signs\" the president-elect will govern differently than he campaigned.\nBut she adds that she voted for Hillary Clinton, and in a letter to parents, warns that many of her students are overwhelmingly black and Latino and would feel that \"they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump's campaign.\"\n___\n10:47 a.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence says he's confident the all-Republican government can \"rebuild our military, revive our economy and, in a word, make America great again.\"\nThat's what the Indiana governor said as he left a closed-door meeting with House Republicans. Pence was making the rounds of meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday, sitting down with Republican and Democratic leaders.\nPence spent more than a decade in Congress. He said it was humbling to be back among his colleagues. He sought to reassure Republicans that the Donald Trump transition wasn't in disarray.\n___\n10:44 a.m.\nVice President-elect Mike Pence has a simple message for House Republicans about the incoming administration and next year: \"Buckle up.\"\nThat's the word from lawmakers who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting with the Indiana governor.\nCongressman Daniel Webster of Florida said Pence told Republicans the next year won't be the slow process they're used to. With an all-Republican government led by Donald Trump, the GOP intends to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's record, from his health care law to environmental rules to cuts in domestic programs.\nCongressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina says the message was the administration will be aggressive and will require an all-hands-on-deck approach.\nPence also asked lawmakers to pray for Trump and his family.\n___\n10:10 a.m.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is calling on Donald Trump to apologize for some of his rhetoric during the presidential campaign. He's also asking Trump to cut ties with campaign CEO Steve Bannon.\nThe president-elect has named Bannon as a top White House adviser, sparking outcry from Democrats who say the conservative media CEO peddles conspiracy theories and white supremacy.\nSanders says his office received \"many, many\" calls from people wanting Trump to ditch Bannon.\nBut he also says there may be opportunities to work together on curbing high drug prices, renegotiating trade deals, curbing the influence of Wall Street and other ideas that will \"improve life for working people.\"\nSanders says Democrats will hold Trump accountable for his campaign promises.\nHe's speaking to reporters in Washington.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Bannon was appointed, not nominated.\n___\n8:50 a.m.\nSen. Ted Cruz is being coy about any role he might have been asked to play in the incoming Trump administration.\nCruz tells Fox News Channel's \"Fox and Friends\" that he and the billionaire businessman who was his bitter campaign rival had \"a far-reaching conversation\" at Trump Tower.\nBut when asked pointedly if the position of attorney general or any other administration post had been discussed, Cruz replied that \"the heart of what we talked about\" were solutions for the problems facing the country.\n\"I'm eager to work with the new president in whatever capacity I can have the greatest impact defending the principles that I was elected to defend,\" said the Texas Republican. Cruz fiercely challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination and relations between the pair were strained for months. Trump repeatedly referred to him as \"Lyin' Ted.\"\n___\n8:05 a.m.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway says she expects that initial announcements of Cabinet choices could come \"either before or after Thanksgiving\" and says \"it's Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone who makes the ultimate decisions.\"\nConway also says in a nationally broadcast interview she believes her boss is prepared for the weight of the presidency.\n\"I actually love seeing how engaged he is in the transition,\" Conway told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Thursday.\n\"He's there sitting at his desk, he's on the phone,\" and talking to advisers, she said. \"He's ready.\"\nConway said the pace of Trump's transition work is on a par with the timetables of recent presidents-elect.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "DETROIT (AP) - Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35-percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico.\nIn an interview with CNBC Tuesday, Fields said Ford is proceeding with its plan to move Focus car production from Michigan to a new plant in Mexico by 2018. He stressed that no jobs will be lost, since the Michigan plant will make two other vehicles.\nFields also warned that a tariff would affect the entire industry - and autoworkers' profit-sharing checks - since many companies sell Mexican- and Canadian-made vehicles or parts.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Post by benleegraham on Nov 20, 2016 11:14:45 GMT It's time to sell my Scorpio, I've owned the car since February this year and have spent loads on it. When I bought the car it had been off the road for the best part of 4 years so I replaced all the tyres as they had cracked. The flexible brake hoses were also replaced as they had cracks. The car ran but needed a new battery, all the service items changing and a new radiator. At this point it was ready for an mot. On the way there it was obvious that there was a problem with the speedometer not working. The vehicle speed sensor was replaced and the wiring checked and this fixed the speedo and the gearbox started to work properly. The windscreen cracked on the way to the mot but they passed it as its not in the \"fail\" area. Unfortunately I bought cheap tpft insurance and it doesn't cover wind screens. I have got one quote from national wind screens but at £315 I'd suggest the new owner gets fully comp and makes a claim. There's also a stone chip in the middle of the passenger side now (as of 17.11.16) I've tried to take pictures of all the worst bits, hopefully you can see the paint on the bonnet, roof and boot is crazed. If the body work was fixed it would be a great example. The car was undersealed by the previous owner and there is overspray all over the car. Some one who knows body work would make this into a brillant example. Mechanically it is great and I love how it drives.The key fobs I have both work, but they are temperamental. Out of the two keys I have only the red one seems to work, not sure why the black one doesn't but I've always just used the red one. The drivers seat doesn't move forward or backward, I have a spare seat base but never swapped it as I don't need to move the seat I've never opened the sunroof in case it breaks and I can't shut it again. They are known to fail and I haven't fancied trying it. The car has had alot of money spent on it since I bought it last year New flexi brake hoses New Uni royal rainsport 2 tyres all round (£240) New gearbox speed sensor (£150) Service done by me with: air, oil, fuel and pollen filters Shell 5w30 fully synthetic oil spark plugs",
