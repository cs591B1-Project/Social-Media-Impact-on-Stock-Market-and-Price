      "text": "Trades from $ 3 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL – December 07, 2016 – Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \"The positive earnings growth from the Q3 earnings season is expected to continue in the current period as well, with the growth pace expected to ramp up notably in the following quarters.\" Earnings Growth to Stay Positive in Q4 Note: The following is an excerpt from this week’s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actuals and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>> The positive earnings growth from the Q3 earnings season is expected to continue in the current period as well, with the growth pace expected to ramp up notably in the following quarters. Many in the market see the incoming administration as favorable to the overall corporate earnings picture, though it will likely be some time before we start seeing that in estimates. That said, the recent uptrend in long-term interest rates and the expected impact of those higher interest rates on banks’ margins is the most tangible change on the earnings front since the election. Total Q4 earnings for the S&P 500 companies expected to be up +3.2% from the same period last year on +4% higher revenues. This would follow the +3.7% growth in Q3 earnings on +1.2% higher revenues. Please note that the positive earnings growth in Q3 followed five back-to-back quarters of earnings declines for the S&P 500 index, a big part of which was the drag from the Energy sector. Comparisons for the Energy sector turn positive in Q4, with the sector’s earnings growth turning positive for the first time after 8 quarters of declines. The negative revisions to Q4 estimates aren’t new or unusual; we have been seeing this trend play out quarter after quarter for almost three years now. That said, the magnitude of negative revisions to Q4 estimates is lower relative to the comparable periods in other recent quarters. In other words, estimates for Q4 have come down, but they haven’t come down as much as was the case in other recent quarters. Estimates for the Technology and Finance sectors, the two largest in the index, have held up really well. In fact, the Technology sector is the only sector to experience positive estimate revisions, largely reflecting favorable revision trends for bellwether operators like Apple (NASDAQ:( AAPL - Free Report ) – Free Report ), Facebook (NASDAQ:( FB - Free Report ) – Free Report ) and others. The sectors suffering the biggest negative revisions include Basic Materials, Industrial Products, Construction, Autos and Transportation. For example, Q4 earnings growth for the Basic Materials sector currently is +0.3%, which is a decline from the +18.2% growth expected at the start of the quarter. It is reasonable to expect estimates for 2017 Q1 to come down as companies start reporting current quarter results and share their business outlook with us. But given the relatively low magnitude of negative revisions that we experienced for Q4 estimates, 2017 Q1 estimates may not fall by that much either. The positive earnings growth in Q3 followed five back-to-back quarters of earnings declines for the S&P 500 index. The tough environment in the Energy sector was a major contributor to that run of earnings declines. The fact that earnings growth turned positive in Q3 despite the sector still facing tough comparisons is testament to the improvement in the overall growth picture. The Energy sector’s comparisons turn positive in Q4, with the sector becoming a growth contributor going forward. The recent momentum in oil prices following the OPEC announcement adds to the sector’s earnings outlook for the current and following periods.

      "text": "So, when a user logs in to the website to search for a person or place to replace or repair some damaged part of the iPhone or Mac, Apple directs him/her to third party repair options and not just its own stores.(Reuters) In the latest update to its online support system, global tech giant Apple has made its possible to locate a place to get their devices repaired. According to a MacRumors report, Apple on its website has included details about third party service providers authorised by the company. So, when a user logs in to the website to search for a person or place to replace or repair some damaged part of the iPhone or Mac, the company directs him/her to third party repair options and not just its own stores. Apple will book appointments with the authorised third party as well.\nThis might appear to be a small change, but long time iPhone and iPad users will swear by the fact that Apple stores in big towns and cities have long waiting for queues, as well as waiting time can extend to as much as a week or two. Apple has authorised some shops which the company has assessed that they can work as AppleCare repair and out-of-warranty fix shop as well. These shops may not look as great, minimalist and fancy as Apple’s regular stores but since they might be able to fix your iPhone or MacBook within a day, you can be happy about it. This is also good news for Apple stores in busy areas which are unable to keep up with the increasing consumer demands and provide quicker service.\nWhat else is making news:",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 30 minutes ago with 0 comments \nApple today released iOS 10.2 beta 7 to both developers and Public Beta testers. The version number is 14C92, and it's the third build that the company has released within the past week, with the most recent being on Monday alongside macOS 10.12.2 Sierra and watchOS 3.1.1 beta 5 . \nThe release notes show a couple fixes for this release - including the TV app not crashing on iPod Touch devices, and it fixes sync issues with iTunes 12.5.x - although to be fair, those have been listed as \"fixed in this release\" since at least Friday's beta 5 . \niOS 10.2 contains the new TV app, which is meant to be a hub for all of your video content - with the exception of Netflix - and it should replace the Videos app itself. There's also support for the 72 new emojis that come with Unicode 9, so you can show your friends your love of bacon and avocados without the complications that come from having to use actual words. \nYou'll also find some minor new features, such as new wallpapers (that you've probably already seen in promotional images), and there's an option in Settings to preserve your Camera settings from the last time that you opened the app (you're going to want to look into that, or else Live Photos will get turned on every time you open it). \niOS 10.2 is slated for a December launch, alongside macOS 10.12.2 Sierra, watchOS 3.1.1, and tvOS 10.1, and it should be pretty soon. With so many new builds in such a short period of time, Apple seems to be gearing up for general availability. Tags",

      "text": "Job Vacancies Samsung prevails over Apple in $399 mn patent appeal SEOUL: This file photo taken on October 26, 2016 shows people on an elevator as the logo of Samsung Electronics is seen on a glass door at a flagship store. — AFP \nWASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $399 million patent infringement penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple’s iPhone design, in a case watched for its implications for technology innovation. \nThe shorthanded justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court. \nWhile the ruling was short on specifics, analysts said it was likely to curb litigation from patent holders expecting to reap big profits from infringement on a component. A jubilant Samsung hailed the “victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.” \nThe 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty-one element of a major patent infringement case-was inappropriate because it represented “Samsung’s entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones” for copying the iPhone’s “rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.” But the court stopped short of delving into details of how the lower court should determine the penalty. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion that “doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture… and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.” The court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details. The case is one element of the $548 million penalty-knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award-Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents. \nNo clarity Observers had been watching to see how the court-which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century-would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. \nDennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed. “Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,” Crouch said in a blog post. Crouch said the court allowed for damages at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is “an article of manufacture,” leaving the matter open to interpretation. “Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level (of damages) applies in particular cases,” he wrote. \nSamsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation. Apple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics, citing precedents like Coca-Cola’s iconic soda bottle. \nReacting to the verdict, an Apple spokesman said in an email, “Our case has always been about Samsung’s blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute… We remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn’t right.” Samsung did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n‘Sigh of relief’ Florian Mueller, an intellectual property analyst who writes a closely followed patent blog, wrote that “large parts of the (US and global) tech industry will breathe a sigh of relief now,” even if the case is not settled. \nEd Black, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which represents major tech firms, welcomed the ruling. “This was a pivotal court case for the technology industry and it is encouraging to see the law interpreted and applied in a way that makes sense in a modern era and protects both inventors and innovation,” Black said. The lower court’s interpretation of design patents, Black said, “would have had a chilling effect on investment and the development of products-especially in the tech sector.” Brian Love, a law professor who follows technology at the University of Santa Clara, said it was noteworthy that the top court declined to provide detailed guidance on how to resolve the damage award. \n“The district court may well end up allowing the entire amount to stand, but it seems more likely that the award will be substantially reduced,” Love said. Still, Love said it may dissuade companies from launching new lawsuits on design patents. “Interest in design patents spiked following Apple’s first jury verdict in 2012,” he said. “Companies suddenly saw design patent rights as a potential gold mine. Now, it seems likely that assertion of design patents will return to being a rare occurrence.”-AFP  ",

      "text": "It seems that Apple Inc. ( AAPL - Free Report ) is facing the same safety issues as its rival Samsung, as eight iPhone 6 handsets have reportedly exploded in China.\nAs per a report released by the Shanghai Consumer Council, the handsets’ batteries powered down emitting smoke and eventually exploded. The Council has called upon Apple to look into the matter. The Council report also added that the company had, earlier in the year, replaced a woman’s iPhone that exploded with a new one without “addressing the cause” of the explosion.\nAPPLE INC Price\nAPPLE INC Price | APPLE INC Quote:\nIn its response to a Reuters mail, Apple claimed that the incidents occurred due to the overheating of the lithium ion batteries caused by “external physical damages”. Apparently, investigations are on for the overheating and battery explosion problems of iPhone as the company is facing a number of complaints.\nPer a Reuters report, analysts are of the opinion that Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, which resulted in recall of some 2.5 million units, caused a sense of “distrust” among Chinese consumers towards international (as well as expensive) smartphone brands. Plus, increasing competition from home grown cheaper smartphones, has highly affected the sale of iPhones in the country.\nThough Apple is pinning its hopes on iPhone 7 to help it regain lost ground in China, the increasing safety issues regarding the product are a big concern.\nAt present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Year to date, Apple shares have generated a return of 4.46% compared with the Zacks Computer Mini Industry’s gain of 5.13%.\nBetter-ranked stocks in the wider technology space include TiVo Corporation ( TIVO - Free Report ) , Facebook Inc. ( FB - Free Report ) and Akamai Technologies, Inc. ( AKAM - Free Report ) . While TiVo sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Facebook and Akamai are Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks. stocks here .\nIn the trailing four quarters, TiVo, Facebook and Akamai have yielded positive average earnings surprises of 97.76%, 21.11% and 2.51%, respectively.\nConfidential from Zacks\nBeyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

      "text": "– A + Invite-only meeting details state of AI, machine learning research inside Apple's halls By Mike Wuerthele \nWednesday, December 07, 2016, 11:21 am PT (02:21 pm ET) \nIn an invitation-only meeting at Tuesdays Neural Information Processing Systems conference, Apple's head of machine learning broke down Apple's specific goals for its artificial intelligence developments, and detailed where it feels it has an advantage of its competitors, giving a rare look at Apple's research process.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to presentation slides supplied to Quartz , Apple's over-arching theme for artificial intelligence research is roughly the same as everybody else's: image identification, voice recognition for use in digital assistants, and user behavior prediction. Apple uses all of these techniques with Siri on macOS and iOS now.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, without specifically mentioning that Apple was working on a vehicle or systems associated with self-driving autos, the presentation by machine learning head Russ Salakhutdinov also discussed \"volumentric detection of LiDAR,\" or measuring and identifying objects at-range with lasers.\n\nLIDAR is a surveying method that measures distance to a target by illuminating that target with a laser light, and is commonly used for automotive guidance systems. The core technology also sees frequent use in map-making for a wide array of sciences.\n\nApple claimed in the meeting that Apple's GPU-based implementation of image recognition was capable of processing twice as many photos per second as Google's system, cranking out 3000 images per second, besting claimed 1500. Apple's system is more efficient as well, with Salakhutdinov noting that the array was comprised of one third of the GPUs as Google's, with both utilizing Amazon's cloud computing services.\n\n\n\n\nDelving deeper into what Apple is working on, is parent-teacher neural networks, where a larger neural network with a equally large amount of data transfers a neural network to a smaller device, like an iPhone, with no compromise in decision-making quality. Implementation of this feature would allow for a subset of a vast artificially intelligent system to make decisions on a mobile device of lesser power, instead of being forced to feed any relevant data to a larger processing network and then the device waiting on a response to the query.\n\nBefore the meeting about Apple's artificial intelligence focus on Tuesday, Apple publicly announced that Apple scientists would be allowed to publish and collaborate with the larger research community, for the first time.\n\nCook has also recently revealed that Apple's Yokohama, Japan, research facility will boast \"deep engineering\" for machine learning, far different from Apple's Siri voice assistant.\n\nApple is also rumored to be utilizing the technology for self-driving car systems , as an offshoot of the \"Project Titan\" whole-car program .",

      "text": "NEW YORK: Apple's streaming service says it has reached 20 million subscribers, showing quick growth as the tech titan tries to close in on sector leader Spotify.\nApple Music launched in June 2015 as Apple, which revolutionised digital music with iTunes 15 years ago, saw the future in streaming - a service that allows online listeners to play unlimited music on demand.\nSenior Apple official Eddy Cue, revealing the figures in an interview with Billboard published late Tuesday, predicted further rapid gains entering 2017.\n\"There are billions of people listening to music and we haven't even hit 100 million subscribers. There's a lot of growth opportunity,\" Cue told the music-industry magazine.\nHe said that more than 60 per cent of Apple Music subscribers have not bought from iTunes for the past year - a sign of streaming's steady rise over pay-per-track downloads.\nApple Music still trails Spotify, which announced in September that it had 40 million paying subscribers.\nThe Swedish company also has a free, advertising-backed tier - controversial among some artists - which brings Spotify's total listeners to 100 million.\nSpotify and Apple Music have plenty of smaller competitors including established streaming players Deezer and Rhapsody and rap mogul Jay Z's upstart Tidal.\nOnline retail giant Amazon in October entered the streaming war, offering a discount rate to subscribers who use the company's speakers.\nApple, like Tidal, has sought to erode Spotify's base by offering exclusives. Apple Music had early windows in which it alone offered the latest albums by leading hip-hop artists Drake, Chance the Rapper and Frank Ocean.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the figures.\n- AFP/de\nEmail More",

      "text": "When Apple announced its new iPhone in September, the news was overshadowed by a goofy plumber with a bushy mustache and bright blue overalls: Nintendo unveiled its first-ever smartphone game starring its biggest icon, Super Mario himself. \nNintendo/Apple \n\"Super Mario Run\" arrives on December 15 for $10 , and it's coming to the iPhone/iPad first thanks to a deal struck between Nintendo and Apple. Nintendo creative director Shigeru Miyamoto even appeared on stage to announce it — Miyamoto is essentially the Walt Disney of video games, having created Mario, Link, Donkey Kong, and many other iconic Nintendo characters. \nFor Miyamoto to appear on stage with Apple's Tim Cook was, to put it lightly, a very big deal. \nLeft: Nintendo creative director Shigeru Miyamoto | Right: Apple CEO Tim Cook Stephen Lam/Getty Images \nIn a Tokyo event on December 7, Sony's mobile gaming unit made a less splashy, broader announcement about Sony's PlayStation games: 10 smartphone titles are in the works, with six planned for launch in the coming fiscal year, according to Reuters . \nUnlike Nintendo's approach, Sony's leading with lesser-known games from PlayStation's past — music/rhythm game \"PaRappa the Rapper\" and tactical role-playing game \"Arc the Lad.\" Also unlike Nintendo's approach, it appears that Sony's targeting Japan first; the games will arrive on iPhone and Android in Japan and other parts of Asia before going worldwide. \nThis makes particular sense for the \"Arc the Lad\" series — it's wildly popular in Japan. \n\"Arc The Lad: Twilight of the Spirits\" on the PlayStation 2. This game is actually available on the PlayStation 4 as well. Sony \nIt looks like the mobile versions of these games aren't direct ports of the original PlayStation 1 games. \nA version of \"Hot Shots Golf\" (known as \"Everybody's Golf\" in Japan) shown after the presentation demonstrates how the series is being adapted for smartphone gaming: \nSony \nThe PlayStation Blog in Japan has a ton more details, and a longer list of games. Many of them seemed destined to not arrive in the US, but assuredly some will — here's the list: \"Arc the Lad\"",

      "text": "Apple's new Single sign-on feature will let users enter cable service account details once to automatically access TV apps thereafter. It is currently available in the United States and is supported by a growing list of cable providers. ( Apple ) Advertisement \nApple wants to streamline your cable viewing experiencing through its recent initiative to introduce the Single sign-on feature for iOS and tvOS. \nA number of cable service providers have already jumped on-board and these include CenturyLink Prism, Hawaiian Telecom, MetroCast and Guam's GTA. This list further expanded the previous roster constituted by Dish, DirecTV, Hotwire and Sling TV. How Single Sign-On Works \nUp to this point, cable subscribers have to provide their account details to different TV apps when viewing content found on Apple mobile devices and the Apple TV. \nThe Single sign-on feature will only require cable subscribers to enter their account information in the iOS Settings app once in order to be signed into TV Everywhere apps. This is, of course, limited to the current stable of participating cable companies. \nAccording to Mac Rumors, Single sign-on began rolling out Dec. 6 to iOS 10 and tvOS 10 devices but is still limited to the United States. Major providers such as Spectrum, Google Fiber, AT&T U-verse, Verizon Fios and Comcast Xfinity have not yet confirmed whether they will be joining the initiative. Sign-On Process \nTo use Single sign-on, head to the Settings menu, then choose Accounts. You will find a list of TV providers there and select whichever cable company you are subscribed to. You will then have to enter your account details. You can ask your cable for support if you don't know this information. \nNow, here is where things can get a little complicated. Cable providers have their respective apps on iOS and tvOS and before using Single sign-on, some of these could require their subscribers to log in first into those apps. That should be quite tedious. Third-party app support could also entail coding tweaks, so some providers could offer support later on. \nApple stressed that Single sign-on will only work on iOS 10 and later versions. The process, thereafter, pretty much fulfills Apple's promise of single sign-in and instant access to video apps included in pay TV subscription. Single Sign-On and Apple TV \nObservers believe that Apple has rolled out Single sign-on feature to pave the way for its upcoming TV app. This is a proprietary video streaming platform that aggregates media content streaming and on-demand video services. One can say that it is also a location to find new content and track what a user is watching across different devices. \nThe Apple TV app is expected to debut once iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1 are unleashed. These platforms are currently in beta stage so they are expected to roll out soon.  ",

      "text": "Cal Jeffrey \nA Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday gave Samsung some breathing room in its fight against Apple over patent violations. It marks a small victory for the Korean electronics firm, but the battle is far from over. \nIn 2011, Apple filed suit against Samsung over several patent and trademark violations. According to Techdirt , the lawsuit contained seven complaints of utility patent violations, three design patent violations, trademark infringements on six different icons, and three “trade dress” infringements. Several of the complaints were identical to those in lawsuits previously filed against Motorola and HTC. \nA lower court ruled in Apple’s favor in 2012 and awarded the Cupertino powerhouse almost $1 billion. The amount equated to all of the profits made from the devices in violation. According to USA Today , the penalties were later reduced to $548 million and then further reduced to $399 million. \nNaturally, Samsung appealed the decision, and in an 8-0 Supreme Court ruling, Samsung is relieved of the $399 million forfeiture. The case hinged on the technical definition of “article of manufacture.” \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor stated in her opinion, “The term ‘article of manufacture’ is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product whether sold separately or not.” \nCheif Justice John Roberts added, “Samsung did not infringe on ‘all the chips and wires.'” Justices Sotomayor and Roberts agreed that Samsung did not copy the design of the iPhone in detail. [Image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)] \nIn essence what the Supreme Court ruling says is that Apple may be entitled to compensation over individual components of the iPhone, but not over the design of the whole device. Judge Sotomayor illustrated it with an analogy in her written opinion. \n“In the case of a design for a single-component product, such as a dinner plate, the product is the ‘article of manufacture’ to which the design has been applied. In the case of a design for a multi-component product, such as a kitchen oven, identifying the ‘article of manufacture’ to which the design has been applied is a more difficult task.” \nWhile the Supreme Court ruling does not let Samsung off the hook, it does seem to indicate that the penalty may see another reduction. As for now, the case will go back to the lower courts where a determination will be made as to which components of the iPhone are the “article of manufacture” in the lawsuit and how much profit Samsung made from those parts. \nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will have to decide how much of its profit Samsung will have to turn over to Apple. Experts in the field of intellectual property law expect the legal wrangling to take several more years. \n“It won’t be easy for courts to differentiate between a product’s design and its overall use, not to mention setting dollar figures for components,” stated USA Today . \nBoth sides are expected to argue over the “proper tests for calculating damages for infringement of a design patent.” Apple claims that Samsung violated several patents by copying design features of the iPhone. [Image by Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images] \nDespite the Supreme Court’s ruling, Apple remains adamant that its intellectual property has been stolen. \n“Our case has always been about Samsung’s blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch . “We remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn’t right.” \nSamsung is staying optimistic as well. Problems with products like the Galaxy Note 7 and some of its washing machines have hung over the company like a dark cloud this year. According to a statement issued to TechCrunch , the company is looking at the small legal victory as a ray of light through that cloud. \n“The U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision today is a victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace. We thank our supporters from the world’s leading technology companies, the 50 intellectual property professors, and the many public policy groups who stood with us as we fought for a legal environment that fairly rewards invention and fosters innovation.” \nSamsung is already facing $5.4 billion in losses between now and the first two quarters of 2017 from the exploding Galaxy Note 7 fiasco. Even though the Supreme Court ruling does not relieve the company of financial liability in the patent lawsuit, the Court’s decision has at least bought it some time to recover before having to fork over millions more of its profits to Apple. \n[Featured Image by Zach Gibson/Getty Images]",

      "title": "Snapchat sees what Facebook, Google and Apple missed - Science & Health - Haaretz.com",
      "text": "Israeli-invented instant messaging is big business but not big profits When Google revealed its Google Glass in 2013, the world swooned. The optical head-mounted display shaped somewhat like eyeglasses looked weird but clearly this was the future. Three years on, we realize they were evidently a bit too futuristic. But now there’s a new player on the board: Snapchat Spectacles. In contrast to Google, the parent company, Snap, decided to make a product that was a little less smart, and to market it a lot more cleverly.The Google product was too smart for its own good. All the Spectacles do is take short video clips, 30 seconds at max, and upload them to the Snapchat app on your phone. The device has none of the computing power or additional apps that Google Glass boasted, which a few geeks might bemoan but which has the rest of the world feeling rather relieved. The key problem with Google Glass hadn’t been among users but among everybody else. People figure they’ll know when you’re taking their picture or even filming them with a smartphone, as you have to aim a device at them. But if you’re filming them just by looking towards them, they can’t know, which is a kind of creepy feeling. Just as bad, as the glasses were smart, had computing power and could connect to applications. So the vibe (if not necessarily the reality) was that your image could be identified, disseminated, uploaded to the cloud, manipulated or heaven-knows-what. And all this is being done to them by a person who looks like a cyborg. Snapchat Spectacles does retain a key creepy feature that Google Glass had, too. You still won’t know when somebody’s taking your picture in the street unless you notice that the camera-on LEDs on the glasses are flashing. The Snapchat Spectacles look like stylish glasses. They don’t make you look like a cyborg. “They didn’t go for the technological aspect at all. The idea was not to be creepy. They just wanted to give kids sunglasses with a camera, in order to boost the interaction with their app,” says Jonathan Schipper, founder and products VP at Gemsense. In his case, the company achieved its goal. He’d barely used Snapchat before he got Spectacles and now uploads all the time, from his trip on a scooter to the first minutes of meeting with a friend or a vignette with the kid. Click and film, without okay Google or any other messing around.Schipper is an early adapter, if not the first. He brought two pairs of Spectacles to Israel, the second for Hillel Fuld, marketing manager at Zcast. Both Schipper and Fuld are over 25, so adjusting to the app and new technology – the glasses see and film exactly what you see – took some doing. At first he thought, “WTF is Snapchat,” Fuld admits – for one thing, he couldn’t stand its interface, but ultimately he forced himself, mainly because Snapchat and its meteoric rise were something that could not be ignored. The company is preparing for a public offering at a company value of up to $25 billion. Even Google has invested. In June, Snapchat passed Twitter in number of daily users, reaching 150 million compared with Twitter’s 140 million. Crucially, it has won over the young. Paul Sweeney, head of North America research for Bloomberg Intelligence, recently remarked that 60% of Snapchat’s users are under 34 and according to Statista, young people say it’s their most important social media. Last year, 24 percent of American youngsters defined it as their most important network, closely followed by Instagram with 23 percent. This year, the figure has risen to 35 percent while Instagram rose to 24 percent.What are oldsters like Fuld and Schipper doing there? “Everything I upload to Facebook I think about a lot,” says Schipper. “I know everyone will look at it and it will remain there forever… the idea with Snapchat is that I upload whatever I see now, and it doesn’t stay for everyone to see for life... I chose for my information to remain for 24 hours – this is who I am, now, and it isn’t who I will be tomorrow or in a year.” Suddenly Facebook looks lumbering, dated, Fuld says. “I go through everything in my feed pretty fast. With Snapchat you can’t keep up. The thing is, these are short things, brief attractions. It’s new and refreshing in my mind, though maybe for the young it isn’t that new.” If he wants more information beyond a clip and picture, he can get in touch with the poster, he points out. He also gets greater engagement on Snapchat than on Facebook plus Twitter plus Instagram altogether, Fuld says. Snapchat actually rethought what people want online, and the Spectacles are a bold step nobody foresaw, not only because a young software company suddenly leaped into hardware. While developing the product, they decided to change the rules of video format and find a way to resolve a long-standing complaint among users: Vertical video syndrome (a snarky name for the fact that some people seem categorically unable to shoot video film in anything other than portrait mode, even “when common sense dictates the device should be turned on its side to film in landscape mode.” With the Specs and the Snapshot app, however you hold your phone – the viewing experience remains good. In short, the video clip will adapt itself to the angle at which you’re holding your phone. It’s very much like 360-degree VR filming, especially when the camera is moving around. But the real success is that in contrast to Google Glass, these things are a hit, mainly thanks to Snapchat’s brilliant campaign. It didn’t open stores or start selling the things through Amazon. It created a popup campaign, placing vending machines here and there, designed not entirely unlike the Minions. It announces the location of the machines only shortly before their arrival, limits any purchase to two pairs and thus has created a supply crunch out of nothing: the faithful stampede. It isn’t rare for somebody on line to buy the two pairs and sell the other to somebody else on line. Or on eBay. “When was the last time you saw a queue a kilometer and a half long for something that isn’t Apple?” Fuld says. “People wait three, six, 18 hours on line,” Schipper says. He tried to bribe somebody to wait on line in his stead, offering as much as $200. Nobody would bite. ",

      "text": "</iframe> \nthe Supreme Court found an ambiguity in the Patent Act, reversing Apple’s $399 million infringement award against Samsung. \ninternational litigation war between Apple and Samsung, Apple prevailed at the trial court level on a design patent infringement case regarding Apple’s rounded corners and user interfaces. Apple was awarded $399 million, representing Samsung’s total profits from sales of the infringing smartphones. Samsung appealed that Apple was only entitled to the profits based on the infringing aspects (the corners and interfaces) not the profits from the entire phone. The Federal Circuit disagreed, affirming the Apple award. In its appeal to the Supreme Court, Samsung ridiculed the lower court’s ruling, arguing that under the Federal Circuit’s logic “profits on an entire car – or even an eighteen-wheel tractor trailer – must be awarded based on an undetachable infringing cup-holder.” \nnimous court, agreed with Samsung, finding that “the term ‘article of manufacture’ [in Section 289 of the Patent Act] is broad enough to embrace both a product sold to a consumer and a component of that product.” The Court acknowledged that the parties asked “us go further and resolve whether, for each of the design patents at issue here, the relevant article of manufacture is the smartphone, or a particular smartphone component.” But the Court punted: “Doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture at the first step of the §289 damages inquiry and to parse the record to apply the test in this case.” Instead, the Court remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit. ’s Next? \n’s smartphones, the “article of manufacture” are the infringing components or the entire smartphone, and then (B) to calculate the proper amount of damages associated with the article of manufacture. \ngamblers on a sporting event over which they have no control, parties litigating patent infringement actions can only hold their collective breath and wait to see which test the Federal Circuit devises and whether the test is pro-plaintiff or defendant. Undoubtedly, the losing party (Apple or Samsung) will argue the Federal Circuit got it wrong, and ask the Supreme Court for a do-over. \nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations. \n© Wendel, Rosen, Black & Dean LLP | Attorney Advertising & Dean LLP on: …\" By using the service, you signify your acceptance of JD Supra's Privacy Policy.

      "text": "There have been many times of late when I have sat back and wondered what Apple was thinking. Sometimes I feel like Tim Cook is sitting in his office thinking up what he can do to mess with Apple fans today. I can see no other reason for launching the new MacBooks and ditching almost all the connectivity options. If you have a new MacBook Pro and you want to get back your ports, you need the HyperDrive .\nThis relatively compact add-on is a hub that plugs into two of your USB-C ports and brings back all your connectivity. You get an HDMI port, Thunderbolt 3 port, USB-C port, microSD card slot, SD card slot, and a pair of USB 3.1 ports. Running at up to 50Gb/s, there’s enough bandwidth to use all those ports at the same time.\nThe Thunderbolt port will also allow you to charge the notebook as you use it. The HyperDrive is on Kickstarter and will set you back $69(USD). Shipping expected to start in March 2017. Take that Tim Cook.\n",

The latest beta, with a build number of 14C92, actually comes in as a 1.98GB OTA update, unlike prior beta updates that were generally under 100MB; the larger size points to the possibility that this latest beta may be a final “GM” release leading to an impending general release of iOS 10.2 to the public. We’ll update with any notable findings.",

As seen in the chart below, 15% of the market cited Amazon Payments as the most preferred payments method after credit card, only trailing PayPal, and coming in way ahead of Apple and Google's competing products.\nRBC Capital\nAmazon Payments enables customers to pay through their Amazon accounts while shopping on other e-commerce sites, saving them the hassle of entering their credit card and shipping info again. Since its launch, the product has gotten thousands of sites on board, but with only a few big names — like the inflight Internet service Gogo — making the list.\nIn April, Amazon Payments launched a new Global Partner Program which allows e-commerce platform providers to easily integrate its service. TechCrunch reported at the time that Amazon has 285 million account holders, with over 23 million of them having paid through their accounts on other sites.\nStill, Mahaney said it's unclear if Amazon Payments will be able to catch up to PayPal and become the de facto paying platform. Payments in general is not a completely underserved market, and Amazon may decide to invest more on growing other initiatives, like its grocery delivery or shipping logistics businesses.\n\"The one challenge here to whether this really becomes the fourth pillar for Amazon is that it’s already a reasonably efficiently served market,\" Mahaney said.\nDisclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.\nLearn more: Credit Card Industry and Market Mobile Payment Technologies Mobile Payments Industry Mobile Payment Market, Trends and Adoption Credit Card Processing Industry List of Credit Card Processing Companies List of Credit Card Processing Networks List of Payment Gateway Providers M-Commerce: Mobile Shopping Trends E-Commerce Payment Technologies and Trends\nSEE ALSO: How Amazon can become the world's first trillion-dollar business NOW WATCH: Here's why some people have a tiny hole above their ears Loading video...

But Apple’s senior VP of Internet software and services Eddy Cue told Billboard magazine that there’s still room to grow—especially when to comes to catching up to Spotify ’s 40 million paid subscribers.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "At an exclusive invitation-only lunch at an AI conference in Barcelona, Spain that took place on December 6, Apple head of machine learning Russ Salakhutdinov and other Apple employees talked about their work on artificial intelligence.\n\nQuartz has obtained some of the slides that Salakhutdinov used during the presentation, giving us a glimpse at the advancements Apple is making in AI and machine learning.\n\nBased on one of the slides, topics at the lunch were wide-ranging, including health and vital signs, volumetric detection of LiDAR, prediction with structured outputs, image processing and colorization, intelligent assistant and language modeling, and activity recognition.\nOne of the slides, related to Apple's LiDAR work, featured a picture of two cars, but Apple engineers did not mention cars or any automotive research, such as self- driving vehicles. Another slide focused on Apple's image recognition algorithms, which are able to process 3,000 images per second, twice as fast as Google's capabilities. Apple's work on smaller neural networks that can run directly on devices was also covered.Another slide focused on Apple's ability to build neural networks that are 4.5 times smaller than the originals with no loss in accuracy, and twice the speed. The technique, not unknown in AI research, uses a larger, more robust neural network to teach another network the decisions it would make in a variety of situations. The \"student\" network then has a streamlined version of the \"teacher\" network's knowledge. In essence, it predicts the larger network's predictions about a given photo or audio sample.\n\nThe discussion also covered some of Apple's research focus areas:\n\n- Deep generative models\n- Model compression\n- Holistic scene understanding\n- Model reliability\n- Deep reinforcement learning\n- Unsupervised learning, transfer learning, one-shot learning\n- Reasoning, attention & memory\n- Efficient training on distributed computing\n\nGoing forward, Apple plans to allow its AI and machine learning researchers to start publishing papers, marking its willingness to contribute to the research community. Apple has always been notoriously secretive, but allowing researchers to publish could attract top talent that would not otherwise want to join the company.\n\nA full rundown of the slides from Apple's presentation can be seen over at Quartz.\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "title": "Apple Watch Series 1 Review",
      "text": "Apple Watch Series 1 Review Apple Watch Series 1 Review 7.3 Comments Introduction When Apple held their big keynote event back in September, a heap of new products were announced. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were easily the starlets of the entire show, but they were also accompanied by the new AirPods and Apple Watch Series 2. While these guys were definitely the highlights of the keynote, another product was announced as well. Apple introduced it on stage, and although it didn’t receive nearly the amount of fanfare or attention, it’s a new product nonetheless.The product goes by the name Apple Watch Series 1, and while it’s essentially replacing the void of the original Apple Watch, it’s important for two very key reasons – performance and price. The Apple Watch Series 1 boasts a dual-core processor similar to that of the Series 2, and while it lacks built-in GPS and extreme water-resistance, it comes in at a much more affordable price point. We’ve already reviewed the Apple Watch Series 2, and seeing as how these two gadgets are both incredibly similar, we’re going to try and keep things as short and sweet as possible by only focusing on the main areas that make the Series 1 unique compared to Series 2. With that said, let’s get started. In the box: Apple Watch Series 1 (in this case, the 38mm Space Gray Aluminum variant with the Black Sport Band) S/M and M/L band sizes Magnetic charging puck How-to manual for watchOS and Sport Band Safety/warranty info Design Right off the bat, differences between the Series 1 and Series 2 can be found within the design. Both versions look identical from an aesthetics standpoint, but the Series 2 does have the upper-hand over the Series 1 with its 50-meters of water resistance. This means that the Series 2 is much better-suited for swimming or showering with than Series 1, but Series 1 does still feature IPX7 water resistance. Although Apple doesn’t recommend you fully submerge the Series 1 variant of the Apple Watch, you can certainly still keep it on your wrist while doing dishes or if you happen to get caught outside during a rainstorm. In addition to the lack of true water-proofing, the Series 1 is also available in a much more limited collection as opposed to Series 2. As it stands, the Series 1 Apple Watch is only available with an aluminum casing and sport band. If you’d like to purchase the Apple Watch with a stainless steel case or different style of band, you’ll have to opt for Series 2. Of course, nothing stops you from purchasing a different kind of Watch band separately, and using it with the Watch Series 1.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Analyst Paul Peterson of boutique research firm BlueFin Research Partners today follows up on the work of his colleagues John Donovan and Steve Mullane , who on Monday cut their estimates for Apple ’s ( AAPL ) iPhone production, writing that so far, there’s not too much to be worried about as regards chip suppliers to Apple such as Broadcom ( AVGO ).\nThe cuts this year are not as bad as was seen last year , for example:\nWhile we do expect the recent forecast reductions to be a headwind for semiconductor suppliers with iPhone exposure in the March quarter, these cuts are not of the same magnitude of reductions for the iPhone 6s when cuts began in December 2015 and continued with additional reductions in January and April 2016. Figure 2 below highlights the iPhone build forecast history, based on Bluefin estimates. The highlighted figures in yellow represent the original build forecast for the initial ramp quarter and outlying 4 quarters for 2015 and 2016 respectively, while the data in green indicates the forecasts after the cuts. Note that the sequential drop in total Q1:16 iPhone builds was 44% compared to a 34% reduction forecasted in Q1:17. Additionally, Q1:17 builds presently are still 20% higher than Q1:16 levels. Last year the supply chain inventory glut drove Q1:16 builds 7M below shipments; at this point we don’t see that happening in Q1:17 unless further cuts are forthcoming. In fact, with CQ4 builds still strong, we wouldn’t expect the recent cuts to have much of an impact on Broadcom’s (AVGO) outlook for the January quarter when they announce their results tomorrow.\nFor those of you wishing for a scorecard, Peterson offers up the following table of his firm’s history of making predictions about Apple’s quarterly builds. You’ll notice that the current outlook for this quarter’s production (the calendar Q4) is down from 83 million units in October but still above the 78 million seen in September (click on the image to see it larger):\nPeterson says broadly of the semi market that “business is pretty good,” and so asks “What could go wrong?” besides the iPhone. He suggests China’s fiscal policy is one risk, though it’s too soon to sound an alarm:\nIn our October 10th Semiconductors Update, we acknowledged the market strength in China while noting that the government’s monetary and fiscal policy was propping up demand […] With respect to double ordering, we have uncovered incidents of buffer ordering in the China smartphone supply chain. However, our research suggests that the practice is not widespread presently and is isolated to a few key components, including DRAM, NAND, and SoCs.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray\nKicking off a day of testimony by AT&T ( T ) and Time Warner ( TWX ) regarding their proposed combination, Mark Cuban , who once sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo! ( YHOO ) for a lot of money, told Congress why the deal should be allowed.\nCuban, reading from prepared remarks, painted for the Congress a picture of a media landscape dominated by a handful of big companies who control content today, chief among them Facebook ( FB ), but also Apple ( AAPL ) and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google , because they dominate the apps that people use to “avoid boredom.”\nCuban said that TV was always the dominant medium because it allowed people to avoid boredom “while pretending we were doing something.”\n“The idea TV is the dominant content delivery medium no longer is valid,” said Cuban.\nFacebook, and smartphone apps, and virtual reality platforms such as Facebook’s Oculus Rift headset, now offer consumers “any kind of content, in any manner the consumer would like to receive it,” better than television can do.\n“Facebook is in a dominant position, if not the dominant position, for delivery of content.”\nCuban told congressmen to imagine what would have happened had Facebook not bought WhatsApp, Oculus, and Instagram. “The market would be far more competitive,” he concluded.\nIn addition, said Cuban, “ Snapchat is taking over millennials as the best alternative to boredom.”\nAmidst all this, “TV is losing viewers to other dominant content players,” he said, citing Apple, and Google’s YouTube . He made a point of noting that YouTube, for instance, was an “acquired property.” He also referred to Google’s search business as the “ultimate programming guide.”\nCuban said it was serious that there are “Two companies, Google and Apple, that are the sole gatekeepers to content.”\nHe then went on to say that “Neither AT&T nor Time Warner are “in any sort of dominant position,” and that “alone they will have a very difficult time controlling their destinies.”\n“We need more companies to compete with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon ( AMZN ) and Facebook,” continued Cuban. “They have all established dominant positions, and that’s why this is an important, strategic content acquisition.”\n“Together, they will have a chance to battle the dominant players,” he concluded of AT&T and Time Warner.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Another day, another Apple ( AAPL ) iPhone warning.\nRosenblatt Securities ’s Jun Zhang today reiterates a Neutral rating, and a $102 price target, warning that sales of the iPhone in China , he estimates, are “still weaker than retail channels” as discounting of the phone has popped up across the country.\niPhone sales, presumably in dollars, he doesn’t specify — fell by 6% in November, and are probably down “slightly” from November this month, as discounting takes hold outside of tight supplies at Apple’s online store:\nOverall iPhone sales in China were down 6% in November and slightly down MoM in November due to some pushes in “single day” sales. In our view, iPh- one 7 sales will continue trending down and many retailers in China have al- ready started discounting ($50) the iPhone 7 in November. iPhone 7 Plus sup- ply is catching up in November, and sales have grown MoM in November. iPh- one 6/6S sales continue to be weak. The 7 Plus model currently accounts for 60% of iPhone 7 sales in China. We started seeing some retailers discounting this model in November. In our view, there is a waitlist if ordered from Apple’s online store, but consumers can easily buy them from local stores and third party retail stores. Since the jet black mod- el has high return rate, Apple might try to control capacity. Overall, we believe iPhone sales in China are still weaker than retail channels expected.\nZhang also cautions investors not to be mislead if they hear of component orders rising come the March quarter. In his view, “Some noise of Apple increasing orders might come from the iPad instead of the iPhone,” given he sees Apple refreshing the various iPad models in March.",

      "title": "Beats Powerbeats 3 Review: The ultimate in-ear headphones for fitness or fashion",
      "text": "Hey, did you hear the news, Apple owns Beats now. OK, so it's not exactly new news, it happened years ago, but it's still a pretty big deal, and important for what we're going to say next. The first wave of post-Apple takeover headphones have dropped, finally, with the Beats Powerbeats 3 acting as the sports-friendly, wireless in-ear siblings to the Beats Solo 3 Wireless cans we loved so much. They might look similar to their predecessors and sound near enough the same, but thanks to Apple there's some impressive new tech inside that put these streets ahead of their predecessors, the much-loved PowerBeats 2s. Is this enough to make these £169.95 headphone a must-own though? We put them to the test to find out. The Good: Comfortable, cool, secure design Impressive Bluetooth connection Brilliant battery life The Bad: No noise cancelling Let in a bit of wind noise Not the deepest sound Beats Powerbeats 3 design: Familiar but fantastic Related: Best wireless headphones Apple might be the king of design, but they haven't sprinkled much of their magic dust over these Beats audio enablers. Compared to past Powerbeats, the new headphones barely look any different. That's not a bad thing though. As well as being an easy on the eye fashion statement, these are some of the most comfortable in-ear headphones we've used. Whether you're strolling down the street, sat at a desk or running through a forest, the flexible ear hooks - which aren't troubled by glasses arms - and soft silicone tips combine to offer a fit that's near enough faultless. When running, the ear pods are snug, comfortable and don't bounce around. As the driver housings are about the size of a small USB drive attached to each ear, just a damn sight better looking, you forget they're there, which is ideal for a long distance training session. The neck cord can bounce around and be a bit annoying, but find the right tightness for you and you'll never notice it again. Just because they look familiar doesn't mean they're completely lacking design updates, either. The body is actually marginally bigger than past models, although you'll struggle to notice the added millimetres. What you will notice, however, is the lack of a fiddly rubber charging port cover. Cleaning up the look while also removing irritations, it's trip to the chopping block is a welcome one. What's more, whether you want to be bold or behind the scenes, there's a colour scheme to suit your style. There are currently five hues to choose from with white, black and blue options joining a red pair. It's the yellow set, which pair a sleek matt black body with bright yellow accents, that's our favourite though. They just look and feel sporty. The standard black models will go with more, but the yellow units will get you noticed. Finishing off the finish, the Powerbeats 3 play host to an in-line mic and volume controls, these give you command over your music while keeping your phone in your pocket. As is now the norm, volume up/down toggles sit either side of a play/pause button that, if given a quick double tap, can also be used to skip tracks. Beats Powerbeats 3 sound quality: Solid but not spectacular Related: Best running headphones Sound quality hasn't always been Beats' strong suit. Things have improved since the early days though. The on-ear Solo 3s now offer impressively accomplished sound, and the Powerbeats 3 are following hot on their heels. Are they perfectly balanced? No, but that doesn't mean they don't still sound great. It all depends on the music you're in to. As has always been the case with Beats, bass is boss. This creates a rich sound that although occasionally compromises on the vocals and high-end, really accentuates the beats of pop, R&amp;B and hiphop tracks. It's almost become the new accepted sound and, yeah, it sounds good if not traditionally on-point. If you want to mix up your listening with a bit of classical music, these probably aren't going to be for you. If you're addicted to Apple Music's weekly discover playlists though, then the heavy sound of the Powerbeats will play to your tastes. What really impresses with these headphones, is that you can properly crank up the volume without any distortion creeping in. They are capable of seriously loud listening. And we mean properly loud. If you want big, punchy sounds, these will leave you with a big ol' smile plastered across your face. There are shortcomings though, Unlike some high-end in-ear headphones, such as the brilliant Bose QC30, there's no noise cancelling. Sat on a train or a plane this can mean the outside creeps in, and escaping people's inane chatter means pushing the volume to painful levels. A largely snug, secure fit can put you in a decent bubble of isolation, but when running, a bit of wind noise can creep in to compromise sound. Beats Powerbeats 3 wireless connectivity and battery life: Serious staying power Related: Beats EP review Apple might not have revolutionised the Beats look or sound. What the iPhone giant has done though, is potentially more impressive. Having squeezed in its new W1 chip, Apple has massively extended both the Bluetooth range and battery life of these wireless headphones. OK, so it might not sound like the most glamorous addition, but it's one that makes an impressive difference. Not only is the Bluetooth range now excessive - you can leave your phone on your desk while nipping to the loo or even on charge indoors while chilling in the garden, without having to pass up on continuous tunes - but the battery life is without rival on a pair of headphones with such a small form factor. Seriously, we can't overstate this enough. Compared with past Powerbeats, the PowerBeats 3 battery life has doubled. Capable of going 12 hours between charges, these headphones are battery sipping wizards. Sure, this pales with the 40 hour staying power of the on-ear Beats Solo 3 Wireless, but for their size, it's witchcraft. That's not where the benefits end, either. When you do need to recharge, just 5-minutes connected to the mains will give you an hour of go. This is perfect when you realise they've died and your gym session just won't wait. Verdict: A coming of age for Beats headphones After a pair of run-friendly headphones that look and sound good enough to become your daily audio enablers? Stop looking, you've found them. The Beats Powerbeats 3 might not change the world when it comes to sound quality, but as an overall package, they're a damn fine offering. Yes, they're built for fitness, but they're so much more than a pair of running headphones. They are a comfortable fashion statement. One that will offer solid sound for the masses and is untouched on battery life. Yes, £169.95 is expensive, but don't see these as just another pair of headphones. See them as the only pair of headphones you need. Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

      "text": "Apple pushes for iTunes rentals of movies still on big screen By Wednesday, December 07, 2016, 12:35 pm PT (03:35 pm ET) Apple could potentially offer iTunes rentals for movies that are still in theatres, a report said on Wednesday, which would give it a rare advantage over other rental platforms. Apple is currently pressing studios for earlier access , according to Bloomberg sources. This coincides with 21st Century Fox, Warner Bros., and Universal confirming that they'd like to offer rentals shortly a movie premieres —the Bloomberg sources indicated that some executives are aiming for a gap as little as two weeks, and considering a deal with Apple as an option. Regardless, Apple has been pursuing shorter windows for a while, the sources commented. One concern studio executives are believed to have is piracy —while Apple uses DRM to prevent easy copying, a person could simply record their TV or monitor and share the video online. While this in itself is nothing new, here it would cut into ticket sales and not just the usual Blu-ray, DVD, and/or online numbers. Early-access rentals would likely come at a high cost. With or without Apple, studios are allegedly considering prices between $25 and $50 —as much or more than a pair of theater tickets, and far more than it costs to buy many older movies outright. Under common agreements, theaters typically have the exclusive rights to a movie for 90 days before rental and purchase windows open. Apple hasn't done much to stand out in the online video market, in spite of iTunes being baked into multiple platforms including iOS devices and the Apple TV. If it became one of the only ways to watch movies in theaters, though, it could gain the loyalty of more customers. Topics: ",

      "text": "Apple in talks to bring new movies to hit iTunes while they’re still in theaters Yoni Heisler Pin it Share As Apple seeks to navigate a rapidly shifting media landscape where original programming is becoming more and more important, the Cupertino-based company is reportedly hoping to lure users back over to the lovely confines of iTunes by focusing on movies. DON’T MISS: 10 great iOS 10 widgets that should be on every iPhone According to a new report from Bloomberg , Apple is extremely interested in inking deals with Hollywood studios that would allow the company to release new movies on iTunes much earlier than normal. As it stands today, new releases don’t make their way to iTunes until about 3 months after their initial theatrical release. Looking to turn that dynamic on its head, movie studios and Apple are reportedly entertaining the idea of narrowing that gap down to two weeks. \nThe most recent talks are part of longer-running efforts by Cupertino, California-based Apple to get new movies sooner, two of the people said. Such an arrangement could help iTunes stand out in a crowded online market for movies, TV shows and music. While the iTunes store helped Apple build a dominant role in music retailing, the company hasn’t carved out a similar role in music and video streaming. Of particular interest here is that such a deal would be mutually beneficial for all parties involved. In addition to making iTunes a more appealing destination for media consumption, it would also provide Hollywood studios with another revenue stream. Of course, the ability to rent a movie so shortly after its theatrical release would come with a hefty price, with some movie studios reportedly toying with the idea of charging consumers anywhere from $25 to $50 for a single rental.

      "title": "Apple is the \"big test case\" for Trump offshoring policy",
      "text": "show chapters Calacanis: Tim Cook not likely to make Trump Tower pilgrimage      4 Hours Ago | 02:09 Inside.com CEO Jason Calacanis told CNBC on Wednesday that Donald Trump's negotiations with Apple will prove whether the president-elect can actually return offshored jobs back to the United States. \nBeyond tweets and public appearances, the real estate mogul is yet to establish a clear, consistent strategy addressing U.S. companies that hire abroad. \"Trump obviously likes to negotiate,\" Calacanis said referring to the recent Carrier deal. \"He likes to bully you, then brings you to the lobby, take a selfie and then have some victory laps with you.\"\nHowever, Calacanis contends that if the president-elect wants to lure wealthier companies like Apple, he will need to use more creative financial incentives. Calacanis said that Trump could offer tax amnesty to a firm like Apple to spur domestic hiring and wage increases.\n\"Trump wants to be a hero to the people, and he's got a little bit of negotiating room with the repatriation of taxes,\" Calacanis said. \"I can see him using it as a real big carrot and stick to companies.\" \nYet, it remains to be seen if these tactics could work. \"Apple is going to be the big test case,\" Calacanis continued. \"Apple under Steve Jobs said, 'Listen: These jobs are never coming back.' Can these jobs come back?\" Calacanis asked. \"It's a big question.\"\nCurrently, Calacanis believes that Apple would not move back to the United States to avoid the high production costs. However, Calacanis said that if Trump combined tariffs on Apple products made in China with tax breaks for Apple products made in the U.S., it might improve the U.S. employment situation. Calacanis also thought that such heavy interference with Apple's operations \"could be a disaster.\"\n\"That's I think the danger of Trump. It's all fun right now to have everybody going to Trump Tower. It's great theater,\" Calacanis said. \"What if Trump, who is answerable to no one, puts a $50 tariff on iPhones coming from China?\"\n\"The guy is complete loose cannon,\" Calacanis said. \"I think this is what the American people wanted. They wanted to clean house. And you know what, it's going to be an interesting experiment.\"",

      "text": "Gabrielle Lurie | AFP | Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook delivers the keynote address at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California, onJune 13, 2016. Apple 's emphasis on software and services seems to be paying off. \nThe company had its highest monthly sales ever in the App Store in November, tweeted Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing. \nTweet: November 2016 was a record breaker for the #AppStore - the highest monthly sales ever in App Store history! \nThe App Store's new milestone comes after two record-setting quarters for Apple's services division, as the company has tried to lure more developers to its platform. It has released a a new, easier-to-learn language, Swift, and coding environment, Swift Playgrounds, a faster app review process and a new revenue-sharing model for subscription apps. \nWhile the iPhone is still the biggest money maker for Apple, its software and services is now the fastest-growing source of revenue, according to the company's latest earnings report. \nCEO Tim Cook has attributed much of Apple's research and development spending in 2016 to services. And Apple has big ambitions for services like Apple Pay, the App Store and Apple Music, which it expects to reach the size of a Fortune 100 company by 2017. \n\nTo be sure, Apple's rapid software expansion has not been without challenges. Developers have told CNBC that while Apple's new features have unprecedented potential, the execution is often buggy and unpredictable . For instance, counterfeit retail apps have slipped through Apple's new fast approval process.\nStill, in addition to a new App Store record, Apple's other services have hit new highs. Apple Pay saw more transactions in the month of September than across all of fiscal 2015, Apple said in its latest earnings. And Apple Music hit 20 million subscribers, Apple's internet software and services senior vice president Eddy Cue told Billboard. \nApple may even be pushing deeper into the movie rental business to bolster iTunes, according to a Wednesday Bloomberg report . Apple is pressing Hollywood studios to get higher priced, early availability of movies just released in theaters,according to Bloomberg.",

      "text": "Shares of Square Inc. climbed more than 5% Wednesday after the company announced a payments partnership with tech giant Apple Inc.\nSquare SQ, +5.46% Chief Executive Jack Dorsey announced Tuesday evening that the Square Cash app will pair with Apple Pay to allow users to pay at stores using the balance in their Square Cash account. Square Cash is a payments app similar to PayPal Holdings Inc.’s PYPL, +1.00% Venmo.\nDespite the pairing with Apple AAPL, +0.96% , CFRA Research analyst Scott Kessler said he does not believe Square Cash will drive growth for Square. Kessler said he and other analysts question Square’s motivation because he does not see the business being material to Square’s earnings.\n“I think Square is doing far more interesting things as it pertains to moving up to larger vendors and expanding outside the U.S. rather than looking to better position Square Cash,” Kessler said.\nThat said, in partnering with Apple, Kessler said Square could be attempting to diversify its customer base.\nSee also: Square shares rise after upgrade to outperform at Credit Suisse\nShares of Square have gained 12% in the past month, compared with the S&P 500’s SPX, +1.14% gain of 4%. The company—founded and run by Dorsey, who is also CEO of Twitter Inc. TWTR, +6.64% — went public in November of 2015 for $9 a share , and was trading for more than $14 Wednesday afternoon.\nSquare Cash’s most direct competitor is Venmo, the peer-to-peer payments app owned by PayPal. But Venmo targets consumers, while Square Cash customers are likely small-business owners who already use the company’s point-of-sale system, Kessler said.\nSquare’s payment system also supports paying with Apple Pay.\nMore from MarketWatch The ‘hidden’ credit card perk that could earn you up to $2,500 Gross warns investors of the ‘negatives’ of Trump policies Can Trump Deal to Save 1,000 Indiana Jobs Be Replicated?",

Apple Pay saw more transactions in the month of September than across all of fiscal 2015, Apple said in its latest earnings.

      "text": "WASHINGTON • The United States Supreme Court overturned a US$399 million (S$566 million) patent infringement penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple's iPhone design, in a case watched for its implications for technology innovation.\nThe justices, in a 8-0 ruling on Tuesday, found that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profit from its smartphones for infringement on design components. The case now goes back to a lower court.\nThe ruling could curb litigation from patent holders seeking to reap big profits from infringements on parts, analysts said.\nA jubilant Samsung hailed the \"victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace\". \nThe 11-page ruling found that the US$399 million penalty - one element of a major patent infringement case - was inappropriate because it represented \"Samsung's entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones\" for copying the iPhone's \"rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colourful icons on a black screen\". \nThis case is one element of the US$548 million penalty - knocked down from an original US$1 billion jury award - Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents.\nThere has been keen interest in the case, to see how the court would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. \nMr Dennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Centre for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed. \n\"Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,\" he said in a blog .\nSamsung won the backing of Silicon Valley and other IT giants, including Google and Facebook. Apple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing.\nOn the verdict, an Apple spokesman, in an e-mail, said: \"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute... We remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\" AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on December 08, 2016, with the headline 'Samsung wins US court fight with Apple'.

      "text": "Supreme Court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple Tuesday Dec 6, 2016 at 11:46 AM Dec 6, 2016 at 12:06 PM \nThe Associated Press \nWASHINGTON  — A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look.",

      "text": "Report: Apple pursuing studio agreements for early movie rentals By Jesse Hollington @jhollington ● 56 minutes ago \nApple is attempting to negotiate with Hollywood studios to offer access to movie rentals — possibly as early as two weeks after they open in theaters — according to a new report by Bloomberg . The move appears to have been initiated by several of the big studios, including 21st Century Fox, Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures, which have confirmed that they are looking for ways to offer “high-priced” video rentals of new movies shortly after they open in theaters. People familiar with the matter have said that the studios are considering a deal with iTunes as a possible option, although Apple is not necessarily the only company that the studios have been in talks with. Sources have suggested that one of the main concerns regarding whether iTunes will be a suitable choice centers on the security of the platform to avoid jeopardizing box office sales from pictures that are still in theaters. Despite Apple’s tight FairPlay DRM security on existing iTunes rentals, studio executives are concerned that users could still use a camera to record a movie playing on a TV screen; by comparison at least one competing startup named in the report has implemented watermarking technology that would in theory allow the source of a leak to be tracked to a specific end user, thereby discouraging piracy. \nStudios hope that an early home rental option, albeit it at a premium price — ranges of $25 - $50 are being considered for such online rentals — would help to bolster flagging home video revenue and build new areas of growth, in addition to deterring online piracy of new releases. On the other hand, the studios face a battle with theater chains that, of course, would prefer to retain exclusivity on new releases. Both theater chains and studios are in talks to find solutions that could benefit both sides, with at least one source saying that such a service is likely to come to fruition within the next 18 months, regardless of the technology platform that is ultimately chosen for it.",

      "title": "Apple (AAPL) iPhone Batteries Reportedly Explode in China",
      "text": "Trades from $ 3 It seems that Apple Inc. ( AAPL - Free Report ) is facing the same safety issues as its rival Samsung, as eight iPhone 6 handsets have reportedly exploded in China. As per a report released by the Shanghai Consumer Council, the handsets’ batteries powered down emitting smoke and eventually exploded. The Council has called upon Apple to look into the matter. The Council report also added that the company had, earlier in the year, replaced a woman’s iPhone that exploded with a new one without “addressing the cause” of the explosion. \nAPPLE INC Price \nAPPLE INC Price | APPLE INC Quote \nIn its response to a Reuters mail, Apple claimed that the incidents occurred due to the overheating of the lithium ion batteries caused by “external physical damages”. Apparently, investigations are on for the overheating and battery explosion problems of iPhone as the company is facing a number of complaints. Per a Reuters report, analysts are of the opinion that Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 fiasco, which resulted in recall of some 2.5 million units, caused a sense of “distrust” among Chinese consumers towards international (as well as expensive) smartphone brands. Plus, increasing competition from home grown cheaper smartphones, has highly affected the sale of iPhones in the country. Though Apple is pinning its hopes on iPhone 7 to help it regain lost ground in China, the increasing safety issues regarding the product are a big concern. At present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Year to date, Apple shares have generated a return of 4.46% compared with the Zacks Computer Mini Industry’s gain of 5.13%. Better-ranked stocks in the wider technology space include TiVo Corporation ( TIVO - Free Report ) , Facebook Inc. ( FB - Free Report ) and Akamai Technologies, Inc. ( AKAM - Free Report ) . While TiVo sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Facebook and Akamai are Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .

      "text": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) benefited hugely in the three months ending in October, according to quarterly smartphone market share data released by Kantar Worldpanel on Wednesday. During the period, iPhone sales accounted for an impressive 4 of every 10 smartphone sales in the U.S. Apple's sharp rise in smartphone market share during the period bodes well for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus prospects.\niPhone 7. Image source: Apple.\nBig U.S. market share for iPhone With Apple beginning deliveries of its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in September and Kantar's quarterly data ending in October, Kantar's quarterly data includes about a month and a half of important sales of the new devices. That being the case, the data provides some insights into how the new phones are faring.\nBased on Kantar's data, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus seem to have hit the ground running. iPhone sales represented 40.5% of smartphone sales in the three months ending October -- up a notable seven percentage points year over year, from 33.5%.\nGoing further, Kantar provided some specific, bullish data on the new iPhone versions during the period, saying the iPhone 7 the top-selling device during the period, accounting for 10.6% of smartphone sales, and the iPhone 7 Plus was the fourth best-selling smartphone with a 5.3% share of smartphone sales. This is particularly notable considering these phones were available for only half of this period -- and their availability was supply constrained .\nApple almost certainly benefited significantly from Samsung's recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphones during this period. The device was recalled a few weeks after its launch, and a few weeks before Apple started shipping its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices. Samsung eventually took its recall even further, opting to end production of the Note 7 altogether after replacement batteries failed to deter spontaneous battery overheating that would lead to the Note 7 catching fire.\nApple vs. Alphabet In addition to highlighting a strong period for iPhone sales in the U.S., Kantar's just-released data highlighted two other important takeaways for Apple investors.\n1. Apple's iOS is gaining on Alphabet 's(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Android: The quarterly data marked a fifth quarter in a row of year-over-year declines for Android market share, Kantar noted. But the Android operating system's share of smartphone shipments -- at 57.9% --- is still meaningfully higher than Apple's 40.5% iOS' share. Apple's share, of course, is particularly notable since the company's operating system is only included on its own phones, while the Android OS is available on many different smartphone manufacturers' devices.\nGoogle Pixel. Image source: Google\n2. Google Pixel sales were solid: Despite only being widely available for sale for about 11 days of Kantar's measured period, Alphabet's brand new Pixel phone grabbed 0.5% of all smartphone sales in the U.S., matching market share from Huawei and Microsoft .\nOverall, it's good to see the iPhone continuing to resonate with customers in Apple's home market. With the iPhone representing about 60% of Apple's total revenue, the device remains critical to the company's business results. But investors may want to keep an eye on Alphabet's early success with its new Pixel phone. If Alphabet can keep this up, the new premium phone could evolve into a threat to the iPhone.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.*\nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Apple wasn't one of them!

      "text": "iPhone 7 being machined. Image source: Apple.\nLast month, reports surfaced that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) had asked two of its primary contract manufacturers , Foxconn and Pegatron, to evaluate the possibility of manufacturing iPhones in the U.S. Evidently, Pegatron opted not to research the possibility, believing it would be too costly, but Foxconn complied and gave the idea some serious thought. After all, Apple is its largest customer, so it didn't have much choice but to entertain the idea.\nWhile I was (and still am) skeptical about Apple being able to bring back any meaningful number of jobs (i.e., beyond a token number of jobs that might primarily serve political purposes) based on a wide range of factors like supply chain logistics, it turns out that Foxconn is seriously exploring the notion of expanding its U.S. operations. Foxconn has announced that it is in discussions with the U.S. to potentially invest in expansion. In a statement released earlier today, Foxconn said, \"While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant U.S. officials.\"\nFoxconn didn't elaborate on which executives were conducting negotiations, or if any of Foxconn's customers had any input, but you can absolutely bet that Apple has some strong opinions on the matter behind closed doors. The news comes just a day after Japan's Softbank said it would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 new jobs.\nStop me if you've heard this one before While Foxconn mulls the idea, keep in mind that this isn't the first time that Foxconn has considered expanding manufacturing in the U.S. The contract manufacturer said in 2013 that it wanted to assemble smartphones and tablets stateside, and again in 2014. Labor costs have been on the rise in the Middle Kingdom, pinching Foxconn's margins in the process.\nFoxconn does already have a presence in the U.S., in part to provide timely support to U.S.-based customers as well as to facilitate collaboration on product development, since manufacturability is critical to scaling. The company has manufacturing and logistics services facilities in a handful of states.\nFoxconn global facilities. Image source: Foxconn.\nIt's probably smart for Foxconn to remain vague at this point, declining to elaborate on any potential expansion in concrete terms. It can score political points by expanding, but theoretically keeping any expansion modest would put a lid on costs as labor costs in the U.S. are still meaningfully higher than in China.\nStill a skeptic It's also a distinct possibility that a Foxconn expansion in the U.S. would focus on areas outside of consumer electronics, but it's unclear exactly what Foxconn has on its mind. But it's hard to imagine Apple sitting out of these discussions altogether, since it has already expressed interest in at least evaluating the possibility. Plus, any cost increases borne by Foxconn would naturally be passed along at least in part to the iPhone maker, and then subsequently to consumers, if Foxconn wants to expand smartphone and tablet assembly.\nDespite this new report, I'm still skeptical about Apple's ability to move any non-trivial number of jobs back to the U.S., particularly around the iPhone. The supply chain is simply far too embedded in Asia to produce the device anywhere else in the volumes that Apple needs.\n10 stocks we like better than Apple\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "print Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos David Ryder/Getty Images \nAmazon Payments, the e-commerce company's payments service that competes with PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Wallet, already owns a sizeable market share and may be its most \"underappreciated\" business, according to RBC Capital's managing director Mark Mahaney. \nSpeaking at Business Insider's Ignition conference on Wednesday, Mahaney said Amazon Payments is showing a lot of potential to \"disrupt\" the payments space, and perhaps, could become the next big revenue driver for the company. \n\"I think Amazon’s ability to disrupt payments is vastly underappreciated,\" Mahaney said. \nMahaney's thinking is based on data from ChannelAdvisor, a leading e-commerce software maker that publishes quarterly data on the general market. As seen in the chart below, 15% of the market cited Amazon Payments as the most preferred payments method after credit card, only trailing PayPal, and coming in way ahead of Apple and Google's competing products. \nRBC Capital \nAmazon Payments enables customers to pay through their Amazon accounts while shopping on other e-commerce sites, saving them the hassle of entering their credit card and shipping info again. Since its launch, the product has gotten thousands of sites on board, but with only a few big names — like the inflight Internet service Gogo — making the list. \nIn April, Amazon Payments launched a new Global Partner Program which allows e-commerce platform providers to easily integrate its service. TechCrunch reported at the time that Amazon has 285 million account holders, with over 23 million of them having paid through their accounts on other sites. \nStill, Mahaney said it's unclear if Amazon Payments will be able to catch up to PayPal and become the de facto paying platform. Payments in general is not a completely underserved market, and Amazon may decide to invest more on growing other initiatives, like its grocery delivery or shipping logistics businesses. \n\"The one challenge here to whether this really becomes the fourth pillar for Amazon is that it’s already a reasonably efficiently served market,\" Mahaney said.",

      "title": "Beats Powerbeats3 In-Ear Headphones Review",
      "text": "Beats Powerbeats3 In-Ear Headphones Review By Chance Kinney · On December 7, 2016 \nWhen Apple made their big iPhone 7 announcement in September, they managed to carve out the smallest sliver of time to introduce three new Beats products — the first set to directly benefit from the Apple’s acquisition of Beats. The Solo3 Wireless on-ears, Powerbeats3 in-ears, and the lighter BeatsX in-ears all have Apple’s new W1 chip, which enables them to connect to all of a user’s Apple devices seamlessly, intelligently switching between input sources as necessary. While Apple had other reasons to buy Beats, their headphones are still no joke — Beats remains a top selling audio brand. We reviewed the Solo3 headphones and found them to be a strong choice thanks to stellar battery life, and now we’ve had a chance to try out the latest version of Beats’ very popular exercise in-ears. The Powerbeats3, as it turns out, are more of the same — terrific battery life paired with better than average audio. Performance \nThere’s not too much to report here if you’re familiar with the Powerbeats2 — the Powerbeats3 are differentiated by battery life, quick charging, and the W1 chip, not audio quality. They sound the same as the Powerbeats2, which isn’t a bad thing — despite their reputation (and name), Beats products have gotten a lot less bass-heavy over the years. That’s not to say the bass lacks punch — the Powerbeats3 have the tightest and most powerful bass performance of any wireless in-ear headphones I’ve tried, and if you want good sub-bass response in a pair of wireless in-ears, the Powerbeats3 are almost certainly your best option. But, Beats has done a better job lately of tuning for balance. The highs sound clear (the mids less so, but nothing too bad), and aren’t drowned out by the bass like they were with early Beats products. The only downside is that there isn’t much warmth to the sound. Like always with Beats, there is no concern about max volume not being loud enough. \nWhere the Powerbeats3 fall behind a bit is in Bluetooth connectivity, although this won’t necessarily be a problem for everyone. They’re made to be exercise headphones, and if you’ve got your phone in your pocket or an armband while working out, the Powerbeats3 won’t have any problems with skipping or dropped connections. That’s not surprising — they have a Class 1 Bluetooth connection, which means range should be anywhere between 66 and 100 feet. What was surprising is that I had a lot of connectivity problems when there was a wall separating me and my phone (leaving my phone in my room and going to the kitchen, for example). I’ve generally not had this problem with other Bluetooth in-ear headphones I’ve tested, so it’s something worth considering if you’d like to use your in-ears around the home, too. \nEither way, pairing is simple. Apple users need only turn the Powerbeats3 on — thanks to the W1 chip, Apple products will auto-detect the headphones and prompt you to pair. It’s a seamless experience for iPhone 7 users that can’t be beat. Android users will need to pair them through their Bluetooth settings as usual, which was no problem. However, they wouldn’t always reconnect automatically with my Android phone when turned on. \nThe Powerbeats3 are stellar when it comes to battery life and charging. During my test (a mix of max volume and half volume playback), I got just shy of 12 hours, which is terrific for a pair of wireless in-ears. Usually we see between six and nine hours on competing products — when audio quality is taken into account (it takes power to get that level of bass), this leaves Beats in a class of their own in wireless in-ears. The battery life is backed up by the Powerbeats3’s new Fast Fuel charging, which provides an hour of playback with five minutes of charging (works as advertised) using the included Micro USB cable. \nThe Powerbeats3 have an in-line remote on the right side of the cable, which has play/pause and volume controls. It ends up resting pretty far down the neck — it’s not perfect for taking and making calls, although I thought it was good enough to meet expectations for a pair of wireless in-ear headphones. Build \nWith the large earhooks and the rectangular housings bearing the trademark b logo, Beats has done a great job of making the Powerbeats look distinctive when compared to similar products, which should remain a large part of their appeal (the large housings are functional, too, as they allow for more battery space). But, they’re not the most comfortable, nor are they the best-designed. The earhooks are rigid, and a lot of other headphone makers have been playing around with soft, flexible inner hooks that provide stability and far more comfort. The bigger problem is that the Powerbeats3 drivers don’t extend far enough out — it feels like they’re always hovering over your ears instead of securely in them. I couldn’t get a firm seal with any of the four sizes of silicone eartips, which detracted a bit from the audio quality. Fortunately, the Powerbeats3 can get loud enough to counter the background noise that leaks in. \nFor those who like a more premium build, you won’t find that here. Other in-ears like the Optoma NuForce BE Sport3 and the Jaybird X2 are also plastic, but feel a bit more hardy while staying lightweight. Powerbeats are heavier, but have always felt cheaper — that’s still true here. Apple says the Powerbeats3 are sweat- and water-resistant, and we can say we never experienced any connectivity problems during exercise. We can’t speak to durability, but as mentioned before, the Powerbeats3 don’t feel quite as sturdy as many other competing products. I also don’t like that the Micro USB charging port is exposed, instead of being covered with a silicone tab like with most other wireless in-ears. Read on for the verdict…",

      "title": "iOS 10.2 Beta 6: Changes And New Features",
      "text": "Earlier this week Apple started to roll out the latest iOS 10.2 beta 6 update to developers and beta testers. It came just three days after the fifth beta and less than a week after the fourth, meaning that Apple is now working much faster than we’ve known it to in the past. So what does this latest beta offer in the way of changes and new features? Let’s take a look…\n\nWhat’s new with iOS 10.2 Beta 6? iOS 10.2 Beta 6 is available to download right now from the developer portal and via an over-the-air update. Developers and beta testers can now use the tweaks which have been included in iOS 10.2 during the previous 5 betas. On initial inspection of Beta 6, nothing seems to have changed since Beta 5. However, it’s more likely that there are differences; they’re just not perceivable by users.\nAccording to MacRumors, emojis such as an avocado, a croissant and a facepalm are now available. However, they were made available with Beta 5, so there’s nothing new about them.\nWe think iOS 10.2 Beta 6 is purely a security fix update, which would account for the super fast turnaround. As for why and what the fixes are, Apple has chosen not to divulge the information. So we could now be in the final stages of beta testing before Apple launches 10.2 to the general populous. But because Apple does not reveal or outline its publishing schedules, we are left guessing as to the date of a possible release.\nWhat we do know about iOS 10.2 While this latest beta may be a bit of an enigma, we already know an awful lot about 10.2 and what it offers above and beyond 10.1, so if you’ve missed our previous updates, here’s what’s coming.\nImage Source: Apple.com New emoji When released to the general public, iOS 10.2 will bring with it more than 100 new emoji. Some of the most highly anticipated emoji are clown face, drooling face, selfie, facepalm, shark, butterfly, croissant and fox face. Additionally, Apple has now thought of professionals and is including specialist emoji in both male and female. These professional emoji are mechanic, scientist, firefighter, doctor, lawyer and more.\nPreserve settings If you dislike always having to reset your iPhone ‘s camera settings each time you use it, the new Preserve setting will allow you to lock your camera into a mode which fits you best. It doesn’t matter which setting, whether video, square, or portrait, they’re all available, as are the photo filter and even live photo.\nTV app With iOS 10.2, Apple has revealed its all-new TV app, which was developed to replace the old Video app. It’s the next generation in iOS 10 video software for the iPhone and iPad. The app will make recommendations based on your past viewing and popularity.\n\nNew wallpapers If you like a variety of wallpapers, there are three new ones within iOS 10.2 for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. They have black backgrounds, and each one has either a yellow, blue, or pink drop of liquid at its center. They are quite stunning to view, but don’t be concerned if you don’t have an iPhone 7. These wallpapers are available for you too; see here .\nFinal thoughts Will Beta 6 be the final update before Apple releases 10.2? Who knows? However, what we do know is that this next incarnation of Apple’s firmware is a continuation of its growth. As it grows, we’re going to see new features that will ultimately transform what iOS is, meaning that by the time iOS 11 is here, Apple’s mobile OS will be hardly recognizable.\nIf you want to find out how iOS 10.2 compares to iOS 10.1, take a look here .\nThe post iOS 10.2 Beta 6: Changes And New Features appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple has now introduced a manner in which customers seeking support can book repair appointments with not only the well known Genius Bar, but also Apple Authorized Service Providers. Previously customers only had the option to book online reservations with the Genius Bar, but the move to add third-party bookings is a new one. Customers should now have a better experience in finding a location to solve their issues. \nThird-party authorized service providers aren’t new within Apple’s support ecosystem, but having the ability to book appointments with them is. Apple’s support pages originally helped customers find authorized providers, but the customer would then have to call and discover time slot availability on their own. Making it easier for customers to get the support they need should help the appease frustrated Apple customers. Third-party booking is now available alongside talking to Apple Support over the phone, chatting online, or visiting the Genius Bar in store. Apple Support page options Apple Authorized Service Providers along with official Apple Store locations \nThe decision to include Authorized Service Providers in online bookings may have come as a result of one of the changes that were introduced earlier this year . As Apple worked to improve Genius Bar support experiences, offloading the work to authorized third-parties could significantly help as well. Customers that live too far away from an official Apple Store now have the peace of mind in finding a more local repair option. Now, when looking to bring in a device for repair, the Apple support page brings up authorized service providers mixed in with Apple Store results. This allows those in need of help to find stores that are closer to them, and show availability for appointments.",

      "text": "Apple in Talks to Offer Rentals of Movies Shortly After They Open in Theaters LIKE MORE Posted 31 minutes ago by iClarified · 393 views · Translate Apple is in talks with Hollywood studios to gain earlier access to movies, according to a Bloomberg report. 21st Century Fox Inc., Time Warner Inc.’s Warner Bros. and Comcast Corp.’s Universal Pictures all confirmed over the past week that they are looking to offer high-priced, home-video rentals of new movies shortly after they open in theaters. Some studio executives have been pushing to allow home rentals as early as two weeks after theatrical debuts and are considering a deal with iTunes as one option, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Apple has long been trying to gain earlier access to movies, giving it a leg up on the competition. However, the studios could strike a deal with a different platform instead.Usually movies are exclusive to theaters for about 90 days before they are made available on DVD or online. Bloomberg notes that there has been little growth in cinema attendance and home video revenue in recent years and so film companies are under pressure to find new growth. Under consideration is a premium rental rate of about $25 to $50 to watch a new movie, higher than the average price of a ticket.More details in the full report linked below...",

      "text": "Foxconn employees could some day be working on Apple products in the US.\nPhoto by Apple Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn might be helping President-elect Donald Trump make good on a campaign pledge he made almost a year ago.\nIn January, candidate Trump said this : \"We're going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries.\"\nWith Trump now the president-elect, Foxconn, which supplies Apple with parts for the iPhone and other products, says it's in talks to expand in the US, according to The Wall Street Journal .\n\"We can confirm that we are in preliminary discussions regarding a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current US operations,\" Foxconn told the Journal.\nAlthough Foxconn counts Apple as its biggest customer, it's also been investing in other tech sectors like robotics, health care and e-commerce. What's not clear is which sector Foxconn is targeting for expansion, the Journal said.\nFoxconn and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation of and comment on the Journal's report.\nLast month, the Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple had asked Foxconn and another Asia-based firm that assembles the iPhone to look into the possibility of moving production to the US .\nAnd just this week, Masayoshi Son, the CEO of Japan's Softbank, which controls Sprint, announced from the lobby of Trump Tower that his company would invest $50 billion in the US and create 50,000 new jobs . The Journal notes that Son is a longtime friend of Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou and the two have collaborated on several investments.\n ",

      "text": "iPhone 7 being machined. Image source: Apple.\nLast month, reports surfaced that Apple ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) had asked two of its primary contract manufacturers , Foxconn and Pegatron, to evaluate the possibility of manufacturing iPhones in the U.S. Evidently, Pegatron opted not to research the possibility, believing it would be too costly, but Foxconn complied and gave the idea some serious thought. After all, Apple is its largest customer, so it didn't have much choice but to entertain the idea.\nWhile I was (and still am) skeptical about Apple being able to bring back any meaningful number of jobs (i.e., beyond a token number of jobs that might primarily serve political purposes) based on a wide range of factors like supply chain logistics, it turns out that Foxconn is seriously exploring the notion of expanding its U.S. operations. Foxconn has announced that it is in discussions with the U.S. to potentially invest in expansion. In a statement released earlier today, Foxconn said, \"While the scope of the potential investment has not been determined, we will announce the details of any plans following the completion of direct discussions between our leadership and the relevant U.S. officials.\"\nFoxconn didn't elaborate on which executives were conducting negotiations, or if any of Foxconn's customers had any input, but you can absolutely bet that Apple has some strong opinions on the matter behind closed doors. The news comes just a day after Japan's Softbank said it would invest $50 billion in the U.S. and create 50,000 new jobs.\nStop me if you've heard this one before While Foxconn mulls the idea, keep in mind that this isn't the first time that Foxconn has considered expanding manufacturing in the U.S. The contract manufacturer said in 2013 that it wanted to assemble smartphones and tablets stateside, and again in 2014. Labor costs have been on the rise in the Middle Kingdom, pinching Foxconn's margins in the process.\nFoxconn does already have a presence in the U.S., in part to provide timely support to U.S.-based customers as well as to facilitate collaboration on product development, since manufacturability is critical to scaling. The company has manufacturing and logistics services facilities in a handful of states.\nFoxconn global facilities. Image source: Foxconn.\nIt's probably smart for Foxconn to remain vague at this point, declining to elaborate on any potential expansion in concrete terms. It can score political points by expanding, but theoretically keeping any expansion modest would put a lid on costs as labor costs in the U.S. are still meaningfully higher than in China.\nStill a skeptic It's also a distinct possibility that a Foxconn expansion in the U.S. would focus on areas outside of consumer electronics, but it's unclear exactly what Foxconn has on its mind. But it's hard to imagine Apple sitting out of these discussions altogether, since it has already expressed interest in at least evaluating the possibility. Plus, any cost increases borne by Foxconn would naturally be passed along at least in part to the iPhone maker, and then subsequently to consumers, if Foxconn wants to expand smartphone and tablet assembly.\nDespite this new report, I'm still skeptical about Apple's ability to move any non-trivial number of jobs back to the U.S., particularly around the iPhone. The supply chain is simply far too embedded in Asia to produce the device anywhere else in the volumes that Apple needs.",

      "text": "By Caitlin Huston, MarketWatch\nAnalyst says Square Cash app, a Venmo rival, is unlikely to drive growth for the company despite Apple deal\nShares of Square Inc. climbed more than 5% Wednesday after the company announced a payments partnership with tech giant Apple Inc.\nSquare (SQ) Chief Executive Jack Dorsey announced Tuesday evening (http://www.recode.net/2016/12/6/13857262/watch-square-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-live-online) that the Square Cash app will pair with Apple Pay to allow users to pay at stores using the balance in their Square Cash account. Square Cash is a payments app similar to PayPal Holdings Inc.'s (PYPL) Venmo.\nDespite the pairing with Apple (AAPL) , CFRA Research analyst Scott Kessler said he does not believe Square Cash will drive growth for Square. Kessler said he and other analysts question Square's motivation because he does not see the business being material to Square's earnings.\n\"I think Square is doing far more interesting things as it pertains to moving up to larger vendors and expanding outside the U.S. rather than looking to better position Square Cash,\" Kessler said.\nThat said, in partnering with Apple, Kessler said Square could be attempting to diversify its customer base.\nSee also: Square shares rise after upgrade to outperform at Credit Suisse (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/square-shares-rise-after-upgrade-to-outperform-at-credit-suisse-2016-11-02)\nShares of Square have gained 12% in the past month, compared with the S&P 500's gain of 4%. The company--founded and run by Dorsey, who is also CEO of Twitter Inc. (TWTR) --went public in November of 2015 for $9 a share (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/square-finds-hope-after-bleak-ipo-pricing-2015-11-19), and was trading for more than $14 Wednesday afternoon.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/ga8KwtuDGa9)\nSquare Cash's most direct competitor is Venmo, the peer-to-peer payments app owned by PayPal. But Venmo targets consumers, while Square Cash customers are likely small-business owners who already use the company's point-of-sale system, Kessler said.\nSquare's payment system also supports paying with Apple Pay.\n-Caitlin Huston; 1552ET\n ",

      "text": "Markets Today Apple's iPhone Manufacturing Probably Won't Leave China for the U.S., but Other Products Might The scale and supply chain challenges involved with ramping flagship iPhones makes it hard to do outside of China. But some low-volume, high-margin products could be made in the U.S. Eric Jhonsa Dec7,20164:41PMEST \nWhen a company's financial interests clash with a vocal political effort to get the company to change its ways, it's probably best not to make firm predictions about what's going to ensue. All the same, in the case of Donald Trump's push to get Apple ( AAPL ) to move iPhone production to the U.S., there are good reasons to think that most, if not all, iPhone production won't be leaving China anytime soon. \nThere could be greater wiggle room for some other Apple products, however. \nThough Apple has officially maintained it has no plans to move iPhone production anywhere, a couple of recent stories raise some questions. Last month, Japan's Nikkei reported Apple asked iPhone contract manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron -- both are based in Taiwan, and rely on Chinese manufacturing plants -- in June to explore the possibility of making iPhones in the U.S. \nPegatron reportedly declined the request due to cost concerns. Foxconn, which gets over half its sales from Apple, agreed to launch a study, but the Nikkei adds Foxconn chairman Terry Gou wasn't enthusiastic about the idea. \nRegardless, Foxconn disclosed on Wednesday that it's \"in preliminary discussions regarding a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current U.S. operations.\" The remarks come a day after a document carried by Masayoshi Son, the CEO Japanese tech/telecom giant SoftBank, during a meeting with Trump appeared to suggest Foxconn is planning to invest $7 billion in U.S. and create 50,000 jobs along the way.

      "title": "Why Some High-Profile Hires Don’t Thrive at Apple",
      "text": "| Editorial \nRecently, a high profile executive, Yoky Matsuoka , left Apple. Often, the temptation is to surmise that a departure of any given executive at Apple is a sign that Apple is losing interest in a particular technology. However, that’s not always the case. Sometimes, certain high-powered people just don’t know what they’re getting into and decide that the Apple culture isn’t for them. I’m not saying any of this is what happened with Ms. Matsuoka, But it does offer an opportunity to explain a few things about Apple. Failure is an Option \nThere are few adults who haven’t had the experience of being uncomfortable, uneasy or unhappy in at least one job in their lives. It can happen at Apple as well. It’s just that our expectation of Apple is a little skewed. That is to say, how can a company with such an exciting vision and exciting products not be a joy to work for? Who would ever want to depart hallowed ground? \nIt turns out Apple, like any other company, can be be a bad fit for some eager new hires. Or there can be rare instances of a really bad boss. Transferring between departments is difficult at Apple, at least when I worked there, and so an really unhappy employee’s only option is to resign. The Apple Atmosphere \nI can’t speak for the Tim Cook regime. I was there when Steve Jobs was in his prime. But I think enough of the culture has survived that I can describe a few things with a broad brush. \nFirst, Apple is a company that is intensely envied and copied by competitors. For Apple to thrive, it has to keep its roadmaps and product plans secret. That should be obvious to any academic, but it’s often surprising how academic types, accustomed to working and thinking with peers in their field, feel trapped when they can no longer attend conferences, trade emails about their research and publish papers about their amazing work. \nIn addition, at Apple there is stressful combination of long hours and lack of tolerance for mistakes. It’s expected that any employee work very hard, have considerable achievements and do so without error. \nThat apocryphal story about a frightening encounter with Steve Jobs in the IL1 elevator and being unable to brilliantly articulate your role at Apple always loomed. It drove one’s mindset and carried along with it stress that some found hard to deal with. My take is that Tim Cook has done a lot to eliminate needless fear while still setting high standards. Make no mistake. Apple employees have a lot of fun. \nAnother source of frustration for people hired as Directors, Senior Directors and Vice Presidents is that they are accustomed to calling the shots in their former job. But at Apple, the corporate vision is tightly held by the 11 senior members of the Apple executive team . That means that any lesser executive’s imperative is to implement the vision, not create their own. This is part of the legacy of Steve Jobs. Maverick VPs who engage in turf-building are not tolerated. \nAnd so, these senior people, who thrive on creativity and authority often find themselves in a situation, contrary to military doctrine, with a lot of responsibility to perform but not as much authority as they assumed they’d have. It requires a unique, flexible, intelligent, patient, graceful and introspective mind to get one’s head around the Apple vision, then work as a manager to execute it with leadership and a smile. \nFinally, and my list is by no means exhaustive, Apple has a strong legacy of speaking with only one voice. The Communications group, formerly led by Katie Cotton and now by Steve Dowling alone speaks for Apple, in general, with media relations. Executive Team members are typically “press certified” and can also speak for Apple, notably Tim Cook and Phil Schiller. \nAny lesser executive who decides they should speak to the press or even send out an innocent tweet on some policy matter will be in hot water. They may or may not be given a second chance. \nNext page: A personal story from my Apple days. \nPages:",

      "title": "macOS: Archiving a Time Capsule",
      "text": "| Quick Tip \nI love Apple’s Time Capsule as a wireless networking/backup device (and I’m hoping against hope that they don’t actually kill it off , though things look bleak in that department). That said, I have to wipe them quite often for clients because sometimes the only troubleshooting step left is the “nuke it from orbit” one. Now, if you’re not attached to a file you may have deleted a year ago, that’s not a big deal, but for some folks, having an extra copy of historical stuff helps them sleep better at night. And who am I to judge that? So for this Quick Tip , I’m gonna discuss how to archive your Time Capsule’s data using Airport Utility. Paranoid people, rejoice! \nThe first step is to make sure your Macs aren’t currently trying to access your Time Capsule’s disk. To be certain, open Time Machine’s settings within System Preferences. An easy way to get there is through the Time Machine icon in your Mac’s menu bar. \nThen turn off those automatic backups within the pane (but remember to turn this back on afterward!). \nRepeat those steps for all the Macs in your house, and you’re ready to get started. You’ll need a USB drive with at least enough space as what you’re using on your Time Capsule in order to archive things, so grab that sucker and plug it in to the USB port on the back of your big ol’ white box. Once the destination drive is plugged in, go to one of your Macs and open Airport Utility. That program lives in your Applications > Utilities folder. \nWhen the app opens, you should see your Time Capsule listed in the window. Click it, enter its password if necessary, and then click the “Edit” button. \nYou should see a series of tabs across the top. Pick the “Disks” one, and you’ll get a list of available partitions, including the ones on the USB drive you plugged in. When you click on the partition on which your backups are stored (usually called “Data)”, you’ll have an option to archive it. \nOn the subsequent screen, you’ll need to pick a destination. This is where you’ll find out if your USB disk has enough space to accommodate your archives; if you can’t use it, it’ll be greyed out. But if you’re good to go, pick the disk from the drop-down and click “Archive.” \nOf course, a warning will appear for you to click “Continue” on. Airport Utility really wants to make sure you know what you’re doing. \nThen the archiving process will begin! You can cancel it at any point by clicking on your Time Capsule’s icon… \n…and also, after a few moments, you should get a progress bar and a laughably inaccurate estimate of the time remaining. \nAnd that’s all there is to it! Once the process is complete, you can unplug your USB disk from your Time Capsule, and when you plug it in to your Mac, you’ll see your backup files in a mountable sparse bundle, within which your files are organized by date, just as you would find with a normal Time Machine backup set. So now you can go forth knowing you have a backup…of your backup! Share this:",

      "text": "By Daniel Eran Dilger Wednesday, December 07, 2016, 02:57 pm PT (05:57 pm ET) Apple has been attacked throughout the year for failing to jump on the Virtual Reality headset bandwagon following Facebook, Samsung, Google, HTC, Microsoft, Sony and others. Yet after a year of hype, VR headsets remain a niche that's failing to live up to even conservative expectations. Wheels come off the VR hype wagon Apple's \"failure\" to deliver a VR headset product this year has been the subject of many handwringing articles from analysts and journalists expressing concern for the company given the exciting future promised by VR. However, a variety of research firms are now reporting much slower VR sales than expected--due to both limited content and high hardware costs. Further, the fragmented market split between higher end PC and console-based headsets (including Oculus Rift and Sony's PlayStation VR, below) and various lower end smartphone-based headsets (including offering by HTC, Samsung and Google) has resulted in a dearth of compelling content for any particular ecosystem. An article by Monica Chen and Joseph Tsai for Digitimes stated that the virtual and augmented reality \"market was originally expected to pick up strongly in 2016, but demand for related applications has been weakening recently.\" The emergence of new flavors of VR in 2017, including Asustek's ZenFone AR based on Google Tango and Acer's VR HMD based on Windows Holographics , has \"some market watchers are concerned that the VR/AR ecosystem may not be mature enough to contribute much to the players,\" the article noted. VR Fail Sales A report by James Brightman for Games Industry Biz , citing sales figures from SuperData, indicated that while premium gaming consoles such as Sony's PlayStation 4 were selling well due to aggressive promotions (recently having reached sales of 50 million units, across three years), Sony's $399 PSVR offering fell far short of its estimated forecast of 2.6 million units. SuperData said that only 750 thousand PSVR units have shipped, explaining that \"notably fewer units sold than expected due to a relatively fragmented title line-up and modest marketing effort.\" The research firm stated that VR is \"the biggest loser\" of the season. VR is \"the biggest loser\" of the season - SuperData Facebook's Oculus Rift is expected to only sell 335,000 units this year, while cheaper smartphone-based VR headsets such as HTC's Vive, Google Daydream and Samsung's Gear VR are not doing much better. Google's effort to standardize VR for Android with Daydream has only shipped about a quarter million units, nearly half the number it was estimated to achieve, while even Samsung's heavily promoted Gear VR has failed to sell (or give away) more than 2.3 million units across 2016. VR vs Apple Watch Samsung's Gear VR is low end, $100 headset peripheral that requires a premium Samsung phone (such as a Galaxy S6, S7 or Note 5). As a vehicle for drawing interest to Samsung's high end, it has clearly failed. Contrast that with Apple's own peripheral for its late modeled iPhones: Apple Watch, which has sold by millions each quarter, profitably, at prices from $300 to more than $1,000, while creating demand for fashionable bands, drawing attention to Apple Pay and attracting sports enthusiasts to Apple's ecosystem. Even if Samsung had shipped each Gear VR at full retail price, its total sales would only amount to a quarter billion in revenue. Apple Watch has contributed billions of dollars in high-margin reviews for Apple each quarter. That hasn't stopped industry wags from portraying Apple Watch as a \"failure\" while remaining giddy about the hyped potential of Gear VR. Another similarity between the emerging market for VR headsets and smartwatches is that various industry players--lead by the same firms, including Samsung and joined by Google and Microsoft and their various licensees--also raced to market watches that saw minimal interest from consumers. However, immediately after launching Apple Watch it took majority market share among smartwatches, trouncing years-old efforts by Samsung Gear and Android Wear, neither of which remain very relevant today. Apple sees AR as a bigger opportunity In August, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook told the Washington Post that he thought augmented reality was \"extremely interesting and sort of a core technology.\" In September, Cook said in an interview with ABC News , \"there's virtual reality and there's augmented reality —both of these are incredibly interesting, but my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far.\" In October, Cook again touted the benefits of AR over VR, stating \"There's no substitute for human contact, and so you want the technology to encourage that.\" As with the smartwatch, Apple has repeatedly arrived to market with offerings that were years behind the unfinished, inferior products of its competitors, using new technologies and a fresh approach to addressing users' needs and desires. Apple's iPod was a substantially better music player; iPhone was a vast advancement over the status quo of smartphones, and iPad crushed existing tablets and has never been bested since by any other tablet maker. That bodes well for Apple's next leap into the AR/VR market, particularly given the poor sales and apathetic response current VR headsets are experiencing. Topics:",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 Things did not go Apple Inc. ’s ( AAPL - Free Report ) way as the U.S Supreme Court ruled in favor of its rival, Samsung Electronics, in a design infringement lawsuit that has been going on for quite some time now. Reportedly, in an 8-0 decision, the jury overturned a lower court’s ruling and the case has now been sent to the Appeals Court. As per media reports, Samsung is now trying to get back $399 million of the $548 million penalty it paid Apple. Samsung’s argument has been that Apple is only liable to get profits from the components that are infringed and not for the sale of the entire phone. We are not going to see an end to this legal dispute in the near term as Apple is unlikely to take this lying down. CNBC quoted an Apple spokesperson saying “Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute. We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world's most innovative and beloved product. We remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\" Apple and Samsung have been entangled in a patent dispute since 2012. In an attempt to dominate the global smartphone market, both the giants have been fighting over intellectual property. Samsung too had accused Apple of violating its patents and in reprisal lodged several lawsuits across continents. In 2014, the two companies decided to drop all the other cases except two cases lodged in the U.S courts. In 2014, a United States District Court in California imposed a penalty of $548 million on Samsung for “copying” Apple’s iPhone technology. The Korean giant coughed up the amount with a caveat that “Samsung continues to reserve all rights to obtain reimbursement from Apple and/or payment by Apple of all amounts required to be paid as taxes”, to which Apple did not agree. \nAPPLE INC Price \nAPPLE INC Price | APPLE INC Quote \nSimultaneously, it moved its case to the Supreme Court asking for reconsideration of the verdict. The original damage amounted close to a billion dollars, but after several retrials and appeals through the Court of Appeals for the Federal Court (CAFC), the settlement amount was lowered to $548 million. Following the verdict then, Samsung made its disappointment pretty evident by stating “while this will not impact American consumers, it is another example of Apple abusing the judicial system to create bad legal precedent, which can harm consumer choice for generations to come.” Samsung had found support from other Silicon Valley giants like Facebook Inc. ( FB - Free Report ) Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE - Free Report ) and Alphabet ( GOOGL - Free Report ) . At present, Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .

      "title": "Apple shares the top 50 songs played on Beats 1 during 2016, Drake & Chance the Rapper lead the way",
      "text": "Reddit \nLast night, Apple shared a breakdown of the top apps, games, music, tv, movies and more across its various digital stores. Now, Apple is taking a step back to provide a look at 2016 in terms of its Beats 1 streaming radio station, offering a playlist of the 50 biggest tracks of the year… \nEarlier today, Beats 1 hosts Zane Lowe, Ebro Darden, and Julie Adenuga presented a special show on the streaming radio station breaking down the biggest songs of the year. In addition to playing the top 50 songs, the hosts also shared tidbits of some of their top interviews of the year. \nWe think 2016 was the best year ever for new music, so we compiled a list of 50 records that shaped our year. There’s no formula because at Beats 1, the songs we love the most are the ones we play the most \nThroughout the course of 2016, Beats 1 aired a variety of exclusive interviews with some of music’s top artists. Interviews included Drake, Chance the Rapper, Bruno Mars, and The Chainsmokers – all of whom happen to have a song in the top 50 list. \nLooking closer at the top 50 list, Drake’s smash hit One Dance tops the list, much like it did the iTunes list last night. In the second sport is No Problem by Chance the Rapper, while Tilted by Christine and the Queens rounds out the top 3. Other notable inclusions are Fade by Kanye West, Closer by The Chainsmokers, Cheap Thrills by Sia, and Panda by Desiigner. \nApple Music’s Beats 1 station has been criticized throughout its time on the air for being too hip-hop focused, but at this point it seems like that’s exactly what Apple is going for. Whether or not that strategy is working, however, remains unclear at this point as Apple doesn’t release statistics for the service. \nApple announced last night that Apple Music now has 20 million paying subscribers , up from 17 million three months ago. Though the service still lags behind Spotify in terms of growth, 20 million subscribers in 17 months is certainly a notable achievement. \nYou can check out the full list of the top 50 songs on Beats 1 below. Let us know in the comments if you’ve been using Beats 1 this year and if you agree with what songs are played. Guides",

      "text": "Apple Picks Its Top 20 Games for 2016 by Best of 2016 Advertisement \nIt’s our favorite time of the season: end-of-year video game awards! As we draw closer to the App Store freeze and general holiday shutdown, shops and sites are beginning to share their favorites from the past twelve months. Google posted a hefty list already, picking games based on traits ranging from beauty to irresistibility and giving their top spot to Clash Royale. \nApple has taken a less descriptive approach, simply selecting ten titles on iPhone and ten on iPad as the “Best Games of the Year.” But, like Google, they’ve chosen Supercell’s juggernaut social strategy game as their number one. DrinkBox Studios’ Severed took first place on iPad, with Reigns and Chameleon Run receiving runner-up on iPhone and iPad, respectively. Pokémon Go—despite being left out of either “10 Best” list itself—snagged something like a participation award with “Breakout Hit.” \nAlthough Apple’s top games earned the coveted above-the-fold promotion spot in the App Store, the entire Featured page has been massively expanded to highlight a bevy of Apple’s favorites from 2016. They celebrate “playing with one hand” through games like Tomb of the Mask and Stretch Dungeon ; card games like Guild of Dungeoneering and Pathfinder Adventures ; indies like Snakebird and Mekorama ; and even Crossy-likes such as Faily Brakes and Looty Dungeon. There are a ton of fantastic titles highlighted and celebrated in a lovely wrap-up that’s a colorful reminder: 2016 was an amazing year for mobile games, and it’s not even over yet.

      "text": "Apple and NHL Close to Striking 'Major Partnership' to Bring iPads to Team Benches Wednesday December 7, 2016 3:18 PM PST by Joe Rossignol Apple is in late-stage discussions with the National Hockey League regarding a \"major partnership\" that could see iPads and other technologies implemented on team benches and elsewhere in arenas, according to Canadian sports network TSN . (Source: Getty Images) The report claims the NHL has been in negotiations with Apple and Microsoft for several years, adding that talks with Apple have accelerated recently after similar talks between Apple and the National Basketball Association failed to materialize. “The NHL Apple deal is more a major partnership than a sponsorship,” said a source familiar with the NHL’s plans. “Right now, some teams have iPads or other tablets and some don’t. Some have good Internet connections, some don’t. This deal is about having a consistent platform that every team can use in every rink.” Major League Baseball's digital operation BAMTech has been involved in the negotiations, after reaching a six-year deal with the NHL last year for the rights to distribute live out-of-market games, according to the report. BAMTech's parent division MLB Advanced Media also owns the rights to the NHL's website, mobile apps, operations, and distribution of the league's streaming platform NHL GameCenter Live, available on iPad and other Apple devices. The deal could resemble a $400 million partnership between the NFL and Microsoft, ongoing since 2013, which provides team coaches with Surface tablets to use on the sidelines during football games.",

Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + If you don't grow, you shrink. That seems to be Apple's mentality, as the company is reportedly looking forward to opening a new flagship store in Washington D.C.'s Carnegie Library. The Washington Business Journal reports that the local convention and sports authority has agreed to let Apple proceed with its plans, which include renovating the 113-year old building.The company will work in tandem with Foster + Partners of London in redesigning the 63,000 square feet of space, possibly borrowing ideas from central Apple stores in London, California, and San Francisco. The design company is the one behind the aforementioned outlets, notable for elements like giant video screens, glass windows, and gathering places.Apple's London store at Regent Street is also situated inside a historic building, and the company has been given a preservation award for its sensitive repurposing of historic properties, which means Apple knows how to handle the Carnegie Library's time-tested look and build. It will eventually become the company's second store in the District, the first one being in Georgetown.The deal will be considered this Thursday. It's not known when Apple will be able to begin the renovation, and there's no schedule for the store's eventual opening.",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple formally introduced its new Single Sign-On feature yesterday , though with a weak list of supporters, both in terms of apps and cable companies. According to a new report from The Verge , however, Apple is adding support for the ABC and Disney apps just a day after the initial launch… \nStarting today, the Watch ABC and Watch Disney apps for tvOS and iOS will now atualtically log you in, assuming you’ve entered your cable provider login credentials into the Settings app. \nThis means that if you open either the Watch ABC or Watch Disney app on iOS or tvOS, you’ll automatically be logged into the service and have instant access to streaming the latest content. \nDespite today’s addition of Disney and ABC, however, the list of apps that support Single Sign-On is still severely lacking. At this point, holdouts include major network apps such as HBO Go, NBC, Fox, and CBS. \nPerhaps more notably, however is the list of cable providers that support Single Sign-On. At this point, providers like Comcast, Verizon Fios, Charter, and Time Warner Cable do not support the feature, but Apple claims that more providers are coming as time progresses. \nBelow is the full list of apps that support Single Sign-On as of now, not including today’s additions of Watch ABC and Watch Disney.

      "text": "Why Apple's Supreme Court Loss is Actually a Win for Innovation The technology industry has reason to celebrate. Apple December 7, 2016 W hen the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Samsung over Apple, it ended the South Korean company’s five-year-long legal battle over 11 phones that lower courts ruled as violations of Apple’s design patents. But on Tuesday, the nation’s highest court determined that Samsung should not be subject to an 1887 law that would require it to surrender all profits from infringing devices to Apple and, instead, has sent the case back to a lower court in order to determine final damages. The ruling is seen as a victory for innovation by a number of technology companies and advocacy groups. Curved rectangles got us into this mess In 2011, Apple sued Samsung for using design elements of its patented iPhone design. The curved rectangular corners and a grid icon display were serious points of contention. Lawyers for Samsung argued that because the design elements were just one component of an otherwise complex and original device, it didn’t owe Apple all its phone entire profits. A U.S. Circuit Court sided with Apple in 2012, hitting Samsung with over $1 billion in penalties and an injunction on future sales. A series of appeals followed; eventually Samsung paid Apple $548 million in December 2015. That’s when Samsung took the matter to the Supreme Court, arguing that it should not be required to pay $399 million for copying features including the rounded-corner font and grid icons: See how they are similar? The tide began to turn in Samsung’s favor when in February a Federal Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals overturned a decision requiring Samsung to pay $120 million to Apple in a separate infringement case. Tuesday’s ruling , which ruled unanimously 8-0 against the use of total profits as a means of repayment, was by far the biggest victory for the company against Apple. Samsung told Reuters in a statement the ruling was a “victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.” Why is Silicon Valley so invested in this case? Tuesday’s ruling was the first time since the 1800s the Supreme Court considered a patent design case and, needless to say, the state of American invention has changed a lot since then. The trial reflects the increasing divide between Silicon Valley innovators and traditional retail companies. Google, Facebook, Dell, HP and eBay were just a few technology companies that filed a petition to the Supreme Court in January requesting that it hear Samsung’s appeals case. Organizations like the Computer & Communications Industry Association and the Internet Association , which represents companies like Uber and AirBnb, also came out to support Samsung. “This was a pivotal court case for the technology industry and it is encouraging to see the law interpreted and applied in a way that makes sense in a modern era and protects both inventors and innovation,” Ed Black, CEO of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, said in a statement. On Apple’s side were mostly fashion retailers whose likelihoods depend on design patents — Nike, Crocs, and Oakley . Not unlikely bedfellows for a tech company that once tried to patent a paper bag . You can't patent this. The Supreme Court ruling doesn’t give patent infringers total immunity, but it is a huge step in acknowledging the complexity of technological devices and how patent law could begin to address innovation in the modern world. While several lawmakers have initiated legislation to reform the centuries-old patent laws ruling Silicon Valley today, advances have been stalled by political disagreement in both parties. “It’s not the end of that litigation but it’s the end of many company’s worse fears related to this case,” Florian Mueller, a patent activist based in Germany, tells *Inverse. “On that basis anybody who would have been threatened by design patent litigation would have faced an incalculable economic risk.” However, it’s hard to predict what the political landscape will look like for businesses under a Trump presidency and Supreme Court nominee. While the president-elect has already expressed his opposition to net-neutrality , he’s been relatively mum on intellectual property. The official GOP platform advocates for strong intellectual property enforcement. Trump is set to meet with technology leaders on December 14 . People wait for iPhones in 2007. What does it mean for consumers? While this five-year battle has important implications for the tech world, there hasn’t been much of an impact on consumers of either brand. Samsung eventually took the 11 devices in question off the market and the company hasn’t struggled to sell other phones — last year it saw its U.S. sales increase . And while the company might be itching to get back the $382 million it currently owes to Apple, even losing in the lower courts isn’t likely to topple the company, which has a $216 billion market value . Barring a settlement — which seems incredibly unlikely — the case will now be kicked back to a lower court to decide how much Samsung owes Apple. In its ruling, the Supreme Court did not provide any guidance as to how the lower court should decide damages. The two companies also have a separate ongoing legal battle in California. “We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world’s most innovative and beloved product,” Apple said in a statement to the press after the trial. “We remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn’t right.” Photos via Getty Images / Michael Nagle, Getty Images / Chip Somodevilla",

      "title": "Biz Break: Pandora, Apple pump up their music-streaming offerings",
      "text": "  \nTop of the Order: \nFill up with Premium: As anyone who’s ever been to a gas station knows, when you pull up for a fill up, there are usually three choices of fuel available: regular, some kind of mid-grade, call it “plus”, if you will, and premium, the most-expensive gas you can put in your car’s tank. \nAnd now, Pandora is taking a step closer toward being the music-streaming equivalent of the corner Chevron station. \nOakland-based Pandora has taken the wraps off of what it is calling Pandora Premium , it’s first, true, on-demand subscription music service. The company gave a demo of Pandora Premium at an event in New York late Tuesday, and, if you are a Pandora member already, you got an email Wednesday pointing to a company blog post that said, well, not a lot about the details of the service. \nSome of the things Pandora had to say were that Pandora Premium “is designed to open up a world of music completely unique to you,” that the “upcoming features tune into each listener’s individuality and leverage our deep knowledge of musical data,” and “it will be an effortless and flexible experience for all subscribers.” \nAlso, Pandora Premium won’t be available until “early 2017.” Pandora didn’t say what the service will cost, but, based on what similar music-streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music charge, it’s widely believed that Pandora Premium will come with a $10-a-month price tag. \nAnd with Pandora Premium, Pandora will complete its gas-station-style services, as the higher-end service will go along with the company’s current free, ad-supported streaming option and its new Pandora Plus $5-a-month ad-free service. \nBut, will there be a Pandora to run Pandora Premium? The company is said to be open to selling itself, possibly to the likes of satellite radio company Sirius XM , and one of the mysteries around any such deal would be if the possible acquirer wants to keep the Pandora name around. \nMiddle Innings: \nApple Speaks: Here’s a rarity: Apple actually disclosing some real information about its business at some time other than during its quarterly report. \nApple senior vice president of software and products Eddy Cue told Billboard that the company is seeing strong new growth in its Apple Music business , and that the streaming music service has surpassed 20 million paying subscribers. When Apple gave its most-recent quarterly report in October, it said Apple Music was at 17 million subscribers. Cue also said that 50 percent of Apple Music’s subscribers are from outside the U.S. \nComing to America: It’s probably safe to say that there wouldn’t be an iPhone without Foxconn Technology. Really. \nIf you haven’t heard of Foxconn, it is the Taiwanese tech-manufacturing giant that actually builds iPhones, and lots of other stuff for lots of other tech companies, mainly in China. And it looks like Foxconn wants to actually come to America. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Foxconn is in talks to expand it operations into the U.S. Foxconn didn’t say how big of an investment it intends to make in the U.S., nor if any of it American facilities would end up making iPhones, or any other Apple products. But Foxconn’s plans to expand into the U.S. could end up playing into President-elect Donald Trump’s promises to bring more manufacturing jobs back into the country. \nBottom of the Lineup: \nHere’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Wednesday … \nMovin’ on Up: SunPower shares surged more than 14 percent after the San Jose-based solar-power technology company said it would slash 25 percent of its workforce . Gains also came from Twitter, Inphi, Cavium and Glu Mobile. \nIn the Red: Decliners included Sigma Designs, GoPro, Nektar Therapeutics, Gigamon and 8×8. \nThe tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.1 percent to 5,393.76. \nThe blue chip Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.6 percent to 19,549.62. \nAnd the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 1.3 percent to finish the day at 2,241.35. \nQuote Of The Day: ‘The year 2016 was the year of his rise; 2017 will be the year of his rule, and like all newly elected leaders, he has a chance to fulfill promises and defy expectations.”— Time magazine Editor-in-Chief Nancy Gibbs , writing about Time’s Person of the Year, President-elect Donald Trump. \nSign up for the 60-Second Business Break newsletter at www.siliconvalley.com .

      "title": "Why Samsung's Troubles Are Apple's iPhone Gains - Fortune",
      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Why Samsung’s Troubles Are Apple’s iPhone Gains \nApple’s iPhone had its strongest market share gains in two years at the end of October, new research shows. \nThe iOS device accounted for 40.5% of all smartphone sales in the U.S. during the three-month period ended October, according to data released on Wednesday by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. That was up from 33.5% share of smartphone sales during the same period in 2015, according to the research firm. That’s the strongest year-over-year growth Apple AAPL has witnessed in the last two years and the greatest number of sales share since the three-month period ended January 2015. \nAndroid devices still reign supreme in the U.S., collectively accounting for nearly 58% of all smartphone sales. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nWhile the iPhone is still trailing Android devices, Apple’s success during the period might have been due in part to the troubles Samsung endured during the same period. \nIn August, Samsung released the Galaxy Note 7 in hopes of competing against the iPhone 7 that would launch in September. However, the smartphone fell victim to manufacturing troubles that caused it to overheat and in some cases, explode. After a recall, replacement devices suffered from the same problem, leading Samsung to discontinue the handset . The Galaxy Note 7 had been expected by some industry watchers to sell exceedingly well. Apple could have benefited from that. \nStill, there’s more to the iPhone’s success during the period than Samsung . Kantar’s consumer insight director Lauren Guenveur noted that the iPhone 7 proved exceedingly popular. The analyst said in a statement that the smartphone’s “lack of the headphone jack has proved to be a non-issue for U.S. iPhone consumers.” Apple’s iPhone 7 was the top-selling smartphone during the period. \nIn addition, Guenveur said Apple benefits from being Apple. For more about Apple iPhone, watch: \n“While Android dominates in terms of the raw number of devices it powers, Apple remains the most desirable smartphone brand in the world,” the analyst said. \nMoving away from Apple, Kantar noted that Google’s Pixel smartphone, the first to be designed and engineered by Google GOOGL , accounted for 0.5% of all smartphone sales during the three-month period ended October. That put Google’s handset on equal footing with smartphones from popular competing brands, like China-based Huawei.",

      "text": "When a company's financial interests clash with a vocal political effort to get the company to change its ways, it's probably best not to make firm predictions about what's going to ensue. All the same, in the case of Donald Trump's push to get Apple ( AAPL ) to move iPhone production to the U.S., there are good reasons to think that most, if not all, iPhone production won't be leaving China anytime soon.\nThere could be greater wiggle room for some other Apple products, however.\nThough Apple has officially maintained it has no plans to move iPhone production anywhere, a couple of recent stories raise some questions. Last month, Japan's Nikkei reported Apple asked iPhone contract manufacturers Foxconn and Pegatron -- both are based in Taiwan, and rely on Chinese manufacturing plants -- in June to explore the possibility of making iPhones in the U.S.\nPegatron reportedly declined the request due to cost concerns. Foxconn, which gets over half its sales from Apple, agreed to launch a study, but the Nikkei adds Foxconn chairman Terry Gou wasn't enthusiastic about the idea.\nRegardless, Foxconn disclosed on Wednesday that it's \"in preliminary discussions regarding a potential investment that would represent an expansion of our current U.S. operations.\" The remarks come a day after a document carried by Masayoshi Son, the CEO Japanese tech/telecom giant SoftBank, during a meeting with Trump appeared to suggest Foxconn is planning to invest $7 billion in U.S. and create 50,000 jobs along the way.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

      "text": "(RNN) - Only three months after the release of Apple's latest phone, rumors are already exploding about the bigger, brighter, sexier iPhone 8.\nThe best of the bunch: Apple will finally include wireless charging capability, ending all those maddening moments when your battery fizzled and you were nowhere near an electrical outlet.\nU.S. sales of the iPhone 7 have been great, Business Insider reported. Despite initial outrage over the removal of the headphone jack, iPhone 7 was the best-selling phone in the nation and, along with iPhone 7 Plus, accounted for almost 16 percent of all smartphone sales. \nThat has not diminished dozens of leaks and rumors of the wonderful iPhone 8 yet to come, with astonishing new features and a complete redesign. The glass-backed marvel might be part of a three-product release if the scuttlebutt is true. \nMacRumors  on Dec. 7 cited Japanese website Mac Otakara's report that Apple would release models 7s and 7s Plus with no redesign, but available in a a new, bright red color and powered by a faster A11 chip.\nIf that's the case, iPhone 8 will be a top-of-the line option for high rollers who want the latest tech whatever it costs.\nOther reports say the Home button will go away, and along with fingerprint ID it will be integrated into the edge-to-edge curved screen.\nBut the game-changing upgrade would address sketchy battery life, the bane of iPhone users.\nThe iPhone 8 will at last include wireless charging, according to multiple reports  Macrumors said that Hon Hai Precision Industry is already manufacturing recharging modules, so that your phone will recharge constantly as long as it is in range of the device.\nThe iPhone 8 is said to be 8.8 inches with OLED (Organic light-emitting diode). The 7s models will feature TFT-LCD (Thin-film transmitter liquid-crystal display). One will be 4.7 inches and the other 5.7 inches. Some rumors say the larger TFT-LCD model also will have wireless charging, but the reports conflict. All the models will have glass backs.\nThe phones will feature an improvement to the telephoto lens in the iPhone 7, which has optimal stabilization for the macro lens but not the zoom.\nCopyright 2016 Raycom News Network.
