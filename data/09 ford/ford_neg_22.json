And now he's truly built \"Ford tough.\" \nFord has tapped Caswell for a promotion highlighting the auto maker's connection to football (Ford is the Official Truck of the NFL) and Houston's affection for a great tailgate experience.On Friday, Nov. 25, Ford is giving away tickets to Sunday's Texans/Chargers game that will come with a meal prepared by Caswell and delivered by Uber . \nHere are the details for the Ford Tough Tailgate on Demand Uber Promotion: On Nov. 25 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. fans can open their Uber app and enter the promo code FORDTOUGHHOU and request the TAILGATE option. There will be 25 fans who will be connected with a driver that will deliver tailgate-inspired dishes made by Caswell. The delivery (in a 2017 Ford Super Duty, naturally) will come with two tickets to Sunday's Texans game, as well as an NFL Shop gift certificate. \nCaswell also is cooking for a private tailgate party at NRG Stadium on Sunday called the Built Ford Tough Tailgate Game Day Stadium Experience. A few lucky guests from a private tailgate lunch held Wednesday for the Houston Fire Department were invited to the party. We're also told that Ford plans to invite a few of the Uber winners, too. \nFord Toughest Tailgate Whole Fish Tacos is one of the dishes Caswell will be making at the tailgate party Sunday.

      "text": "Daniel Strohl on at 8:59 am Share \nPhoto courtesy Chevrolet Caribbean. \nFinding common ground helps foster connections among rivals and opponents, whatever the matter at hand. Adherents of many diverse philosophies, tenets and tribes can operate side by side as long as they recognize shared goals and visions. Don’t think it’s possible? Just consider the time that Chevrolet and Ford – rivals to end all rivalries – rebadged the same vehicle. \nOne can count the number of indirect connections between the Bowtie and Blue Oval brands throughout history on one hand: the Chevrolet brothers’ Frontenac performance parts for Ford Model Ts, Zora Arkus-Duntov’s development of Ford V-8 parts before getting hired at Chevrolet, Knudsen and Shinoda’s work for both brands, Ford’s use of the Quadrajet on the 1970 to 1971 Cobra Jet 429. But only twice in both brands’ histories did both sell the same vehicle as their own. \nThe first doesn’t really count as a rebadging effort. During World War II, Chevrolet and Ford each built versions of the Canadian Military Pattern trucks for the British Commonwealth’s war effort. Neither, of course, were built for the general public, and like many other military vehicles, the trucks were built to specifications provided to the companies. \nBut like the Canadian Military Pattern trucks, the rebadging of the Suzuki Carry into the Chevrolet CMV / CMP and the Ford Pronto not only involved the same acronym but also each brand’s parent company’s extensive global operations. \nWhile the Carry dates back to 1961, it remained an also-ran in its home market until about the mid-Seventies, when it became the top-selling kei-class utility vehicle. Not long after, Suzuki began to sell the Carry in Indonesia and licensed the trucklet to the Chinese automaker FAW Jilin, and by the early 1980s Suzuki had licensed the Carry all over Asia. \nPhoto by Tttkusoialonis . \nAmong those early licensed versions was the Ford Pronto, built in Taiwan by Ford Lio Ho Motor, a Ford subsidiary that largely assembled Ford vehicles for the Taiwanese market. Production – using a chunky plastic fascia that wrapped around the nose – began in 1985 and continued until 2007. A successive version, which Ford calls the PRV, also appears to be based on the Carry. \nExactly when and how Chevrolet began to rebadge the Carry as the CMV (van) and CMP (pickup) isn’t clear, though other GM brands, including Bedford, Vauxhall, GME, and Holden, began marketing their own versions of the Carry as early as 1986. Chevrolet versions, built by Daewoo in South America, were eventually sold across Central and South America – most notably in Colombia and Venezuela – as well as in Tunisia. It appears Chevrolet continued to sell the CMV/CMP up until 2013, when Suzuki introduced the most recent generation of Carry. \nFor the record, several other automakers around the world also produced or marketed their own versions of the Carry, among them Maruti, Mazda, Autozam, Wuling, PakSuzuki, Chang’an, Mitsubishi, and Songhuajiang. In addition to Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea, versions of the Carry have been built in England, India, and Uzbekistan.",

(Photo: David Paul Morris / Getty Images) \nFord Motor Co. on Tuesday will unveil its new Ford Fiesta during one of the automakers special “Go Further” events in Cologne, Germany.\nTaking the wraps off the subcompact car will be Ford President and CEO Mark Fields and Ford of Europe Executive Vice President and President Jim Farley.\n“The new Fiesta will be our best expression of Ford — lovable fun, sporty to drive and with an unmatched personality true to the spirit of the iconic small car that has delighted generations of customers for the past 40 years,” Farley said in a statement.\nDuring the event, Ford says it also will announce details on its “Smart Mobility strategy, fuel-saving technology news, and reveal new commercial vehicles.”\nFord in recent years has used “Go Further” events to outline new strategies for the company as well as unveil new vehicles. The event will be livestreamed starting at 2 p.m. Tuesday through Ford Europe’s YouTube channel. \nAbout 2,500 dealers, employees and media are expected to attend the event, which is taking place at the company’s W-Halle inside the Niehl, Cologne manufacturing facility — one of several assembly plants for the current Fiesta.\nFord did not announce any details of the vehicle or its production plans for the car. For the U.S., the car is currently imported from Ford’s Cuautitlan Stamping and Assembly Plant in Mexico.\nFord Fiesta sales in the U.S. were down 26.6 percent through October, as consumer preference continues to shift toward larger, more-capable crossovers and SUVs.\nAutodata Corp. reports U.S. passenger car sales heading into the final months of the year were down 8.9 percent through October, including a 14.1 percent decline in Ford’s car sales.\nmwayland@detroitnews.com \n(313) 222-2504 \nTwitter: @MikeWayland",

By: Nandagopal Rajan | New Delhi | Published: November 24, 2016 6:20 AM Umang Bedi, managing director, Facebook India and South Asia, attributed it to the fact that this was “only platform with real people”, in effect making it the “largest aggregator of real identities on the planet”. (Reuters) \nFacebook India has claimed that it has started offering unprecedented results for its partners in terms of “moving business”. Umang Bedi, managing director, Facebook India and South Asia, attributed it to the fact that this was “only platform with real people”, in effect making it the “largest aggregator of real identities on the planet”. \nListing examples of recent successes, Bedi, who joined the social network a few months back, said Tata Housing was able to sell 280 houses on the platform within a day while Ford and Samsung too experienced similar success. Bedi said his focus was on eight key vertical including financial services, tech, telecom and auto. \nIndia has for sometime been Facebook’s second largest market, but Bedi said the country is clearly the most critical and strategic market for the company. “We contribute $4 billion and 335,000 jobs to India through our marketing, platform and connectivity efforts.” he said, quoting a 2015 Deloitte report. Though he refused to divulge India’s position in terms of revenue, he said it was “leading the charter for emerging markets”. \nTo help brands make better use of the platform, Facebook has rolled out its Blueprint free creative training modules for businesses. The idea he said was to help them create “thumb stopping” creatives and understand the best practices for mobile first. Blueprint eLearning has hit 1 million enrolment. India ranks as the second largest country signing onto Blueprint. The top five countries include the US, India, Egypt, Brazil and the UK. \n“Blueprint has vertical specific narratives. Then it shows various products and how to use them with deep and narrow segmentation as well as broad and wide targets. There is training on how to get maximum reach and maximum frequency. Blueprint really focuses on two things. One is the creative, the other is how do you build a campaign, reach and optimisation. By the way it is for both on and off Facebook,” Bedi told indianexpress.com. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

(FCA US LLC)   11:52 AM \nIf you’re reading this, you managed to make it through your family Thanksgiving, awake from your tryptophan-induced coma and, very possibly, survive the perilous battleground that is post-Thanksgiving retail. \nYou deserve a pat on the back, a good stiff drink and a heaping helping of the latest automotive news. \nConsidering most people had the day off yesterday, the news load is a little light today, but it is Friday, so you might have better things to do anyway. \nSo, without further ado, here’s your Black Friday edition of the Daily Drive-Thru. Ford, Ram appeal to working class \nFootball fans may have noticed an abundance of pickup truck advertisements during Thursday’s game, particularly for the Ford F-Series and Rams trucks, both of which shared a common theme, the blue-collar worker, though they approached it in very different ways. \nFord took the comedic approach in its latest ad, “Tough,” showing a group of construction workers skipping rope on a work site while two other, ostensibly tougher workers watch in disgust next to a Ford Super Duty. \nIn the dark, brooding style of the Chrysler’s “Imported from Detroit” and “Halftime in America” spots from 2011 and 2012, respectively, Ram crafted its latest ad “Praise,” a commercial celebrating both the work that goes into making its trucks and the work done with them in its. Don’t believe the Black Friday hype Black Friday is not the best day to get a deal on a new car. (John Gress/Corbis via Getty Images) \nSpeaking of car ads, many of them will try to convince you that today’s big promotional sales make it the ideal day to buy a car. Well, TrueCar begs to differ—it’s actually just the fifth best day. \nLast year, the greatest savings came on December 31, which makes sense as automakers and dealerships are prepared to do whatever they can to shed stock before the end of the year. It’s all a numbers game. The average price reduction on New Years Eve was 8.8 percent or $2,640 off of a $30,000 car. \nThe next three best days for car sales also were in December, getting progressively friendlier as the end of the month approached. So, the moral of the story: if you’re looking for a deal, you’re better off waiting. Marchionne calls Trump a ‘game changer’ FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne said Trump's presidency could be a game changer for his company. (GIUSEPPE CACACE/AFP/Getty Images) \nIn addition to finding success as brash outsiders in the political world, President-elect Donald Trump and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin now have something else in common: being labeled game changers. Palin, of course, was given the moniker by a not-too-flattering depiction of vice presidential candidacy in the HBO movie “Game Change,” while Trump’s title comes from another outspoken businessman, Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne. \nDuring press event at the Alfa Romeo plant in Cassino, Italy, Marchionne said Trump’s election “certainly is a game changer, mainly because I think that there are a number of conditions in the U.S. which are not yet spelled out.” \nWhile the term game changer can often be positive, something tells me that isn’t the case here. Marchionne had previously warned that Trump’s anti-NAFTA sentiment could harm his company’s profitability and that concern still holds true today. About 17 percent of Fiat Chrysler’s North American vehicles are made in Mexico and the company also has a large Canadian workforce. \nSource: Bloomberg Daimler doubles down on diesel Daimler said it will not be afraid to offer diesel versions of cars such as the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. (Mercedes-Benz) \nWhile a certain emissions scandal has one German automaker running away from diesel engine production, another remains undeterred. I’m talking, of course, about Volkswagen’s so-called “Dieselgate” snafu that caused the company to formally end its TDI program in the U.S. earlier this week. Yesterday, fellow German-based carmaker Daimler said it will not follow suit. \n“There is currently no decision nor are there considerations to withdraw diesel from the U.S.,\" a Daimler spokesperson said. Diesel cars make up less than 1 percent of Daimler’s American sales, which include the Mercedes and Smart brands. \nSource: Reuters \nCheck the Daily Drive-Thru every weekday morning to get the latest on the most important news and trends in the automotive world. \nYou can find Thursday’s installment of the Drive-Thru here and view the rest of our archives here . \nGot a news tip or a comment?

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nFord has introduced an all-electric version of the Mustang GT, but there’s a major catch. It’s just a fraction of the size of a real pony car because it was developed by Fisher-Price for kids aged between 3 and 7. \nThe Blue Oval promises the newest addition to Fisher-Price’s Power Wheels lineup is more advanced than any kiddie car to date. That’s partly because it features a built-in sound system with a large speaker that plays the symphony of the ‘Stang’s 5.0-liter V8 engine, a feature that makes the driving experience more realistic for young drivers. Kids who would rather sit back and enjoy the ride can play three preloaded songs, or listen to their favorite playlist by plugging in an MP3 player. \nMore: Radio Flyer’s kid-sized Tesla Model S redefines the term “early adopter” \nThe Mustang GT inaugurates Fisher-Price’s new computer-controlled powertrain. Named Smart Drive, it brings features such as a traction control system that adjusts the speed of the electric motors if it detects wheel slip so that kids can power through wet grass or bumpy roads without getting stuck, and a stability control system that turns the motors off if it senses the car is about to roll over. \nThe electric drivetrain gives the GT a top speed of 5 mph forward and 2.5 mph in reverse. Five speed settings accessible via a touch screen on the dashboard allow parents to control how fast their kids go. There’s even a feature named Smooth Start Technology that reduces the car’s tendency to jerk while accelerating at low speeds. \nThe Smart Drive Mustang carries a base price of $360, and the first deliveries are scheduled for next month. It’s only available as a convertible, as you’d expect from a Power Wheels car, but parents can order it in either blue or pink. Also watch: Superformance Ford GT40 MkII Review",

      "text": "on Nov 25, 2016, 2:00 PM TechSpot \nOne of the highlights of my youth was owning a go-kart. I was the envy of all the neighborhood kids but when my family relocated to an area that didn’t allow for such gas-powered fun, it was sold and replaced with a Power Wheels-style 3-wheeler. \nNeedless to say, going from a serious driving experience to second-hand electric toy wasn’t much fun. Had something like Fischer-Price’s new Ford Mustang GT Power Wheels been available, I suspect the transition wouldn't have been so bad. \nThe pint-sized Mustang GT is designed to hold up to two riders comfortably (recommended for ages 3-7) with a total weight limit of 130 pounds. The built-in sound system with touch screen display comes with a few pre-loaded songs and sound effects although kids can bring their own tunes via MP3 player. The display is also used to adjust speed settings (maximum of 5 mph forward, 2.5 mph reverse), view battery status and alert drivers when traction control or stability control kick in. Wait, what? \nIndeed, the mini Mustang GT features a dynamic traction control system that adjusts the speed of the electric motors when it detects wheel spin as well as a stability control system that can turn the motors off to prevent rollovers at unsafe angles. There’s also Smooth Start Technology that enables smooth acceleration at lower speeds. \nThat’s some impressive technology for a toy of this caliber and should provide overly cautious parents peace of mind. \nThe Power Wheels Ford Mustang GT goes on sale next month priced at $360.

      "text": "Friday, Nov 25th, 2016 @ 12:56 pm Ford has announced that it will unveil its next-generation Fiesta sub-compact at an event in Colonge, Germany on November 29. The company will also detail its latest Smart Mobility strategy at the event.Ford didn't dish out any details on the next-generation Fiesta, but the company promises a sporty compact with an unmatched personality.\"The new Fiesta will be our best expression of Ford - lovable fun, sporty to drive and with an unmatched personality true to the spirit of the iconic small car that has delighted generations of customers for the past 40 years,\" Ford of Europe executive vice president Jim Farley said.The next Fiesta (pictured) will ride on the same Global B platform that underpins the current car. That means the Fiesta's overall dimensions won't change much, but the latest version of the small car is expected to adopt a blunter front end, thinner headlights and wider taillights. The Fiesta should also see a major step up in interior quality and design.A number of new safety systems will be available on the next Fiesta, including lane departure warning and traffic sign recognition. Powertrains should carryover, including the top-spec Fiesta ST.The North American version of the next Fiesta will be built in Thailand; the current North American version of the car is built in Mexico.Following its unveiling on November 29, look for the 2018 Ford Fiesta to go on sale early next year. \n ",

      "text": "Daniel Strohl on at 8:59 am Share \nPhoto courtesy Chevrolet Caribbean. \nFinding common ground helps foster connections among rivals and opponents, whatever the matter at hand. Adherents of many diverse philosophies, tenets and tribes can operate side by side as long as they recognize shared goals and visions. Don’t think it’s possible? Just consider the time that Chevrolet and Ford – rivals to end all rivalries – rebadged the same vehicle. \nOne can count the number of indirect connections between the Bowtie and Blue Oval brands throughout history on one hand: the Chevrolet brothers’ Frontenac performance parts for Ford Model Ts, Zora Arkus-Duntov’s development of Ford V-8 parts before getting hired at Chevrolet, Knudsen and Shinoda’s work for both brands, Ford’s use of the Quadrajet on the 1970 to 1971 Cobra Jet 429. But only twice in both brands’ histories did both sell the same vehicle as their own. \nThe first doesn’t really count as a rebadging effort. During World War II, Chevrolet and Ford each built versions of the Canadian Military Pattern trucks for the British Commonwealth’s war effort. Neither, of course, were built for the general public, and like many other military vehicles, the trucks were built to specifications provided to the companies. \nBut like the Canadian Military Pattern trucks, the rebadging of the Suzuki Carry into the Chevrolet CMV / CMP and the Ford Pronto not only involved the same acronym but also each brand’s parent company’s extensive global operations. \nWhile the Carry dates back to 1961, it remained an also-ran in its home market until about the mid-Seventies, when it became the top-selling kei-class utility vehicle. Not long after, Suzuki began to sell the Carry in Indonesia and licensed the trucklet to the Chinese automaker FAW Jilin, and by the early 1980s Suzuki had licensed the Carry all over Asia. \nPhoto by Tttkusoialonis . \nAmong those early licensed versions was the Ford Pronto, built in Taiwan by Ford Lio Ho Motor, a Ford subsidiary that largely assembled Ford vehicles for the Taiwanese market. Production – using a chunky plastic fascia that wrapped around the nose – began in 1985 and continued until 2007. A successive version, which Ford calls the PRV, also appears to be based on the Carry. \nExactly when and how Chevrolet began to rebadge the Carry as the CMV (van) and CMP (pickup) isn’t clear, though other GM brands, including Bedford, Vauxhall, GME, and Holden, began marketing their own versions of the Carry as early as 1986. Chevrolet versions, built by Daewoo in South America, were eventually sold across Central and South America – most notably in Colombia and Venezuela – as well as in Tunisia. It appears Chevrolet continued to sell the CMV/CMP up until 2013, when Suzuki introduced the most recent generation of Carry. \nFor the record, several other automakers around the world also produced or marketed their own versions of the Carry, among them Maruti, Mazda, Autozam, Wuling, PakSuzuki, Chang’an, Mitsubishi, and Songhuajiang. In addition to Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea, versions of the Carry have been built in England, India, and Uzbekistan.",

      "text": "I Just Spent $67K On a Truck I just spent $67,515 on a new 2017 Ford F-150 Raptor. It has a twin-turbocharged intercooled 3.5-liter V6, and absolutely fully loaded interior. It’s one hell of a truck. Now I’m wondering how many people I could’ve fed with that money.\nWell for starters, I helped feed the thousands of employees at the Dearborn Truck factory in Michigan. I also helped to feed workers worldwide who were responsible for getting the materials needed for the vehicle.\nI fed the workers at iron ore mines and steel refineries in Australia and Brazil , who provided the steel for the frame. I fed the workers at bauxite mines in Russia and China , who provided the aluminum for the engine (the Raptor has an aluminum block engine). I fed cattle ranchers in Brazil and the USA , who provided the leather. I fed the rubber farmers in Thailand , Indonesia , and Vietnam . I fed workers in Canada where the lead, silicon, and copper came from, and workers in South Africa where the Chromium and Palladium came from. I fed workers in Germany and France where the glass for the windows came from. I fed Stephanie (the woman who drove the semi truck that brought my Raptor to the dealership) and her partner . I also fed Rick (the district manager). I fed Laurence and Deborah (the interns who do the paperwork for the Ford dealership I bought the truck from). I fed Luis (the janitor at the dealership) and his son. I fed Kelly and Jamie (the car salesmen who sold me the vehicle) and their families. Every time I fill up on gas, I feed Yvonne and her parents, and Luther (the employees at the gas station), and Aaron (the Shell truck driver who fills up the underground tanks at he station) and his three kids. That’s not to even mention the entire upstream supply chain for the gasoline. All of the materials for my truck had to be mined and refined, and jobs were created in order to do that. They then had to be transported, either by road, rail, boat, or air. The parts were then made in one of countless factories across America and in other countries, before final assembly in Michigan. At each of the steps along the way, people were employed through my purchase.\nI’m not trying to tell you that I single-handedly fed these hundreds of thousands of people in dozens of countries just by buying my expensive truck. But when close to 8 million cars every year are built and transported around the world, then sold in the USA alone, it’s consumers who are paying and feeding all of these workers, and the entrepreneurs who started the companies who enable the jobs.",

      "text": "Remember Top Gear? Rory Reid Did A Great Review Of Ford's Focus RS | By Share While the disaster that was Top Gear Season 23 has left a sour taste in everyone’s mouth, there were still a number of interesting segments from the series, particularly those presented by Rory Reid and Chris Harris. One of the best from the former was a review of the potent Ford Focus RS, arguably the most exciting hot hatch to launch in recent memory. Now, we can relive that review and before you ask, yes, it is worth watching again. The review starts off with Reid testing out the RS on some exciting tarmac and gravel back roads before he heads onto the Top Gear test track to test out the ‘controversial’ Drift mode. A comparison between the Honda Civic Type and Mercedes-AMG A45 then comes, all in drifty, rain-soaked madness. All three models provide incredible driving thrills, but for Reid, the Focus RS is the best of the three. Do you agree? Or would you rather the Civic Type R or A45? VIDEO",

      "text": "Ogier tests M-Sport Ford ahead of 2017 decision 2,749 views By: Jamie Klein , News Editor 25/11/2016 04:06 Four-time WRC champion Sebastien Ogier has tested M-Sport's Ford Fiesta RS ahead of his decision about where he will drive in 2017. \nThe Frenchman tried out the Cumbrian-built machine on Friday morning at the Walters Arena rally complex in Wales, where team boss Malcolm Wilson was present. \nOgier only drove for the morning, with DMACK Ford driver Ott Tanak taking over in the afternoon. \nIt follows the test Ogier undertook with Toyota on Wednesday in Catalunya as the 32-year-old weighs up his 2017 options in the wake of Volkswagen's pull-out. \nM-Sport has made it clear it is willing to pull out all the stops to sign Ogier, who has indicated he wants to test all four 2017 WRC cars before making a decision. \nHowever, Hyundai has already stated it has no room its line-up for the reigning champion, while Citroen has said it wants him to commit to a deal first before allowing him to try out the C3 WRC.

      "text": "McFarland, McGahn to join Trump administration McFarland part of Nixon, Ford, Reagan administrations Author: By Eugene Scott CNN Published On: Nov 25 2016 12:30:55 PM CST Updated On: Nov 25 2016 04:09:04 PM CST Gage Skidmore, via Wikimedia Commons (CNN) - \nNational security analyst KT McFarland will join President-elect Donald Trump's administration as the deputy national security adviser, the transition announced Friday, also naming Donald McGahn, general counsel for Trump's campaign, to be White House counsel. Related Content Donald Trump's most provocative quotes \n\"I am proud that KT has once again decided to serve our country and join my national security team,\" the President-elect said in a statement. \"She has tremendous experience and innate talent that will complement the fantastic team we are assembling, which is crucial because nothing is more important than keeping our people safe.\" \nTrump's choice for national security adviser, Michael Flynn, first announced the decision Friday on Twitter. \n\"So proud & honored to have KT McFarland as part of our National Security team. She will help us #MAGA,\" Flynn tweeted from his verified account, using a hashtag that is an acronym for Trump's campaign slogan \"Make America great again.\" \nTrump's transition team announced a week ago that Flynn was its choice to be national security adviser. \nMcFarland, a frequent critic of President Barack Obama's foreign policy, praised Trump's outlook. \n\"Nobody has called foreign policy right more than President-elect Trump, and he gets no credit for it. I'm honored and humbled that he has asked me to be part of his team,\" she said in the statement. \nFormer Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, the 2000 Democratic Party vice presidential nominee, praised Trump's move. \n\"In asking KT McFarland to become his deputy national security adviser, President-elect Trump has brought to the top ranks of his administration one of our country's most experienced, informed, and wise foreign policy and national security experts\" he said. \nMcFarland, who ran for a US Senate seat in New York in the 2006 Republican primary, is currently a Fox News national security analyst and was an aide in the administrations of Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. \nMcFarland often pointed to Trump as the best candidate to improve America's relationships with its allies. \n\"Nobody thinks American foreign policy in the last fifteen years has been a success. Our adversaries, and even some of our allies, think we're a spent power, mired in decadence, self-indulgence and smug self-satisfaction,\" she wrote on FoxNews.com. \n\"Right now, things look grim for American leadership and the American dream. But we've been in scrapes like this before and recovered,\" McFarland added. \nMcGhan will also be assistant to the President in the administration. \n\"Don has a brilliant legal mind, excellent character and a deep understanding of constitutional law,\" Trump said in his statement. \"He will play a critical role in our administration, and I am grateful that he is willing to serve our country at such a high-level capacity.\" \nMcGahn, a partner at Jones Day in Washington, has a legal career spanning two decades. He is a former chairman for the Federal Election Commission. \n\"President-elect Trump is a bold leader committed to draining the swamp in Washington and restoring economic prosperity and security. I look forward to serving the American public in this role,\" he said. \nTrump's soon-to-be chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said Sunday that incoming counsel will be responsible for ensuring there are no conflicts of interest with the real estate mogul's businesses. Critics have already flagged would-be issues from conversations Trump and his children have had with world leaders since his election and the effect those conversations could have on Trump's global businesses. \nObama also told reporters he told President-elect Trump to make sure he had a strong counsel's office to avoid ethical controversies. \nCopyright 2016 by CNN NewSource .

      "text": "Large \nStart counting down the days, because Ford will reveal its latest Fiesta next week. \nPer Automotive News , the reveal is happening in Germany on Nov. 29. We’ll also see an updated mobility strategy and new fuel-saving tech, as well as new commercial vehicles revealed alongside the Fiesta – which, by the way, is expected in North America for 2018. \nRumours suggest the new Fiesta will still be underpinned by the outgoing platform, but will be spruced up in the refinement and driving dynamics department. Count on seeing more active safety features and upgraded interior bits, such as better materials and sharper displays. \nThere could even be a luxurious ‘Vignale’ variant offered for the European market, though that model is unlikely to cross the Atlantic. We’ll bring you full details on the new Fiesta next week. You may also like... ",

In Europe, Ford may offer a luxurious Vignale variant of the next Fiesta, British magazine Auto Express reported, citing Ford of Europe sales and marketing officials. \nU.S. sales of the Fiesta have dropped sharply this year -- 27 per cent through October -- as low gasoline prices entice consumers to buy larger vehicles, notably crossovers. \nSales of the vehicle have also plummeted in Canada, where the automaker has sold 2,771 in the first 10 months of 2016, down from 4,746 in the same time frame a year ago. \nFord builds the Fiesta in Germany, Mexico, Thailand, Vietnam, Venezuela, Taiwan and India. The U.S. version of the Fiesta will continue to be made at Ford's factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, a company spokeswoman said. \nFord sells the Fiesta, launched in 1976, in a number of markets around the globe.

He also announced that Marcus Peters, Dontari Poe, Steven Nelson, Kendall Reyes and Derrick Johnson are listed as questionable for the game.\nReid says no matter who is out there, he expects them to take advantage of the opportunity to help the team win.\n“I think anything less than that is wrong. You have an opportunity to get in a challenge and you challenge and challenge, and you have to have a short memory in certain cases. Learn from your mistakes and move on. That’s how we roll so if you are hurt, get better and get yourself back in,” he said.\nPeters did practice on Friday, but his status is still questionable for Sunday’s game.\nCopyright 2016 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)

      "text": "by Jack Browne 9h ago Peter G. Aiken / Getty Images Sport / Getty \nKansas City Chiefs linebacker Dee Ford - who's tied for the NFL lead in sacks - and wide receiver Jeremy Maclin have been ruled out for Sunday's game against the Denver Broncos with hamstring and groin injuries, respectively. \nIt will be Maclin's third consecutive missed game. \nThe former first-rounder Ford has experienced a breakout campaign after two disappointing seasons. \nThe loss of two of their most impactful players could be pivotal in the prime time matchup, which could go a long way to deciding who wins the AFC West.",

Ford was the first and last player to find the end zone on bookended 23-yard touchdowns in front of an energized crowd. \n“We like we could win the line of scrimmage on offense and our offensive line completely dominated this game from start to finish,” Opelika coach Brian Blackmon said. “Weldrin Ford just kept pounding that rock all night. Our run was the difference in a difference standpoint.” \nOnce Opelika took a 24-10 lead into the halftime locker room, it was clearly time to hand the ball to No. 26 in a home jersey and Ford sealed the victory with a pair of touchdown runs. \nFord, who has suffered multiple knee injuries in his career, has 1,684 yards and 24 touchdowns this season. He leads Opelika to the Class 6A state championship game for the first time since 2012. \n“To know that my last high school football game on my home field is a win means so much to me,” Ford said. “We’re not done though. I promise you I’ll be in our field house tomorrow watching film doing everything I can for one more victory.” \nHowever, it was a goal-line stand late in the third quarter that flipped the momentum and led to the victory for the host Bulldogs. Park Crossing (13-1) was unable to punch it in after having a two attempts from the 2-yard-line but on both plays quarterback Malik Cunningham was on the sidelines standing next to Thunderbirds head coach Smitty Grider. \nAfter the defensive stand, Opelika marched 99 yards in just nine plays culminating with a touchdown pass from John David Worth to his favorite target Jaleel Heard to give Opelika a 31-10 lead with just over two minutes left in the third quarter. Worth fit the pass in between double coverage and Heard made an impressive bobble and catch near the sideline for the score. \n“That goal line stand is not something new for us,” Blackmon said. “Our kids just don’t just bow down if you get the ball inside the 5-yard-line. You may score but we’re going to make you earn it.” \nCunningham, who was having trainers loosen his left shoulder throughout the contest, finished 14-of-30 passing for 285 yards and had three total touchdowns (two passing, one rushing), but he wasn’t on the field in arguably Park Crossing’s two most critical plays. \n“That would’ve got us within a score right there so that sequence was huge,” Grider said. “We didn’t execute down there and the better team won tonight.” \nOpelika’s defensive line did a solid job keeping Cunningham, who has verbally committed to Louisville, inside the pocket and only allowed him to beat the Bulldogs with his right arm. With Opelika up 34-10 in the fourth quarter, Cunningham’s desperation comeback attempt included a 23-yard touchdown pass and a 70-yard touchdown strike to Josh Knight. \n“We knew Malik was going to make plays because he’s such a talented young man but we had to figure out a way to contain him a little bit,” Blackmon said. “Our defensive coaches did an excellent job of mixing up when we blitzed him and when we held up to keep him in the pocket.” \nOpelika didn’t punt in the first half and couldn’t have asked for more in the two total times it was forced to do so all game as it pinned Park Crossing inside the 1-yard-line each time. \nOpelika will face Ramsay next week at Jordan-Hare Stadium for the Class 6A state championship after Ramsey defeated Austin 25-14. The Bulldogs will be searching for the school’s first state title just 12 miles from its campus. 2 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "During a 3-day sales campaign a Ford Dealership netted $10,878 in new car sales as a direct result of adopting Mojo Global’s All-In-One Multi-Channel Predictable Auto Sales Lead Generation System.\nNovember 26, 2016 /MM-prReach/ —\n“Sales for the top three auto makers selling in the U.S. slipped in July as the strong growth rate that defined the past six years slows to a crawl, another indication the industry is entering its first sustained plateau since the decade leading to the financial crisis,” according to John D. Stoll and Christina Rogers in an article published by The Wall Street Journal: July Auto Sales Stoke Fears of Market Plateau.\nAuto dealers are solving this problem by implementing Mojo Global’s All-in-One Automated Multi-Channel Auto Sales Lead Generation System that can be scaled to any size car dealership.

Employing Mojo Global’s System is like having an automated marketing sales force that doesn’t sleep without the payroll expense.\nRecently, a Ford dealership ran a 3-day campaign using Mojo Global’s Auto Sales Lead Generation System with substantial results. Mojo’s System generated 299 inbound phone calls (72 calls in 1 day) of which 252 were unique resulting in new net sales of $10,878.\nMojo’s System allows an auto sales team to focus on closing deals and takes care of the consistent follow up necessary to generate predictable leads.\n• Struggling with follow-up\n• Hate cold calling\n• Want predictable streams of incoming leads\n• Are 1,000% committed but need more sales and or customers\n• Is it difficult to get the sales team to make outbound calls\nSchedule a Complimentary “Predictable Auto Sales Lead Generation Made Easy” Consultation by contacting automotive@mojoglobal.com, by calling 480-339-4300 or Start a free trial at mojoautomotive.com.

      "text": "Ford's Interactive Calendars Indicate When a Driver is Coming Home By: Laura McQuarrie - Nov 26, 2016 References: fordcaminhoes.br & prexamples Over the years, there are plenty of interesting and innovative interactive calendars that have been created, but one of them are quite as unique as this creation from Ford called the 'Calendário da Saudade.' \"Saudade\" is one of those words that is identified as an untranslatable one, but it is said to be an emotional state of longing, melancholy or nostalgia for something or someone. This word is characteristic of the Portuguese and Brazilian temperament and was used as the central theme for a Ford stunt created for the Brazilian market. The Calendário da Saudade takes the form of a cardboard truck that connects to a GPS device of a real ford truck. When this connected calendar is used within the home, a family is able to see when the driver of a Ford truck is within one kilometer of home, as the truck-shaped calendar will begin to honk and have its headlights blink.",

      "text": "TAMPA — Before dawn on a humid morning last August, Rob Padgett turned his Ford Expedition onto East Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard just as a single headlight suddenly appeared in his rearview mirror.\nThe vehicle closed on him fast. Padgett figured the driver would pass him. And he did, but not in the way Padgett expected.\nA battered, dark-colored pickup truck tore through the grassy shoulder on his right, cut back into the lane and skidded to a halt. Padgett slammed on his brakes to avoid a collision.\nSeconds later, the pickup driver appeared in the glow of Padgett's headlights — a burly, bald man shouting threats and waving his arms as he walked toward the SUV.\nPadgett, a 42-year-old father of four on his way to work in Zephyrhills, grabbed his handgun from a cupholder in the door panel. He warned the stranger he was armed and told him to get back in his truck.\nPadgett didn't know that the angry driver was Gary Lynn Durham, a 40-year-old lawn care worker who had served prison time for killing a man in an earlier fit of road rage.\nBut he knew he felt threatened.\n\"The only thing I was thinking was he wants to kill me and I really love my wife, so I've got to get home.\"\nThe man was almost to Padgett's window.\nHe had to make a decision.\n•••\nPadgett was 10 the first time he fired a handgun. He was taught by his father, a sheriff's deputy in the Savannah, Ga., area.\n\"He believed if you take away the curiosity, then you take away a lot of the danger,\" Padgett said earlier this month as he and wife Brenda sat at the dining room table of their Valrico home.\nIt was Padgett's first interview since the road rage incident. A light hanging above the table made his ice-blue eyes glimmer. His salt-and-pepper hair was cut close, his goatee neatly trimmed.\nPadgett got his concealed carry permit after serving nearly three years in the U.S. Army. He didn't have to shoot anyone while in the service, and, after he got his permit, he didn't expect to use his gun in altercation.\nAt 6-foot, 265 pounds, Padgett could hold his own in a fight but always tried to talk his way out of trouble. He had considered scenarios where he might not be able to. Maybe he'd walk in on an armed robbery, or happen upon someone in danger.\nPadgett also assumed he might have to fire in less than ideal conditions, so he used quarters to draw circles on a target and tried to hit the mark by firing with his non-dominant left hand.\nSpending time at the gun range was a way to decompress from the week and bond with his sons, now 16 and 19. He told them carrying a gun was a responsibility and, in a way, a burden.\n\"You're carrying an obligation to be the last person to respond. You have to always be thinking about confrontations and situations, and it's exhausting. Sometimes I would rather not carry in some ways because I don't want to have to think about it.\"\nBut the desire to be prepared outweighed that burden.\nOn the morning of Aug. 10, his Springfield Armory .40-caliber semi-automatic pistol sat in its usual place, in the cup holder on his driver's side door.\n•••\nPadgett left home a few minutes late that day. It was the first day of school and his youngest son was dragging his feet, but Padgett got him to the bus stop in time.\nAs he drove north on Forbes Road, Padgett chatted with his stepfather by phone on his Bluetooth headset. Instead of taking his usual Interstate 4 route, he made a last-minute decision to turn onto Dr. King boulevard with plans to stop for coffee in Plant City. It was about 6:25 a.m., half an hour before sunrise.\nA former firefighter with Hillsborough County Fire Rescue, Padgett works for a construction company, driving an 80-ton truck moving heavy equipment to and from out-of-state job sites. His commercial driver's license is his livelihood so he drives \"like an old lady.\"\nThe rest of this account is based on Padgett's recollection and the Hillsborough Sheriff's Office investigation report.\nWhen the headlight appeared in his rearview mirror, Padgett eased off the gas pedal to make it easier for the vehicle to pass him. But there were oncoming headlights ahead. A Mazda pickup with a headlight out suddenly appeared on Padgett's right, cut him off and stopped abruptly.\nPadgett stood on his brake pedal and nearly slammed into the truck's bumper. With an uneasy feeling, he shifted into reverse and backed up with plans to go around the truck, but headlights appeared in the distance behind him, so he stopped. His driver door handle was less than three car lengths from the driver door handle of the truck.\nAt the same time, the pickup driver got out and started walking toward him. He was about 5-foot-10 and muscular, wearing an orange long-sleeve shirt, dark-colored pants and work boots.\n\"He just had this rage on his face,\" Padgett recalled. \"He looked like I had just run over his kid.\"\nI'm going to kick your a--, the man shouted.\nPadgett told Durham to get back in his car, but he continued to approach. Padgett warned that he was armed.\nI don't give a f --- if you have a gun. I'm going to kick your a--.\nPadgett warned him again, then drew his gun with his left hand and pointed it out the driver-side window. He warned Durham he'd shoot.\nI'm going to f kill you.\nHe was almost to Padgett's driver-side mirror.\nAt that moment, Durham appeared to reach toward his waist.\nPadgett squeezed the trigger once.\nI can't believe you shot me.\nDurham staggered backward and fell to the pavement in front of Padgett's Expedition.\n•••\nPadgett was on the phone with his stepfather the whole time.\nOh my God, I just shot this guy, Padgett told him. Call 911.\nPadgett called out to Durham: Are you armed? Are you going to hurt me?\nNo answer.\nWhen he walked over and saw Durham writhing on the ground, blood flowing from a bullet wound in the center of his chest, Padgett called 911, too. He began to sob as he told the dispatcher what happened.\n\"I had to shoot him! He wouldn't stop!\"\nHe kneeled down and touched the man's neck. No pulse, and he wasn't breathing. He pumped Durham's chest but knew it was too late.\n\"Do you think he's beyond help, sir?\" the dispatcher asked.\n\"Yes,\" he said, weeping.\nPadgett remembers leaning against the deputy's patrol car, looking down at his bloody hands and sobbing some more.\n\"As a firefighter, I was very proud of being a lifesaver,\" he said. \"To have to take that kind of action was so contrary to who I am. I remember just the weight of it starting to settle on me.\"\nThen it was time to answer the detectives' questions.\n•••\nSitting in a cramped interview room at the Sheriff's Office on Falkenburg Road, Padgett told detectives he didn't know what set off Durham. The men had no interaction before Durham passed him.\nWhat puzzled him most is why Durham kept coming even after he showed his gun.\n\"I can't wrap my head around that,\" he said during the recorded interview, his voice breaking and his face reddening. \"All he had to do was go back to his car.\"\nDetectives asked the obvious question: Why not just drive away?\nWith traffic coming behind him and in front of him, Padgett said, he thought about going around on the right but worried about getting stuck. Once he stopped backing up, his eyes were fixed on the angry, rapidly approaching stranger.\n\"I just felt stuck and everything unfolded, and escape didn't seem like an option anymore.\"\nPadgett told detectives Durham's brazenness led him to believe he might be armed, too. Then he appeared to reach toward his waistband.\nOther motorists drove up on the scene but investigators found no witnesses who saw the shooting. One witness said Padgett looked like \"an undercover cop\" as he stood behind his door, gun trained on the man on the ground. A school bus driver who passed by remarked how calm Padgett looked at that point.\n\"I felt the strongest level of fear that I have ever felt in my life, and it triggered something in me to know that this will not end well,\" Padgett told the Times . \"But right when I pulled the trigger, I had a calmness. I had a peace, that I knew I had to that.\"\nInvestigators did not find a weapon on or near Durham. But they soon learned that Padgett's account of the man's behavior sounded eerily similar to another road rage incident that left a man dead and sent Durham to prison.\n•••\nIn October 2001, Durham turned in front of motorist Timothy James Gibbs at the intersection of N Armenia and W Linebaugh avenues. Durham followed Gibbs into a parking lot, they got out and argued. Durham punched Gibbs in the face, a Tampa police report said.\nGibbs fell and hit his head on concrete. Durham got back in his car and drove off. Gibbs died days later from a brain hemorrhage and skull fracture.\nDurham was convicted of manslaughter in 2002 and served about 10 years in prison. It was his third and longest prison stint, after previous convictions for aggravated assault, grand theft and trafficking in stolen property, state records show. He was released in 2012 and was on probation at the time of his death.\nAccording to the Sheriff's Office report, investigators found a potential clue tucked between the driver's seat and the console — an empty package labeled \"super strong incense.\"\nKnown as synthetic marijuana or spice, the herbal material has been sprayed with chemicals that behave in ways similar to THC, the active ingredient in marijuana. But it can be 100 times more potent than pot and cause erratic — and sometimes violent — behavior.\nA toxicology screening showed only caffeine in Durham's system. The Sheriff's Office did not ask the Hillsborough Medical Examiner's Office to screen for synthetic marijuana, which is typically difficult to detect because it contains many compounds, said Dr. Julia Pearson, chief toxicologist with the medical examiner.\nDurham's widow, Heather, did not respond to interview requests for this story. In August, she told the Times her husband was a kind, generous man who wasn't defined by his past.\n\"I don't know what happened this time, who was the aggressor or if both people were at fault,\" Durham said then. \"In my mind it doesn't matter because he died over something stupid. It's not going to bring him back.\"\nDetectives told him if he'd gotten out of his SUV, Durham probably would have hurt or killed him, Padgett said. Criminal charges seemed unlikely, but he would have to wait two months for the Hillsborough State Attorney's Office to decide.\nUntil then, he lived in a state of uncertainty, wondering if deputies would knock on his door or show up at work to arrest him.\n\"I think if you're not questioning whether you did the right thing, there's something wrong with you because it should not be natural to take another life. It should make you second-guess everything you've done.\"\nPadgett's account is the rare case that aligns perfectly with Florida's divisive stand your ground law, which states that an individual met with the threat of violence need not retreat before responding with force, said Charles H. Rose III, director of the Center for Excellence in Advocacy at Stetson University College of Law in Tampa.\n\"It's in that narrow lane where the use of force made common sense, was justified by law and apparently was the only option available,\" Rose said.\nBut Padgett could also make a solid argument for traditional self-defense, which does require retreat when possible, Rose said.\nThe case's lead detective, Edward Remia, declined an interview request. Hillsborough State Attorney Mark Ober's office declined a request to interview the prosecutor who reviewed the case.\nLast month, Ober sent a letter to the Sheriff's Office. The evidence, he wrote, \"is insufficient to refute Mr. Padgett's claim that he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot Mr. Durham. No criminal charges shall be filed.\"\n•••\nIn the weeks that followed, Padgett found himself looking over his shoulder, wondering if someone who knew Durham would come looking for him. His concerns made him decline to be photographed for this report\nFriends and loved ones tried to comfort him by talking about divine intervention, about being placed at that intersection by God to protect others who might have crossed paths with Durham that morning. Padgett said he eventually came to believe that.\nBut he had nightmares nearly every night. In one, Durham tried to attack him in his sleep. Padgett awoke thrashing at wife Brenda, who had tried to rouse him. He snapped at people and lost his temper over little things.\nTaking a life in an act of violence can trigger post-traumatic stress disorder, said Dr. Glenn Currier, professor and chair of psychiatry at the University of South Florida Health Morsani College of Medicine. It's a common cause of the disorder in combat veterans.\nPatients experience flashbacks, avoid circumstances that could remind them of the trauma, struggle with anger or grief and feel nervous or jumpy.\n\"The sooner you get care for something like this, the easier it is to contain,\" Currier said. \"If you don't, it can last a lifetime.\"\nPadgett's wife Brenda, his church pastor and friends who saw combat in the military urged him to seek counseling. But he was embarrassed and afraid to reach out. Then, one night, he had a \"meltdown\" and asked his wife and sons to leave.\n\"I didn't trust myself,\" he said. \"It was like I was trapped in an out-of-control robot. I was fighting a lot of demons inside of me and was not myself. I was pretending to be okay. It was terrorizing me, and eventually it was just too much.\"\nBrenda and the couple's sons stayed with their daughter for a few weeks. She said it was one of the best decisions they made.\n\"He needed his space to be able to feel, to release, and to figure out who he was now because of this situation without having to worry about saying the wrong or doing the wrong thing.\"\nPadgett said his counselor easily identified his PTSD.\n\"When you shoot someone and see their face and put your hands on them to save their life, it's very personal, and it hurts you,\" he said.\n\"I realized I had a choice. I could either let him win from the grave and accomplish what he set out to do that morning, or I could rise above it.\"\nPadgett choked up as he recalled explaining to his kids that some part of him would likely be broken for a long time.\n\"God reminds me through it that you're okay, you feel that hurt because you're still that guy who loves people, who cares about people, and that's why I'm letting it hurt you,'' he said. \"I could have been turned into a monster by it.\"\nHe thought about reaching out to Durham's widow and family but decided against it.\n\"They're victims. His choices dumped all this on them. I wanted to say I'm sorry they're suffering from an unimaginable grief, but I was forced to do what I did, and I also have a wife and family.\n\"Unfortunately, only one man was going home that day and it had to be me.\"\n•••\nOne day last month, Padgett stood in front of about 60 men and talked about anger.\nHe'd been asked before the shooting to speak at a men's conference hosted by his church, the nondenominational Palms in Brandon. After the incident, he changed his topic to use the experience as a warning.\nPadgett told the men that Durham's rage, driving him to shoot, uncovered a latent anger that was probably rooted in Padgett's childhood. He said he had an abusive father, a U.S. Army veteran scarred by combat in the Viet Nam War. He told them not to keep their emotions corked.\nThe shooting also has Padgett considering a career change.\nHis goal is to become certified by the National Rifle Association to give advanced firearms training classes. He wants to teach people how to go through a mental checklist, even when they're frightened, in deciding whether to pull the trigger. And he wants to tell them how to navigate the aftermath if they do.\n\"If people react out of emotion, they're going to make a bad choice most of the time,\" he said.\n\"If they respond out of training or instinct, they're going to do the right thing nine times out of 10. And that may be keeping it in the holster.\"\nContact Tony Marrero at tmarrero@tampabay.com or (813) 226-3374. Follow @tmarrerotimes.",

      "text": "  Why The Ford F-350 Super Duty Makes More Sense Than An F-150 Limited by Jay Traugott   Size matters - as does value. It’s pretty incredible just how expensive the Ford F-150 has become. Take the F-150 Limited, for example. Base price for that top trim is $59,600. Nearly fully loaded, you’re looking at a price tag of over $68,000. For an F-150. Insane, right? Yeah, kind of, and that made us wonder whether its big brother, the F-350 Super Duty might be the better overall value. We recently spent some time with a 2017 F-350 Super Duty and were impressed with it for a number of reasons. For starters, our tester came powered by the optional 6.7-liter Power Stroke turbo diesel V8 with a grand total of 440 hp and 925 lb-ft of torque . Yes. 925 lb-ft of twist. That’s not a typo. Along with adding the fifth wheel (it just looks cooler), our F-350 had a maximum towing capacity of 21,000 lbs. and a maximum payload of 6,540 lbs. The interior also wasn’t too shabby. There’s an 8-inch touchscreen with Sync 3, dual-zone automatic climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and more than enough room for human beings, a couple of canine friends, and stuff in general. All told, our tester stickered for $68,115. Yeah, literally the same as the F-150 Platinum, which isn’t nearly as badass. Special thanks to Future Ford of Sacramento for letting us film the car.",

      "text": "Back to Top Post by retroade on Feb 19, 2015 18:53:07 GMT Awful cars, the worst of American styling and no room whatsoever inside. I remember a football awayday in one going to Sheffield United from Ipswich, about 4 hours each way. 4 adults was claustrophobic to say the least. Chap near me has always ran at least one, normally has two on his front drive. He must be mad. Probably decent on an oval though so bring on more Probe bangers. My mate bought one as he was obsessed with the Area 51 ad campaign when the car was released. Silly boy. Never buy a car just because you like the ad campaign. The MX6 on the other hand looks luverly! Basically the same car in the hands of a decent designer. Ford and Mazda shared a lot of platforms / drivetrains in the 90s. The Mazda Bongo Friendee/Ford Freda also shared the 2.5l V6.",

It’s hard driving new cars all the time; sometimes you just gotta go for a run in a turd.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Genesis Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo That’s more or less how we decided the time had come for another beater challenge. Past such budget-burners have featured ice racing, a sort of street-car Olympics, and a cross-country scavenger hunt. For this installment, we decided to buy old 4x4s and fix them up so we could break them again. Pairs of editors were given $1500 budgets, which they promptly blew, and we devised a series of off-road abuses. The scoring was, to put it mildly, improvised.\nReviews editor Josh Jacquot and your author immediately ­dismissed rationality. “We could buy a pretty nice Cherokee for $1500,” Jacquot observed, “but that’d be like buying a Camry.”\n© JARED GALL The Battle of the Off-Road Beaters: Ford F-150 Custom vs. Geo Tracker, Jeep Cherokee, Land Rover Discovery Agreeing that insanity was the surest path to victory, we found a ’79 Ford F-150 missing the bed, fenders, and hood. The hood was not actually missing, but the seller wanted to keep it because he was using it as a sled to pull his kids around behind a snowmobile. Our test drive suggested that gravity and friction were standing in for threaded fasteners, as no part of the truck seemed to be securely attached to any other. But it rode on 44-inch tires and looked like a Mad Max prop, so we towed it home $1500 poorer and fully agreed that we had already won.\nTriumphantly, we parked it in front of the office. As our co-workers debated how comfortable they were even standing near it, deputy editor Daniel Pund and I climbed aboard for a joyride. The Ford stalled 12 feet later, refused to restart, and wouldn’t take a jump. As we pushed it back into its parking space, the power-steering pump puked its fluid. Lucky for us, our landlord likes oil stains. At least, we hope he does, because he now has a panoply.\nWith more rock-crawling and dune-running experience than the rest of us combined, road-test editor Chris Benn and senior online editor Mike Sutton were early favorites, especially when they announced their intention to buy said “Camry.” They reasoned that when it comes to Jeep Cherokees, a late ’90s vintage would make the most sense, as it would be fitted with sturdier axles, plus airbags they could sell to pad the budget. But as Benn glanced over a Craigslist ad for an ’88 XJ, his seasoned eye caught something: lockable hubs on the front axle, not factory Cherokee equipment. The seller had neglected to mention in the ad that the Jeep sat on the burlier running gear from a ’79 Bronco, complete with shorter gears and locked front and rear differentials. In the cons column: The fuel tank had been relocated to the cargo area and fixed in place with fabric ratchet straps, the windshield was spider-webbed, and there was a distinct lack of doors. They snatched up their backwoods mash-up for $800.\n© Car and Driver 1979 Ford F-150 Custom Looking to maximize agility and minimize parts cost, Pund and assistant tech editor David Beard set their hearts on a Suzuki Samurai. They found one with an external roll cage that the seller told them “doesn’t look pretty, but that’s because I know it works.” That pitch apparently worked for other potential buyers, because it was sold out from under them. They found another that the seller said didn’t run so well because “it got stolen for a year and they didn’t take very good care of it.” Ultimately, the Pund/Beard team laid out $1200 for a 1990 Geo Tracker with a three-inch lift and an odo showing 130,000 miles. After a quick vacuuming, some Meguiar’s on the dash, and a loving exterior wash, it looked like an honest $3000 car—right up until your humble narrator did a cannonball onto the Tracker’s hood, because who needs a hood?\nOur leaking liabilities successfully registered and insured, we set our schedule: We’d trundle 60 miles west to Bundy Hill, a 350-acre gravel-pit-cum-off-road-park in Jerome, Michigan. After a few days for recuperation and repairs, we’d long-haul 220 miles northwest to the dunes at Silver Lake State Park along Lake Michigan.\nAnd then one morning we arrived at the office to find an old Land Rover, sans front bumper. Wanting in on the fun, creative director Darin Johnson had emailed a Craigslist link to editor-in-chief Alterman asking if he could dark-horse a Discovery into the competition. In retrospect, the one-word reply, “Boom,” might not have been permission so much as a prediction for the outcome. Rather than seek clarification from the boss, Johnson found and purchased a 2004 Disco near Chicago. While the rest of us ­worried about how many more heartbeats our rigs might have left, Johnson drove it the 300 miles home, then another 200 miles the ­following weekend visiting family in northern Michigan. It was there that it developed an ominous knock, requiring photo assistant Charley Ladd to rescue his teammate and tow the WasteLand Rover back to the office. And so began Car and Driver’s fourth ­quasi-periodic beater challenge.\n© Car and Driver 1990 Geo Tracker Formidable as Benn and Sutton’s Jeep might have been, it also seemed to have been parked in a bog at some point in its life and then disassembled and put back together while fully submerged. In rebuilding both axles, the team had to fabricate a tool to reach into the housings to scrape out all the mud. To check the fluid in their transfer case, they had to punch a screwdriver through a thick crust of Mother Earth inside the drain plug. But if any vehicle can run on equal parts oil and soil, it’s a Jeep.\nAnd if any team was going to resurrect a fossil, it would be Benn and Sutton. They rebuilt their front suspension, made a variety of components for the rear, modified the steering linkage, fabricated brackets to mount new seats to their rusty floor, and built a frame to attach belts to. In any contest of speed, knowledge and talent can sometimes offset a bigger budget.\nThe Jeep started off the cheapest but ended up costing the most: $2930, all in. (Features editor Jeff Sabatini, arbitrator for the contest, had initially decreed that wear and safety items wouldn’t be counted, but then changed his mind. We changed his title to “arbitrarian.”) At least they had a few freebies: A call to BFGood­rich turned up a set of All-Terrain KO2 tires for each vehicle, and Optima donated Red Top batteries for every competitor.\nIt came as little surprise that the Jeep was the most miserable to drive on the street, with its occupants donning rain suits, earplugs, and goggles on the damp drive to Bundy as if riding topside on an Alaskan pollock trawler. All were awed when shortly after their arrival, Benn crawled beneath the Cherokee with a hammer to shift the transfer case into low range, having run out of time to repair its damaged linkage.\n© Car and Driver 1988 Jeep Cherokee We started with dirt drags on a strip that had been reduced by an overnight downpour to more of a mud lake. Here, the Jeep ­finished last, its locked differentials clawing at the muck but its 4.0-liter straight-six reduced from its original 177 horsepower to the approximate output of a Lawnboy by the long-term ingestion of several cubic yards of dirt, possibly including the partial jawbone of a yet-undiscovered sauropod. At our next stop, a timed obstacle course, the John Deere Jeep missed a turn and plunged into a hood-deep water hazard that Bundy Hill’s owner had cautioned us about, predicting that none of our trucks could cross it. Not only did Benn and Sutton make it through, they somehow did so without getting soaked despite being in a vehicle with no doors. Fluid dynamics had finally turned in their favor.\nOn the second run, the welded front diff forced them to make a three-point turn on the course’s tightest corner, costing time. But upon completion, they scrambled with ease over a pile of concrete construction debris that we’d identified as a bonus obstacle.\nUnfortunately for the Jeep team, the light faded and the park closed before we hit any trails on which Toledo’s Thunder surely would have left at least a couple of its com­petitors behind. And their transfer case ground its internals back into raw material en route to Silver Lake, leaving them with a DNF and a front-wheel-drive rig that Sabatini gleefully christened the “Two-by-Four.” A Cherokee, even one less crazy than this, might have won this contest based on potential, but, as Sutton noted, “Maybe that ‘Open 24 Hours’ sign on the hood was an omen we shouldn’t have ignored.”\nAs Jacquot steered our truck around a deer carcass in the seller’s yard on the test drive, the dude pointed out a pair of sandhill cranes on a nearby hilltop, noting, “They call them the sirloin of the sky.” Shazam! Our truck had a name. “Sirloin of the Sky” got shortened to “Sirloin,” and then road warrior Max Mortimer inserted a space, making it “Sir Loin.” We traced Sir Loin’s various electrical problems to crusty connections and a bunch of wiring that led nowhere. We improved a stalling issue by advancing the timing to an indicated 40 degrees before top dead center—a guess, actually, due to a spun crank damper, a loose timing chain, or both.\n© Car and Driver 2004 Land Rover Discovery Sir Loin’s 44s were not only dry-rotted—a lookup of their DOT number revealed that they popped from their molds in 1994—but, at 18 inches, they were so wide that the inside-shoulder tread blocks grabbed the frame and shook the whole truck at anything more than half steering lock. The largest KO2 is just 35 inches, and so Interco, manufacturer of the original Super Swamper, provided a fresh set of 39.5x13.5s. Jacquot hoped that these lighter, smaller tires would give our axles and driveshafts a better chance at survival. Each wheel and tire still weighed 125 pounds, though, giving us well in excess of a quarter-ton of unsprung weight.\nGenerous spacing of the Super Swampers’ gnarly tread blocks gave us unmatched traction off-road. In the drags, Sir Loin finished just 0.1 second behind the Land Rover in spite of eventually logging an on-road zero-to-60-mph time 8.2 seconds slower.\nThe springs that lofted the truck so high had the compressibility of tungsten. We drove more slowly over the office speed bumps than we normally do in Dodge Vipers and Ferraris, lest we shatter a spinal disc. Hammering over logs and rocks in the obstacle course, the front and rear axles took turns trying to send us into an endo tumble. At any moment the front axle threatened to fold under and send our chins into the dirt, but it held up and instead we won that test handily.\nAmped up on adrenaline and shocked to still have 33 distinct, intact vertebrae, we easily clambered over the construction debris at an entirely unreasonable pace. But our win cost us a body-mount bushing, which we replaced the next day with a few scraps of plywood plus some hockey pucks stolen from Beard’s office cubicle. On the other hand, the axle we sheared on an aggressive hill-climb required actual truck parts to fix.\n© Car and Driver 1979 Ford F-150 Custom, 2004 Land Rover Discovery, and 1990 Geo Tracker The F-150’s punishing ride made the dunes feel like an all-day car accident. We staged a three-way drag race that climbed and descended five towering dunes over nearly a mile. Sir Loin’s tracks through the whoop-de-dos in each trough were notable for the large gaps where the truck had been airborne. In between momentary blackouts and involuntary grunts, though, we never realized the truck had left the ground. Every bump felt like the Stockholm hitting the Andrea Doria. After a brief ride, Sabatini tumbled out of the truck and, rubbing his back, remarked: “Wow. There’s only one word for that: violent.”\nBut he jumped at the chance to climb back in to experience Sir’s unmatched water-fording capability. We eventually stopped testing water holes, instead simply charging in without worrying about the consequences. An air intake nearly six feet off the ground is empowering like that. But in our final scoring, water fording didn’t matter as much as having body panels or air conditioning. Seems arbitrary, no?\nBeard and Pund initially thought their trucklet just needed a tuneup. But when tests showed rampant leaking in all four cylinders and only 30 psi of compression in number three, the tuneup snowballed into an engine rebuild that consumed most of Beard’s downtime for two weeks. Its proud owners noted one important thing about Trackers: Parts are cheap. Exhaust valves for just $6. A muffler for $25. The engine-rebuild kit—including pistons, rings, bearings, oil pump, and timing belt—was $245. Crewman Beard noted that, at 70 mph, the 1.6-liter turns at 4100 rpm, surely making it the winner of the “lifetime engine revolutions” category.\nWith just 80 horsepower, more or less, after the rebuild, Pund and Beard were happy simply not to be in last place for Bundy’s mud drags. But then the Geo took second in the obstacle course, before any points were awarded for the extreme rock-crawling bonus pile. So Beard carefully picked his way over the mound, only scraping at the same point Sutton and Benn’s extreme Cherokee had. We had already noted the Geo’s impressive approach, departure, and breakover angles, but watching it creep up and over the jumbled concrete was a sight. This Japanese jeeplet is just a little under 12 feet long, and when rolling on 30-inch tires, much of its belly is rubber contact patch, giving it the approximate footprint of a leopard slug and the corresponding ability to ooze over nearly anything. And, with its short 87.0-inch wheelbase, the Geo was astoundingly maneuverable, a proper mountain mollusk. As Beard put it, “What the Miata is to the sports-car world, the Tracker is to the off-road world.” We agreed it was equivalently adorable, with the butched-up, lifted Geo winning the appearance vote.\nIn the vein of Sir Loin, Benn and Sutton had named the Jeep “Spare Rib.” After wowing everyone on the obstacle course, Beard christened his Geo the “Deathstalker Scorpion.” He was the only one who knew, without consulting Wiki, that the Deathstalker is in fact a really dangerous bug from the deserts of the Middle East.\nLikewise, the Geo held the potential to kill or maim. Even as Beard spun celebratory donuts in the mud next to the rock pile, the Tracker was starting to sag on its rusty body mounts. Over the course of two days at the Silver Lake sand dunes, whomping and slamming over crests and bumps, it ultimately settled so low that the tailgate wouldn’t open, as it had sunk below the top of the bumper. Recall, though, that Tracker parts are cheap. Beard has already located a whole new body for just $175.\nLike the Geo, the Rover looked relatively tame, but it was not to be underestimated, especially if you happened to be cocooned in its leather-lined seven-seat interior. While the Jeep and Ford were missing a significant number of body panels, the daggy Disco still had frosty A/C, a power driver’s seat (plus frozen motors beneath the passenger’s seat), and wood dash trim. The only wood in any other competitor was clamped between hockey pucks in Sir Loin’s makeshift body mount.\n© Car and Driver 1979 Ford F-150 Custom The ticking that sounded so much like rod-knock turned out to be a new power-­steering pump, which was replaced after being identified as defective. Johnson and Ladd also replaced an ignition coil and the plug wires, along with multiple oxygen sensors. In a demonstration of the team’s priorities, they allocated $150 for a new stereo. Another ticking noise believed to be a damaged pushrod endured throughout the test, though, earning the Land Rover the nickname “Timex.” The main thing these utes are really good at is inspiring nicknames.\nThe metronomic soundtrack didn’t slow Timex much. Its 10.9-second zero- to-60 time is just 0.8 slower than what we originally recorded in 2001. Both at Bundy Hill and at the dunes, on hills where the Arabian Insect struggled with power and Sir Loin struggled with power and occupant self-preservation, the Rover’s only concern was clearance. But it had enough grunt that, were it snagged on a crest or submerged rock, it would simply power through.\nIt was easily the fastest, topping out at 99 mph where the Deathstalker Geo hit only 78 and Sir Loin wobbled to a terrifying 71 (­terrifying because the F-150’s first stop from 70 mph took 450 feet). Spare Rib, the junker Jeep, tentatively wandered up to an observed 65 mph while it was dining on its transfer case, but certain life-insurance stipulations prevented us from taking the front-drive Cherokee to the track for official verification.\nJohnson and Ladd won the drive to Silver Lake by more than a half-hour, cool and comfortable, texting out a gloating pic of a sweaty beer pitcher while the rest of the field plodded across the state in sweltering August heat. When Sabatini suggested they use their time to do some reconnaissance (expecting the art boss to be concerned with photos), Johnson replied, “Find beer: Check.” Awhile later came another picture of him golfing. “Find golf course: Check. Fore!” Deep karmic thunderclouds were building, we were certain.\nLooking to create an off-road analogue to Lightning Lap, we mapped out a three-mile course around the perimeter of the ­Silver Lake dunes. The trucks set off at one-minute intervals to avoid the temptation to swap paint, but the field immediately bunched up when all three failed to crest the first dune, backing down and charging back up past one another. Sir Loin left first, thrashing its occupants around like salt in a shaker for a 7-minute, 37-second lap. One minute later, the Geo hadn’t materialized, giving the towering Ford the lead and presumed victory. Another 40 seconds later, the Tracker still missing, the Disco nosed over the last crest, pushrod clacking furiously, and ripped down the final dune for the win with a 7:34. Karma had failed to avenge us. Its power and speed also made the Rover our overall winner, even as its relatively low ride height likely would have hindered it in a competition more biased toward serious rock crawling.\nBut just as Beard lined up a new Tracker body, Rovernaut Johnson has already purchased a lift kit. Jacquot and I have stolen more hockey pucks from Beard for our Sir Loin, and Benn is stockpiling parts for his munched transfer case. Our flotilla of off-road beaters delivered so much fun for the buck that all four have been purchased back from the company by staffers eager for more wheelin’. God willing.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "SHARE \nLike the Geo, the Rover looked relatively tame, but it was not to be underestimated, especially if you happened to be cocooned in its leather-lined seven-seat interior. While the Jeep and Ford were missing a significant number of body panels, the daggy Disco still had frosty A/C, a power driver’s seat (plus frozen motors beneath the passenger’s seat), and wood dash trim. The only wood in any other competitor was clamped between hockey pucks in Sir Loin’s makeshift body mount. \nThe ticking that sounded so much like rod-knock turned out to be a new power-­steering pump, which was replaced after being identified as defective. Johnson and Ladd also replaced an ignition coil and the plug wires, along with multiple oxygen sensors. In a demonstration of the team’s priorities, they allocated $150 for a new stereo. Another ticking noise believed to be a damaged pushrod endured throughout the test, though, earning the Land Rover the nickname “Timex.” The main thing these utes are really good at is inspiring nicknames. Top left: Johnson uses his Rover’s belly as a road grader, rounding off crests of mud and sand. \nThe metronomic soundtrack didn’t slow Timex much. Its 10.9-second zero- to-60 time is just 0.8 slower than what we originally recorded in 2001. Both at Bundy Hill and at the dunes, on hills where the Arabian Insect struggled with power and Sir Loin struggled with power and occupant self-preservation, the Rover’s only concern was clearance. But it had enough grunt that, were it snagged on a crest or submerged rock, it would simply power through. \nIt was easily the fastest, topping out at 99 mph where the Deathstalker Geo hit only 78 and Sir Loin wobbled to a terrifying 71 (­terrifying because the F-150’s first stop from 70 mph took 450 feet). Spare Rib, the junker Jeep, tentatively wandered up to an observed 65 mph while it was dining on its transfer case, but certain life-insurance stipulations prevented us from taking the front-drive Cherokee to the track for official verification. \nJohnson and Ladd won the drive to Silver Lake by more than a half-hour, cool and comfortable, texting out a gloating pic of a sweaty beer pitcher while the rest of the field plodded across the state in sweltering August heat. When Sabatini suggested they use their time to do some reconnaissance (expecting the art boss to be concerned with photos), Johnson replied, “Find beer: Check.” Awhile later came another picture of him golfing. “Find golf course: Check. Fore!” Deep karmic thunderclouds were building, we were certain. One of the rare moments when anyone in the Disco wished they were in the Ford. \nLooking to create an off-road analogue to Lightning Lap, we mapped out a three-mile course around the perimeter of the ­Silver Lake dunes. The trucks set off at one-minute intervals to avoid the temptation to swap paint, but the field immediately bunched up when all three failed to crest the first dune, backing down and charging back up past one another. Sir Loin left first, thrashing its occupants around like salt in a shaker for a 7-minute, 37-second lap. One minute later, the Geo hadn’t materialized, giving the towering Ford the lead and presumed victory. Another 40 seconds later, the Tracker still missing, the Disco nosed over the last crest, pushrod clacking furiously, and ripped down the final dune for the win with a 7:34. Karma had failed to avenge us. Its power and speed also made the Rover our overall winner, even as its relatively low ride height likely would have hindered it in a competition more biased toward serious rock crawling. \nBut just as Beard lined up a new Tracker body, Rovernaut Johnson has already purchased a lift kit. Jacquot and I have stolen more hockey pucks from Beard for our Sir Loin, and Benn is stockpiling parts for his munched transfer case. Our flotilla of off-road beaters delivered so much fun for the buck that all four have been purchased back from the company by staffers eager for more wheelin’. God willing. ",

      "text": "SHARE \nBeard and Pund initially thought their trucklet just needed a tuneup. But when tests showed rampant leaking in all four cylinders and only 30 psi of compression in number three, the tuneup snowballed into an engine rebuild that consumed most of Beard’s downtime for two weeks. Its proud owners noted one important thing about Trackers: Parts are cheap. Exhaust valves for just $6. A muffler for $25. The engine-rebuild kit—including pistons, rings, bearings, oil pump, and timing belt—was $245. Crewman Beard noted that, at 70 mph, the 1.6-liter turns at 4100 rpm, surely making it the winner of the “lifetime engine revolutions” category. \nWith just 80 horsepower, more or less, after the rebuild, Pund and Beard were happy simply not to be in last place for Bundy’s mud drags. But then the Geo took second in the obstacle course, before any points were awarded for the extreme rock-crawling bonus pile. So Beard carefully picked his way over the mound, only scraping at the same point Sutton and Benn’s extreme Cherokee had. We had already noted the Geo’s impressive approach, departure, and breakover angles, but watching it creep up and over the jumbled concrete was a sight. This Japanese jeeplet is just a little under 12 feet long, and when rolling on 30-inch tires, much of its belly is rubber contact patch, giving it the approximate footprint of a leopard slug and the corresponding ability to ooze over nearly anything. And, with its short 87.0-inch wheelbase, the Geo was astoundingly maneuverable, a proper mountain mollusk. As Beard put it, “What the Miata is to the sports-car world, the Tracker is to the off-road world.” We agreed it was equivalently adorable, with the butched-up, lifted Geo winning the appearance vote. \nIn the vein of Sir Loin, Benn and Sutton had named the Jeep “Spare Rib.” After wowing everyone on the obstacle course, Beard christened his Geo the “Deathstalker Scorpion.” He was the only one who knew, without consulting Wiki, that the Deathstalker is in fact a really dangerous bug from the deserts of the Middle East. \nLikewise, the Geo held the potential to kill or maim. Even as Beard spun celebratory donuts in the mud next to the rock pile, the Tracker was starting to sag on its rusty body mounts. Over the course of two days at the Silver Lake sand dunes, whomping and slamming over crests and bumps, it ultimately settled so low that the tailgate wouldn’t open, as it had sunk below the top of the bumper. Recall, though, that Tracker parts are cheap. Beard has already located a whole new body for just $175. ",

      "text": "SHARE \nAs Jacquot steered our truck around a deer carcass in the seller’s yard on the test drive, the dude pointed out a pair of sandhill cranes on a nearby hilltop, noting, “They call them the sirloin of the sky.” Shazam! Our truck had a name. “Sirloin of the Sky” got shortened to “Sirloin,” and then road warrior Max Mortimer inserted a space, making it “Sir Loin.” We traced Sir Loin’s various electrical problems to crusty connections and a bunch of wiring that led nowhere. We improved a stalling issue by advancing the timing to an indicated 40 degrees before top dead center—a guess, actually, due to a spun crank damper, a loose timing chain, or both. \nSir Loin’s 44s were not only dry-rotted—a lookup of their DOT number revealed that they popped from their molds in 1994—but, at 18 inches, they were so wide that the inside-shoulder tread blocks grabbed the frame and shook the whole truck at anything more than half steering lock. The largest KO2 is just 35 inches, and so Interco, manufacturer of the original Super Swamper, provided a fresh set of 39.5x13.5s. Jacquot hoped that these lighter, smaller tires would give our axles and driveshafts a better chance at survival. Each wheel and tire still weighed 125 pounds, though, giving us well in excess of a quarter-ton of unsprung weight. Top right: The cab, settling from a broken body mount, bound the shift linkage and trapped us in park. As with the Jeep, we fixed it with a hammer, which would have been useful for beating sense into certain staffers. \nGenerous spacing of the Super Swampers’ gnarly tread blocks gave us unmatched traction off-road. In the drags, Sir Loin finished just 0.1 second behind the Land Rover in spite of eventually logging an on-road zero-to-60-mph time 8.2 seconds slower. \nThe springs that lofted the truck so high had the compressibility of tungsten. We drove more slowly over the office speed bumps than we normally do in Dodge Vipers and Ferraris, lest we shatter a spinal disc. Hammering over logs and rocks in the obstacle course, the front and rear axles took turns trying to send us into an endo tumble. At any moment the front axle threatened to fold under and send our chins into the dirt, but it held up and instead we won that test handily. \nAmped up on adrenaline and shocked to still have 33 distinct, intact vertebrae, we easily clambered over the construction debris at an entirely unreasonable pace. But our win cost us a body-mount bushing, which we replaced the next day with a few scraps of plywood plus some hockey pucks stolen from Beard’s office cubicle. On the other hand, the axle we sheared on an aggressive hill-climb required actual truck parts to fix. \nThe F-150’s punishing ride made the dunes feel like an all-day car accident. We staged a three-way drag race that climbed and descended five towering dunes over nearly a mile. Sir Loin’s tracks through the whoop-de-dos in each trough were notable for the large gaps where the truck had been airborne. In between momentary blackouts and involuntary grunts, though, we never realized the truck had left the ground. Every bump felt like the Stockholm hitting the Andrea Doria . After a brief ride, Sabatini tumbled out of the truck and, rubbing his back, remarked: “Wow. There’s only one word for that: violent.” \nBut he jumped at the chance to climb back in to experience Sir’s unmatched water-fording capability. We eventually stopped testing water holes, instead simply charging in without worrying about the consequences. An air intake nearly six feet off the ground is empowering like that. But in our final scoring, water fording didn’t matter as much as having body panels or air conditioning. Seems arbitrary, no? ",

      "text": "SHARE \nFormidable as Benn and Sutton’s Jeep might have been, it also seemed to have been parked in a bog at some point in its life and then disassembled and put back together while fully submerged. In rebuilding both axles, the team had to fabricate a tool to reach into the housings to scrape out all the mud. To check the fluid in their transfer case, they had to punch a screwdriver through a thick crust of Mother Earth inside the drain plug. But if any vehicle can run on equal parts oil and soil, it’s a Jeep. \nAnd if any team was going to resurrect a fossil, it would be Benn and Sutton. They rebuilt their front suspension, made a variety of components for the rear, modified the steering linkage, fabricated brackets to mount new seats to their rusty floor, and built a frame to attach belts to. In any contest of speed, knowledge and talent can sometimes offset a bigger budget. Top right: Fearsome crawler crawls over construction detritus. Bottom: Sutton crawls under fearsome crawler. \nSometimes. \nThe Jeep started off the cheapest but ended up costing the most: $2930, all in. (Features editor Jeff Sabatini, arbitrator for the contest, had initially decreed that wear and safety items wouldn’t be counted, but then changed his mind. We changed his title to “arbitrarian.”) At least they had a few freebies: A call to BFGood­rich turned up a set of All-Terrain KO2 tires for each vehicle, and Optima donated Red Top batteries for every competitor. \nIt came as little surprise that the Jeep was the most miserable to drive on the street, with its occupants donning rain suits, earplugs, and goggles on the damp drive to Bundy as if riding topside on an Alaskan pollock trawler. All were awed when shortly after their arrival, Benn crawled beneath the Cherokee with a hammer to shift the transfer case into low range, having run out of time to repair its damaged linkage. Stripped-out interior with fun starter switches. (Not shown: creepy-crawlies.) \nWe started with dirt drags on a strip that had been reduced by an overnight downpour to more of a mud lake. Here, the Jeep ­finished last, its locked differentials clawing at the muck but its 4.0-liter straight-six reduced from its original 177 horsepower to the approximate output of a Lawnboy by the long-term ingestion of several cubic yards of dirt, possibly including the partial jawbone of a yet-undiscovered sauropod. At our next stop, a timed obstacle course, the John Deere Jeep missed a turn and plunged into a hood-deep water hazard that Bundy Hill’s owner had cautioned us about, predicting that none of our trucks could cross it. Not only did Benn and Sutton make it through, they somehow did so without getting soaked despite being in a vehicle with no doors. Fluid dynamics had finally turned in their favor. \nOn the second run, the welded front diff forced them to make a three-point turn on the course’s tightest corner, costing time. But upon completion, they scrambled with ease over a pile of concrete construction debris that we’d identified as a bonus obstacle. \nUnfortunately for the Jeep team, the light faded and the park closed before we hit any trails on which Toledo’s Thunder surely would have left at least a couple of its com­petitors behind. And their transfer case ground its internals back into raw material en route to Silver Lake, leaving them with a DNF and a front-wheel-drive rig that Sabatini gleefully christened the “Two-by-Four.” A Cherokee, even one less crazy than this, might have won this contest based on potential, but, as Sutton noted, “Maybe that ‘Open 24 Hours’ sign on the hood was an omen we shouldn’t have ignored.” ",

      "text": "Taming the corporate media beast The Soviet Statesman Who Had the Talent to be Boss of Ford or GM \nFavored by Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev, Kosygin was responsible for the introduction of dramatic reforms in the 1960s, attempting to bring elements of a market economy into the Soviet system years before perestroika Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers Alexei Kosygin poses for a photo in his office (1974). Source: Yakov Khalipa / TASS Originally appeared at Russia Beyond the Headlines \nA photo exhibition dedicated to Soviet reformer and statesman Alexei Kosygin has opened at the Ekaterina Cultural Foundation in Moscow. Kosygin, who was esteemed by the likes of Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev and served as prime minister, is associated with the most radical pre-perestroika attempt to change the Soviet economy. \n\"The Kosygin Phenomenon\" exhibition illustrates the fate of a talented Soviet statesman in the context of a historical era that essentially includes the whole period of the USSR. Kosygin went through the Civil War, three decades of Stalin, World War II, the Khrushchev Thaw and the period of stagnation under Leonid Brezhnev. Emigrate While You Still Can! Learn More... \nThe child of a Petrograd worker, Kosygin went on to forge a brilliant career in the Soviet Union. After serving in the Red Army and gained experience in the cooperative system in Siberia, Kosygin graduated from a textile institute in Leningrad. After working as director of a garment factory for a short time, in 1938 he was elected to head the Leningrad Council, thereby becoming the leader of the second city in the USSR after Moscow. A year later he was appointed Minister (or People's Commissar, as the post was called) of Textile and Industry. At the time he was only 35 years old. Alexei Kosygin and his party are pictured in one of the workshops of the car assembly plant \"Somaka\" in Casablanca, Morocco, on Oct. 9, 1971. Source: Viktor Koshevoi / TASS \nSaving industrial enterprises during the war \nKosygin fully demonstrated his organizational skills during World War II. Several days after the Nazi invasion of Russia he was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Council for Evacuation. The council was faced with a big challenge: evacuating thousands of industrial enterprises from those areas of the country that could soon be occupied by Hitler's troops to the Soviet east. \nThe difficulties were overcome and by 1942, 2,500 industrial enterprises had been moved to the east, where many began functioning as soon as they were unpacked and reassembled. Historians believe that Kosygin played a big role in the successful implementation of evacuation procedures. \nThe Road of Life \nIn January 1942 Kosygin was sent to Leningrad, which was surrounded by German and Finnish troops. He had to organize the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of residents and establish a supply route to the besieged city. \nIn Leningrad, Kosygin participated in the creation of the Road of Life, the road across the ice of Lake Ladoga, the only route connecting the isolated city with unoccupied Russia. The appearance of the Road of Life provided an opportunity to send the starving city food supplies and evacuate sick residents. It was mortally dangerous to traverse the road because it was constantly shelled by German planes and artillery. Vehicles would often sink in the cracks formed in the ice. Yet there was no alternative. \nThanks to the Road of Life more than half a million people were evacuated from Leningrad. A pipeline was also laid along the bottom of the lake to supply the city with fuel. It is said that the road remained Kosygin's pride and joy until the end of his life. \nStalin's sympathies \nAfter the end of the war Kosygin's administrative skills were in great demand and he held various government posts. It is considered that Stalin, who was favorably disposed to him, appointed Kosygin his deputy in the government back in 1940. Many people are convinced that it was precisely Stalin's sympathies that saved Kosygin from the repressions related to the so-called Leningrad Affair. \nMeanwhile, Kosygin's grandson Alexei Gvishaini believes that his grandfather \"was needed, that the regime needed him as a practitioner, one who knew how to do specific things in agriculture and obtain concrete results. Others didn't know how to do this.\" In the 1960s foreign mass media also reported on the Soviet politician's administrative talent. The American publication Newsweek wrote: \"A person of this sort could head a large corporation such as Ford or General Motors.\" \nIn the years of Khrushchev's tenure, Kosygin first supported him in the inner-party struggle but then became close to those who spoke out against the general secretary. After Khrushchev was replaced, Kosygin became head of the Soviet government, a post that he held almost until his death in 1980. He set a particular record at this post, having held it longer than anyone else since it was established in the beginning of the 20th century. \nThe golden five-year plan \nAfter becoming prime minister in 1964, Kosygin attempted to change the Soviet planned economy, introducing elements of a market economy. He tried to make enterprises more autonomous: Еhey received the right to establish relations with suppliers and consumers by themselves and keep part of the profits. The results of the change were immediate: Еhe period of the reform, the second half of the 1960s, was one of the fastest periods of growth in the Soviet economy. The 1966-1970 five-year plan was called \"golden.\" \nHowever, there was a reverse side to the reforms. Not having the opportunity to raise prices (the government had maintained control over them), the enterprises reduced investment in production and increased the salaries. The growth of the population's income led to the growth of inflation. Consequently, Kosygin's reforms gradually came to an end. However, the experience of Kosygin's changes was useful in the middle of the 1980s, during perestroika.",

      "text": "This Ford Mustang For Kids Has More Safety Features Than Your Car This Ford Mustang For Kids Has More Safety Features Than Your Car The PowerWheels Mustang comes with traction control and stability control The Fisher Price Mustang is a battery operated ride on car for kids The Mustang also comes with AUX input and V8 engine sound effects The need for enhanced safety aids on cars has been increasingly pressed upon, especially in the west. So much so that now toy cars for children are being equipped with electronic aids to make them safer and more crash protected. Well, that's what toymaker Fisher Price is offering with its new Ford Mustang 'PowerWheels' Ride on Car that gets traction and stability control as part of the standard kit. Believe it or not, this toy car has more safety aids than the average hatchback sold in India. The Fisher Price Ford Mustang PowerWheels is a battery operated ride on car, in which children can sit and operate the toy. The toy is based on the 2016 Mustang and replicates the design very well. As for the safety features, the toy actually comes loaded with traction control which can monitor for wheel slip and adjust motor speeds to help keep the car going over wet grass or bumpy terrain. You also get a tilt sensor that switches off the motors when an unsafe angle is detected to prevent rollovers, essentially stability control. Furthermore, you get a LED touch interface to change speed and check charge level. Ford Mustang 75.98 Lakh * On Road Price (New Delhi) FIND OUT MORE The PowerWheels Mustang also comes with V8 sound effects, which should make the drive even more enjoyable while children cruise at a top speed of 8 km/h. If that's not enough, the young drivers get auxiliary connectivity as well; you know, to play the top 10 chartbusters for kids playlist. Meanwhile, the original Ford Mustang is now available in India priced at ₹ 65 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi) and is powered by a 5.0-litre V8 petrol engine tuned to produce 395bhp of power at 6500rpm and develops 515Nm of torque at 4250rpm. The motor comes paired to a 6-speed automatic transmission as standard. The American pony also happens to be the most affordable V8 to be sold in the country, and we had great fun with it when we drove the car earlier this year. The Fisher Price PowerWheels Ford Mustang will go on sale in the US in December this year and is priced at $359.99 (around ₹ 26,600 excluding taxes), which clearly doesn't make it any cheap. What it really does though is making a lot of adults envious of their kids. That said, if your child is a car nut, this just might be the perfect Christmas gift.",

      "text": "  Mini Confirms Return Of Nurburgring-Killing JCW GP by Gabe Beita Kiser   Here's a hot hatch Ford and Volkswagen may want to worry about. Any fan of the movie The Italian Job knows that, as dinky as they look, Minis can be serious cars for serious enthusiasts. They just have to be heavily modified beforehand to fully take advantage of their small dimensions and low weight. Some prime examples of this are rally-racing Minis that can pack a serious punch to Focus RS and Subaru STI competitors. And then there’s the JCW GP, a race-ready Mini straight from the factory, which, as Autocar confirms, is something to be excited about again. Ever since BMW bought Mini, reinventing the design for the new millennium in 2001, the line has grown from there. To celebrate its popularity, Mini has given a nod to enthusiasts by creating the John Cooper Works GP, a stripped out and modified JCW that, in its previous rendition, was able to lap the Nurburgring in an astonishing 8:23. Mini tends to release these on the final year that a certain generation is available, with the previous highly limited edition models seeing the light of day in 2006 and 2013 when the first and second generation of Mini was going out of production. Now that the third generation of Mini is out, there is one question that remains: will Mini remake the JCW GP? According to what Mini boss Peter Schwarzenbauer told Autocar, the answer is yes. \"It's an important part of the Mini brand. It has worked well for us in the past and I don't see why not in the future,\" said Schwarzenbauer. While the JCW badge already designates the fastest Minis available from the factory, the last generation of GP improved on it by adding a track-tuned suspension, a reinforced chassis, upgraded brakes, a stripped out interior, and a strut brace that replaced the rear seats. Power was only up by 3 horsepower over the JCW’s 208 ponies, but it fit well with the rest of the hardware. Unfortunately, the production run will likely be low (500 JCW GPs came to the US in the last generation) and we’ll have to wait until around 2020 to see it.",

In this country, the Escape has enjoyed its earned status as the segment leader, moving 47,726 units last year alone. Watkins stated that the volume of crossovers sold last year represents 33 percent of all vehicles sold in Canada—and by 2020, the expectation is that crossovers will account for 40 percent.

It’s with the SE and Titanium we experience the biggest change: the availability of two new EcoBoost engines, a 1.5 L, 4-cylinder with 179 hp and 177 lb-ft of torque or an optional 2.0 L twin-scroll, 4-cylinder turbocharged power plant generating 245 hp and 275 ft-lb of torque on the SE and the 2.0 L iteration being standard on the Titanium trim. The entry level S, the lowest volume seller retains a 2.5 L 4-cylinder engine. Greg Watkins and his team estimate that the SE with the optional turbocharged engine and AWD will likely be their volume seller. Ford Escape (David Taylor) \nAnd on that, we would concur. Our drive route from Calgary up to Jasper was spectacular. The smaller EcoBoost engine, while capable, did not feel there was much left when pushed on long, steep climbs with some altitude. The 2.0 L version performed really well. To be clear: most shoppers in this category of vehicle will not be ascending and descending roads through mountains in almost every conceivable weather pattern the elements can throw at you. The smaller EcoBoost option may be more than sufficient driving from Markham along the 401 eastbound daily. At the end of the day, however, it’s about choices: will you be towing consistently; is fuel economy a major concern; and, what will your budget withstand? \nFrom the outside, the overall appearance is a little more rugged, likely with greater appeal to the diverse demographics—millennials and boomers. The front end is now more in keeping with the Ford family appearance and no longer looks “adopted”. \nInside, things have obviously improved, too. General ergonomics are more intuitive and provide the driver and passengers with a feeling of greater cabin space. More thought has been given to softer materials, the position of an electronic hand brake, greater console space and flexibility. Plus, a shift lever positioned where it should have been years ago. Ford Escape (David Taylor) \nWith years of growth and success behind this market leader, Ford has reason to be proud. Based on our driving experience from Calgary to Jasper via Lake Louise and back, it’s safe to say that complacency has not taken root and confidence is deservedly high. With clear skies and a favourable forecast, we were soon on our way from Calgary toward our first stopping point, Lake Louise, driving through truly magnificent country, on well-engineered roads designed to be driven. It appeared that many roads have been carved out of the Rockies themselves with cliffs swooping to the edge of the asphalt. \nThroughout the complete drive the marvels of nature passed our slightly tinted windows. Frankly, it seemed that about the only thing missing from this experience was the hushed yet enthusiastic voice-over typical of nature television programs. All through the drive, we encountered many of the indigenous species: black bear grazing metres from the road; what we believed to be a grizzly, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, an elk, and even a caribou or two within Jasper National Park. \nAfter a few hours of seat time, the earlier enthusiasm of the Ford team in Calgary took hold in almost osmosis-like fashion. \nThe cabin had a feeling of airiness and abundant space assisted no doubt by the crisp, spring weather experienced during our drive. Skies seemed bluer, clouds fluffier and lighter and lakes a fantastic hard-to-describe blue-green. The only shortfall was the seat cushions up front; while driving was quite comfortable and reasonably effortless, slightly longer seat cushions would have been appreciated. Scenery Second-to-None \nThe majority of my seat time was in the top-of-the-line Titanium model. When we made our first stop in Lake Louise at the Fairmont hotel for a coffee and well-deserved leg stretch, we were approached by tourists from around the world, eager to see for themselves this new Ford. In fact, in behind the hotel, we parked (somewhat illegally) but with the “blessing” of hotel security to take photographs. It was here that the Escape was “swarmed”! \nLake Louise boasts the glacier-clad Mount Victoria, which soars an impressive 3,464 meters into the huge, never-ending sky. And, if you are an aficionado of late night television, you might hear the subliminal rejoinder, “But wait: there’s more!” Continue north from the Fairmont and there is the breathtaking scenery along the Icefields Parkway (Highway 93). A sight to behold, the Columbia Icefield is a throwback to prehistoric times. Over the centuries, the slow-moving, powerful flow of ice has carved a path through the mountains, reinventing local geography as it travels, slowly yet inexorably along a path whose final destination has yet to be determined. Here’s a fun-fact to consider: this icefield produces meltwater that eventually feeds streams and rivers which reach three oceans—the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic! Fairmount Hotel (David Taylor) \nIt is here that you will appreciate the power of this natural environment: cellular phone coverage is spotty at best and regardless of some of the new communications tech in the 2017 Escape, it cannot compete with Mother Nature. \nDriving north, the Escape handles the mountain roads and limited traffic with relative ease. Soon, the Athabasca Falls are in sight. This wonder of the force and power of nature is impressive. Not so much for its size–only some 23 metres in height, but more for the continual, unwavering volume of icy water which cascades downwards with tremendous force. Bears Are Not Pets: Treat With Respect and Caution \nContinuing on our journey we drive into Jasper National Park witnessing further jaw-dropping vistas and a seemingly docile black bear. Do not, however be deceived: these are wild animals and should be considered dangerous and must be treated with caution and respect. This message was continually reinforced by dedicated, uniformed Park Rangers who patrol the roads constantly, keeping a watchful eye open to ensure that wildlife and homo-sapien intruders, respect all boundaries, natural and otherwise. Ultimately we reach our postcard-perfect destination for the evening, the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge where we parked our well-travelled Escapes together like a herd of sheet metal and plastic. Black Bear (David Taylor) \nThat evening, en route to a western-themed cookout of epic proportions with much of the local bounty prepared by a legion of chefs, we dined like royalty likely in much the same way Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip did back in 2005. We wondered, however, did they walk respectfully behind a solitary Caribou, ambling the pathways of the sprawling hotel grounds as we made our way to dinner? \nThe following morning bright and early, we climbed back into our well-equipped vehicles and prepared to descend from mountainous regions toward the foothills around Calgary. For the most part, our route was the same as 24 hours ago, yet it all seemed so different, Such is the magnificence of Canada generally, and this part of our country, specifically. \nHere’s the thing: the 2017 Ford Escape will be at home wherever it is driven–without ever feeling out of place or requiring any explanation or apology. \nFord Escape Titanium 2017 with Sport package \nBody Style: Compact crossover utility vehicleDrive Method: Front-engine, with all-wheel-driveEngine: 2.0 L twin-scroll turbocharged 4-cylinder engine (245 hp, 275 lb-ft of torque)Cargo Capacity: 68.0 cu ft (behind first row) and 34.0 cu ft (behind second row)Fuel Economy: In the Titanium model, 91-octane fuel is recommended (premium) 11.5/8.7 L/100 km (city/highway)Price: $35,999* \n*Includes freight and PDI.

      "text": "By SportsDayDFW.com Contact SportsDayDFW.com on Twitter: @SportsDayDFW \nThe Dallas Cowboys offensive line delivered some much needed assistance to someone other than Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott over the Thanksgiving holiday. \nEarlier this week, Ford Motor Company posted a YouTube video of Doug Free, Ronald Leary, Travis Frederick, Tyron Smith and Zack Martin paying a visit to Dallas Fire Station 43 for a surprise makeover of their facilities. \nThe Cowboys partnered with Ford, Fox Sports, and The Leary Firefighters Foundation to give these public servants a proper place to watch the Cowboys play on Thanksgiving. \nWatch the video here. \nEstablished by actor Denis Leary in 2000, The Leary Firefighters Foundation's mission is to provide funding and resources for fire departments to obtain the best available equipment, technology and training. \n\"Today and every day, we're grateful to the firefighters of Fire Station 43, and to firefighters across the country for their courage and bravery,\" Leary said in a statement. \"The Leary Firefighters Foundation is proud to team up with Ford to provide Dallas with much needed equipment, and to support the men and women who risk their lives to keep us safe.\" \nAlong with the renovation, the foundation also donated $50,000 worth of equipment along with a brand new truck to the Dallas station.

      "text": "Post by fordperv on Apr 20, 2016 9:50:40 GMT Thought I'd share the info the owner has given on another forum \"I can confirm that the car was found earlier and is now rather secure!The **** who stole it managed to open the drivers door, cut the steering wheel with what looked to be a hacksaw (no tools left but tool marks very visible) to remove the disklok off the steering wheel and then kindly unscrewed (yes that's right) the steering column cowling, unscrew the ignition barel and just started it with whatever they had. Only damage is that it needs a new steering wheel and my sense of security! Also when it was found they had managed to get the disklok back on the wheel and popped the cowling on.I hope this description will help people make their pride and joy more secure. I thought my Escort was safe but they still got round it and never made a sound! Also very strange but nothing was taken from the car and seems nothing left in it either, even has my lighter on the dash where I left it and they even left the screws to put the interior back together, I'm totally baffled if I'm honest and never thought I'd see it again let alone in the same condition it was taken in, apart from the steering wheel!Also thanks to a lot of very helpful people, I now have a good description of the offender and know where the car has apparently been! It was taken from my home address near Diss, the we heard it travelling towards Thetford, no idea where then. Then sometime today it was seen near/at McDonald's in Dereham and also spotted driving through atleborough. Will not give the description as police are currently dealing with the situation. CSI will be coming tomorrow. I sent the message out at approx 5am and it was all over Facebook by 6am, then at around 6pm we had a call from a chap saying he had just arrived home and realised that my Escort was parked on his road,, he said had seen it on a mates Facebook page earlier today and recognised it being so different. Turns out that Facebook thing is very useful, shame I don't use it, though I'm so glad everyone I know does. I'd just like to thank everyone for their concern and help with posting messages on other sites and sharing the Facebook messages.Thanks, Craig (the happiest XR owner ever!)\" escortmad79 and skylinedave like this Last Edit: Apr 20, 2016 9:52:00 GMT by fordperv",

      "text": "Standing in his family's Orland Park garage, Alex Marneris beams over the 2005 Ford Mustang V6 that has been both a training vehicle and a catapult to national recognition in the field of automotive technology.\n\"I learned brakes on it, how to fix suspension, how to do diagnostics on it. This was the main tool I used,\" he said of the supercharged, track-ready gray vehicle.\nMarneris, a Carl Sandburg graduate and a student at both Joliet Junior College and University of Illinois Chicago, recently took third in a national competition, making him one of five contenders for the chance to represent the United States in the 2017 WorldSkills Automobile Technology competition in Abu Dhabi, National Arab Emirates.\nThough he was not selected for the international event, he says he will root for the candidate who was chosen and he will set his sights on representing the U.S. in the 2019 competition in Russia.\n\"I have been so fortunate to be able to get this far,\" he said.\nSo far, the 20-year-old has amassed 13 medals earned in various state and national competitions and over 25 industry certifications.\nThe most prestigious of them is the third place award he earned at SkillsUSA in Louisville, Ky., in June, 2015. He was 18 at the time and it qualified him for the world competition, which takes place every two years.\nMarneris competed in that event at the high school level. His friend and former JJC classmate, Tom Hahn, a graduate of Stagg High School, took first place in the national event at the college level, becoming the first JJC student to win gold at a SkillsUSA contest. Hahn was not eligible for WorldSkills. He missed the maximum age requirement by two days. Now 24, he is currently a student at Southern Illinois University , where he is studying automotive engineering.\nCollege of Lake County receives grant to grow mechatronics program Emily K. Coleman Wauconda resident Pat Lincoln has two engineering degrees, but he still has trouble finding full-time work.\nHe keeps getting told he's overqualified, but he suspects his age may be more the issue. He's found that certifications sometimes carry more weight than years of experience.\nThat's why he's...\nWauconda resident Pat Lincoln has two engineering degrees, but he still has trouble finding full-time work.\nHe keeps getting told he's overqualified, but he suspects his age may be more the issue. He's found that certifications sometimes carry more weight than years of experience.\nThat's why he's...\n(Emily K. Coleman) Both SkillsUSA and WorldSkills promote excellence and advancement in vocational and technical skills in some 50 fields of study, including welding, baking, landscape gardening and cabinetmaking. Competitions are held at the high school and college levels.\nMore than 6,000 competitors vied for medals at this year's national event, Marneris said. In his category — automotive services — 50 high school and 25 college students competed.\n\"It was so humbling to take third,\" he said. \"It was an amazing moment to be standing up on stage to get that medal.\"\nBut it was hardly the first time he'd known the feeling. Marneris has a medal to show for every competition he's entered.\nMarneris' road to success began with a regional qualifying event, in which 250 students across Illinois competed. About 60 of those qualified for the state contest based on results of an exam of automotive knowledge. Marneris took first place in that contest.\nThe SkillsUSA Illinois competition consisted of 20 hands-on stations that required students to diagnose problems, take measurements, conduct tests and make repairs. They were judged according to Automotive Service Excellence standards.\nMarneris took first in that event as well.\nIn Louisville, the competition was among all 50 state winners.\nAt each competition, the contestants are put through a series of stations, at which they have a specific amount of time to complete a task. The higher the level of competition, the more complex the diagnostic tasks and the more advanced the vehicles.\nChris Komer, applied technology teacher at Sandburg, said Marneris' success is a testament to his work ethic.\n\"Alex worked really hard,\" Komer said. \"He met every day after school with (teacher) Ron Morris, who mentored him.\"\nMorris has since left District 230 for a job in North Carolina. But Komer said the staff at Sandburg is proud of how far Marneris has taken his skills.\n\"We've never had anybody be able to get as far as Alex did (at the high school level),\" Komer said. \"It's very gratifying. We show the kids the skills, but it's the student's commitment that takes it to the next level. Alex was really into it, put in the time and effort. That's what he wanted to do. He took the basic skills and knowledge he got here and applied them.\"\nMarneris said he still keeps in touch with Morris. \"He was the main person who made sure I was prepared and had everything I needed,\" Marneris said. \"He ensured my path to the podium.\"\nHe said he is grateful that both Sandburg and JJC, which he visited often during his high school years, were outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment and caring teachers. In addition, he said Hahn, who is four years older, helped him considerably along the way.\nMarneris, who is studying automotive technology at JJC and biology at UIC , credits his dad, George Marneris, Sandburg's Morris and a former neighbor, Bob Alexander, with helping him not only find a passion but excel at it.\n\"It began with my dad's 1987 Porsche 928 S4. We took it on Sunday drives. It was a nice dark silver metallic, almost a gun metal gray with a nice cream, ivory interior,\" Marneris said. \"I loved that car. Unfortunately, he had to sell it because it couldn't be his daily drive.\"\nThen Alexander bought a 1983 Cobra.\n\"He was our best friend. He'd let me watch or help tinker with it. It was an amazing vehicle,\" Marneris said. \"Unfortunately, he passed away from cancer. It was a tough time, because I really loved that car and he was the man who made it. Unfortunately, his wife had to get rid of it because there was too much emotional attachment to it. I wish I could have bought it but at the time I didn't have the funds.\n\"That's what kind of drove me to go automotive. It was a way to say 'Thank you' to my neighbor and to my dad for kick starting this,\" he said.\nGeorge Marneris said: \"He's a champion to me. We spent many hours in this little garage. In that corner of tools. It was the most incredible time I had with him. It's emotional. Thirteen medals and counting and still he's driven to do this.\"\nMarneris's mom, Margaret Marneris, said her son displayed a knack for mechanics early on.\n\"When we first moved in here, we were doing some remodeling. He wanted to help remove the (electrical) cover plates. He was little. I said, 'No, no, no.' Then one day I came home and while my mom had been watching him, he'd removed every single cover plate,\" she said.\n\"He's one of those kids that when he sets his mind on something, he just goes for it,\" she said. \"I am very proud of him.\"\nMarneris said he was disappointed he wasn't chosen for WorldSkills 2017, but he already has his sights set on the next nationals and the next WorldSkills competitions.\n\"I love this weird little passion, tinkering with cars, figuring out what's wrong and fixing them,\" he said.\nThe hobby also has opened other doors, he said.\nNoticing the similarities between many automotive diagnostic tools and those used in the medical field, Marneris has opted to double major in both mechanics and biology, with the intent to become a doctor one day.\n\"I really like helping people, whether through medicine or mechanics,\" he said. \"That is my passion.\"\ndvickroy@tribpub.com\nTwitter @dvickroy\nTo learn more about WorldSkills 2017, go to www.worldskills.org/what/competitions/wsc2017/\n Southern Illinois University University of Illinois at Chicago",

      "text": "A draft plan released by the city of St. Paul on Nov. 14, 2016, for the former Ford Motor Co. campus in Highland Park calls for the 135 acres to be split into six zoning districts, with 2-story buildings nearest the Mississippi River to the west, growing to as high as 10 stories as they “step up” to the east. Ford, which still owns the land, has demolished its manufacturing buildings and will seek a master developer in 2017-2018. (Courtesy of city of St. Paul and Goff Public) St. Paul is a major step closer to its vision for a 21st Century Community on the site of Ford’s former Twin Cities Assembly Plant in Highland Park. With release of the preliminary plan earlier this month, the city prepares to exercise its key tool — zoning — to shape the “mixed-use urban village” it envisions on the prime, 120-acre site.\nWe’re reminded that the site is Ford’s to sell. Under the city’s plan, a master developer the company could select by 2018 would work with the city on a range of housing types, neighborhood parks and recreational amenities, including a stream-like water corridor, as well as retail and office buildings, the Pioneer Press’ Frederick Melo reported . Building heights and densities would be dictated by six zoning districts.\nAbout 1,500 jobs are expected, with “leeway” in either direction, city officials say.\nWe’d wish for more jobs on this site that provided gainful employment for generations of St. Paul families, serving as an economic engine for more than 80 years. From the first Model T in 1925 to the last Ranger pickup, 9 million cars and trucks were built in Highland Park.\nLimited access now makes it less suitable for some jobs, including manufacturing, the city’s director of Planning and Economic Development, Jonathan Sage-Martinson, told the editorial board.\nThe site includes the 13-acre rail yard owned by Canadian Pacific Railway, described as a wedge-shaped parcel on the south border of the main Ford site. The yard and the former “spur” line to it served the site for most of its operating years, the city explains on its website.\nIn years to come, jobs on the site “are likely to be different,” and in higher density than we’d see with manufacturing, Sage-Martinson explains.\nIn the realms of both housing and jobs, the project “needs density to make it feasible,” City Council Member Chris Tolbert, who represents the area, told us. Density will help provide the tax base to support the open space and other amenities community members want, as well as hoped-for transit connections to the site.\nThe balance is delicate. A plan for the redevelopment of the former Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant in Arden Hills, for example, has encountered pushback as “too urban” from some community officials and residents. It’s argued that density is key to creating a development with hoped-for vitality that will, for example, provide plenty of street traffic to support local businesses.\nOn the Ford site, all but one “gateway” business district in the northwest corner of the development would allow a mix of housing and commerce, the Pioneer Press reported, noting that heights would “step up” from the Mississippi River on the west, and get taller moving east.\nTransportation plans for the site , the topic of a meeting last week, call for a new traffic connection between Cretin and Montreal avenues that would reduce congestion at the busy intersection of Cleveland Avenue and Ford Parkway. The goal, in part, is to keep heavy traffic off Mississippi River Boulevard, which would gain a bicycle/pedestrian path, according to the Pioneer Press report, which also noted that the former railroad spur could become a public transit, bicycle and pedestrian route into the neighborhood.\nSt. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman stresses that the plan is the product of a decade of careful progress that has included Ford’s extensive work on environmental cleanup of the site. Efforts have included a 25-member community task force, 34 community meetings and a dozen technical studies on topics including the site’s sustainable energy future. Ford’s openness to the process and cooperation are noteworthy.\nThe process is “a marathon, not a sprint,” says Tolbert, who describes it as a “once-in-a century opportunity” on a “site that deserves greatness.”\nGiven its river-bluff beauty, location in one of St. Paul’s most desirable neighborhoods and proximity to the airport and two downtowns, it’s been acknowledged as one of the nation’s most promising development sites.\nThe city has said it will continue to collect community input on the plan at meetings and via its Open Saint Paul online forum. A formal master plan, incorporating feedback, is expected to go to the Planning Commission next spring and to City Council next summer, with final adoption anticipated by late summer or early fall.\nA city’s ability to renew itself — and to engage the public in such work — is an indicator of good health. St. Paul’s careful work should provide a firm foundation that will support the development vision as times, economic trends and political leaders change — provided nobody ever loses sight of the need for jobs, jobs, jobs.",

      "text": "0 \nHoonigan’s Andreas Bakkerud won the FIA World Rallycross season finale in Argentina today, driving a Ford Focus RS RX to mark his third victory of the 2016 season. EKS team went ahead to win the Teams’ championship title ending a close battle with Team peugeot Hansen. \nJohan Kristoffersson from VW RX Sweden was the main rival to Bakkerud today, running second throughout the final to claim second in the drivers’ standings. Bakkerud missed the same spot by a single point and had to settle for third in the overall championship standings. Mattias Ekstrom already won the 2016 championship title and was only cruising for the fun of it in Argentina, he did however manage to get through all rounds into the final where he finished fifth. World RX of Argentina 1 of 18 \nEKS driver Toomas Heikkinen beat Ekstrom to the first corner and thus claimed third, leaving Timo Scheider and Ekstrom to fight for fourth – both are DTM drivers. Eventually, Heikkinen would finish third leading Scheider. Earlier on, Ekstrom suffered a loss of time after taking two joker laps, the Swedish driver had jumped the start. Robin Larsson finished sixth in the final. \nFormer World RX champions Petter Solberg had an unlucky weekend after his campaign came to a premature end in the semi-finals, he finished fifth after getting caught behind a shunt between Janis Baumanis and his teammate Timur Timerzyanov. Prior to that, Solberg had been leading all weekend up until the semi-finals. Sebastien Loeb suffered a similar fate, only making it as far as the semi-finals. The Frenchman finished fourth but dropped to fifth after receiving a five-seconds penalty. CATEGORIES",

      "text": "Ford EcoBoost® continues to set benchmark with all-new 3.5-litre V6 bettering torque levels of V8 engine Ford EcoBoost® continues to set benchmark with all-new 3.5-litre V6 bettering torque levels of V8 engine 2.5 5   Ford EcoBoost \nFord continues its relentless pace of innovation, delivering segment-leading torque for 2017 F-150 customers with the all-new 3.5-litre EcoBoost V6 engine and 10-speed automatic transmission. The new second-generation 3.5-litre EcoBoost engine will provide more peak torque compared with the first-generation 3.5-litre EcoBoost engine, with 629 Nm*, and a horsepower of 390PS*. The importance of Ford’s EcoBoost engines shouldn’t be underestimated. The Ford GT race car, which this year won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in its class, features a number of innovations – including state-of-the-art aerodynamics to deliver outstanding levels of downforce for improved stability with minimal drag, and advanced lightweight composites featuring carbon fibre for an exceptionally rigid but light chassis – not least of which is the power and efficiency of EcoBoost technology. In the Middle East, Ford’s EcoBoost technology is available in nearly every Ford car, utility and light-duty pickup ranging from the Fiesta, Focus, Fusion, Taurus, Edge, Escape, Explorer, Expedition, Flex, F-150. EcoBoost engines also power a growing number of Ford performance models, including the new Mustang, just-announced F-150 Raptor, as well as Fiesta ST and Focus ST. Based on the same race-proven engine architecture serving Ford’s IMSA Daytona Prototype endurance racing efforts, the next-generation twin-turbocharged 3.5-litre EcoBoost V6 features a wide powerband with impressive time-to-torque characteristics. Specifically, on Ford’s all-new Edge, the brand’s youngest model now in market, two of its available powerplants are entirely new; a standard twin-scroll 2.0-litre EcoBoost® four-cylinder with 253 PS and 378 Nm of torque, and a powerful 2.7-litre EcoBoost V6 with 340 PS and 542 Nm of torque on the Sport model. All EcoBoost engines, however, demonstrate remarkable efficiency – a key attribute of its endurance racing-derived powertrain, where exceptional performance combined with efficiency is a critical competitive advantage. Highly pressurised fuel is injected into the combustion chamber of each cylinder rather than traditional mixing with air in the inlet port. This precise delivery of fuel means fewer trips to the petrol pump and lower emissions without sacrificing performance. More air produces a bigger bang, and that means more power out of the same size engine. Traditional engines let air flow from engine exhaust go to waste. The EcoBoost turbocharger uses it to generate more horsepower. With EcoBoost, you get the power of a bigger traditional engine combined with the fuel efficiency of a smaller engine. “Ford is continually improving on its already class-leading technology,” said Ziyad Dallalah, Chief Resident Engineer, Ford Middle East & Africa. “EcoBoost is an excellent example of how engine down-sizing, matched with greater fuel efficiency, doesn’t have to come at the expense of power, refinement or drivability. In fact, Ford has proven that down-sizing can actually enhance performance.” Globally, Ford’s range of powerful yet fuel-efficient EcoBoost engines includes1.0-litre, 1.5-litre, 1.6‑litre, 2.0-litre and 2.3-litre four cylinder engines, and 2.7-litre and 3.5-litre V6 engines. The latter powers the all-new Ford GT supercar that cruised to victory on its return to Le Mans this year, five decades after claiming a 1-2-3 finish at the 24-hour race.",

      "title": "2017 Ford F-150 3.5 EcoBoost First Test: Gazing Head On Into Peak Pickup",
      "text": "  \nWe shouldn’t feign awe and disbelief when the inevitable “peak pickup” sales taper off hits, but trucks such as the Ford F-150 are constant reminders of how much OEMs value their high-visibility, high-profit products. Some might say it’s the best time to be shopping for a new pickup. \nThe F-150 plays the critical numbers game. That’s for sure. The big update for the 2017 model year is the rise of the second-generation 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6. It’s the same unit that initially gained fame as the chosen reciprocating one (albeit juiced up) in the new 450-horsepower Raptor. With 375 horsepower in the regular F-150, it has 10 horsepower more than before (penciling out to a 3 percent leap) alongside a torque peak 50 lb-ft higher. The torque increase locks in a 10-lb-ft advantage over GM’s L86 6.2-liter V-8, which lead to best-in-class torque claims, although that Ford torque peak has shifted north from the first-gen V-6’s 2,500 to 3,500 rpm. \nThat engine continues to be positioned as the truck line’s most premium set of rods and pistons, and it does a masterful job of pitching the EcoBoost lifestyle. It’s not a trim elitist, either; the 3.5-liter twin-turbo V-6 can be had from entry-grade XL all the way up to the 22-inch-wheel-wearing Limited, where it’s standard. As road test editor Chris Walton calls out on the F-150, “It’s such a solid, easy-to-drive truck with way more power than most people will need, which is probably what Ford needed to do considering it’s not powered by a V-8.” \nRead more on the Ford F-150 from 2017 Truck of the Year testing HERE . \nThere’s plenty of non-V-8 muscle to flex. Instrumented testing ascertained a 0–60 time of 6.1 seconds and quarter mile of 14.7 seconds at 95 mph, 0.3 second fleeter and 2.5 mph rapider than a 2015 F-150 Platinum FX4 with the retro, cool 3.5-liter EcoBoost and six-speed automatic we ran when aluminum-body trucks were still an infrequent sight. The P552-platform F-150 is more common now, but the 10-speed automatic transmission backing this Platinum 4×4 EcoBoost is rare … for the time being. \nWith a 7,000-pound trailer affixed, the additional grunt and gearing assistance is more noticeable. Our “half-ton typical weight” trailer has been tethered to more than a few full-size trucks over the past couple years, and the F-150 hardly broke a sweat. Its 13.0-second 0–60-mph and 19.3-second quarter-mile times outmaneuver an L86-motivated GMC Sierra Denali tested last year pulling the identical weight (13.3 and 19.5 for the Sierra, respectively). \nThat same weight stress on the rear bumper had strained the 2015 Platinum FX4 even more, to the tune of 14.7 seconds to 60 mph and 20.2 seconds in the quarter mile. A 1.7- and 0.9-second improvement from old Ford to new Ford in the 0–60 and quarter mile effusively shows off the new excess capability on tap. The transmission shifts about as undetectably and at the driver’s will as one could hope for, but it seemed to be more sensitive after a cold start as it stuttered along in the lower gears. Once warmed up, all was well. \nThe new V-6, which comes with more gears and features both port and direct fuel injection and a remarkably nonintrusive auto start/stop system, gets real-world Real MPG benefits. Our latest Real MPG test (trailer not attached) earned 17.1/21.1/18.7 mpg city/highway/combined, an 11 percent combined upgrade over the 2015 Platinum FX4’s 14.8/19.9/16.8. If history hadn’t already conditioned us to expect something better to be lurking around the corner, we might actually have to start believing that this is it . Surely, the bottom of the gasoline-efficiency barrel has been scraped. That’s why spy photos of a diesel F-150 exist, we imagine. \nBeing ruthlessly efficient at turning gas into momentum has never been an EcoBoost inadequacy, especially not in the F-150. As before, the F-150’s sense of highway-rolling invincibility is reinforced by the easy speed and quiet cabin. It’s a quietness that’s interrupted by the pleasing thrum of the V-6 upon rolling on the throttle. \nThis is an engine that’s prepared to oblige its operator. “Ford has this turbo engine dialed now,” associate editor Scott Evans said. “No more big delay while boost builds to get moving with a trailer. This truck has demonstrated that the future of trucks is turbocharging.” We were pleased with the 2017 model’s heavier revised steering, which helped settle the truck and vanquish the sensation of nervousness that startled us in years past. Equipped with 275/55R20 Hankook Dynapro AT-M tires, it’s also worth noting that the braking distance from 60 to 0 shortens up by 5 feet (from 126 to 121) and the figure-eight lap time drops from 28.1 to 27.8 seconds when comparing the 2017 vehicle to the 2015 example. \nSome might say it’s the worst time to be going after a new truck, too. List prices remain heroic. Our Platinum 4×4 test truck starts at $58,455 with the EcoBoost V-6 and 10-speed automatic. (It’s $57,455, or $1,000 less, for a Platinum 4×4 with the trim’s stock 5.0-liter V-8 and six-speed automatic.) As equipped, we’re looking at $63,610, an amount we’ve become numb to for the segment. The top-shelf F-150 Limited 4×4 opens the bidding at $64,220. \nIf we’ve reached peak pricing and powertrain performance, things can’t get any better, right? That’d be untrue, As with the 2015 F-150s we met, the interior design and ergonomics are polarizing. “I like the chamfered-square design theme,” Walton said. But executive editor Mark Rechtin dinged the shifter. “The gear shifter knob is ridiculously oversized, like the size of the World Cup trophy,” he said. “I get it. It’s so you can work the controls while wearing work gloves, but it’s almost cartoonish.” The truck rode smoothly on well-kept and level surfaces but was jumpy and stiff everywhere else. Amusingly (or should it be bemusedly) the truck had a tendency to self-aim toward the roadside shoulder when crossing our drive loop’s cattle guards at brisk but not outrageous speeds. \nFrom their hauling and towing abilities to trailer-attaching in-truck electronic guidance to the quality of materials lining the cab’s innards to the sticker prices slapped on the driver-side window, pickups have never been more impressive. Which means the eager, post-peak secondhand pickup shoppers have a lot of F-150 to look forward to. 2017 Ford F-150 Platinum 4×4 EcoBoost BASE PRICE",

Tony Branda, SAAC, and other Shelby specialists have provided technical support, and/or parts. The car has less than 100 miles since completion and is in what we consider the 'shake-down' stage. We've seen hundreds of fabulous Mustangs and restomods here at Park Place over the years and, to put it simply, This Is An AWESOME Car. If you're ready to stand out with an iconic American classic that is the perfect mix of muscle car attitude and first class modern performance, featuring a no-nonsense combination of menacing looks and vicious street manners, this is your kind of car.This awesome Mustang was built to honor the very rare and prestigious Shelby GT350H, also known as the Hertz Rent-A-Racer. True originals fetch in excess of $200,000 and you wouldn't dare drive one. With this fine example, you can be the center of attention at your local car show, and enjoy a car that you can be very proud of and not be afraid to drive. This Mustang GT350H is ready to be driven, shown, admired and enjoyed for years to come and will make a fine addition to any garage.This car has had a careful ground up restoration and detailing to be a drivable yet very high-grade representative of the 1966 Shelby GT350 Hertz model. Though Not 100% true to the original Shelby GT350's, care was taken with the car to use correct components in every opportunity, providing a realistic appearance and driving experience with some emphasis on low maintenance and safety. The very straight and solid body was completely stripped and fitted with a Dynacorn steel frame hood before being painted in the Black and Gold Hertz paint scheme. All new gaskets and seals were installed with new windshield glass and correct Shelby plexiglass quarter windows. New stainless glass trim and windshield wiper arms were installed along with new bumpers and overriders. A new fuel tank, fuel lines, brakelines and wire harnesses were fitted followed by a completely new interior top to bottom. An AM/FM slide bar stereo with I-pod connection from CustomAutoSound was installed in the dash along with new stereo in-dash speaker. Details like the Shelby dash mounted tachometer, new full gauge panel, and Shelby Lap belts were given care to be correct and functional. All lighting has been replaced with new assemblies, lenses, and bulbs.Under the hood of this example is a freshly rebuilt .030 over 289, built to A code spec's with a warmer Comp Cams hydraulic cam eliminating the mechanical lifter maintenance issues. Topped by an Edelbrock intake manifold and new Holley 715cfm S2M LeMans carb. A correct Cobra air cleaner, hollow letter valve covers and high capacity T-pan are installed. The motor has been fitted with a Ford Motorsports windage tray and Ford high volume oil pump. Ignition is Pertonix electronic with rev limiter and matching chrome coil. Exhaust is handled by new Hedman Elite headers in black ceramic and flowing into a 2.5 all stainless steel Magnaflow exhaust system with X-pipe and quiet mufflers exiting chromed stainless down-turn tips. A new alternator with correct Shelby pulley and spacers, new starter, new battery, cables and solenoid, along with a correct new windshiel",

      "title": "The Latest Ideas in Loyalty from Amex, IHG, Ford and the Wall Street Journal",
      "text": "by Gary Leff on November 28, 2016 \nLast Friday IHG Rewards Club hosted a ‘loyalty summit’ in New York at the Kimpton Eventi that I attended. \nIt was a small group, in an intimate space, although super cool — directly outside the window they control a bright screen where their program logo was displayed. \nThere was a great conversation around loyalty with some very thoughtful people — although I’m not sure why they held the event (and indeed it was their second, after an earlier one in London). \nThey certainly looked to be trying to position themselves at the forefront of loyalty although with such a small group I’m not sure they made much progress there and more fundamentally while they seemed to have the ideas right IHG Rewards Club itself seems to suffer a cognitive dissonance – a belief that they’re executing on these ideas when they do so less than most of their competitors. \nIHG produced a booklet given out to participants: Meaningful Membership: Transforming Membership in “The Age of I” . Here’s what I thought was the real money quote: \nMeaningful membership makes money because members who are truly loyal buy more often, become more committed to the brand, become less price sensitive while becoming more resistant to competitive offers, are more willing to recommend, and are more profitable… Enthusiasm is an individual choosing your brand even if their second choice brand costs less. Brand enthusiasts perceive the brand as having trustworthy brand value. The higher the trustworthy brand value, the greater the brand contribution to the organization’s Trust Capital. \nBack in March Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson was quoted as saying that loyalty comes down to quality and value. I told him why I disagree , and I basically heard my arguments being repeated back to me here. \nSome of my takeaways from the conversation: IHG Rewards Club says they have 98 million members. That’s a lot more than I expected, so I’m a bit skeptical of the number. It would place them as the second largest program behind American AAdvantage. \nReaders of the Wall Street Journal are about ambition or success so that’s how they position ancillary products. \nThere are ‘attitudinally loyal’ customers who do not buy frequently. The Porsche Owners Club has members who do not own and will not ever own a Porsche. But they are tremendously brand loyal. Communities offer meaningful membership. I wonder what this says about the 25 stay Hyatt Diamonds who are being discarded next year. \nIt was interesting that American Express was on the panel — but not Chase or MasterCard, who are IHG’s current credit card partners in the U.S. American Express reports 10 million members in the U.S., which I took to mean Membership Rewards customers. \nThere was certainly discussion of customers that are ‘margin negative’— about anticipating those customers, and narrowing offerings to appeal to target customers. \nDavid Sanabria from Ford emphasized that they view themselves have having “responsibility to be relevant and loyal to those who we talk about being loyal to us.” \nDelta was noted for thanking customers not only for being loyal SkyMiles members — but offering onboard thank you’s for corporate customers (“thank you for being a Coca-Cola employee with Delta.”) \nWhen a customer complains, recognize their issue and address is. Loyal customers usually aren’t looking for ‘distributive justice’ compensation. They want to be heard and to make sure the issue doesn’t repeat. So address the issue and fix it. At a hotel, if they had an air conditioning issue on their last stay, welcome them on their next stay noting the problem they had and assuring that their room has been checked and the air conditioning works. When a customer is dealing with a problem over the phone, keep the first person who answers on the phone with them so they don’t have to explain their issue over and over when getting transferred. \nUltimately I think the basics of loyalty are the same today (and in the future) as they have been in the past, no matter how many consultants tell brands they need to change to be relevant to millennials. Loyalty marketing is about recognition (elite program) and reward (earn and burn). \nCustomers are increasingly cynical of institutions and brands, and that is fault of brands – devaluations without notice, enhancements that are really devaluations. Too many consultants are telling programs they need to offer low value rewards that are easy to claim. That’s a cop out. It’s important to demonstrate value from the program quickly to earn credibility with customers. But low value rewards demonstrate low value . The key is to offer real value and do so authentically .

      "text": "What We Know About Ford’s All-New 2017 Fiesta, A Day Before The Official Reveal | By Share Ford is going to lift the veil off their all-new Fiesta supermini and we gathered all the information we have in one place. The new generation of Ford’s supermini model has rather big shoes to fill, as the current Fiesta has proved to be rather popular, combining good looks with a fun-to-drive character and punchy little engines. Since the first time we spotted a camouflaged test car , it was obvious that the new Fiesta is bound to grow slightly in size, as Ford reshuffles its small-car strategy with the introduction of the new KA+ . This size increase will not only allow the Fiesta to further distance itself from the new baby Ford but is also a first-class opportunity to position itself a bit more upmarket in the segment. Growing bigger though is just not enough for the Fiesta to become more upscale, with Ford having to improve other areas like the perceived quality of the cabin materials along with the fit and finish, as well as inject it with a brave dose of the latest technologies, including the infotainment and active safety systems. Speaking of which, Ford will definitely use their latest SYNC3 infotainment system with an adequately big touchscreen display -at least in the more expensive trim levels- and throw their latest active safety and driver assist systems into the Fiesta. The new Ford Fiesta will also continue to be offered in three- and five-door versions, unlike most of its rivals which are offered only with a five-door body. The new generation’s design is expected to be more mature , taking a lot of styling cues from Ford’s bigger models, including a different take on the front grille combined with a set of simplified headlights and a rearranged rear end with horizontally-positioned taillights. As for the available engines, expect to see a revised range of three- and four-cylinder EcoBoost engines, including the 1.0-litre and the 1.5-litre units, being offered in various states of tune. Ford keeps its mouth shut as far as technical details go but recent reports suggest we’ll see a new 1.5-litre diesel unit too, at least in Europe. Ford is keen on giving us a successor to the mighty Fiesta ST model too, although we don’t know which engine it will use; some reports say that the hot version of the Fiesta will be powered by an upgraded version of the 1.0-litre EcoBoost, others claim that it will use the 1.5-litre of the same family. All we know for sure is that Ford has already announced that they will halve the production of their four-cylinder engines in the UK. Stay tuned for the reveal of the all-new Ford Fiesta tomorrow, on November 29, at 20:00 CET (2 pm EST). Photo Credits: CarPix for CarScoops PHOTO GALLERY",

      "text": "Ford \nThere are two key issues in the US auto industry at the moment.\nNumber one: SUVs and pickups are selling like crazy. US sales this year could equal or top 2015's record of 17.5 million, driven largely by consumer demand for crossovers and pickups.\nPassenger cars are another story. Sales have been weak, leading some automakers, notable Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, to back off from US production in order to use that manufacturing capacity to build more trucks.\nMoving the assembly of those vehicles to Mexico, where many automakers have or are constructing plants, is an appealing solution.\nBut Donald Trump attacked these plans during the election, even though his preferred target, Ford, has been operating in Mexico since the 1960s. As a candidate, he threatened to slap a 35% tariff on vehicles built in Mexico coming into the US.\nNumber two: Automakers are up against rising fuel-economy standards. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements for the large automakers selling vehicles in the US are suppose to rise to 54.5 mpg by 2025 — a goal that federal and regulators think is unlikely to be met, and that the automakers have been lobbying against.\nHard to come up with grand bargain You can probably see where this is going. Trump wants to make trouble for the automakers on the North American Free Trade Agreement front, demanding that they stop outsourcing production south of the border. But if his EPA shapes up to be as corporation-friendly as many suspect, the carmakers stand a pretty good chance of getting a CAFE break.\nThey'll love that. But given that major car companies are investing $24 billion in Mexico, according to Bloomberg , they're going to hate whatever inflexibility a Trump administration imposes on them.\nFord \nThere really isn't an easy way to deal with this, resolving the two big issues to everyone's satisfaction. Auto labor costs are not going to decline in the US to anything that even vaguely resembles what they are in Mexico, where a worker will be paid $10 an hour while a US worker could get close to $60. \nAuto manufacturing jobs are also skilled-labor positions, and employers have to pay for that skill, depending on the market they're operating in. The calculations that US carmakers are being compelled to confront is the meager profits of smaller passenger cars versus the fat profits of trucks and SUVs; they'd like to use their costly US labor force to build their most profitable vehicles.\nThe linkage with the CAFE debate is of course that building a lot of trucks and SUVs — the vehicles that consumers wants — runs counter to meeting the CAFE goals. So automakers would like to catch a break there, so that they can bank as much money as possible now, while the US market is booming at gas prices are low.\nThis suggests that although a love-hate relationship with Trump may persist, there could be some horse-trading that takes place. \nNOW WATCH: Trump said he prevented a Ford factory from leaving the US — but the company says the move was never planned \n",

      "text": "  The Ford C-Max Isn't As Dorky As It Looks by Jay Traugott   Well, it's still a little dorky, but in a good way. This is one of those cars that not enough people know about but should. The 2017 Ford C-Max Hybrid may not look like all that much from the outside , but step inside and you’ll better understand it for what it really is – a raised and slightly more spacious Focus hatchback. Our C-Max Hybrid tester came powered by a 2.0-liter inline-four paired to two electric motors for a combined output of 190 hp, which is 54 more ponies than the Toyota Prius. Power is sent to the front wheels through a CVT. We know. Boring, right? Only to a certain point, because here’s the thing: the C-Max Hybrid is one of the best family vehicles on the market today. Not everyone needs a larger minivan or wants a crossover. In many ways, the C-Max Hybrid could be a good solution for those who are looking to replace their Mazda5 MPV. The C-Max Hybrid has a premium interior feel, smooth ride and, most importantly, is more fun to drive than a Prius. We were also pleasantly surprised to see that it can drive in electric-only mode for up to 62 mph. Is the C-Max Hybrid kind of dorky? A bit, perhaps, but we happen to think it doesn’t receive the amount of attention it deserves. Special thanks to Future Ford of Sacramento for letting us film the car.",

      "text": "Ford expands program to employ autistic workers KO By Kyle O'Brien - 28 November 2016 16:14pm \nIn May, the Ford Motor Company began a pilot program to train individuals with autism in the workplace . Recently, the automaker said that it was expanding the program to employ adults with autism, bringing on an additional 12 to 24 hires in 2017, according to reports by the Automotive News and Benchmark Monitor. Ford is expanding its FordInclusiveWorks program to employe more adults with autism \nFord hired its first four adults with autism who have college degrees to work in its product development department at its headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, for the FordInclusiveWorks program, in partnership with the Autism Alliance of Michigan . The four original employees were on temporary status to start but all have become regular employees at Ford. \n\"When we started, we wanted to make sure we could do this and do it sustainably,\" said Kirstin Queen, manager of diversity and inclusion at Ford, in the Automotive News story. \"The program was found to be very successful, and the supervisors have said these individuals brought a new energy that spread to other employees.\" \nThe Autism Alliance of Michigan is a non-profit that works with nearly 40 companies, including Ford, training staffers on making structured tasks, and how to interact with the new employees so everyone succeeds, including socially. \n“The work is highly structured, requires a great deal of focus, and calls for a high level of attention to detail and organization. Skills required to complete this task safely and with a high level of quality lend themselves to strengths typically associated with individuals with autism,” said a press release on the Ford website. \n“We applaud Ford for recognizing the value in employing people with autism,\" said Autism Speaks Vice President of Adult Services Leslie Long on the Autism Speaks website when Ford initially announced the program. \"This trend of tapping into a labor pool that is skilled and engaged is critical for companies to be successful in the next century.” \nThe expansion of the program has already begun and the extra jobs are expected to be filled by January.",

      "text": "For Ford Motor Company (F) and General Motors Company (GM), Trade Trumps Trump GM and Ford cannot afford a trade war By Dana Blankenhorn , InvestorPlace Contributor | Nov 28, 2016, 10:46 am EST Source: William Oliver via Flickr (Modified) \nShares in Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F ) and General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ) jumped after the results since Trump says he wants an industrial policy that will benefit heavy machinery and car sales. \nBut the bulls may be making a mistake . A trade war would be very, very bad for the automakers . \nEven with the recent bull run, both stocks are bargains. Ford sells at a price-to-earnings multiple of 6.6, against an S&P 500 average of 18. That of GM is even lower — it’s below 3.9. Buy the stock today and your earnings could equal the price you pay before the next presidential election. Ford Stock Is a Multinational \nFord is less an American auto company than a multinational that happens to be based in America. It makes its design and production decisions based on where it can get a competitive advantage. The Best Investments for 2017 \nFord, which has already invested $2 billion in India, is now building a technology center there that will employ 12,000 people. Its new EcoSport SUV will be made in India and imported to the U.S. market . \nFord’s factory in Brazil is producing cars around-the-clock while it is idling four U.S. plants while sales catch up to production of its F-150 truck. The new Ford Bronco is going to be developed in Australia . It is still moving small car production to Mexico , despite Trump’s threats to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), though they did decide not to move Lincoln MKC production . \nThese are the kinds of moves that let Ford beat earnings expectations for its third quarter , earning 26 cents per share while analysts had been expecting 21. Revenue came in at $35.9 billion. To put it in perspective, that’s over five times more than Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM ) brought in all of last year. \nCEO Mark Fields says the company is rushing headlong into a future where it will no longer be a car company, but a “mobility” company . It is using Blackberry Ltd (NASDAQ: BBRY ) in its cars and could easily buy the company, which is worth $4 billion, even while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) could probably buy Ford itself with seat-cushion money, given its over $200 billion in cash against Ford’s market cap of under $48 billion. \nFord’s future, in short, is not going to wait on Donald Trump.",
