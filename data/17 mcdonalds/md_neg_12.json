      "text": "\nNintendo and McDonald's have a long history of cross promotion, and it appears that the fast food giant will soon be offering Mario toys with their Happy Meals, presumably to coincide with the release of Super Mario Run . Nintendo Everything came across a promotional flyer for employees of UK McDonald's locations that says Mario and friends will be given away in Happy Meals from January 11 to February 7 next year.\n\nNo word on whether the promotion will be available in other territories yet, but it seems likely given the global appeal of iPhones, McDonald's, and Mario. The flyer mentions that Mario is searching for Yoshi, so it's possible that might be the goal of Super Mario Run .\nHappy Meal toys are kind of a sneaky way to get kids to beg for fast food, but there's no denying it works. I remember pleading to go to McDonald's back in 1989 when the Super Mario 3 figures launched. I had the spring loaded Mario figure that you could make \"jump\" by pressing his suction cup down to the base. It was great until the plastic cracked and the suction cup couldn't grip the base anymore. Oh well.\nWhile we're on the subject, that Happy Meal box dressed up like Mario is more than a little freaky. It looks kind of like the end result of a minion making love to one of those MAGA ornaments .\n \n\nSuper Mario Happy Meals will be back at McDonald's UK starting next month [NintendoEverything]",

The burger giant has been experimenting with various ways to make its burgers fresher, hotter and tastier as competition with \"better burger\" places increases. The fresh beef tests only include the chain's Quarter Pounder sandwiches. (julie.jargon@wsj.com)\nContaining Russia Pig Disease May Hit Grains -- Market Talk\n1719 GMT - Measures to contain an outbreak of African swine fever among Russia's pigs would affect the global grain market, says Andrey Sizov, managing director of research institute Sovecon. Food-safety agency Rosselkhoznadzor said Friday it will decide this week whether to impose a quarantine following an outbreak of the virus, which is transmittable by contaminated grain, in the Krasnodar region. \"I think the risk is quite low, but if they block all ports in Krasnodar there will be a huge effect on total Russian grain exports and a huge effect on the world market,\" says Andrey Sizov. More than half of Russia's grain is shipped through Krasnodar at ports including Novorossiysk and Tuapse.

That's better than last year at this time, when just 55% of the nation's winter wheat crop earned the same high marks, and forecasts for rainfall in the southern Plains next weekend could benefit the crop further.

      "text": "0 \nMario didn't get that physique just by eating pasta \nNintendo and McDonald's have a long history of cross promotion, and it appears that the fast food giant will soon be offering Mario toys with their Happy Meals, presumably to coincide with the release of Super Mario Run . Nintendo Everything came across a promotional flyer for employees of UK McDonald's locations that says Mario and friends will be given away in Happy Meals from January 11 to February 7 next year. \nNo word on whether the promotion will be available in other territories yet, but it seems likely given the global appeal of iPhones, McDonald's, and Mario. The flyer mentions that Mario is searching for Yoshi, so it's possible that might be the goal of Super Mario Run . \nHappy Meal toys are kind of a sneaky way to get kids to beg for fast food, but there's no denying it works. I remember pleading to go to McDonald's back in 1989 when the Super Mario 3 figures launched. I had the spring loaded Mario figure that you could make \"jump\" by pressing his suction cup down to the base. It was great until the plastic cracked and the suction cup couldn't grip the base anymore. Oh well. \nWhile we're on the subject, that Happy Meal box dressed up like Mario is more than a little freaky. It looks kind of like the end result of a minion making love to one of those MAGA ornaments . You are logged out. Login | Sign up",

      "text": "\nWe McDonald continues to deliver great performances. This time with a version of Billie Holiday’s “God Bless The Child.” The live playoffs are upon us as the top 10 hopeful artists compete to come out on top on The Voice.\nThe name Wé is Kenyan for “diligence,” which is something that Wé has had her entire life. Her father helped her get into vocal lessons at the Harlem School of the Arts, which she still attends after school and on weekends. Wé has performed at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and, most recently, at the Apollo Theater. Although Wé has always found her place with music, she struggled to fit in at school. Kids teased her for her high-pitched voice and thick glasses, but she stuck it out and slowly things got better. Now she embraces her differences and is hoping her uniqueness will help her stand out on The Voice.\nIn the final live-performance phase of the competition, the Top 12 artists compete each week against each other during a live broadcast. The television audience votes to save their favorite artists. The three artists with the lowest number of votes are eligible for the “Instant Save.” These artists each perform a new song that represents why they should earn the save. Then, America has the opportunity to save their favorite performer by tweeting #VoiceSave along with the artist’s name. The singers with the lowest number of votes are sent home each week. In the end, one is named “The Voice” and receives the grand prize of a recording contract.\nShare with us who you liked during the live playoffs in the comments section. Whose performance do you think was better? Who do you think will ultimately win the competition?\nThe Voice Social Media Reactions Guys… I really really want @we_mcdonald to win this season. This performance is #voicetop10 @NBCTheVoice \n— Brian Wayne Johnson (@BWJohnsonMusic) November 29, 2016 \n\n@we_mcdonald is God bless!! #voicetop10 \n— Christina (@Christina16S) November 29, 2016 \n\nSee you in the #VoiceFinale , @we_mcdonald ! That was epic! #VoiceTop10 \n— Jacob Elyachar (@JacobElyachar) November 29, 2016 \n\nSuperstars Miley Cyrus and Alicia Keys join coaches Adam Levine and Blake Shelton and host Carson Daly this season. For the first time, a pair of female coaches will command the red chairs for NBC’s immensely popular musical competition series. The show’s innovative format features five stages of competition: the first begins with the blind auditions, followed by the battle rounds, the knockouts, the live playoffs and, finally, the live performance shows.\nIn the final live-performance phase of the competition, the Top 12 artists compete each week against each other during a live broadcast.

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nOne person was in custody and two other people were on the run after a police-involved shooting that involved a stolen car in front of a Fort Lauderdale fast-food restaurant Monday afternoon, according to police. \nThe incident, which began when officers spotted a stolen car, happened at about 12:15 p.m. Monday in front of McDonald's, 2300 W. Sunrise Blvd. \nAs the officers approached the car, two people inside got out and took off on foot, police said. One of the two was seen discarding a gun, police said. \nMeanwhile, police said, the driver took off and hit an officer with his car. \nAt that point, two officers opened fire on the car, but it was not clear if anyone was hit, according to police. \nThe driver went over a curb and headed west on Sunrise Boulevard, initially traveling west in the eastbound lanes. \nThe suspect who was seen ditching a gun was later taken into custody in the area of the 2200 block of Northwest Eighth Court. The firearm was also found, police said. \nThe stolen vehicle, a silver Ford Fusion, was later found in the area of the 2800 block of Northwest 15th Court, but no one was inside. \nPolice are still looking for the driver and one of the two people who took off on foot. \nThe officer who was struck by the car was taken to Broward Health Medical Center with minor injuries. \nAnyone with information is asked to call Fort Lauderdale Police Department at 954-828-5534.",

      "title": "NBC’s ‘The Voice’ review: Ali Caldwell, Christian Cuevas, We McDonald perform in top 10 show",
      "text": "NBC’s ‘The Voice’ review: Ali Caldwell, Christian Cuevas, We McDonald perform in top 10 show   \nTonight, the top ten show for “ The Voice ” is here! We’re going to be seeing some big performances over the course of the hour, and our hope here is that they’ll find a way to stand out, and for some contenders to rise to the table to the point that they establish themselves as favorites. Right now, we’d consider Billy Gilman and We McDonald to be the slam dunks, with Sundance Head and Ali Caldwell being on the list of possible contenders for the time being. \nAs per usual, we’re going to be offering up some further updates on the performance show over the course of the night. Be sure to refresh the night for more updates! We’re also ranking the performances from worst to first. \n10. Josh Gallagher, “Real Good Man” – It feels almost cruel to consistently put Josh so low on our personal list of performances on the night, but it’s really not at all due to the quality of his performances. It’s more due to the fact that they don’t do anything that separate themselves from the field. We greatly value originality, and unfortunately, we’re not really feeling that here. \n9. Courtney Harrell, “If I Could Turn Back Time” – One thing that we do really appreciate from this performance was that it felt very much like a modern rock song and didn’t feel nearly as dated as we could’ve imagined this song being on paper. Courtney came out with a lot of vocal firepower, and we really do think that she owned this. We just think she needed a little more intonation to go along with it. \n8. Sundance Head, “Me and Jesus” – This was a good revival performance, but for the sake of this show, it falls more into the Josh Gallagher camp of not really doing anything original or exciting. We do still think that it’s going to generate some good sales on iTunes, mostly because of the fact that “The Voice” fans do tend to love religious songs. \n7. Aaron Gibson, “Rocket Man” – This may not have been the best song for Aaron to give this sort of spin to, but it was a pretty cool, interesting idea! We’re always going to prefer someone trying something risky like this to someone basically doing the same thing we’ve heard many times before so a quick round of applause to Aaron here! \n6. Brendan Fletcher, “True Colors” – This was a really nice performance and a lovely vocal from Brendan, but at the same exact time we’d be wrong not to mention here that the saxophone really made this feel a little too much like a classic TV theme song from the 1970’s and took away from everything he was doing. \n5. Christian Cuevas, “Million Reasons” – This was a little bit shaky near the end of the performance, but at the same time probably his best performance of the show without question. We felt a genuine emotional connection to the lyrics, while at the same time we really got a genuine sense from him that he was invested in the lyrics. \n4. Billy Gilman, “Anyway” – Billy went a little bit back to his country roots for this performance, while still putting his modern spin on it. While we wouldn’t see that he completely changed the game with this, it was another powerful performance from a guy who’s probably not going to be in danger anytime soon. He certainly got the judges off their feet to start things off! \n3. We McDonald, “God Bless the Child” – Really great swagger and performance from We over the course of this performance. She showed that she has the capacity to be almost a completely different person the moment that she steps up on stage with the microphone. While Alicia Keys really wanted her to play out that operatic side at the end of the performance, that to us was the only negative. It just took us out of everything else. \n2. Austin Allsup, “Missing You” – We mentioned before the show that “Missing You” was a song that we really loved from the 1980’s, and we were surprised to see Austin do it on the show. While it didn’t have the vocal theatrics of many of the other performances, but we were all about everything from the arrangement to the vocals to the emotion he showed. Easily Austin’s best performance on the season. \n1. Ali Caldwell, “Without You” – Talk about a comeback! We’ll admit that this isn’t our favorite song like “Missing You,” but she completely killed this vocal. She hit all of the notes, played into the drama of the song, and didn’t overdo the runs and do anything that took away from the melody. \nIf you want to get some other news when it comes to “The Voice,” be sure to head over to the link here !

      "text": "Deer nabs McDonald's trophy on buzzer beater By Robert Avery, ravery@hcnonline.com Published 10:30 am, Monday, November 28, 2016 \nIf coaches want terrific competition early in the high school basketball season, they know they'll likely find it at the McDonald's Texas Invitational. \nAs usual, Deer Park found it with games Thursday, Friday and Saturday, topped by a contest against state-ranked Angleton last Friday morning at the Deer Park north campus. \nThe Wildcats had visions of a title, but Deer Park hurt those rankings with a 60-49 victory. Angleton would go on to lose a third tournament contest, falling to McKinney 72-54 in the consolation finals at Sam Rayburn High School Saturday afternoon. \nFor head coach Darren Chandler team, the win over Angleton highlighted a 3-2 record for the three-day event. \nA close second and arguably its best moment was the team's final game in which the maroon and gold dramatically nipped Fort Bend Ridge Point 63-62 for the Division 2 Silver third-place trophy, a limestone replica of the San Jacinto Monument. \nWith the exception of a handful of seconds in the third period when the team was up 42-40, Deer Park trailed the entire contest until the final two seconds of the game. \nAn inbounds play from the baseline resulted in Tristan Ikpe scoring the game-winning points. \n\"The kids executed it great. He (Ikpe) was one of two options. As aggressive as they were on defense, we kind of thought that was the best option and it sure was,\" said Chandler. \n\"We got off to a slow start. They were killing us on the glass. \nThey had 11 offensive boards in the first half and zero offensive boards in the second half. We cleaned that up and came back from 10 or 12 down,\" said Chandler as he scouted the game between Memorial and South Houston later Saturday afternoon. \nDeer Park's pool of three teams finished Thursday's action all with 1-1 records. \nDeer Park lost to Katy Taylor 46 -43 in its first tournament test, but bounced back to defeat Grapevine and former South Houston head coach Jeremy Mills 71-63. Grapevine then turned around and belted Katy Taylor Thursday night 56-38. \nOnce in bracket play, the team was kept from the title contest by a 53-48 overtime loss in the semifinals to a good Langham Creek squad that was missing four players because of football. \n\"We were up six with four minutes to go and we kind of stopped playing,\" said Chandler, who watched the team prior to that go on a 23-4 rampage to forge the advantage. \nLangham Creek went on to capture the Silver title by downing La Porte 60-48. \nDeer Park had just earned the big win over Angleton some four hours earlier so Friday was a highly-competitive day for Chandler's guys. \n\"Against Angleton, we kind of started out slow, got down, but in the second half we started playing well. \nWe got a little lead and rode that the rest of the way because of our defense. \nWhen we get back on defense, our defense is really tough to beat,\" said Zach Walker , praising the work of the team's man-to-man scheme. \n\"Everyone knows their roles. We accept our roles and we do it to the best we can.\" \nThe only Division 2 team to finish unbeaten in the massive tournament was Hebron, which defeated Humble 62-44 for the title. \nIn Division I, Spring Westfield won it all with a 61-54 victory over Allen.

      "text": "We McDonald ‘God Bless The Child’“The Voice” Video: Watch Top 10 Performance! Truth rating: 10 By Shari Weiss | 9:26 pm, November 28th, 2016 VIDEO (NBC) \nWe McDonald performed Billie Holiday’s “God Bless The Child” during “The Voice” on Monday. Watch below! \nAs Gossip Cop has reported, McDonald has been one of the favorites of season 11. Only 17 years old, the aspiring star has consistently given confident, big-voiced performances. Last week, she was extremely current with Rihanna’s “Love On The Brain,” but now for the Top 10 show, she opted to perform a decades-old classic. \nHoliday released the much-covered “God Bless The Child” back in 1942, and it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1976. In rehearsals, McDonald now revealed that the music icon is “one of my favorite singers,” and admitted, “I’m nervous because I feel like I have to do her justice.” And, as she’s often insecure off-stage, the teen said she planned to “channel” some of coach Alicia Keys’“swag.” \nShe did that and more come show time, even talking to the audience like it was her own concert, and going operatic towards the end of the performance. Host Carson Daly said the crowd was “enamored,” and noted McDonald received one of the “strongest” reactions of the night. An approving Keys also exclaimed, “There’s nobody like you! It’s just incredible to see you.” Check out the video below! \nEnter your email address here to receive daily news updates from us.",

      "title": "Yeah, I Ate That: McDonald's goes full sconnie with cheese curds and brats",
      "text": "PHOTO COURTESY OF MCDONALD'S \nMcDonald's is selling cheese curds, made with real Wisconsin cheese, for a limited time. \nNormally, cheese curds wouldn’t be exotic enough to rate a mention in the Yeah, I Ate That column. This is Wisconsin, after all — you should be able to hold out your hand and count on a piece of cheese falling from the sky and into your palm. \nBut this week’s column isn’t so much about what the food is, but where it came from. \nMcDonald’s is making cheese curds now. \nStarting last week, all McDonald’s locations in Wisconsin began selling little boxes of the deep-fried darlings for $2.99 (two for $5 on the Pick Two menu) for a limited time. This came on the heels of the fast food chain’s new Wisconsin-centric Johnsonville brat. \nMcDonald’s says that all the cheese in their curds comes from Wisconsin farms. To continue the Badger State connection, the box is stamped with the Green Bay Packers logo (which doesn’t put Wisconsinites in the best of moods lately, but whatever) and the slogan: “Eat like a local.” \nHey, McDonald’s? We’re in Wisconsin. We always eat like the locals. We ARE the locals. \nKudos to the chain for supporting Wisconsin cuisine, but it does feel a little strange to order cheese curds at a McDonald’s drive-thru. I’ve had cheese curds from Culver’s which are pretty good, but that’s a Wisconsin-born chain. Having McDonald’s offer its own — even with homegrown cheese inside — feels a little like cheese curd carpetbagging, doesn’t it? \nInside the box are 12 to 15 curds of various sizes, which is a little light for three bucks. The McDonald’s cheese curds thankfully avoid the pitfall of many fried cheese curds — excessive breading. Perhaps because the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board was involved in connecting the restaurant with local farms, the cheese is front and center here, with the breading just a thin casing. Don't miss a thing. Get a Cap Times daily summary sent to   \nAnd while the cheese is tasty enough, the breading doesn’t have the flavoring or crunch I had hoped for. It was surprisingly disappointing that the curds didn’t come with a container of ranch dressing, or any sauce at all, for dipping. It made for an undeniably cheesy, but sort of bland eating experience. \nI got one of the Johnsonville brats on another visit, by the way. Having enjoyed brats on the grill all summer long, the comedown to a McDonald’s-made brat was pretty steep. Warning: the brat comes with mustard and ketchup on it. I know of brat people who prefer mustard and brat people who prefer ketchup. I don’t know anybody who likes both. \nOverall, McDonald’s foray into Wisconsin cuisine is well-meaning, but with so many other options for curds and brats at our disposal, why would we go to McDonald’s except in an emergency? Maybe what McDonald’s needs to do is put cheese curds on the menu in any every state except Wisconsin, letting folks in Delaware, New Mexico and Alabama know what they’ve been missing all this time.

      "text": "Alleged worker exploitation at McDonald’s in Malaysia AP file photo Tweet Published: 4:25 PM, November 29, 2016 \nKUALA LUMPUR — The Guardian on Tuesday (Nov 29) reported of alleged exploitation of migrant workers by a labour supplier to McDonald’s in Malaysia, in the British newspaper’s continuing series that previously exposed such practises by two international electronics giants here. \nAccording to its report published on Tuesday, migrant workers employed by the chain through a third-party labour supplier claim they were misled about their pay, cheated of their wages through deceptive fees, and had their travel document taken. \nThe workers, mostly from Nepal, told the newspaper that some among them have allegedly been exploited for months and others for years by Human Connection, the firm that supplies manpower to McDonald’s in Kuala Lumpur. \nThey further alleged that they were paid as little as £0.60 (S$1.06) an hour; below the minimum wage of RM4.33 (S$1.38) per hour, but has since been increased. \n“They claim they were deceived about their wages and were charged additional fees when they arrived in Malaysia, resulting in a 25 per cent deduction in their basic monthly salary. Over the course of working at McDonald’s, this equated to the loss of months of wages,” the report said. \nSome workers had reportedly also gone on strike earlier this year, in protest of their late salaries. \n“We didn’t have the money to eat because we were not paid regularly. \n“How can we go to work on an empty stomach? I thought it was a good company and I would earn good money. Now my life is damaged. I feel that I have no future,” one worker was quoted saying. \nThe Guardian said that it interviewed 15 Nepalese workers who were previously deployed at four McDonald’s restaurants in Kuala Lumpur, and who had worked at McDonald’s at different times over a three-year period. \nMore than half of the workers claimed that they were forced to abandon the jobs without their passports or unpaid wages, and entered the illegal work market in a desperate bid to earn some money. \nThe Guardian said that it was informed by McDonald’s that the company has ended its contract with Human Connection. \n“At McDonald’s Malaysia, the welfare of staff is a top priority. \n“Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards. As a result, we have terminated our contract with them,” McDonald’s reportedly said in its reply. \nThe UK newspaper previously exposed migrant worker exploitation at the plants of electronics firms Samsung and Panasonic in Malaysia. \nLast week, Samsung and Panasonic said they have started probes into the serious allegations of exploitative practises in their supply chains in Malaysia that included extortion and forced labour of migrants.

      "text": "Workers at some McDonald’s outlets in Kuala Lumpur have been exploited , according to an investigation by the Guardian .\nThe British newspaper says it spoke to 15 Nepali men who were employed by a labor supply agency and sent to various McDonald's mcd outlets in Kuala Lumpur.\nOver the course of three years, the agency, Human Connections, allegedly exploited the men, illegally withholding passports, forcing them to live in squalid and unsanitary conditions, and withholding their salaries, which were as low as 70 cents an hour.\nHuman Connections did not immediately respond to Fortune’s requests for comment. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on McDonald’s part.\nDuring the period investigated by the Guardian , several of the men were said to have gone back to Nepal, reportedly using middle men who charged up to two months' wages to arrange new documentation and flights; others entered the illegal job market.\nSome of the workers talked to who talked to the paper said that they had told the fast food chain about the situation. \"I complained about our salary to McDonald's many times,\" one man told the Guardian .\n\"When we went to meet the managers of McDonald's to complain,\" said another to the paper, \"they usually said we were not employed by McDonald's and they are not responsible for anything.”\nMcDonald's said, in a statement reported by the Guardian , \"Because the workers are not employees of McDonald's, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald's to assume responsibility for paying workers directly. In the interim, to assist, we authorized restaurants to provide food and provisions to workers affected while we worked to address the issue.”\nThe Guardian also reported that McDonald’s had ended its contract with the employment agency Human Connection.\nOne McDonald’s branch manager told the Guardian that \"The labor supply company withheld two to three months' wages. The workers only had a photocopy of their documents, but they should have had the original with them. We are humans. We tried to help them with food, but you can't do it all the time.\"\nSeveral workers remain stranded in Malaysia.\nFor more on McDonald’s, watch this Fortune video: \n\n\"The great tragedy about this kind of exploitation is that it is actually easy to fix,\" said Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International to the Guardian . \"Companies operating and profiting from their business in places like Malaysia can't say that they are not aware of the issues facing migrant workers there.\"",

The officer ended up on the roof of the car. \nFort Lauderdale Detective Keven Dupree says that at that point, officers fired into the car. It's unknown if the driver was struck. \nThe hit officer was taken to a hospital with minor injuries. \nOfficers arrested one of the passengers who tried to flee. The driver and other passenger are still being sought. Related content",

      "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Two suspects are at large and one has been detained after a police-involved shooting in front of a McDonald's in Florida.\nFort Lauderdale police tell local news media that officers were attempting to stop a stolen Ford Fusion with three men inside Monday afternoon in a McDonald's drive-thru when two of the men jumped out of the car and fled on foot.\nPolice say the driver then attempted to speed away, hitting an officer as he did so. The officer ended up on the roof of the car.\nFort Lauderdale Detective Keven Dupree says that at that point, officers fired into the car. It's unknown if the driver was struck.\nThe hit officer was taken to a hospital with minor injuries.\nOfficers arrested one of the passengers who tried to flee. The driver and other passenger are still being sought.",

As the worker was handing Walker back his money, court documents say he aimed a gun at the fast food worker. Recommended for you",

      "text": "Cate Gillon/Getty Images \nMcDonald's is expanding a test of its most dramatic menu change in decades: the addition of fresh, never-frozen beef.\nThe fast-food chain is adding fresh beef patties to 75 restaurants in Northeast Oklahoma, following a test that started earlier this year in the Dallas-Forth Worth area .\nThe fresh patties will be used in McDonald's Quarter Pounder burgers,  which include the Quarter Pounder with cheese, the Double Quarter Pounder with cheese, the Quarter Pounder Deluxe, and the Bacon Clubhouse Burger. \n\"These burgers are hotter and juicier than our previous quarter pound patties, and are made with fresh 100% North American beef that’s simply seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper,\"  McDonald's Chef Chad Schafer said in a statement. \nMcDonalds said the Dallas-Fort Worth test was successful and received positive feedback from customers. \nSwitching to fresh beef represents a massive challenge for McDonald's, but one that could potentially pay off through an improved public image and better-tasting burgers.\nThe company has long relied on an extensive network of suppliers who make, freeze, and ship beef patties to its more than 14,000 restaurants in the US.\nExpanding the test would require a massive shake-up to that supply chain. \nCate Gillon/Getty Images Some franchisees have warned that at the restaurant level, it would introduce a whole range of new food-safety issues. \n\"I have major concerns over food safety and our lack of ability to serve a large number of customers quickly,\" one franchisee wrote in response to a survey by Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski in July .  \nT he potential for foodborne illnesses is higher when uncooked meat is kept at a temperature above 40 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the USDA. \nBut other franchisees said the change could improve business.  \n\"Faster cook times, juicier product, seared product versus stewed meat,\" one franchisee wrote. \nAnother said, \"Many customers perceive unfrozen to be better for you. Perception is everything.\" \nNOW WATCH: Why almost every pair of jeans has a zipper that says ‘YKK’ \n",

      "text": "Service union targets McDonald's, UPMC with wage rallies  27   14 minutes ago The Service Employees International Union is targeting McDonald's restaurants and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center with marches demanding a $15 minimum wage and union representation. The union contends UPMC shuttle bus workers have also gone on strike seeking union representation. UPMC, which is western Pennsylvania's dominant hospital network, had previously announced plans to increase the minimum starting wage for entry-level jobs at most facilities to $15 per hour by 2021. But the union contends UPMC needs to move faster and accused the network of trying to silence workers and union organizers. UPMC hasn't immediately commented. Organizers began their “Day of Disruption” marches at a McDonald's in Pittsburgh's East Liberty neighborhood Tuesday morning. The group plans similar protest near a McDonald's and the federal building downtown during the evening rush hour.

Perception is everything.\" \nNOW WATCH: The biggest security mistakes people make when buying things online \n\nMore From Business Insider \nThe real story behind McDonald’s mysterious 'Gold Card' — the ticket to unlimited free fast food that Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have in their wallets \nWe tried the special breakfast sandwich McDonald's is testing — and think it could be a huge hit \nBlack Friday online sales are about to hit an all-time high — here are the top-selling items",

That’s when the 39 people were arrested and transported to the Detroit Detention Center. The whole thing lasted about an hour. \nWWJ-AM reports some locked arms and sat in the middle of the roadway. The crowd chanted “We work, we sweat. Put 15 on our check.” \nThe protest is part of a nationwide campaign for higher hourly wages, including for workers at airports and fast-food restaurants. The campaign has included several rounds of actions, including multiple Michigan protests, since the efforts began in 2012.",

They planned to do it again at another fast-food restaurant at 5 p.m. \nSt. Louis police stood by as the 100 or so protesters marched, chanted and held signs outside the restaurant at 1119 North Tucker Boulevard. Managers had closed the dining area, and protesters blocked the drive-through for about a half-hour starting at 7 a.m. \nThey swarmed the window, chanting at the workers inside: \"Come on out, we've got your back.\" \nCommuters coming off the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge onto Tucker could see the lighted signs of the protesters. Some honked as they passed. Several cars that came onto the lot left after being confronted by the crowd. \nOrganizers say the St. Louis effort is part of a protest by workers in 340 cities nationwide. \nThe protesters were bused to the site, many taking the day off work on strike. The push is for more pay and a union. They were joined by people from labor unions and organized by Jobs with Justice, a St. Louis labor advocacy group. \nFrances Holmes, 53, of St. Louis, said Tuesday's effort was her fifth strike in recent years. She said she works at a Webster Groves fast-food restaurant, making $9 an hour. She was one of three people on her morning shift who skipped work to protest. \nHolmes took glee in seeing the protesters block the drive-through lanes and force the restaurant to close its dining room. \n\"That let them feel what we feel, no money coming in,\" she said. \nJaven Goode, 18, was in the crowd of protesters. Goode, 18, lives in Florissant with his mother. He makes $8 an hour at Subway. \n\"$15 an hour would give me a chance to move out,\" he said. \nGoode dreams of moving to California and designing computer games. He said he wanted Bernie Sanders, a proponent of the minimum wage hike, to be president. \n\"Man, we're going to have to work twice as hard now,\" he said. \nThe restaurant had security blocking the entrance, and the manager wasn't available for comment.

The march, which drew about 100 people, was otherwise peaceful, police said. \nHome health and child care providers, and some drivers for ride service Uber Technologies Inc were planning to join the action, which is backed by the Service Employees International Union. \nLast year Trump said U.S. workers' wages were \"too high\" and made the nation uncompetitive, but this year, he has said the minimum wage should rise, with states taking the lead. \nHopes of an increase in the $7.25-per-hour federal minimum wage were dashed earlier in November by the election of a Republican-controlled Congress, but advocates say they will continue to press for increases at state and local levels. \n\"We've already run a path to $15 (per hour) in states like California and New York, and we're not stopping now,\" said LiAnne Flakes, a 40-year-old child care worker from Tampa, Fla., who said she planned to protest. \nVoters in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington raised their state minimum wages in November, and labor groups are considering campaigns in states including New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New Mexico. \nHector Figueroa, president of 32BJ SEIU in New York, said Trump won the election by promising jobs for voters who were not able to see a way toward success for themselves or their children. \n\"There is no question to us that this is a moment that working people need to take action, mobilize, organize, and that (Trump) needs to be held accountable for his promises,\" Figueroa said. \nProtest organizers have also criticized Trump's pledge to deport up to 3 million undocumented workers with criminal records, as well as his treatment of women and Muslims. \nMcDonald's said in a statement that it invested in its workers by helping them to earn degrees and on-the-job skills. Franchisees, which own most U.S. fast-food restaurants, set wages for their employees. — Reuters Tags",

      "text": "A New York man has been arrested after reportedly hallucinating and going on a knife-wielding rampage inside a McDonald's on Black Friday.\nFortunately, only the floor of the restaurant was harmed.\nHancock, N.Y., police and New York State Police arrested the knife-wielding man who was reportedly hallucinating inside the McDonald's.\n\nPolice say on Friday at around 10:00 p.m., Braden Rose, 40, was seen stabbing at the floor of the restaurant in a violent state of paranoia.\nOfficers disarmed the man without incident and said it was determined he was hallucinating, believing he was being attacked by wild animals.\nAfter being evaluated, it was determined that he was under the influence of drugs, and was taken to Delaware Valley Hospital for treatment.\nThe man had ingested drugs at McDonald's , apparently.\nMoreover, in his possession, he had approximately one ounce of cocaine, 1.7 ounces of heroin, various pills and hypodermic needles.\nRose is charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance, two counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance and more.\nA lot more. So much more that he was arraigned in the Village of Hancock Court and remanded to the Delaware County Jail on $25,000.\nThe approximate value of the drugs seized is $10,000.\nWe don't have a video of this incident, but because crazy things going on at McDonald's are fairly common, we do have this for you:\n",

      "text": "TOPEKA, KS ( KSNT ) – A Topeka McDonald’s employee who put mustard into a Topeka Police Officer’s drink has been fired after a lengthy investigation by the cooperation. The District Attorney’s Office is opening a criminal investigation into the matter.\nIt all started with a photo shared on Facebook showing a law enforcement officer’s soda at a Topeka McDonald’s mixed with mustard has gone viral.\nThe Facebook group Kansas GOING BLUE posted the photo Sunday evening saying “a McDonald’s here in Kansas just served a Law Enforcement Officer on duty a Dr. Pepper with Mustard in a drive thru order. This is extremely unacceptable!!”\nThe incident reportedly happened at the McDonald’s located at 2001 North Topeka Boulevard.\nSupervisor at the McDonald’s, Gary Vaughn, tells KSNT News the issue has been handled internally but would not elaborate on what that meant.\nTom and Marilyn Dobski of McDonald’s Franchisees in Topeka released the following statement.\n“All customers, including local law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities, are always welcome at our restaurants. Immediately upon learning of this complaint, we began our own internal investigation to gather the facts. We are shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee. This employee no longer works for our organization. We proudly support police officers and all divisions of first responders at our restaurants across northeast Kansas.”\nThe Kansas Highway Patrol tells KSNT News this happened to one of their trooper’s about two weeks ago at the same location.",

      "text": "View Comments Print By -   \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - The Service Employees International Union is targeting McDonald’s restaurants and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center with marches demanding a $15 minimum wage and union representation. \nThe union contends UPMC shuttle bus workers have also gone on strike seeking union representation. \nUPMC, which is western Pennsylvania’s dominant hospital network, had previously announced plans to increase the minimum starting wage for entry-level jobs at most facilities to $15 per hour by 2021. \nBut the union contends UPMC needs to move faster and accused the network of trying to silence workers and union organizers. UPMC hasn’t immediately commented. \nOrganizers began their “Day of Disruption” marches at a McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood Tuesday morning. The group plans similar protest near a McDonald’s and the federal building downtown during the evening rush hour. \nCopyright © 2016 The Washington Times, LLC.",

This is extremely unacceptable!!\" \nThe Kansas Highway Patrol says a similar incident happened to one of their troopers about two weeks ago at the same location.",

      "text": "Officer Targeted in Cruel Prank at McDonald's posted by Jason Howerton - \nAn on-duty police officer in Topeka, Kansas, visited a local McDonald’s location, ordered a Dr. Pepper. He took a sip and immediately noticed something was wrong with his drink; it tasted awful. \nHe lifted the lid to find someone had seemingly poured mustard into the soda. \nThe employee responsible may have thought the prank targeting the officer was hilarious at the time — but he’s likely not laughing now. { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"live\", \"id\" : 6043, \"name\" : \"NBC News Radio\", \"description\" : \"The news you want, when you want it\" } } \nThe worker has reportedly been fired by McDonald’s and is now facing criminal charges for tampering with the officer’s drink. \nThe story went viral after the pro-police Kansas Going Blue Facebook page posted a photo of the drink in question: \nOfficer Safety Alert **Updated *** to add link to news story in post. Please take the time to read the news articles... Posted by Kansas GOING BLUE on Sunday, November 27, 2016 \nThis isn’t the first time a mustard-laced soda has been served to a police officer in Kanas, according to Fox News : \nThe incident comes just two weeks after a Kansas Highway patrol officer reported similar incident involving mustard in his soda. \nThe franchise owner of the north Topeka McDonald’s, Tom Dobski, told WIBW-TV the company is “shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee.” Dobski also made it clear that police officers are always welcome at McDonald’s restaurants.",

      "text": "TOPEKA, Kan. (KSNT) – A Kansas McDonald’s employee who put mustard into a Topeka Police Officer’s drink has been fired after a lengthy investigation by the cooperation. The District Attorney’s Office is opening a criminal investigation into the matter.\nIt all started with a photo shared on Facebook showing a law enforcement officer’s soda at a Topeka McDonald’s mixed with mustard has gone viral.\nThe Facebook group Kansas GOING BLUE posted the photo Sunday evening saying “a McDonald’s here in Kansas just served a Law Enforcement Officer on duty a Dr. Pepper with Mustard in a drive thru order. This is extremely unacceptable!!”\nThe incident reportedly happened at the McDonald’s located at 2001 North Topeka Boulevard.\nSupervisor at the McDonald’s, Gary Vaughn, tells KSNT News the issue has been handled internally but would not elaborate on what that meant.\nTom and Marilyn Dobski of McDonald’s Franchisees in Topeka released the following statement.\n“All customers, including local law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities, are always welcome at our restaurants. Immediately upon learning of this complaint, we began our own internal investigation to gather the facts. We are shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee. This employee no longer works for our organization. We proudly support police officers and all divisions of first responders at our restaurants across northeast Kansas.”\nThe Kansas Highway Patrol tells KSNT News this happened to one of their trooper’s about two weeks ago at the same location.",

It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that’s cooked when ordered. \nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. \nMcDonald’s says it has making “significant enhancements” to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter. \nThe company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.",

(AP) — McDonald's is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers. The fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that's cooked when ordered. Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. McDonald's says it has making \"significant enhancements\" to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter. The company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Today's Deals",

      "text": "If you’re planning on going to the airport today or even stopping at McDonald’s for a McRib you should probably add a bit of buffer time into your schedule. The “Fight for 15” crowd, in concert with other union activists, are staging another Day of Disruption . In other words, it’s not a protest to get a message out, but rather an orchestrated attempt to shut down the flow of commerce and basic infrastructure. (Fox News)\nWorkers from fast-food chains and nearly 20 airports joined nationwide protests for higher pay, union rights and immigration reform on Tuesday in their first major action since businessman Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election.\nMcDonald’s restaurants in 340 cities are prime rally targets, while baggage handlers and cabin cleaners at Chicago’s O’Hare and Boston’s Logan international airports were to demonstrate in support of workers demanding starting pay of $15 per hour, organizers of the “Fight for $15” campaign said.\nMore than 200 protesters held a pre-dawn rally in New York City’s Zuccotti Park, about half a block from a McDonald’s restaurant, where they banged on drums and chanted slogans calling for a minimum wage of $15 an hour.\nWhat we’re seeing here is the merging of several liberal attack modes, both old and new, now being repurposed for the next phase of the liberal agenda. In terms of “something old” we have the New York City gathering at Zuccotti Park. In case you weren’t around for their previous antics, that’s where the Occupy Wall Street movement kicked into gear, with makeshift camps full of rape tents and “peaceful protesters” pooping on police cars in the public square. The SEIU sponsored protesters today are moving on from such displays to closing down fast food outlets and trying to slow down if not stop flights at airports. These are the newer tactics of “disruption” which are being taught in liberal protest boot camp these days. \nYou may recall when the #BlackBrunchNYC plan was hatched and BLM activists went around the Big Apple flooding into eateries and shutting them down with the stated purpose of “disrupting white spaces.” (That must have been a shock to the black and Latino patrons in all of those establishments who were similarly prevented from eating.) More commonly than that, we’ve seen BLM marching onto highways in cities around the nation every time they have anything to protest and shutting down entire interstates for hours on end.\nNow the tactics are all being rolled into one and fed into the Fight for 15 crew’s playbook. I was originally tipped off to this event by Jeremy Adler at America Rising Squared. Their statement on this scheme hits all the right notes.\n“Big Labor poured hundreds of millions of its dues-paying members’ dollars into this past month’s elections, only to see its chosen candidates lose across the board. From the defeat of Hillary Clinton and so many others who strongly backed the unions’ “Fight for $15” minimum wage campaign, this election should serve as a wake-up call that organized labor’s special-interest agenda doesn’t reflect the values and priorities of working people across America…\n“The truth is, today’s protests are not genuine reflection of worker anxiety, but a highly coordinated, well-funded campaign by SEIU union bosses and their PR pros in New York City. Big labor is spending tens of millions of dollars to orchestrate these protests to try and recruit fast-food workers as new dues-payers, filling their shrinking coffers and bolster their depleted membership rolls.\nPersonally, just as I’ve said with the highway and restaurant stunts pulled by Black Lives Matter, I’m all in favor of some of these protests going forward. Rather then demonstrating in a traditional fashion and getting their message out to potentially supportive members of the public, they will leave a single, vivid memory seared in the minds of all who encounter them. That vision will be of missing out on a lunch meeting or sitting in an endless line of stalled traffic for hours when they’re supposed to be getting home to pick up the kids. Any possible empathy the group might have fostered evaporates at that point.\nSo you go ahead and “disrupt” the world, guys. Let’s see how far it gets you.\n",

      "text": "TOPEKA, Kan. (KSNT) – A Topeka McDonald’s employee who put mustard into a Topeka Police Officer’s drink has been fired after a lengthy investigation. The District Attorney’s Office is opening a criminal investigation into the matter.\nIt all started with a photo shared on Facebook showing a law enforcement officer’s soda at a Topeka McDonald’s mixed with mustard has gone viral.\nThe Facebook group Kansas GOING BLUE posted the photo Sunday evening saying “a McDonald’s here in Kansas just served a Law Enforcement Officer on duty a Dr. Pepper with Mustard in a drive thru order. This is extremely unacceptable!!”\nThe incident reportedly happened at the McDonald’s located at 2001 North Topeka Boulevard.\nSupervisor at the McDonald’s, Gary Vaughn, tells KSNT News the issue has been handled internally but would not elaborate on what that meant.\nTom and Marilyn Dobski of McDonald’s Franchisees in Topeka released the following statement.\n“All customers, including local law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities, are always welcome at our restaurants. Immediately upon learning of this complaint, we began our own internal investigation to gather the facts. We are shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee. This employee no longer works for our organization. We proudly support police officers and all divisions of first responders at our restaurants across northeast Kansas.”\nThe Kansas Highway Patrol tells KSNT News this happened to one of their trooper’s about two weeks ago at the same location.\nNever miss another Facebook post from 8News \nFind 8News on Twitter , Facebook , and Instagram ; send your news tips to iReport8@wric.com .

(AP) — McDonald's is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers. The fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that's cooked when ordered. Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. McDonald's says it has making \"significant enhancements\" to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter.

      "title": "McDonald’s Just Gave Their Favourite 100-Year-Old Customer A Lifetime Of Free Food",
      "text": "  \nA woman named Nadine Baum was delighted when she recently walked into her regular McDonald’s branch to be presented with a surprise celebration. Featured Image VIA \nThe staff at the Baltimore Street restaurant had decorated it with balloons, flowers and a birthday cake to celebrate Nadine’s 100 th birthday. Apparently she had been going to that same branch regularly for six years – I’m surprised she made it to 100 if she’s eating Maccy’s everyday. Image VIA \nMcDonald’s crew member, Ginny Slaubaugh, and her co-worker Genevieve Steinbrenner, said they have grown to know many of the customers by name and order, as they get many regulars in the branch. And after many years of seeing Nadine with her son, Mike Baum, they decided to give her the birthday party she deserved. \nThe previous year they had done the same, however, this year they wanted to go above and beyond and so they decided to give her a certificate for a lifetime of free McDonald’s. Yeah, that’s all very well and good, but what use is that going to be for a woman who’s just turned 100? She’s probably only got a few good years left in her, especially if she starts eating even more of their shitty food. Nevertheless, Nadine was delighted, as she said: \nI just can’t get over this. This is so wonderful. Image VIA \nCute. Well if anything, the coupon might not get much use out of it, but I guess it’s the thought that counts. And it seems like this branch did an excellent job of making this woman’s 100 th birthday really special – or as special as is possible in a Maccy’s. \nFor a less heartwarming story regarding McDonald’s, click HERE .",

      "text": "  12:07PM CHICAGO (WLS) -- About 2,000 people were expected at O'Hare Tuesday to begin the strike.Airport workers were cheering each other on as they walked off the job Tuesday. Hundreds of baggage handlers, cabin cleaners, janitors and wheelchair attendants at O'Hare cheered each other on as they walked off the job. They say they have experienced retaliation, intimidation and threats.They are part of the Fight for 15, and they say their pay doesn't fly.The Fight for 15 kicked off a day of disruption nationwide.In Chicago, the morning started with McDonald's fast food workers striking, shutting down the intersection of Chicago and Damen. They were willing to be arrested to send a message.\"We have gotten so much out of this, and we cannot stop now. We cannot stop now we need to keep going because living paycheck to paycheck is ridiculous. It is not going to work,\" said Adrianna Alvarez, McDonald's employee.Uber drivers are also joining the fight. Drivers in two dozen cities, including Chicago, say they'll go as far as idling their cars to demand better pay.\"Uber is making a ton of money now, we know that they can afford to pay us more so we can keep driving and moving Chicago,\" said Durrell Imani, Uber driver.The cause spread to health care as well. Protesters joined hospital workers for a march and rally outside Northwestern Memorial Hospital in the Streeterville neighborhood Tuesday morning.Airport workers said they didn't want to strike the day before thanksgiving during the busiest travel day. Why? Because they want public support. This Is Only Expected To Be A One Day StrikeOrganizers say they expect delays and disruption, particularly for United and American airlines. But Chicago Department of Aviation officials say they don't anticipate disruptions.The workers are employed by private contractors. Strike organizers say many work for minimum wage. They're trying to unionize with the help of Service Employees International Union Local 1. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Related Topics:",

(Photo: Gene J.

It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that’s cooked when ordered. \nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. \nMcDonald’s says it has making “significant enhancements” to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter. \nThe company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that’s cooked when ordered. \nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. \nMcDonald’s says it has making “significant enhancements” to its food.

Fast-food restaurant workers and home and child-care workers rallied in cities including Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and New York on Tuesday morning. In many cities the protesters blocked busy intersections. In Chicago, hundreds of protesters at O'Hare International Airport were outside terminals chanting \"What do we want? $15!

      "text": "View Comments Print By Jessica Chasmar - The Washington Times - Tuesday, November 29, 2016 \nA McDonald’s employee in Topeka, Kansas, is out of a job and could face criminal charges after allegedly pouring mustard into the drinks of two law enforcement officers. \nTom Dobski, the franchisee of the north Topeka McDonald’s, said the company is “shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee,” who no longer works for the organization, a local CBS News affiliate reported . \n“All customers, including local law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities, are always welcome at our restaurants,” he said. “We proudly support police officers and all divisions of first responders at our restaurants across northeast Kansas.” \nReports first surfaced on the “Kansas GOING BLUE” Facebook page that a uniformed Topeka police officer found mustard in his soft drink after he went through the McDonald’s drive-thru at 2001 N.W. Topeka Boulevard. The Kansas Highway Patrol said the same thing happened to a trooper who bought a drink there two weeks earlier, CBS reported. \nAfter consulting with the District Attorney’s Office, a criminal investigation has been opened into the matter, the Topeka Police Department said Monday in a news release . \nThe employee has not been identified.",

      "text": "By DANIEL VICTOR and NOAM SCHEIBER NOV. 29, 2016   Photo Protesters in front of a McDonald’s restaurant on Broadway in Manhattan on Tuesday were among the thousands who demonstrated in cities across the country to demand a $15 minimum wage. Credit Mark Lennihan/Associated Press Thousands of low-wage workers protested in cities across the United States on Tuesday to demand a $15-an-hour minimum wage and the right to form a union, shutting down streets and disrupting service at some of the nation’s busiest airports. The protests came on the four-year anniversary of the “Fight for $15” campaign, the labor-funded effort to change the terms of the political debate over what the working poor should earn and how employers should treat them. That movement has produced played a crucial role in winning wage gains for millions, including $15-an-hour minimum wage laws in California, New York and many cities around the country. On Tuesday, protests involving retail workers, Uber drivers, and employees at fast-food restaurants, airports and hospitals were organized in cities including New York, Detroit, Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif. Local media outlets reported arrests in several places. In Lower Manhattan, workers marched on Broadway starting at Zuccotti Park, where Occupy Wall Street protesters camped in 2011 . We've filled Broadway in downtown Manhattan! We won't be divided. We won't back down! #Fightfor15 pic.twitter.com/5Fpdcjc80X — Fast Food Forward (@FastFoodForward) Nov. 29, 2016 Three City Council members — Mark Levine, Antonio Reynoso and Brad Lander — were among the protesters arrested at a sit-in, along with Francisco Moya, a state Assembly member. Mr. Lander had written an article published on The Nation magazine’s website called “Why I’m Getting Arrested During Today’s National Day of Disruption.” Photo Police arrested dozens of protesters in Los Angeles and other cities. Credit Lucy Nicholson/Reuters Protests at airports, including O’Hare International in Chicago and Logan International in Boston, were expected to follow throughout the day. An hour before a planned airport worker strike, hundreds of protesters organized by the Chicago chapter of the Service Employees International Union gathered at O’Hare’s public transportation terminals carrying signs and dressed in purple union gear.",

(AP) — McDonald’s is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers.\nThe fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that’s cooked when ordered.\nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area.\nMcDonald’s says it has making “significant enhancements” to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter.\nThe company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.",

About 25 chanting minimum-wage protesters were arrested. They were among about 350 people at a peaceful rally Tuesday. Protests were staged in numerous cities across the country. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) \nDETROIT — More than 100 people were arrested Tuesday during minimum wage worker protests throughout the USA.\nAcross the country, fast-food workers pressed for a $15-an-hour minimum wage as part of protests organized by the Fight for $15 group.\nIn Detroit, 39 people were arrested, including 24 women and 15 men during the demonstration, said Michael Woody, media relations director for the Detroit Police Department.\nThe Detroit protests was planned by organizers of the Detroit 15 movement, which in addition to the $15-an-hour minimum wage, is seeking union rights for hundred of employees who work in various industries, including fast food, retail and health care.\nUSA TODAY\nMinimum wage: 4 states decide whether to put more money in workers' pockets\nHundreds of people lined Grand River Avenue in front of a Detroit McDonald's restaurant with picket signs and speakers. Some lanes of Grand River were briefly blocked during the protest, Detroit Police spokeswoman Jennifer Watson said, adding that the protest began around 6 a.m.\n\"The group stated they were prepared to be arrested for non-compliance and similar protests are set in other states,\" said Watson.\nIn New York, about 25 people were arrested after they linked arms and sat on a lower Manhattan street.\nThey were among about 350 people at a peaceful rally in New York.\nParticipants chanted \"We shall not be moved\" and waved signs reading \"We won't back down\" and \"Strike for $15 and our future.\"\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed legislation last April that gradually raises New York's minimum wage. The minimum wage will rise to $15 in New York City by the end of 2018 and in some prosperous suburbs by the end of 2021. It will rise to $12.50 in the rest of the state by 2020, eventually reaching $15.\nUSA TODAY\nLow-paid workers are leading in wage gains\nAlso, nearly three dozen protesters were arrested in Cambridge, Mass.\nIn Los Angeles, 40 protesters were arrested as they blocked a downtown intersection.\nNationally, thousands of low-wage workers were scheduled to protest Tuesday at 20 different airports, including Chicago’s O’Hare international airport and New Jersey’s Newark Liberty, according to a news release.\nIn addition to the strike at airports, fast-food workers, home care and childcare workers also planned to protest as part of the Fight for $15 movement.\nOrganizers said the protest was timed to coincide with the fourth anniversary of the first major Fight for 15 action, when fast-food workers walked off the job in 2012.\nContributing: The Associated Press.

      "text": "David Russell, 25, from Northampton, lured Maricar Benedicto to woods He blindfolded her and said he was giving her gift before slitting her neck Ms Benedicto, then 19, escaped after 'persistent and continuous attack' \nBy Emily Chan For Mailonline \nPublished: 12:58 EST, 29 November 2016 | Updated: 13:04 EST, 29 November 2016 \nDavid Russell, now 25, from Northampton, Googled 'how to kill someone and get away with it' before slitting the throat of an American teenager he met online \nA McDonald's worker who Googled 'how to kill someone and get away with it' before slitting the throat of an American teenager he met online has been jailed for 14 years. \nDavid Russell, now 25, from Northampton, lured Maricar Benedicto, then 19, to woodland after she flew across the Atlantic to meet him. \nHe blindfolded the teenager and said he was going to give her a gift but instead stood behind her and took a knife to her throat. \nThe court heard Ms Benedicto was the victim of a 'persistent and continuous attack' in Harlestone Firs, Northamptonshire, hours after she arrived in the UK in April 2011. \nRussell, then 19, went on to punch and hit her, shouting 'Why won't you die?', before she managed to escape to safety. \nRussell admitted attempted murder in October 2011 and was told he must serve at least 10 years in jail before being considered for release. \nThe conviction was quashed at the Court of Appeal and a re-trial held, with Russell found guilty of the same charge at Northampton Crown Court in September. \nHis time spent in custody will count towards his prison term. \nNorthampton Crown Court heard that Russell, who suffers from autism spectrum disorder, had searched 'killing someone' and 'how to cut skin with a knife' in the early hours of the morning before the attack. \nJudge Rupert Mayo said: 'Russell put a blindfold on her and stood behind her. Maricar thought he was going to give her a present so held her arms out. \n'Russell applied a kitchen knife to the front of her neck.' \nHe said the attack left Ms Benedicto 'dazed and confused' and led to her staying in hospital for 24 hours, adding that it was a 'cold-blooded and callous' attack on a 'naive victim'. \nThe court heard that Russell had taken his victim to the woodland after saying he had fond childhood memories of the area. \nAfter attacking her with a knife, Russell continued the assault until she said she had given his name and address to immigration officers when arriving in the country. \nThe pair met online and bonded over their love of heavy metal music. The court heard that Russell referred to himself as Bring Me The Horizon singer Ollie Sykes, while Ms Benedicto called herself Ruby Townsend - the singer's girlfriend at the time - during their online chats. \nProsecuting, Christopher Donnellan QC said: 'The fact is he drew a knife across her neck from behind,' adding this was part of a 'persistent and continuous attack'. \nJohn Lloyd-Jones QC, mitigating, said the attack had a 'lack of sophistication, was clumsy in execution and ultimately ineffective'. \nHe added: 'The reality is David Russell did not kill Maricar Benedicto. He did not inflict upon her a single life-threatening injury. She lived not because of the intervention of a good Samaritan, she lived not because of the prompt action of paramedics. \n'She lived because he stopped his attack. He deeply regrets what he did. He is a very different person as he stands before you at 25 than he was at the age of 19.'",

(AP) - McDonald's is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers. \nThe fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that's cooked when ordered. \nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. \nMcDonald's says it has making \"significant enhancements\" to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter. \nThe company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.

      "text": "McDonald's testing the use of fresh beef in some burgers Posted: Updated: \nTULSA, Okla. (AP) - McDonald's is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers. \nThe fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that's cooked when ordered. \nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. \nMcDonald's says it has making \"significant enhancements\" to its food. It says that over last 18 months it has removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and stopped using margarine in favor of butter. \nThe company is trying to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.

      "text": "Email \nTOPEKA, Kan. — A McDonald’s employee who allegedly put mustard into a Kansas police officer’s drink has been fired. \nOn Sunday, Facebook group Kansas GOING BLUE posted a picture of a McDonald’s drink with mustard squirted in it. \nThe post read, “a McDonald’s here in Kansas just served a law enforcement officer on duty a Dr. Pepper with Mustard in a drive-thru order. This is extremely unacceptable!! According to the manager, this happened before with a Kansas Highway Patrol trooper. Maybe we should all remind them of the Taco Bell incident that happened in Newton. # McDonalds # KansasGoingBlue .” \nSupervisor Gary Vaughn told KSNT the same thing happened several weeks ago and that the issue has been handled internally. \nMcDonald’s released a statement regarding the incident: \nAll customers, including local law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities, are always welcome at our restaurants. Immediately upon learning of this complaint, we began our own internal investigation to gather the facts. We are shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee. This employee no longer works for our organization. We proudly support police officers and all divisions of first responders at our restaurants across northeast Kansas. 39.055824 -95.689018 ",

      "text": "Email \nSAN DIEGO – Dozens of ‘Fight for 15’ protesters marched for higher wages outside McDonald's in Barrio Logan Tuesday. \nThe protests are part of a nationwide campaign wanting to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. \nGov. Jerry Brown recently signed legislation that will raise California’s mandatory minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022, but workers Tuesday said they can’t wait that long. \nRamone Johnson says he works two jobs just to get by and his family needs the wage increase sooner. \n“It would be good for our coworkers and our families to have a fighting chance at the cost of living,” one protester said. \nHowever, opponents say a minimum wage increase would cost millions of jobs. \n“The rise in the cost of labor under a $15 minimum wage would result in substantial job loss, with significant variation across industries and cities,” according to economics professors Andrew Hanson and Zachary Hawley . “Although it may help partially realize a policy goal to increase incomes for some workers, it comes with the terrible cost of job destruction for some of America’s poorest workers.” \nProtests are planned at Lindbergh Field and the Federal Building in downtown San Diego Tuesday.
