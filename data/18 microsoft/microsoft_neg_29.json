      "title": "Ryman Healthcare: Turning Risk Mitigation into a Digital Transformation Opportunity",
      "text": "AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND - Media OutReach - Nov 21, 2016 - In Microsoft's Data Culture Champions Series in Asia, we speak to Simon Challies, Managing Director of Ryman Healthcare, on how the leading retirement village operator has digitally transformed its business to mitigate risk and better care for its seniors residing within its premises.\n\nAccording to IDC, 60% of the top 1,000 Asia Pacific organizations will have digital transformation at the center of their corporate strategy by the end of 2017. While one would imagine that organizations start their digital transformation journey with a bold vision to transform their entire business, many actually kick-start their journey with very humble goals.\n\nThe transformation journey for Ryman Healthcare, a leading retirement village operator in New Zealand, started two years ago to mitigate risks of documentation errors. The company knew that it was risky to depend on manual and paper-based documentation especially when it comes to patient care. Ryman Healthcare also lost its head office in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake -- so the company had good reason to be nervous about how it stored its information.\n\nIts solution was to digitize its business processes so they could be captured and analyzed more easily, cutting down any possible errors in its interactions with older people under its care.\n\nThis single digital project provided the fuel for Ryman Healthcare to use data in transforming staff productivity and ultimately, enhancing customer experiences. \"The status quo was not acceptable,\" said Simon Challies, Managing Director of Ryman Healthcare. The company now aims to have 95 per cent of processes digitized. Up until two years ago, 95 per cent of them were carried out with pen and paper.\"\n\n\nRyman Healthcare is working to develop myRyman, a tablet-based nursing app running on Microsoft Surface devices and Azure cloud services.\n\nThe app will help handle the staff roster, let staff communicate with one another and check which residents they are expected to see on the day. When it is complete, myRyman will also provide transparency to residents, giving them an opportunity to understand how Ryman Healthcare staff are working around the clock to provide the best patient care.\n\n*The drivers for transformation*\n\n*\n*\n\nData is the new currency for forward-thinking organizations to enable business innovation. While harnessing data through technology has been around, new cloud and data technologies have allowed for new possibilities in data insights. With the right tools, insights can come from anyone, anywhere, at any time. When that happens, organizations develop what Microsoft describe as a \"new data culture\".\n\nFor a new data culture to happen, organizations need to recognize the new opportunities for harnessing unprecedented insights that can be derived from data collected in this digital world. In fact, Microsoft Asia's Data Culture Survey, involving 940 C-suite executives and business decision makers in Asia, shows that business leaders feel that implementing a data strategy needs to start right from the top. The survey found that a majority of business leaders (87%) feel that a data strategy should not only be implemented through a top-down approach, but that it should also be a formalized role in management in order to drive transition to a data-driven organization.\n\nIn the driver's seat for Ryman Healthcare's digital transformation journey is Challies. He said the efforts to develop a data culture would not be possible without a champion, especially a manager from the top.\n\nHe sees this digital transformation as way to stay ahead of the business curve, where today, Ryman Healthcare is an industry and market leader, operating 30 retirement villages in New Zealand with 6,000 village units and aged care beds. In addition to building more retirement villages across New Zealand, the company is also embarking on expanding its operations into Australia.\n\n\"We wanted to stay ahead of the competition. Because we knew that we had to leverage technology if we wanted to continue growing and to keep an eye on competitors in the market,\" Challies said.\n\nHe has charted a singular focus of changing patient care and service for Ryman Healthcare. Residents, doctors, care-givers and nurses all want one thing -- more time to spend caring for patients.\n\nRyman Healthcare could have assumed that seniors under its care were not tech-savvy. What it found, however, was that residents took to tablets quickly and were keen to use them. Challies said: \"Because finally, they've got a device which they're comfortable using, to a scale that they like. So they open up when it works for them because they won't typically use smart phones or desktops, but they are happy to use a tablet.\"\n\nA Ryman Healthcare resident trying out the myRyman app on a Windows device\n\n\nData-driven transformation, made possible by the Microsoft Cloud\n\nAt the core of what Ryman Healthcare is driving is to get better insights. As it digitizes processes and its interactions with seniors in the villages, lots of useful insights are being generated and analyzed on Microsoft Azure, forming the foundation for the company's business transformation.\n\nAlthough the initial aim was to solve one business problem -- mitigating risks -- the efforts have since changed the way the company does business as well. In future, as it unearths more insights from its data, there could potentially be more benefits to be reaped.\n\n\"We wanted data to be managed in a structured fashion in the cloud because then we could really use it to make better decisions, make more consistent decisions,\" said Challies.\n\n\"We also wanted to embed all our processes more firmly in software because prior to this, in the paper documentation process, most of our processes were written up on manuals and sat on shelves and collected dust. We would have liked it if they were used, but in reality, they were not,\" he added.\n\nWhile it is early days he is clear about what the ultimate goal for a new data culture is -- the ability to help predict challenges and exploit new opportunities.\n\nThree ingredients for success\n\nChallies noted that resistance towards developing a new data culture was expected but once it was clear how staff would benefit; driving adoption of the new technology was made easier. In his experience, three things would help to bring about a successful transformation:\n\n*1. Change from the top*\n\nIt is important to have someone lead the effort, bringing various departments on board from the start. Challies took on that role in Ryman Healthcare, where his job as managing director included pushing everyone -- the operations team, clinicians and IT department -- in the right direction.\n\n\"The biggest hurdle was getting everyone to believe in the vision. There was also the challenge in communicating the vision and getting other people to move out of their comfort zone,\" said Challies.\n\nSimon Challies, Managing Director of Ryman Healthcare\n\"It was tough getting the operations and clinical teams over the line which is not surprising. They're the ones that are going to be the most skeptical as they viewed more automation and change as being too uncertain. Once we got them to envision an outcome they believed in, one where they could see the benefits to be reaped, they were in a rush to get there,\" he added.\n\n*2. Democratization of data and services*\n\nEmpowering users will lead to faster adoption and more meaningful uses of data and digital services. At Ryman Healthcare, nurses can now add their names to a roster instead of waiting to be assigned by a manager.\n\n\"If you give them the tools and abilities to make decisions to do things for themselves, you can trust them to do it because they'll do the right thing,\" said Challies.\n\n\"Giving people access to information and the right tools to communicate and interact is better than being wound up in processes that are not necessarily helping their workplace relationships,\" he added.\n\n*3. IT is an enabler, but not necessarily a driver*\n\nOne barrier to Ryman Healthcare's efforts were IT professionals. Changing things was too risky and it often just could not be done, was what Challies was told. \"IT consultants can help, but ultimately, the people in the departments and functions have to drive these digital transformation projects,\" he said.\n\n\"If the IT people were to drive it on their own, then you'd get an IT solution that doesn't reflect your business,\" he noted. His partnership with IT is key.\n\nResidents enjoying a day out in the sun at one of Ryman Healthcare's retirement villages.

This will be a bigger challenge, but one he feels will bring even greater benefits.\n\nHe explained: \"It's early days on that but with the clinical data we are collecting, we anticipate will enable us to drive the evolution of all our protocols. What we'd really like to have is all of our data with the intelligence tools built into the Microsoft cloud to tell us when we should intervene, give us triggers based on our own experiences in order to provide even more personalized care for every individual. This is now possible as we have so much information that now we can make decent decisions as well as the right technology to make it happen.\n\nIn our Data Culture Champions in Asia series, we profile senior executives across the region who have driven a new data culture within their organization by adopting new processes, technologies as well as enabling their people with skill sets. These individuals cut across key industries and organization sizes, but what makes them stand out above the rest is how they are embracing change.

      "text": "Tyler Joseph of Twenty One Pilots performs a medley at the American Music Awards at the Microsoft Theater on Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016, in Los Angeles. (Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP)\nAt the beginning of Sunday night’s American Music Awards, co-host and former “Saturday Night Live” star Jay Pharaoh told the audience they weren’t going to talk about politics: “Tonight is all about the music,” he announced.\nThat was not entirely true. Minutes later, Pharaoh launched into his impression of President-elect Donald Trump (“I love Bruno Mars. I don’t know what color he is, so I can’t deport him. . . . I love ‘Uptown Funk.’ It was totally about me. . . . I’m gonna funk this country up, bigly.”)\nBut punk rock group Green Day was the most overtly political; lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong is a vocal Trump critic. During the performance of their new single, “Bang Bang,” they segued briefly into “Born to Die” by punk band MDC, singing Trump-themed lyrics: “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!” They repeated the line (which has been heard at anti-Trump protests) three times before they finished the song.\nA few more Trump references were peppered throughout the AMAs, including AMAs co-host, supermodel Gigi Hadid, who imitated Melania Trump and mocked the Michelle Obama plagiarism incident.\nPlus, there was this onstage banter between presenters Mark Cuban (entrepreneur and noted Trump nemesis) and Broadway star Idina Menzel:\nCuban: “Congratulations on your new album. I know you’ve been looking forward to that for a long time.”\nMenzel: “Thank you so much. What are you looking forward to?”\nCuban: “Not being invited to the inauguration is a good start.”\nMenzel: “I know how you feel. Us unsafe, scary theater people wouldn’t be invited to the inauguration, either. I love you, ‘Hamilton’!”\nPharaoh dropped in a Trump jab while talking about DJ Khaled’s famous Snapchat presence: “He gives his major keys to success and all that. I just can’t wait until he drops the major keys on moving overseas once Trump takes over.”",

      "title": "Microsoft Joins the Linux Foundation",
      "text": "It has just been announced that Microsoft is joining the Linux Foundation. Linux’s arch-rivalry is turning into a friendship as Microsoft recently announced the new partnership on Nov. 16, 2016, in New York .\nMicrosoft has announced that their next version of their SQL server will be for Windows and Linux. Google also joins in on .Net foundation, and furthermore, Microsoft also announced that they are releasing their largely popular software, Visual Studio, for Apple computers, as well.\nI double checked that it wasn’t April, so it can’t be an April fool’s joke. I also walked outside this morning with my coffee in hand, and the sun wasn’t rising from the west. But all jokes aside, the announcement of Microsoft joining the open source industry, Linux Foundation , is taking the world by great surprise. Why the sudden expansion for an already profitable company?\nThe large technology giant, Microsoft, has openly hated the concept of open source. However, in recent years, their new CEO, Satya Nadella, is now joining their long-time nemesis in building a better future for technology – together!\nDoes “If you can’t beat them, join them,” spring to mind?\nLinux was originally developed in order to fight against Microsoft’s closed source architecture, all the while breaking the hinges of hegemony over regular desktop computing. For those who remember, Bill Gates spent a lot of time back in the 90s, building his brand as a major competitor over Linux.\nBack in March, Microsoft also announced their release of an open “Public View Edition” of their SQL server database, in which they have made generously available to Linux-based operating servers.\nFor those that are SQL server running Linux, you can download a copy of the Microsoft’s SQL database here . While this edition is a public view, it is also a major aspect of the full version that will soon be launched in Microsoft’s next SQL server version. The world will anticipate this new server launch as it will be the first server to operate on both Linux and Windows.\nGoing over to Microsoft’s .NET Foundation, Google is joining in on the .NET Foundation. Google is not the only company looking into joining it either. In fact, Samsung is collaborating with Microsoft, bringing the .NET Foundation to the traditional Tizen Operating System. This new collaboration will provide future developments for the Smart TV, as well as mobile devices, such as your smart phone or tablets.\nAnd closing this article off, Microsoft is also releasing a version of their Visual Studio for Apple users. And when we circle back around to the top of this article, we only have one question in mind, “What is Microsoft up to?” The only thing we can be sure of is a bright future in technology as we all look closer into the world of open source.\nResources: Microsoft (Joining Linux Foundation) , Linux Foundation , Microsoft (Blog Post) , Microsoft (SQL Server Open-Source) .",

      "text": "Homeless in Vancouver: Microsoft joins Linux Foundation—and now loves Linux to death by Stanley Q. Woodvine   8:03 PM 1 of 3 2 of 3 \nMicrosoft has joined the Linux Foundation . That’s right, the maker of the closed-source Windows operating system—the very antithesis of free open source software—is suddenly one of the driving forces behind free open source software (cue hair-rending and groans of mock incredulity). \nThe normally phlegmatic website Extreme Tech reacted to the news this week by suggesting that Hell had frozen over . \nThere was no immediate word if Steve Ballmer, the former bombastic fixture of Microsoft’s executive suite and long-time hater of open source software, was rolling over in his jacuzzi. Someone has to pay for free software \nOn November 16 it was officially announced that Microsoft Corp. had become a top-level Platinum member of the non-profit Linux Foundation, which oversees the collaborative development of the open source Linux operating system. \nPlatinum membership means that Microsoft will pay (US)$500,000 annually and gain a seat on the Linux Foundation’s board of directors, joining other Platinum members: Fujitsu Ltd, Hewlett-Packard Development Co. LP, Intel Corp., IBM Corp., NEC Corp., Oracle Corp., Qualcomm Innovation Center Inc., and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. \nGoogle, with both its cloud-based advertising business and its Android operating system built on Linux, is only a Gold member of the foundation, one tier down, contributing $100,000 annually. Cannonical, the South African company that oversees the development of Ubuntu, the best-known of all Linux distributions, is one of some 224 Silver members, contributing something between $5,000 to $20,000 annually. \nApple, so far as I know, is not a member of the Linux Foundation, despite both its desktop and mobile operating systems being built on the open source operating system BSD. \nThe fact that Microsoft is effectively now on the steering committee of Linux—part of the group tasked with increasing the “market share” of the free open source operating system—is significant for what it says about how far both the computer industry and Microsoft have come over the last 20 years. A brief word from our history department UNIX programmer Dennis Ritchie looks on as a clock ticks the final second of 32-bit UNIX time. \nIn September of 1983, under the title “ New UNIX implementation “, Richard Stallman wrote in an Internet Usenet newsgroup that he was going to write an entire computer operating system that worked like AT&T’s venerable UNIX operating system . He was going to call his scratch-built version GNU and when it was done he would give it away for free. To begin with, he predicted, GNU would be a central kernel plus all the surrounding utilities needed to write and run programs, as well as a few other things. \nEight years later and Stallman had almost everything written except the kernel—which was required to tie all the other components together into a coordinated operating system. That was in 1991, the year that young Linus Torvalds posted to Usenet that he was writing a little UNIX-like operating system and that it would also be free, but “not so big and professional like gnu”. \nBasically, Torvalds wrote the kernel which became the unifying element that completed the GNU project, which, all together, became known as GNU/Linux and then simply as Linux. \nBy 1996 Linux was a growing phenomenon and something new under the sun. Here was a commercial-grade computer operating system, collaboratively developed over the Internet by thousands of volunteers, that was being given away for free. Microsoft and the carcinogen that was Linux \nIn 1996 the media loved Linux but Microsoft, still basking in the triumph of Windows 95 , hated and feared the free operating system as a nascent threat that had to be nipped in the bud. \nMicrosoft, using a negative marketing tactic perfected by IBM, began sowing fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about Linux in the minds of all its existing and potential customers—as well as forcing customers to sign restrictive agreements against their ever using Linux. \nFor 18 years, much of the FUD about Linux was slung by a top Microsoft executive who was second only to Bill Gates in public recognition—the combative and clownish Ballmer, who finally succeeded Gates as head of Microsoft in 2000. \nBallmer reached a personal best for vein-popping bombast when, in 2001—a year into his term as Microsoft CEO— he famously compared the Linux operating system to cancer . \n“Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.” \nBallmer dutifully continued the disinformation campaign of FUD against open source software for most of next 13 years, until he stepped down as Microsoft’s CEO in February of 2014. \nMicrosoft’s long-running hate campaign against Linux deeply angered and scarred the open source software community (most of whom were also Windows users). \nIn 2004, when Mark Shuttleworth, the head of the South African tech support company Cannonical, created Ubuntu, a user-friendly version of Linux intended to appeal to Windows users, he militantly declared that Microsoft was the number one software bug that Ubuntu Linux needed to fix. \nAnd just six months before Steve Ballmer’s tenure as Microsoft CEO ended, I wrote how the developers of Fuduntu Linux cancelled their project after being hounded and harassed by other developers in the Linux community. The cheeky name of their Fedora Linux-based, Ubuntu-like distribution was seen by some in the community as deliberately evoking Microsoft’s FUD campaign to insult other Linux distributions! \nOnce the malignant Steve Ballmer was removed from Microsoft there was no more talk of Linux being a cancer. The new CEO, Satya Nadella , very quickly turned the company toward a software-as-service business model, with a strong focus on enterprise cloud computing. And Nadella began rebuilding burned bridges. \nOnly eight months after Ballmer’s departure, in October of 2014, Nadella’s Microsoft revealed that some 20 percent of the computational power sold by its Azure cloud computing service was used to run Linux. And lest anyone missed it, CEO Nadella himself emphasized the sharp break with the Ballmer era by declaring to anyone who would listen that “ Microsoft loves Linux .” Like polar bears love penguins? \"Just wait there little buddy while I get some salt.\" School clip art/ethiriel photography \nNadella wasn’t kidding about Microsoft’s newfound amour for open source! Right from its initial release in July of 2015, Windows 10—the bug fix for Ballmer’s Windows 8— was swimming with features lifted from Linux . And the August 2016 Windows 10 Anniversary update went much farther, adding the ability to install and run real Ubuntu Linux command-line applications inside the Windows environment! \nIn 2016, Microsoft also extended its close relationship with OpenSUSE , another Linux distribution. \nAnd earlier, toward the end of 2015, Microsoft admitted the almost unthinkable: that it had created a Linux-based operating system of its own, called Azure Cloud Switch , to help run its Microsoft Azure cloud computing platform. Wow! \nThe degree and speed of the course correction that Microsoft has made in it attitude towards Linux under Nadella cannot be overstated. However, it couldn’t possibly be fast enough to recapture the lost opportunities that had slipped through Ballmer’s fingers. \nFor seven years, beginning with the introduction of the Apple iPhone in 2007, Ballmer continued his misplaced focus of competing against Apple on the basis of hardware. Ballmer never seemed to fully grasp that the really dangerous aspect (to Microsoft at least) of the iPod and then the iPhone and iPad was the closed channel between all those mobile devices and the cloud-based iTunes store where users purchased software and media content. \nGoogle certainly understood what Apple was doing and quickly followed suit. \nWhile Microsoft largely stood and watched, Apple and Google took over the mobile space and grew their combined mobile user space to exceed the size of Microsoft’s desktop base. This last fact alone broke Microsoft’s operating system monopoly, as Cannonical’s Shuttlesworth recognized. \nIn May of 2013, Shuttleworth ceremoniously declared that Bug #1 had finally been fixed . He gave some credit to Microsoft’s move into cloud computing, begun under Ballmer, who, at that point, still had a little over a year to go as Microsoft’s CEO. \nBut what had really fixed the bug of Microsoft’s near monopoly market share, said Shuttleworth, was Google’s Linux-based Android operating system, which, at that point was running on over a billion mobile devices. \nOn Ballmer’s watch Microsoft was effectively shut out of the mobile space—and Ballmer’s last minute purchase of Nokia’s handset division in 2014 did nothing to change the fact. \nTo add insult to injury, both Apple and Google opted for a business model that made the mobile operating system a free background service and generated constant revenue by controlling the sales channel through which users acquired apps and media. \nBy 2014, over 1.5 billion iOS and Android users took it for granted that their operating systems updated automatically and for free. \nMicrosoft would’ve looked worse than old-fashioned had it tried, at that point, to continue charging Windows users for operating system upgrades. Better to rule in the desktop and serve in the cloud \nAs I see it, Apple and Google have, for the time being, barred Microsoft from growing into the mobile space. CEO Nadella appeared to concede as much in 2015 by writing off Ballmer’s purchase of Nokia’s handset division (and laying off most of its employees). \nNadella is building wisely, on the firm foundations of Microsoft’s strengths. Among other things, he’s growing the enterprise cloud computing business, left him by Ballmer, which leverages the company’s massive server/storage capacity. \nAnd if Microsoft can’t go to the mobile space—the fastest-growing and most lucrative part of computing—because it’s dominated by Apple and Google, then Nadella appears to be bringing the mobile space to the desktop, which Microsoft dominates—by adding all the key modalities of mobile to Windows 10, including: a so-called rolling release operating system with free updating; a closed application ecosystem, i.e., an app store; tight integration with cloud-based services; real-time harvesting of user analytics; and a chatbot digital assistant. If you can’t beat them, join them—then take them over \nBy joining the Linux Foundation Microsoft is underlining the kind of master-servant relationship that the commercial tech industry now has with free, open source software. \nThese days the Linux operating system is blood in the veins of computer tech. Linux powers the vast majority of computerized electronics, from web cams to CADD-driven lathes to street lights. Linux drives your HP printer. The Android in your Moto G phone is Linux. The Tizen OS in your Samsung phone/tablet/TV/refrigerator is Linux. \nLinux powers virtually all the routers that connect you to the Internet. Linux is the operating system that runs on the vast majority of computer servers that make up the Internet. The “cloud” is another name for the Internet. Linux IS the cloud. \nOne way to look at it is that Linux won. It’s everywhere, after all. But look again. Free Linux is being used everywhere like lightning in a bottle by commercial entities and less and less as an alternative operating system by ordinary computer users. \nThe Linux operating system has never become popular with the general public because: Its volunteer base cannot be made to create software to meet consumer demand. Without its own open hardware, it’s completely reliant on closed commercial hardware. Closed hardware vendors do not ship Linux computers because they won’t sell (see #1). \nLinux has instead become wildly popular within the computer industry as a sort of good and cheap pie filling for any computer device that doesn’t require much direct consumer interaction (like automated pumps, smart TVs and anything labelled as an Internet of Things thing). \nAnd it’s not as if Linux didn’t get its shot to become a popular alternative to Windows. \nOn either side of the admittedly solid Windows 7, were two very flawed versions of Windows —the pretty looking but abysmally performing Windows Vista and the miserable-looking but solidly coded Windows 8. Not to mention the never-say-die Windows XP, which still has an 8.27 percent market share, despite Microsoft’s best efforts to smother it with FUD . \nLinux, having blown its best chance to become a popular consumer operating system (except in the unrecognizable form of Android), is left as an inexpensive go-to resource for commercial computing. Microsoft and the other Platinum members of the Linux Foundation already own it in all but name and there is no reason why Microsoft will not soon own it in fact. Linux as a suburb of Windows \nWindows 10, from the outside, already looks like a Windows-themed version of Linux Mint. Under the hood, it had several new productivity features lifted straight from Linux, such as virtual desktops, window spread, desktop search, snap view, paste into the command prompt, package management and, of course, the ability to run real Linux command-line programs. \nIt was Cannonical, in fact, the makers of Ubuntu Linux, that actually helped Microsoft bring the true Linux Bash Shell to Windows 10 , which allows Windows users to run Linux command line programs that they download and install from the Ubuntu software repository, via Ubuntu’s apt-get command. \nAnd if Windows can now run actual command line Linux applications, I do not believe it will be long before desktop Linux applications will be able to be run in Windows as well. \nAnd to me, the logic of why Microsoft would add full Linux support to Windows (if it can) is obvious. \nFor starters, the typical Linux desktop borrows and adapts many interface elements from Windows—including the Taskbar, the Start menu, the basic File Explorer window and the right-click menu. This is both to entice Windows users to use Linux and to cater to existing Linux users—the majority of whom are also Windows users and who, quite often, dual boot Linux and Windows on their computers. Such users would likely be happy to run full Linux programs in Windows. \nIn Microsoft’s quest to get a billion Windows 10 users and create a closed Windows ecosystem to rival the mobile ecosystems of Apple and Google, there is no room for a desktop rival that can be so easily (and I would argue, willingly) absorbed into the Windows 10 hegemony. \nThe lesson of Google’s successful Linux-based Android operating system is that Linux works best as putty in the hands of a strong commercial entity with vision. By itself, Linux lacks the focus to become a dominant (or even particularly popular) operating system. \nIt could be argued (both paradoxically and correctly) that only by becoming a feature of the commercial closed source Windows operating system could Linux finally fulfill its stated goal of bringing the benefits of free open source software to the masses. \nAnyway, that’s how I expect Microsoft and the Linux Foundation to spin the announcement, when the time comes, that “Linux” has become “Microsoft Linux”. \nAnd won’t that be the day, for many of us, when Hell has really frozen over!

      "text": "Black Friday is just right around the corner and Microsoft is preparing itself for a blitz in hopes to keep itself ahead of the competition. ( Microsoft ) Advertisement \nMicrosoft is preparing itself for a blitz come Black Friday, which is why the Xbox Store is rocking with several great deals. From Xbox One consoles to the games, Microsoft has a deal for everyone it would seem from what we have witnessed. \nFolks who are looking for an awesome deal can save up to 50 percent on selected games and $50 when it comes down to the Xbox One. Even the accessories are going cheap for Black Friday, so no one should miss out on what Microsoft is cooking. Let's Talk About The Xbox Deals \nOne of the best deals Microsoft is rocking right now is of the Xbox One S . The console usually goes for $299, but come Nov. 22, Microsoft is slashing $50 off the price and giving consumers a $25 gift card along with a free game of their choice. This deal will run from Nov. 24 to 28. \nWe're not certain which accessories will see a price drop, but as with all Black Friday deals before, the controllers are always on the deals list. Now To The Games \nBet you've seen your friends playing Battlefield 1 on Xbox Live, but you couldn't get in on the fun because the money is just not there. Worry not because come Black Friday, Microsoft is selling this game at 25 percent off. However, if you're an Xbox Live Gold subscriber, then it can be had at 33 percent off. \nThe next game is FIFA 17 with 30 percent savings and 40 percent for gold subscribers. Forza Motorsport 6 Standard Edition is the other title that will go on sale when Black Friday comes around, expect the price to get slashed by 40 percent, and 50 percent for Xbox Live Gold subscribers. Grand Theft Auto V is another game destined to go on sale, keep an eye out for a 40 percent cut in price and a whopping 50 percent for Gold subscribers. \nBear in mind that Forza 6 Motorsports is not an Xbox Play Anywhere title ; however, Forza Horizon 3 is, but there's no Black Friday deal for this game, at least, not at the moment. Microsoft could surprise gamers when the day comes, or even on Cyber Monday. Here's The List Of Xbox 360 Games On Sale \n• Red Dead Redemption : save 40 percent, Gold saves 50 percent• Call of Duty Black Ops : save 40 percent, Gold saves 50 percent• Skate 3 : save 40 percent, Gold saves 50 percent• Madden 17 : save 30 percent, Gold saves 40 percent \nIt should be noted that disc-based games are the only ones that can save consumers up to 50 percent of the cost. Furthermore, Gold subscribers can take advantage of this deal beginning on Nov. 18, while everyone else will be forced to wait until Nov. 22. \nThe games on offer are great according to both critics and gamers alike. The Xbox One S is also a solid gaming machine, probably the best on the market behind the PlayStation 4 Pro. TAG © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft recently announced that System Center Configuration Manager Current Branch surpassed 50 Million devices under active management. Microsoft highlighted that more than 25,000 unique customers have upgraded to ConfigMgr Current Branch and they have reached this milestone in less than 1 year after its release. This is the fastest upgrade to a new version of ConfigMgr in its history.\nNearly every week we see 1M Windows 10 devices deployed in the enterprise. Of these 1M devices, more than 99% are managed via ConfigMgr. Organizations that base their Windows 10 deployments on ConfigMgr are using unified Windows management of ConfigMgr (i.e. managing their Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 traditional, and Windows 10 modern management devices via the single pane of ConfigMgr). Earlier this month, Microsoft released version 1610 for the Current Branch (CB) of System Center Configuration Manager that includes some great new features and product enhancements.\n",

      "text": "In their rush to do away with problematic passwords, Apple, Microsoft and other tech companies are nudging consumers to use their own fingerprints, faces and eyes as digital keys. Smartphones and other devices increasingly feature scanners that can verify your identity via these \"biometric\" signatures in order to unlock a gadget, sign into web accounts and authorize electronic payments. No security systems are perfect, said Anil Jain, a computer science professor at Michigan State University who helped police unlock a smartphone by using a digitally enhanced ink copy of the owner's fingerprints. Apple's iPhone 5S, launched in 2013, introduced fingerprint scanners to a mass audience, and rival phone makers quickly followed suit. Jain and two associates made a digital copy of the prints, enhanced them and then printed them out with special ink that mimics the conductive properties of human skin. Researchers at the University of North Carolina , meanwhile, fooled some commercial face-detection systems by using photos they found on the social media accounts of test subjects. To make such theft more difficult, biometric-equipped phones and computers typically encrypt fingerprints and similar data and store them locally, not in the \"cloud\" where hackers might lift them from company servers. Or it might be stored in a different database; Jain pointed to the 2015 computer breach at federal Office of Personnel Management, which compromised the files — including fingerprints — of millions of federal employees. There's a legal distinction between something you know, like a password, and something you possess, like a physical key or a fingerprint, said Marcia Hofmann, a San Francisco attorney who specializes in privacy and computer security.",

      "text": "By Cage Appleby Neowin LLC · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nIf you were lucky enough to pre-order the Microsoft Surface Studio, get ready to hold down your excitement, as the company has started to notify users their device will ship soon for all first day orders. \nIt's a slightly ambiguous move by Microsoft. Pre-ordered devices were originally slated to ship on December 15th, but was rescheduled to sometime in early 2017 . According to Brad Sams, a writer for Thurrott, early buyers can now expect their device to be processed and delivered this week, if you ordered the device during the first day of availability. The news comes after a user tweeted an image from an email they received from Microsoft, as seen below. \nThe Surface Studio has been met with critical acclaim, praising the device not only for its gorgeous screen and beautiful design but panning it for its steep price point. \nWhether or not the price is justified, it is clear Microsoft is relentlessly targeting a niche market, hoping to win over creative types alike. One can assume Microsoft shouldn't have too many problems, as the Surface brand has reinforced itself as a trustworthy and strong competitor in the market. \nWhile there will always be two sides to the coin, it is hard to disagree with how eye catching the Surface Studio is. The Studio's bespoke craftsmanship would surely complement the pristine and sterile environment studio spaces are often known for. Perhaps at this point, it is anyone's guess, but it will be interesting to watch Microsoft at least try to infiltrate the artistic market, and hope it works in the company's favor. \nIf you have pre-ordered the Surface Studio on the first day it became available, be sure to check your emails for a confirmation from Microsoft that your device will be shipping soon. \nSource: Image via Twitter | Thurrot t Tags",

      "text": "Microsoft announced a couple of days ago that it added a new feature called My Saves to its Bing Search engine.\nMy Saves, as the name suggests already, lets you save certain types of content so that you can access these saves at a later point in time or on other devices.\nThe feature is linked to a Microsoft Account which means that you need to sign in before it becomes available on Bing.\nThe current iteration of My Saves supports the saving of images, videos, shopping results and places.\nBing My Saves \nTo add an entry to the saves, simply hover over an appropriate result, say an image or video, and click on the plus icon that is displayed in a small overlay. The plus icon may also be displayed next to an item instead of on it when you hover it.\n\nThis saves the item to the My Saves page on Bing. You can access the page directly, or by clicking on the menu icon in the top right on Bing and selecting \"My saves\" from the context menu.\nWhile this works well for most supported items, you will notice that the plus icon is not displayed for some results.\nThat's without doubt the biggest restriction of the feature right now. You can't save regular web results to My Saves, and the saving won't even work for part of the image results as well.\nMy Saves vs Bookmarks My Saves is a bookmarking service at its core. You save items while using Bing to store them and get the chance to access them at a later point in time.\nThe items that you have saved are displayed directly as media files on the My Saves page.\nThe data is linked to a Microsoft Account so that you may access it again on any device without need for third-party add-ons or synchronization.\nThe downside to using My Saves is that it restricts what you can save to My Saves. You cannot save textual links, and only some image links can be saved.\nAnother restriction is that My Saves offers no search interface and no option to sort results into categories or folders. If you use it heavily, you will end up with a large list of image and video thumbnails that you cannot manage in any meaningful way (the only option you have is to remove items right now).\nClosing Words It is easy to overlook My Saves on Bing. The reason for this is that it is only available if you sign in to a Microsoft Account, and that the \"add icon\" is only displayed for select results and not all of them.\nThe feature is less powerful than browser bookmarking, but it may appeal to some Bing users nevertheless.\nNow You : What's your take on My Search?\n \nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post Bing My Saves launches appeared first on gHacks Technology News .\n",

      "text": "Microsoft Paint 3D Now Available With Windows 10 Insider Preview Build Microsoft announced Paint 3D in October Microsoft Remix 3D now expanded to several European countries Microsoft Edge now allows users to read e-books in EPUB format \nAt its 'What's next for Windows 10' event in October, Microsoft announced a completely revamped version of its painting app, simply named Paint 3D . Now the Redmond-based company has made the new version of its painting app available for use with its latest Windows 10 Insider Preview build. \nPaint 3D, put simply, allows users to make their paintings in 2D as well as 3D using various tools at their disposal. Even though the app doesn't introduce a breakthrough technology, because of its simplicity and easy controls, it can be termed as a 3D painting tool meant for use by a wide range of users. \nStarting with Windows 10 Insider Preview build 14971, every build of Windows 10 will carry the Paint 3D app and opening the paint app will take you to the Paint 3D preview app, the company said in a note regarding the release . As of now, both the app and the Remix 3D Preview, its online community for Paint 3D users, are only available in English but support for other languages will be coming soon as per Microsoft. Microsoft also announced that its community Remix 3D is now expanding to Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\nApart from the revamped Paint app, the Windows 10 Insider Preview build 14971 brings along the capability of reading e-books in the EPUB format to Microsoft's Edge browser. \n\"When you open an unprotected e-book in Microsoft Edge, you will be taken into a customisable reading experience where you can change the font and text size and choose between 3 themes: light, sepia, and dark. As you read, you can leave bookmarks. To navigate through an e-book, you can use the table of contents or seek bar at the bottom of the browser. And you can also search for words or phrases and use Cortana to define specific words,\" the company said in its release note. \nWith Windows 10 Insider Preview build 14971, the company has also made PowerShell the defacto command shell from File Explorer. The preview build further comes with other bug fixes for the operating system as well. \nThe build is available for the Windows Insiders who are part of company's Fast Ring to check the features in latest builds of Windows as soon as they are made available by the company.",

It was a bit of, I don’t want to throw up but I don’t feel regular, for a while. That’s almost worse; you’d rather just throw up and get it done!

      "text": "US Takes Microsoft’s Side in the War Against Russia GO US official says they’re concerned over LinkedIn ban in Russia, as this could set a precedent for other restrictions Nov 21, 2016 09:41 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Russia has blocked access to LinkedIn last week , and while Microsoft’s struggling to resolve the problems its newly-purchased service has in the country, United States officials also step in to take the side of the Redmond-based software giant. Maria Olson, spokeswoman at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, expressed public concerns that banning LinkedIn could set a dangerous precedent in Russia, as the country could then proceed to blocking other services as well. This could only harm competition and local users, she was quoted as saying by Reuters . “The United States is deeply concerned by Russia’s decision to block access to the website LinkedIn,” she said. “This decision is the first of its kind and sets a troubling precedent that could be used to justify shutting down any website that contains Russian user data.” Russia says LinkedIn can resolve its problems in the country On the other hand, Russia says the LinkedIn ban can be lifted only if the service complies with regulations and moves data of Russia users on servers that are located within the country’s borders. Russian Communications Minister Nikolai Nikiforov expressed in a statement that the decision to block LinkedIn was made by courts, and not by the country itself. “We hope a constructive dialogue can solve this situation,” he was quoted as saying. “All foreign companies have to act in line with the law and there are many that have no problems with respecting the legislation.” On the other hand, LinkedIn says that it’s indeed interesting in lifting restrictions on its service and the company wants to meet with Russian officials and address the matter. LinkedIn previously said that it scheduled a November 11 meeting with Russia, but for some reason, this didn’t take place. LinkedIn currently has 6 million users in Russia and whoever attempts to connect to the service these days is hit with a message saying that “Access to the resource you requested is restricted.”",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft hates the fact that Windows 10 users continue to dwell on Chrome and Firefox as their default browsers. As such, the company has been busy lately trying to come up with new tricks, tips and comparisons to convince users to adopt the built-in Edge browser . This time, the software giant claims its Edge browser is more secure than the other two. \nIf you run Windows 10, you may have noticed that Microsoft has turned on a new set of Windows Tips to inform Chrome and Firefox users that Edge is a safer browser. When inquired, Microsoft reported that this latest recommendation had been active since November. Getting a sense of deja vu ? \nIt is because a similar thing happened back in July when Microsoft started generating notifications warning Chrome/Firefox users about battery drain and then recommended Edge instead: \nThis wave of Windows Tips for Windows 10 users began in early November. These Windows Tips notifications were created to provide people with quick, easy information that can help them enhance their Windows 10 experience. \nThe pop-up notifications are a part of Microsoft’s “ Windows Tips for Windows 10 ” campaign which launched in early November. As claimed by Microsoft, the service was launched as a means to promote or educate users about the new Windows 10 features. But lately, it seems that Microsoft has been using it more to its advantage, not to user benefit. The company has lately been criticized for attempting to promote features affiliated to advertisements. \nThe notification read: \nMicrosoft Edge is safer than Firefox. It blocks 21% more socially engineered malware. Learn more. \nA similar message is shown to Chrome users but with a different percentage. The company claims to have drawn the statistics from NSS Labs which conducted tests and experiments on browsers recently proving that Edge blocks 91.4% of phishing URLs and 99% of social engineered malware. The percentage values for Chrome were 82.4% and 85.8%, and for Firefox 81.4% and 78.3%. \nMicrosoft has a long-standing relationship with NSS labs and has been asking them to conduct various tests and analysis often. Unsurprisingly, the results always turn out in favor of its own browser, Microsoft Edge . \nGiven the circumstances, it doesn’t look like Edge is doing so well with only a 5% market share . It does seem that Microsoft has intensified its browser cold war lately, exploiting its place as the creator of the most popular OS. It appears that the company is using its OS more for promotion purposes than user convenience, while its competitors Google and Firefox don’t have the same kind of leverage and resources to highlight their strengths. \nAnnoyed with these notifications? We won’t blame you if you are. Just press the keys Windows-I to open the Settings app, go to System > Notifications & actions , Locate “ Get tips, tricks, and suggestions as you use Windows “, and switch the preference to Off. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "Click to print (Opens in new window) Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington. \nThe practice has yet to gain widespread acceptance, but internal carbon pricing is starting to catch on in the global business community. One of the companies setting the standard is Microsoft, which back in 2012 imposed what can be best described as an internal carbon tax in order to nudge the company closer to carbon neutrality. \nNow, some results are in: During the COP22 climate talks in Marrakesh, Morocco, the company released a white paper that makes a strong business case for an internal carbon fee. \nMicrosoft’s argument is that such a policy can help a company become more efficient and also inspire social and economic impacts far beyond its headquarters. \nMicrosoft’s sustainability strategy sounded cliché at first, with its three pillars of “be lean, be green, be accountable.” Four years later, however, the company is arguably practicing what it preached. \nIt set targets to become leaner by decreasing its energy consumption, which includes the use of technology to reduce unnecessary business travel. In turn, the company’s drive to be “green” includes ambitious commitments to the purchase of more renewable energy. With such efforts comes transparency and accountability, as the company established an internal price on carbon. It also tracks emissions with software and encourages employees to change their habits through several sustainability awareness programs. \nThe results are certainly impressive. Microsoft reduced its carbon emissions impact by 9 million tons of CO2 equivalent since 2014. The company has in turn invested in more than 14 million megawatt-hours of renewable power. Microsoft suggests that 7 million people across the world benefited from its investments in carbon offset projects. \nIt is that last point by which Microsoft can offer companies ideas on how they can “create impact.” All companies say they want to have a positive impact – the trick is actually executing such a plan. Microsoft opted to purchase carbon credits that balance out its emissions, whether they come from business travel or the consumption of energy in regions where clean-energy generation is not a possibility. \nThe benefits, Microsoft says, can be seen all over the map. Its carbon offsets funded clean cookstove programs in countries such as Guatemala, Ethiopia and Nepal. Environmental conservation projects launched in regions as remote as Australia’s Tasmania and coastal Chile. The company even purchased carbon offsets in Mongolia, which fund energy-efficiency and home-insulation projects. ( Citigroup is involved in a similar program in Mongolia.) Microsoft says these programs reached students, women, farmers and wildlife around the world. \nThis is not just one-way philanthropy. Microsoft has the opportunity to strengthen business ties across the globe due to its offering of technology that helps these projects succeed. After all, technology donated now could lead to contracts in the future. The company says its smartphones and tablets help locals working on the Rimba Raya REDD+ Project in Indonesia document the local environment – one that has suffered since palm oil companies moved into the region and disrupted the ecosystem and local economy. Microsoft partnered with other REDD+ (the United Nations’ Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) projects in Madagascar and Malawi. \nIt is here where some may quibble with Microsoft’s insistence that is has actually affected the lives of as many as 7 million people; the REDD+ program has its fair share of critics , who suggest that while the program is noble, it lacks the necessary enforcement and due diligence mechanisms that could otherwise make the program far more effective. \nBut when it comes to creating a company culture that understands and values sustainability, Microsoft sets the bar high. Climate grants available to business groups and subsidiaries give the freedom to explore projects as mundane as improving energy efficiency, to the funding of initiatives that to some may seem the more outlandish — as in Project Natick , the testing of a subsea data center off the U.S. Pacific shore. \nThe world may agree that the climate cannot warm any more than 2 degrees Celsius this century if society is to avoid risks and increased disasters due to climate change. The solutions will be difficult to achieve. And they will require plenty of experimentation, with some ideas failing as others will scale. \nOn that point, Microsoft is way ahead of the curve and will long serve as a case study for why the business community needs to take climate change more seriously; and better yet, the company offers ideas instead of hand-wringing. \nImage credit: Robert Scoble/ Flickr",

      "title": "Can Microsoft’s Upcoming Phone Help Windows Phone OS Rise From the Ashes?",
      "text": "Microsoft Corporation ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) has been struggling with its Windows phone for a very long time. It made several failed efforts to grab a sizable chunk of the smartphone market by riding on the back of its flagship devices like Nokia Lumia series and the latest HP Elite X3 . However, Android and iOS devices continue to rule the market. According to the latest rumour , HP and Microsoft are one again gearing up to launch a Windows 10 powered smartphone in early 2017 . The device is rumoured to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress 2017 as a successor of HP Elite X3.\nThe specifications of the device are unknown. Given the fact that both Microsoft and HP need to make a mark in the market, we can expect interesting and attractive upgrades in the device. The Elite X3 hosts Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 820 with 4GB RAM, 64GB storage and a 16-megapixel camera which means we can expect more advanced Snapdragon 835, 6-8 GB RAM, different storage capacity versions and a better camera quality in the upcoming version. However,\nBut hardware specifications are not the primary reason behind the disappointing performance of Windows Phones in the market. Windows mobiles are failing to make a mark because of its OS – Windows Phone OS.\nWindows Phone OS Failure Microsoft’s Windows Phone OS have always failed to provide its users with a great experience. To provide a unified and seamlessly integrated experience between mobile and desktop the company is powering all mobile devices with Windows 10 OS. The interface, however, fails to attract the mobile users. It lacks many convenient features, such as control centre, which provides access to general settings and controls. On the other side, these features are frequently used and are provided by Android and iOS.\nBesides, Windows Phone Store is pretty disappointing for its users. The app store lacks many popular games and apps. As it fails to attract app developers, most of the apps are either not upgraded regularly or are not introduced on the Windows Phone OS platform. This is resulting in a great disappointment for Windows mobile users, especially when they see their peers on Android or iOS platform enjoying the latest features of apps. Undoubtedly, Windows will need to work on providing an unmatched user experience to win the lost and new customers. However, it is going to be a tough call for Windows phones to beat Android and iOS.\nWindows Lost the OS Market The smartphone operating system market has become highly competitive. Android leads the OS market with the maximum market share. As of Q3 2016, Windows Phone OS market share touched a mere 0.4% compared to iOS’ 11.5% and Android’s 87.8%. Microsft revealed that the revenue from phones has decreased by $4.2 billion (56%) in the fiscal year 2016, thanks to to the falling sales of Windows Lumia Phones. The sales of Lumia devices went down by nearly 60% within a year, to 13.8 million units in fiscal 2016 from 36.8 million units in the fiscal year 2015.\nWhen the sales/revenue of a product/brand falls at such a high rate, it means that the consumers are changing their track towards a better option available in the market. However, Microsoft and HP are still not ready to give up.\nWhat is Wrong with Microsoft? If we consider the brilliant features and design introduced in Surface Pro 4 by Microsoft, it gives us a reason to believe that Microsoft still has the potential to think and develop great mobile devices and software for an unmatched experience. However, the company is trying to kill two birds with one stone – which has never been fruitful for any company in the past. Apple and Google both tried to follow the same model but failed, and later decided to power Desktop and Mobile Environment with two separate operative systems. The reason is simple, mobile and desktop are two different ecosystems altogether and users behaviour on one ecosystem is quite different compared to the other one.\nWith the current scenario and past performances, however, it is highly doubtful that the successor of Elite X3 will be a hit in the market, until and unless it offers something unique and unprecedented experience. Android and iOS are loaded with tons of features and Customers are having a tough time choosing between them, leave alone Windows. The problem is not that the consumers do not need a Windows phone, but Microsoft has mismanaged it badly. The inconsistent third-party support, distribution chaos and unavailability of apps has been disappointing users for long and making them shy away from Windows Phones. It seems like Microsoft doesn’t believe in itself because of its changing strategies and lurching behaviour.\nWhile we are doubtful of the fate of the upcoming Windows device, let’s just wait for the device to launch. You never know what Satya Nadella has got in its kitty to surprise us all !\n",

Buyers are now receiving emails telling them that the Surface Studio is ready to ship, and given the fact that this week it’s Thanksgiving Day, they should get the device sometime in the next 24 to 72 hours. “Your new Surface Studio is almost here. Good news, your new Surface Studio is available early. We will be processing payment and shipping your new Surface Studio the week of November 21, 2016. You will receive a shipping notification once your order is processed,” a message that only the luckiest Surface Studio buyers are getting reads. At this point, absolutely all Surface Studio models that can be purchased from Microsoft’s online store ship in early 2017, including the top-of-the-range configuration with 2 TB storage space, 32 GB RAM, Intel Core i7 processor and $4,199 price. On the other hand, if you pre-order the Surface Studio right now, you also get a free Surface Dial, the revolutionary accessory that would otherwise be available separately for $99. The Surface Studio in all its glory In case you forgot how awesome the Surface Studio is, then it’s worth noting that the device comes with a 28-inch PixelSense display with a resolution of 4500x3000 pixels and 10-point multi-touch, up to quad-core Intel Core i7 CPUs, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M 2GB GPU GDDR5 memory or NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980M 4GB GPU, up to 32 GB RAM and 2 TB storage. The Surface Studio has pretty much everything you could get from an AIO PC, including 4 USB 3.0 ports, an SD card reader, a mini DisplayPort, a headphone jack, built-in camera for Windows Hello, dual microphones, stereo 2.1 speakers with Dolby sound, and many other goodies that make it one of the most powerful computers at this point. Shipment of new orders are pushed to early 2017 CHECK OUT THE GALLERY (2 Images)",

Microsoft’s Next Generation Volume Licensing (NGVL) platform is the foundation for its $60 billion per year Enterprise Volume Licensing and OEM businesses globally. Objective Handle peak contracting periods for the company’s rapidly growing worldwide cloud business across multiple geographies and languages. Results Auto-scaling to handle peak demand at 175 agreements/minute Reduced contract cycle time from 90 days to 15 days Supports clauses, templates and agreements globally for all regions and languages where Microsoft licenses its products Supports familiar standard Microsoft CRM User Interface Microsoft Standardizes on the Icertis Contract Management Platform to Manage its Enterprise Volume Licensing and OEM Business Worldwide The powerful combination of Microsoft Azure’s auto- scaling enterprise cloud, coupled with the Icertis Contract Management (ICM) platform’s ability to handle the complexity and pace of a US $60 billion cloud business, ensures smooth handling of surges in demand when salespeople rush to get sales agreements signed. Business Challenge Due to the rapid growth of Microsoft’s cloud business, the company’s enterprise volume licensing and OEM contracting processes needed to be quickly enhanced to deliver more velocity and scale supporting contracting needs across the world and in multiple languages. In addition, the sales team demanded continued world-class contracting velocity, especially during the critical quarter-end and year-end periods. Slide 2 Solution The Icertis Contract Management platform’s clause and template management sub-system easily handled the 100s of templates and 1000s of clauses across multiple geographies and languages. Rules for dynamic clause assembly helped quickly and automatically create contracts based on any metadata, empowering the sales team to self-serve themselves, dramatically reducing contract cycle time from 90 days to 15 days. Microsoft Azure’s auto-scaling and ICM’s ability to handle high concurrency loads ensured smooth handling of the surge in demand at the end of the quarter and year, when salespeople are pushing hard to close deals and need a contract management system that works with and for them. Results “With the Icertis Contract Management platform, we are providing our sales team with a robust, hyper scale contract management solution to handle the high quarter-end and year-end volumes,” says Tony Ulkekul, Head of Enterprise Commerce Engineering. “Even with the multiple regions and languages involved, the Icertis platform is meeting and exceeding our SLA expectations by generating complex, multi-page volume licensing agreements at peak times. Empowering our sales team with self-service contract templates has reduced contract cycle time from 90 days to only 15 days.” Tony Ulkekul, Head of Enterprise & Corporate IT About Icertis Icertis is the leading provider of contract lifecycle management in the cloud.

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft has recently announced their plans to abandon support for TLS certificates signed by the SHA -1 hashing algorithm starting February of 2017. Microsoft further acknowledged that numerous websites, users, and third-party applications will be severely affected once the company deplores SHA-1 signed certificates. \nStarting on February 14 th , 2017 , Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 will prevent sites that are protected with a SHA-1 certificate from loading and will display an invalid certificate warning. Though we strongly discourage it, users will have the option to ignore the error and continue to the website, said Microsoft in is blog post . \nThe revelation is not exactly news: the company hinted as much back in November. \nThe SHA-1 hashing algorithm, used for internet security in conjunction with with the HTTPS protocol and certificates used to protect Web sites, has been declared unsafe and vulnerable to attacks from well-funded adversaries back since 2005 but was largely utilized before until the SHA-2 and SHA-3 algorithms that were tested to be more secure alternatives for hashing functionalities came along. The initiative is not a new one and the function has previously been denounced and rejected by Google and Mozilla for being more prone to cryptographic collisions than estimated. \nMicrosoft has detailed that their browsers, Edge and the Internet Explorer , will now prevent sites using SHA-1 signed certificates from loading and will display an “invalid certificate” warning in order to restore security back to the services. Although users won’t be compelled to skip the sites, they will have the option to bypass the threat and access the potentially vulnerable website despite the warning, just without the “bar lock” trust icon that users see in the address bar of their browsers. \nThird-party Windows applications running the Windows SHA-1 cryptographic API set or former versions of Internet Explorer will not be affected by these changes. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) Jordan Strauss \nIdina Menzel, right, arrives at the American Music Awards at the Microsoft Theater on Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016, in Los Angeles. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Stars at the American Music Awards are still thinking about the \"Hamilton\" cast's statement to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, for which President-elect Donald Trump is demanding an apology. \nBroadway star Idina Menzel said the theater is the perfect place to provoke thought, as the \"Hamilton\" cast did when they told Pence after a recent show that they hoped it would inspire him to work for all Americans. \n\"It's the right place and it's beautiful and that's what theater's all about: It's about being thought-provoking,\" Menzel said Sunday on her way into the American Music Awards, where she was set to take the stage as a presenter. \"And it's just unfortunate that someone who's going to be our president doesn't embrace that as a freedom of speech and the arts, and sort of celebrate that moment... I'm really proud of all my friends in Hamilton and I thought it took a lot of courage.\" \nFrom the stage, she declared, \"I love you 'Hamilton!'\" \nProducer Diplo echoed her support for free speech. \n\"People can say whatever they want. That's what's great about America,\" he said. \"That's awesome those guys took a second to speak, and they made a story about it, so that's even better. It breeds awareness.\" \nActress Keke Palmer said the presidential nominees ushered in \"a new age\" with their disrespectful tone during the campaign. \n\"People should have a certain amount of respect for the government and the president and the vice president, but the president and the vice president and all those people should have a certain amount of respect for the people that they're catering to,\" she said. \"You can't create a disrespectful atmosphere and then not expect the people to disrespect you back.\" \nDonnie Wahlberg, who came to the AMAs with wife Jenny McCarthy, said he thought the \"Hamilton\" cast remarks were \"more appropriate than many other ways people have been speaking out.\" \n\"They were respectful! I thought they were very respectful,\" Wahlberg said. \"Maybe something like that's never happened before, but I think the proper response was the one Mike Pence gave, which is, 'We hear you.' \" \nThe American Music Awards are being broadcast live on ABC.

      "text": "A few things to bear in mind for anyone on the fence... I have the i7 model and it's mostly great but it is not a fantastic tablet. If you are looking for a tablet experience, look elsewhere. Think of it more like a very slim laptop. Windows 10 just isn't very good for general tablet use, normal windows 10 programs can be hit or miss. Generally, if its from the Windows app store then it will be fine, but there are very few apps available. The battery life if more on par with an average laptop than what you might expect from a tablet. Realistically I get between 2 and 3 hours. Maybe 5 at a push if its in eco mode. The screen is fantastic and gets retina burningly bright, the touch screen and stylus are brilliant too. Kickstand is fantastic and very usable for lap browsing. Lap typing with the keyboard cover isn't great. Overall, I'd say just make sure you know what you are getting. Its a windows laptop thats super sleek. You will not get the same experience that you would with an android tablet. If you need to be able to use Windows programs, you couldn't do much better for a portable machine, but if you want to browse the web and play (mobile) games, look elsewhere.",

      "text": "Microsoft is planning to support virtual reality experiences for all Windows 10 PCs as part of the Creators Update next year. While HTC’s Vive and Oculus’ Rift use their own custom software, Microsoft is attempting to create its own VR platform with Windows Holographic, the same environment that powers the company’s HoloLens headset. The software giant revealed that VR headsets for Windows 10 will start at $299 , and now it’s starting to detail the PC specs required to power those VR experiences.\nIn the latest test builds of Windows 10, Microsoft is now including a \"Windows Holographic First Run\" application that tests a machine to ensure it’s compatible. I’ve tested a variety of machines, and it appears that Microsoft’s minimum requirements are pretty basic:\n4GB of RAM USB 3.0 port A graphics card with DirectX 12 support 4 CPU cores, including dual-core processors with hyperthreading That’s good news for anyone interesting in stepping into virtual reality without the big costs of PC power and the actual headset itself. Microsoft is planning to detail more about its VR headsets for Windows 10 at an event in December. While the first run app is present in Windows 10 test builds, the full holographic shell is not yet available to run on devices like HTC’s Vive. We’re expecting Microsoft to enable this in the coming weeks as the company starts to discuss more about its VR plans.",

      "text": "0 0 \nAfter Microsoft announced the discontinuation of their Lumia phones with a heavy heart, the company has since been collaborating with third-party firms in hopes of reviving the Windows 10 Mobile ecosystem again. \nWe will continue to support and update the Lumia devices that are currently in the market, and the development of Windows 10 phones by OEMs, such as HP, Acer, Alcatel, VAIO, and Trinity; as well as develop great new devices. \nThis time, HP has stepped up and taken it upon themselves to launch a next-generation Windows powered, consumer phone by February 2017. \nWhile Windows users were anxiously waiting for some news regarding the release of a Surface Phone from Microsoft’s side, HP emerged as a savior. The company will ostensibly cover the majority of the workload, which includes the manufacture and sale of the upcoming handset, while Microsoft is left with taking responsibility for investing in the product development. \nSo, any residual hopes of an upcoming Surface Phone are long gone. But considering the massive applause HP’s Elite X3 received, HP taking the steering wheel for this might actually prove to be beneficial. Although the Elite X3 is a business targeted phone, details from German site Dr. Windows report that HP is working with Microsoft on a Windows 10 Mobile device that’s specifically aimed at consumers. \nDetails on the device are pretty lean at the moment, but the phone is rumored to be immensely inspired by the design and specifications of Microsoft’s Lumia phones , inheriting features like ClearBlack screens, Glance , double tap to wake and more, all of which previously existed in Lumia devices. \nGiven the limited expertise HP has as a smartphone manufacturer, taking incentive from the professionals in the domain would be a smart move. The upcoming device could very well be called a successor to HP Elite X3, which was announced last February. \nPredicting the hardware specs of the upcoming HP consumer phone, it is going to be a guaranteed upgrade from their Elite X3 that uses a Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB of RAM, so we can expect improved and advanced internals conceivably including a Snapdragon 835 and 6 GB of RAM. \nAlthough the posh price tag labeled on Elite X3 devices kept away most consumers and marked it as a business phone, the HP/Microsoft collaboration is certainly aiming to change that with their new project. Given the hard time Microsoft has been facing lately in the smartphone domain, the alliance is undoubtedly a blessing in disguise for the company. \n ",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft released Windows 10 build 14971 last week. We already told you about some of the most common issues caused by this build but apparently, that’s not all. \nOne user reports on Microsoft’s forums that the last couple of builds set Microsoft Edge as the default browser in Windows 10 . In addition to that, none of his desktop website shortcuts seem to work with any other browser, except for Edge. \nHere’s what he said on the forums : \nHi…Edge is set to default after the upgrade….I don’t like this….but what is worse is after I reset Firefox…my Desktop short cuts to web sites do not work anymore as with build 14965….if I change Edge back to default then the short cuts work….but I do not want or like Edge…. If M$ is forcing us to use Edge then I will no longer endorse Windows 10 period. I will wait to see what happens…I hope this is just a stitch gone loose in the continued construction of this windows 10 project. \nThis is a very annoying issue, especially for those who don’t use Edge on a regular basis. It is well known that Microsoft encourages Windows 10 users to use Edge through various tips, suggestions and test results . However, this is something completely different. \nWindows 10 is literally forcing Microsoft Edge down users’ throat by crippling other browsers. Now, since this happened in Windows 10 Preview, we cannot say for sure this was done on purpose, and it probably wasn’t. \nAll in all, Microsoft needs to fix this issue, because it will only drive away users from switching to Edge , because no one likes to be forced into something. Remember what happened with the Windows 10 upgrade process ? \nHave you noticed any similar issues with Edge or some other unusual features in the latest Windows 10 build? If the answer is yes, let us know in the comments. \n ",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nLatest News\nAUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND – Media OutReach – Nov 21, 2016 – In Microsoft’s Data Culture Champions Series in Asia, we speak to Simon Challies, Managing Director of Ryman Healthcare, on how the leading retirement village operator has digitally transformed its business to mitigate risk and better care for its seniors residing within its premises.\nAccording to IDC, 60% of the top 1,000 Asia Pacific organizations will have digital transformation at the center of their corporate strategy by the end of 2017. While one would imagine that organizations start their digital transformation journey with a bold vision to transform their entire business, many actually kick-start their journey with very humble goals.\nThe transformation journey for Ryman Healthcare, a leading retirement village operator in New Zealand, started two years ago to mitigate risks of documentation errors. The company knew that it was risky to depend on manual and paper-based documentation especially when it comes to patient care. Ryman Healthcare also lost its head office in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake — so the company had good reason to be nervous about how it stored its information.\nIts solution was to digitize its business processes so they could be captured and analyzed more easily, cutting down any possible errors in its interactions with older people under its care.\nThis single digital project provided the fuel for Ryman Healthcare to use data in transforming staff productivity and ultimately, enhancing customer experiences. “The status quo was not acceptable,” said Simon Challies, Managing Director of Ryman Healthcare. The company now aims to have 95 per cent of processes digitized. Up until two years ago, 95 per cent of them were carried out with pen and paper.”\nRyman Healthcare is working to develop myRyman, a tablet-based nursing app running on Microsoft Surface devices and Azure cloud services.\nThe app will help handle the staff roster, let staff communicate with one another and check which residents they are expected to see on the day. When it is complete, myRyman will also provide transparency to residents, giving them an opportunity to understand how Ryman Healthcare staff are working around the clock to provide the best patient care.\nThe drivers for transformation\nData is the new currency for forward-thinking organizations to enable business innovation. While harnessing data through technology has been around, new cloud and data technologies have allowed for new possibilities in data insights. With the right tools, insights can come from anyone, anywhere, at any time. When that happens, organizations develop what Microsoft describe as a “new data culture”.\nFor a new data culture to happen, organizations need to recognize the new opportunities for harnessing unprecedented insights that can be derived from data collected in this digital world. In fact, Microsoft Asia’s Data Culture Survey, involving 940 C-suite executives and business decision makers in Asia, shows that business leaders feel that implementing a data strategy needs to start right from the top. The survey found that a majority of business leaders (87%) feel that a data strategy should not only be implemented through a top-down approach, but that it should also be a formalized role in management in order to drive transition to a data-driven organization.\nIn the driver’s seat for Ryman Healthcare’s digital transformation journey is Challies. He said the efforts to develop a data culture would not be possible without a champion, especially a manager from the top.\nHe sees this digital transformation as way to stay ahead of the business curve, where today, Ryman Healthcare is an industry and market leader, operating 30 retirement villages in New Zealand with 6,000 village units and aged care beds. In addition to building more retirement villages across New Zealand, the company is also embarking on expanding its operations into Australia.\n“We wanted to stay ahead of the competition. Because we knew that we had to leverage technology if we wanted to continue growing and to keep an eye on competitors in the market,” Challies said.\nHe has charted a singular focus of changing patient care and service for Ryman Healthcare. Residents, doctors, care-givers and nurses all want one thing — more time to spend caring for patients.\nRyman Healthcare could have assumed that seniors under its care were not tech-savvy. What it found, however, was that residents took to tablets quickly and were keen to use them. Challies said: “Because finally, they’ve got a device which they’re comfortable using, to a scale that they like. So they open up when it works for them because they won’t typically use smart phones or desktops, but they are happy to use a tablet.”\nA Ryman Healthcare resident trying out the myRyman app on a Windows device\nData-driven transformation, made possible by the Microsoft Cloud\nAt the core of what Ryman Healthcare is driving is to get better insights. As it digitizes processes and its interactions with seniors in the villages, lots of useful insights are being generated and analyzed on Microsoft Azure, forming the foundation for the company’s business transformation.\nAlthough the initial aim was to solve one business problem — mitigating risks — the efforts have since changed the way the company does business as well. In future, as it unearths more insights from its data, there could potentially be more benefits to be reaped.\n“We wanted data to be managed in a structured fashion in the cloud because then we could really use it to make better decisions, make more consistent decisions,” said Challies.\n“We also wanted to embed all our processes more firmly in software because prior to this, in the paper documentation process, most of our processes were written up on manuals and sat on shelves and collected dust. We would have liked it if they were used, but in reality, they were not,” he added.\nWhile it is early days he is clear about what the ultimate goal for a new data culture is — the ability to help predict challenges and exploit new opportunities.\nThree ingredients for success\nChallies noted that resistance towards developing a new data culture was expected but once it was clear how staff would benefit; driving adoption of the new technology was made easier. In his experience, three things would help to bring about a successful transformation:\n1. Change from the top\nIt is important to have someone lead the effort, bringing various departments on board from the start. Challies took on that role in Ryman Healthcare, where his job as managing director included pushing everyone — the operations team, clinicians and IT department — in the right direction.\n“The biggest hurdle was getting everyone to believe in the vision. There was also the challenge in communicating the vision and getting other people to move out of their comfort zone,” said Challies.\nSimon Challies, Managing Director of Ryman Healthcare\n“It was tough getting the operations and clinical teams over the line which is not surprising. They’re the ones that are going to be the most skeptical as they viewed more automation and change as being too uncertain. Once we got them to envision an outcome they believed in, one where they could see the benefits to be reaped, they were in a rush to get there,” he added.\n2. Democratization of data and services\nEmpowering users will lead to faster adoption and more meaningful uses of data and digital services. At Ryman Healthcare, nurses can now add their names to a roster instead of waiting to be assigned by a manager.\n“If you give them the tools and abilities to make decisions to do things for themselves, you can trust them to do it because they’ll do the right thing,” said Challies.\n“Giving people access to information and the right tools to communicate and interact is better than being wound up in processes that are not necessarily helping their workplace relationships,” he added.\n3. IT is an enabler, but not necessarily a driver\nOne barrier to Ryman Healthcare’s efforts were IT professionals. Changing things was too risky and it often just could not be done, was what Challies was told. “IT consultants can help, but ultimately, the people in the departments and functions have to drive these digital transformation projects,” he said.\n“If the IT people were to drive it on their own, then you’d get an IT solution that doesn’t reflect your business,” he noted. His partnership with IT is key.\nResidents enjoying a day out in the sun at one of Ryman Healthcare’s retirement villages. Credit: Intergen",

      "title": "Microsoft Edge Is Safer Than Google Chrome And Mozilla Firefox, New Windows 10 Notification Claims",
      "text": "Microsoft Edge Is Safer Than Google Chrome And Mozilla Firefox, New Windows 10 Notification Claims 21 November 2016, 7:24 am EST By Alexandra Burlacu Tech Times Internet In A Minute Now Playing Microsoft added a new Windows 10 \"tip,\" this time targeting Chrome and Firefox users to urge them to switch to Edge. According to the new tip, Edge is safer than both Chrome and Firefox, fending off 21 percent more \"socially engineered malware.\" ( Venture Beat ) Advertisement \nMicrosoft continues to aggressively push its Windows 10 OS and features, and the latest trick is a pop-up telling users that Edge is safer than Chrome and Firefox. \nTo say that Microsoft has heavily promoted Windows 10 would be a gross understatement. The company went above and beyond to push its latest operating system and harassed users with constant notifications, pop-ups, alerts and other nagware . \nNot too long ago, Microsoft started pushing intrusive notifications alerting users that Google Chrome drained their device's battery life faster than the Microsoft Edge browser. In fact, Microsoft said that Edge was the best browser for battery life , but it didn't stop there. Windows Tips \nEarlier this month, Microsoft started a blatant Windows 10 promotion that urged Google Chrome users to switch to Microsoft Edge . Microsoft served these suggestions as Windows Tips notifications, but instead of getting tips on how to navigate the OS or use various features, Chrome users got Edge ads that Microsoft denied were ads. \nMicrosoft is now at it again, introducing a new Windows tip that now informs Chrome and Firefox users that Edge is safer. According to the pop-up, Edge can fend off 21 percent more socially engineered malware compared to its rivals, VentureBeat reports . \nThe new notification tip appears just above the Edge task bar icon and aims to convince more Windows 10 users to rely on Edge for their browsing needs. Still, Microsoft allows users to opt out of such notifications, at least in theory. \nTo turn this feature off, head over to Settings > System > Notifications and toggle off \"Get tips, tricks and suggestions as you use Windows.\" \nIf this doesn't work, however, it wouldn't be the first time. There have been cases before when users disabled various Windows 10 features only to see Microsoft continue its aggressive push, ignoring their settings. Microsoft Edge Push \nMicrosoft Edge is not among the most popular browsers currently in use, and not for lack of trying. Microsoft has constantly struggled to improve its browser and appeal to more users, promising to keep hackers at bay , preserve battery life and more, to no avail. \nOther browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Opera are still leading the charge and it remains to be seen whether this new Edge promotion will work out in its favor or in its detriment. Users tend to get frustrated by intrusive ads and aggressive promotions, so the end result could be opposite of what Microsoft's hoping for. \nHave you tried out Microsoft Edge? If not, would such an ad promoting it as the safer option convince you to switch from Chrome or Firefox to Edge? Let us know in the comment section below.  ",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 45 minutes ago with 0 comments \nThis month, Microsoft launched updated versions of its Surface Book with Intel Core i7 processors, upgraded graphics performance, and improved battery life, priced from $2,399. Of course, not everyone needs such fierce performance on the go - and not everyone can afford it either. \nIf your budget is a bit more modest, Microsoft is hoping to tempt you into buying its entry-level Surface Book instead. With a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD, it usually costs $1,499 - but Microsoft has now slashed its price by $250 (just under 17%), reducing it to $1,249 . \nThat deal will remain available until November 28 - but if you can squeeze a bit more out of your bank account, you might be interested in another offer later this week. \nAs part of its Black Friday promotions , Microsoft will be offering a whopping $400 (21%) off its Surface Book model with Core i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and a discrete GPU. Normally priced at $1,899, it will be available instead for $1,499.",

The main window basically provides quick access to three different sides of the application, which are actually the only features at your disposal. You can scan a computer using its name or IP address, as well as multiple computers within a domain name or a range of IP addresses. You can also view existing security scan reports. The application checks the system for Windows administrative vulnerabilities, weak passwords, IIS and SQL administrative vulnerabilities, as well as security updates, providing a detailed report and instructions on how to turn your system into a more secure working environment. A system scan takes only a few minutes and although Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer may stress up the CPU and memory a little bit, it should be able to run on most Windows workstations out there. The app needs Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Server 2003, Server 2008, Vista, XP or Windows 2000 and all users need administrator privileges for the computers included in the scan. Overall, Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer is a handy software solution, especially because it helps make your computer a bit safer. It's easy to use, it can work both locally and remotely and allows you to print and copy the reports.

While HTC’s Vive and Oculus’ Rift use their own custom software, Microsoft is attempting to create its own VR platform with Windows Holographic, the same environment that powers the company’s HoloLens headset. The software giant revealed that VR headsets for Windows 10 will start at $299, and now it’s starting to detail the PC specs required to power those VR experiences.\n\nIn the latest test builds of Windows 10, Microsoft is now including a \"Windows Holographic First Run\" application that tests a machine to ensure it’s compatible.

      "text": "Microsoft has made available the download link for its November 17, 2016, cumulative firmware and driver update package developed for its Surface Book device, which improves the unit’s system stability through new NVIDIA GeForce GPU (21.21.13.6961) driver. In addition to that, the present update package also installs the 90.1380.768.0 Surface UEFI version that improves stability one more, as well as a new Intel Precise Touch Device driver, namely version 1.2.0.70, which reduces false touch events when the device is closed. When it comes to applying this release, the task can be performed either automatically through Microsoft’s Windows Update service or manually by downloading and installing the update packages. However, take into account that via the Windows Update service, every update is provided to customers in stages, which means that you might not receive it right now. Still, all Surface devices will get this update at some point. On the other hand, if you ...",

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Stars at the American Music Awards are still thinking about the \"Hamilton\" cast's statement to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, for which President-elect Donald Trump is demanding an apology. \nBroadway star Idina Menzel said the theater is the perfect place to provoke thought, as the \"Hamilton\" cast did when they told Pence after a recent show that they hoped it would inspire him to work for all Americans. \n\"It's the right place and it's beautiful and that's what theater's all about: It's about being thought-provoking,\" Menzel said Sunday on her way into the American Music Awards, where she was set to take the stage as a presenter. \"And it's just unfortunate that someone who's going to be our president doesn't embrace that as a freedom of speech and the arts, and sort of celebrate that moment... I'm really proud of all my friends in Hamilton and I thought it took a lot of courage.\" \nFrom the stage, she declared, \"I love you 'Hamilton!'\" \nProducer Diplo echoed her support for free speech. \n\"People can say whatever they want. That's what's great about America,\" he said. \"That's awesome those guys took a second to speak, and they made a story about it, so that's even better. It breeds awareness.\" \nActress Keke Palmer said the presidential nominees ushered in \"a new age\" with their disrespectful tone during the campaign. \n\"People should have a certain amount of respect for the government and the president and the vice president, but the president and the vice president and all those people should have a certain amount of respect for the people that they're catering to,\" she said. \"You can't create a disrespectful atmosphere and then not expect the people to disrespect you back.\" [ The Daily Progress news app keeps you up-to-date. Click here to get the free iOS or Android app. ] \nDonnie Wahlberg, who came to the AMAs with wife Jenny McCarthy, said he thought the \"Hamilton\" cast remarks were \"more appropriate than many other ways people have been speaking out.\" \n\"They were respectful! I thought they were very respectful,\" Wahlberg said. \"Maybe something like that's never happened before, but I think the proper response was the one Mike Pence gave, which is, 'We hear you.' \" \nThe American Music Awards are being broadcast live on ABC.

      "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS\nSting performs a medley at the American Music Awards at the Microsoft Theater on Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016, in Los Angeles.\nASSOCIATED PRESS\nNicki Minaj, left, and DJ Khaled perform “Do You Mind” at the American Music Awards at the Microsoft Theater on Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016, in Los Angeles.\nComing on the heels of a divisive political election, the American Music Awards on Sunday night in Los Angeles became a platform for strong, and sometimes foul, political language. Here’s a look at some of the top moments from the American Music Awards show:\nNOT TRUMP’S NIGHT \nLess than two weeks after the presidential election, President-Elect Donald Trump was bound to be hot and divisive topic at the show. And the insults and jokes came from all sides, including the hosts, the presenters and the performers. Co-hosts Gigi Hadid and Jay Pharoah started off the show with not-so-great impressions of Melania and Donald Trump.\nSinger Idina Menzel and businessman Mark Cuban commiserated about not getting invited to the presidential inauguration, as both were supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. And Menzel gave a shout out to the cast of the Broadway show “Hamilton” who have been criticized by Trump on Twitter.\nAnd Rock And Roll Hall of Famers Green Day blasted Trump during their performance of “Bang Bang” when lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong sang a new chorus in the middle, “No KKK, no fascist USA, No Trump.”\nDRAKE WINS BIG \nDrake doesn’t always show up to award shows even when he’s likely to win, but since he set a record with 13 nominations, he must have felt obliged.\nIn fact, he did win four awards, including favorite rap/hip hop artist and favorite rap/hip hop album for his hugely successful “Views” record, which has dominated radio with singles like “Hotling Bling” and “One Dance.”\nHe thanked his hometown, Toronto, and his family and collaborators, and said he was just focused on the music.\n“For our genre, I just like to keep things exciting and keep making music, shout out to everybody that’s trying to do the same\nthing,” he said.\nAlthough he didn’t perform, Drake debuted a funny Apple Music commercial in which he lip-synced to Taylor Swift while working out, an homage to another Apple commercial starring Swift.\nHe hinted at new music to come, but also seemed to reference some of the criticism he’s received from other rappers for his success, adding quickly, “so watch how you speak on my name.”\nDROPPING THE F BOMBS \nThe censors were on their toes with several unscripted moments in which curse words were flying profusely.\nMost award shows have to bleep out or mute some lyrics or accidental slips of the tongue, but this year’s show seemed to be full of foul language, mostly on purpose.\nChrissy Teigen unleashed a mouthful of colorful language about the election that most people didn’t hear on the broadcast as she was introducing her husband, singer John Legend.\nElectronic duo The Chainsmokers also let a couple of curse words slip when they were caught unprepared for winning the favorite electronic dance music award.\nFormer One Direction singer Zayn gave a big thank you to his “(expletive-deleted) fans” for winning new artist of the year.\nAnd artist of the year Ariana Grande was twice muted for language on the broadcast during her acceptance speech.\nMaybe next year the show should consider moving to cable.\nPURPLE REIGN \nThe death of Prince earlier this year continues to have an impact on today’s music and fans showed their appreciation again by voting for “Purple Rain,” as the favorite soundtrack, more than 30 years after it was released.\nHis sister, Tyka Nelson, who noted that her brother had the courage to be different, accepted the award on his behalf.\n“Prince defied the odds, a black teen from Minneapolis with the goal to electrify the world,” Nelson said.\nBut she said being known as a great songwriting was the most important to him.\n“He wanted to be the world’s most prolific songwriter, and with 984 titles to his credit and counting, he has done just that,” Nelson said.\nNelson began to tear up as she talked about her family and said she would keep the award at Paisley Park, the late singer’s estate, and raised it in the air.\n“Until we see you again, this is for you,” Nelson said.\nSELENA SPEAKS OUT \nSelena Gomez also wasn’t expected to be in attendance at the Microsoft Theater as she had been taking time off touring to treat depression and anxiety.\nStill one of the most followed celebrities on Instagram, earlier this year she stopped posting her to social media accounts. She took to the stage after winning favorite female artist – pop/rock to talk about dealing with an overexposed life.\n“I think it’s safe to say that most of you know a lot of my life whether I liked it or not, and I had to stop, ‘cause I had everything, and I was absolutely broken inside,” said 24-year-old Gomez.\n“I don’t want to see your bodies on Instagram. I want to see what’s in here,” she added, pointing to her heart.\nEven Lady Gaga appeared overjoyed for Gomez’s honesty, with a big smile and her hands pressed together.\n“I am not trying to get validation, nor do I need it anymore,” Gomez announced to a round of applause from the crowd.",

      "text": "​Microsoft announced at its late October event that it’s working to bring Windows 10 in the VR world with Windows Holographic, a new platform that’s supposed to let devices such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and other headsets enjoy the power of the new operating system. Redmond said from the very beginning that the target was to make these headsets available for as much as $299, which is quite a small price to pay for what you get with Windows 10 in VR, but the main concern for the majority of users was the processing power that a computer would need to run the platform. Fortunately, it turns out that Microsoft has paid particular attention to this side of Windows Holographic, and technical requirements that were published today do nothing than to confirm this. For example, what you need is a computer with a quad-core processor, 4 GB RAM, and a USB 3.0 port, but also a graphics card that supports DirectX 12. If your system has more t...",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 11 minutes ago with 2 comments \nIn August, Microsoft announced plans to bring its Windows Holographic shell to 'mainstream PCs' as part of its next major update to Windows 10 - and we now have our first indication of the kind of specs that will be required to power those experiences. \nWhile Microsoft already offers its own $3,000 HoloLens headset , the company said last month that it is working with some hardware partners to launch more affordable virtual reality headsets for Windows 10, priced as low as $299 . It added that these budget-friendly VR headsets will offer different experiences based on their price and specs , as well as the specs of the PCs to which they'll be tethered. \nWith its rollout of Windows 10 Insider Preview build 14971 last week, Microsoft said that it had included the Windows Holographic First Run app as part of that release - and as Thurrott.com reports, that app has revealed a basic set of minimum PC specs that will be required to power the Windows Holographic VR experience: 4GB of RAM A graphics card that supports DirectX 12 Quad-core CPU Image via Thurrott.com \nThe app recommends a system with USB 3.0 support too, although that doesn't appear to be a mandatory requirement; the app simply warns that \"you may experience issues\" if your PC doesn't have a USB 3.0 port. \nThe First Run process also advises on 'preparing your room' to be able to safely use the VR headset. Unlike HoloLens , the low-cost Windows Holographic headsets on the way will be opaque, with no view of the 'real' world when in use, as well as being tethered to a Windows 10 PC by wire. \n\"Make sure you are in a safe place with no tripping hazards,\" the app advises. \"Move obstacles and furniture so you have lots of room to move around while using your headset.\" As WalkingCat (@h0x0d) pointed out on Twitter, the app recommends that you have an area of at least 1.5 x 2 meters in which to move round. \nThe full Windows Holographic shell will be released as part of the Windows 10 Creators Update, which will roll out early next year . But we should find out a lot more about Microsoft's virtual reality platform, and the affordable new headsets on the way from its partners, at an event next month .",

It started out with school kids posing like mannequins, and has now evolved to the point where NFL teams, artists, celebrities, and even Presidential candidates are all posing perfectly still for the camera.\n\nLike any good meme, it's only a matter of time until brands and corporations finally discover it and start to produce their own versions. Microsoft is one of the first major brands to officially get involved in the Mannequin Challenge, but the software maker is providing its own unique twist.

      "text": "Microsoft has pledged to improve browsing security with Edge and Internet Explorer, and part of this plan is giving up on the SHA-1 hash algorithm, which has been around for so long and is no longer secure. The Redmond-based software giant has already announced earlier this year that it plans to abandon this has algorithm and in a blog post recently, the company reveals that site admins have until February 14, 2017 to update their websites. Otherwise, both Edge and IE11 will no longer load them and instead display a notification informing of an invalid certificate. Users will also be allowed to ignore the warning and continue to the website, but the company clearly states that this is not a recommended option. “This will only impact SHA-1 certificates that chain to a Microsoft Trusted Root CA.

      "text": "Share This Tweet This \nUS tech giant Microsoft has declared that it will end its sales for both its Windows 7 and 8 operating systems. New PCs will no longer feature both operating systems. \nNow, OEMs stand as the last official way to get copies of both Windows 7 and 8.1, because Microsoft already stopped making them available for retail. Consequently, all Windows PCs will come with Windows 10 and consumer may no longer have the privilege to downgrade their PCs' operating systems. \nAccording to Forbes , Microsoft's move to proceed with end-of-sales for both Windows 7 and 8.1 will greatly boost and benefit the market for Windows 10. Market growth for the new operating system will head to a stagnant pace, as Christmas sales would eventually speed it up. Advertisement \nThe end of Windows 7 and 8.1 will cause massive changes both for Microsoft and its millions of users worldwide. This move will make Windows 10 a long-term choice for consumer and OEMs that sell laptops and PCs with pre-loaded Windows. \nAs reported by GIZBOT , while Microsoft has bid its final goodbye to the ever-popular Windows 7 and its successor Windows 8.1, it will remain the most popular operating system on the planet. Consumers need to act fast if they want to get copies of both operating systems, as stocks for OEMs are currently limited and may not last any longer. \nYet, those who are using Windows 7 and 8.1 need not to worry because Microsoft will continue supporting both operating systems until January 2020 and January 2023, respectively. \nEnterprise customers with customer support agreements with Microsoft are willing to pay steep prices for premium support agreements, and are thus allowed to receive customer updates after official support ends.

      "text": "Get Office App Becomes Your Office 365 Hub on Windows 10 \n\nLast week Microsoft released the first beta of the new Get Office app that is now the Office Hub . \nWhile this Office Hub brings your Office 365 related content, recently created files, and other account information into one spot for improved functionality/productivity - this weekends release of a Windows Defender Hub app for Windows 10 introduces an information hub. \nThe app contains information, in other words official blog posts, released by the Windows Defender team to help you learn more about the default anti-virus/malware solution for Windows 10 but it also contains a simple tip of the day. \nThere is a shortcut to open up Windows Defender itself at the top of the screen plus any content from the app can be pushed out to your favorite communications channels through the Windows 10 sharing system. \nThe Windows Defender team also provides a tip of the day within the app window to help increase your security awareness. \nWhile I like the concept behind this app to float information about Windows Defender up into your awareness, it does not appear that the app takes advantage of the notification system or the Action Center to let you know when new information is available. \nWithout any type of notification that means you must open the app on a regular basis to see if there is new information. While you may create a new habit to do this it would make much more sense to get alerts in Action Center when new information is available about Windows Defender. Of course, an option to control those alerts would also need to be available for those users who prefer a quieter alert system. \nAccording to the Windows Store listing, this app is available to all versions of Windows 10.",

The first new feature mentioned in the official changelog is the ability to “view images in page” outside of OneNote application . OneNote users will be able to achieve that by tapping on image and select “open” context menu.One other new feature included in the update, as the title says, will allow users to add alternative text on images and embedded files in Page. Only a few bug fixes have been delivered in the latest version of OneNote. One that should address an issue with the crashes that affected the previous OneNote build . Also, the update should fix some miscellaneous issues reported on the previous version of the application.The update doesn't seem to have been pushed to Google Play store in all countries yet. We believe this is a staged rollout, so if you don't notice these changes in your OneNote app, you should check back later for the update. OneNote for Android",

Artopolescu and Florica declined comment.\nProsecutors said from 2004-2008 the three signed contracts with the government to use Microsoft licenses. The government allegedly paid much more than appeared in the contracts.\nA former minister, a former mayor and two businessmen were handed prison sentences in the same case last month.\n ",
