      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters   6:50   \nLONDON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Citi has joined JPMorgan at the top of global regulators' list of systemically important banks, replacing HSBC and meaning the US bank will have to hold extra capital from 2019 to help preserve financial stability. \nThe group of 20 economies (G20) agreed after the 2007-09 financial crisis that top banks, whose size and complexity mean a collapse could wreak havoc in markets, should hold extra capital, according to the level of risk they present. \nMembers of the list of 30 lenders will also have to begin holding bonds from 2019 that can be written down to help replenish capital that is burnt through in a crisis. \nIn the annual update of rankings published on Monday by the G20's Financial Stability Board (FSB), Citi has replaced HSBC in the top \"bucket\" facing a 2.5% capital surcharge on top of global minimum requirements. \nNo lender joined or dropped out of the top 30 list this year. \nLenders on the list typically already meet or exceed the amount of capital they must hold due to pressure from regulators and markets to dispel any doubts about their resilience. \nHSBC joins BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank in the next category down, with a surcharge of 2%. Bank of America rose a category to join them. \nBarclays dropped a category to the 1.5% surcharge group. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Wells Fargo rose a category to join the UK bank. \nMorgan Stanley fell a category to the 1% surcharge group. \nThe FSB is also due to agree a higher leverage ratio for the 30 lenders. \nThe ratio, a broad measure of capital to non-risk-weighted assets, has been set at a minimum of 3 percent for all other banks across the world. \nThe FSB has yet to decide if the 30 should be subject to the same leverage ratio \"surcharge\" or whether it too should adopt a \"bucket\" approach. \nThe watchdog also updated its list of nine globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year. \nInsurers still on the list in 2017 will be required to comply with tougher \"loss absorbency\" requirements from January 2019. \nThe list comprises Aegon, Allianz, AIG, Aviva, Axa, MetLife, Ping An, Prudential Financial, and Prudential. \nThe FSB's latest list makes no mention of reinsurers, a category still being considered for inclusion. \nGlobal insurance regulators have said they may take into account the activities of insurers when they decide if they are globally systemic, rather than just focusing on size and global reach. \nMetLife, the biggest US life insurer, has also been designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of the heads of US financial regulators. \nThe company is fighting the US designation in the country's courts.

Bank of America rose a category to join them. \nBarclays dropped a category to the 1.5 percent surcharge group. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Wells Fargo rose a category to join the UK bank. \nMorgan Stanley fell a category to the 1 percent surcharge group. \nThe FSB is also due to agree a higher leverage ratio for the 30 lenders. \nThe ratio, a broad measure of capital to non-risk-weighted assets, has been set at a minimum of 3 percent for all other banks across the world. \nThe FSB has yet to decide if the 30 should be subject to the same leverage ratio \"surcharge\" or whether it too should adopt a \"bucket\" approach. \nThe watchdog also updated its list of nine globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year. \nInsurers still on the list in 2017 will be required to comply with tougher \"loss absorbency\" requirements from January 2019. \nThe list comprises Aegon, Allianz, AIG, Aviva, Axa, MetLife, Ping An, Prudential Financial, and Prudential. \nThe FSB's latest list makes no mention of reinsurers, a category still being considered for inclusion. \nGlobal insurance regulators have said they may take into account the activities of insurers when they decide if they are globally systemic, rather than just focusing on size and global reach. \nMetLife, the biggest U.S. life insurer, has also been designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of the heads of U.S. financial regulators. \nThe company is fighting the U.S. designation in the country's courts.

      "text": "Citi Announces $1.75 Billion Increase to Planned Capital Actions November 21, 2016 07:45   \nNEW YORK- Citigroup Inc. today announced that it will increase its common stock repurchase program by up to $1.75 billion. This amount is in addition to the $10.4 billion in planned capital actions announced earlier this year, which include an increase of Citi's quarterly common stock dividend to $0.16 per share and a common stock repurchase program of up to $8.6 billion. Combined with the repurchase announced today, Citi’s total planned capital actions will increase to $12.2 billion. The additional buybacks will allow Citi to further reduce the amount of its outstanding common shares. In the past two years, Citi has lowered the amount of outstanding common shares by 180 million or 6%. \nCiti’s Board of Directors has authorized the increase and Citi has received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve Board regarding this addition to the planned capital actions requested as part of the 2016 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). \nMichael Corbat, Citi's Chief Executive Officer, said, “We continue to make strong progress on the factors that will allow us to deliver the returns our shareholders expect and deserve -- generating consistent earnings, investing in businesses well positioned to drive growth and continuing to strengthen our capital planning process. We believe this solid foundation will enable us to deliver more of the capital we generate from earnings, DTA utilization and divestments back to our shareholders, while also positioning our firm for long-term success.” \nRepurchases by Citi under the common stock repurchase program may be effected from time to time through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules or other means, depending on satisfactory market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The common stock repurchase program does not obligate Citi to repurchase any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended at any time at Citi's discretion. \nAbout Citi \nCiti, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management. \nAdditional information may be found at www.citigroup.com | Twitter: @Citi | YouTube: www.youtube.com/citi | Blog: http://blog.citigroup.com | Facebook: www.facebook.com/citi | LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/citi Contacts",

      "text": "November 21, 2016 at 07:45 AM EST Citi Announces $1.75 Billion Increase to Planned Capital Actions Citigroup Inc. today announced that it will increase its common stock repurchase program by up to $1.75 billion. This amount is in addition to the $10.4 billion in planned capital actions announced earlier this year, which include an increase of Citi's quarterly common stock dividend to $0.16 per share and a common stock repurchase program of up to $8.6 billion. Combined with the repurchase announced today, Citi’s total planned capital actions will increase to $12.2 billion. The additional buybacks will allow Citi to further reduce the amount of its outstanding common shares. In the past two years, Citi has lowered the amount of outstanding common shares by 180 million or 6%. \nCitigroup Inc. today announced that it will increase its common stock repurchase program by up to $1.75 billion. This amount is in addition to the $10.4 billion in planned capital actions announced earlier this year, which include an increase of Citi's quarterly common stock dividend to $0.16 per share and a common stock repurchase program of up to $8.6 billion. Combined with the repurchase announced today, Citi’s total planned capital actions will increase to $12.2 billion. The additional buybacks will allow Citi to further reduce the amount of its outstanding common shares. In the past two years, Citi has lowered the amount of outstanding common shares by 180 million or 6%. \nCiti’s Board of Directors has authorized the increase and Citi has received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve Board regarding this addition to the planned capital actions requested as part of the 2016 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). \nMichael Corbat, Citi's Chief Executive Officer, said, “We continue to make strong progress on the factors that will allow us to deliver the returns our shareholders expect and deserve -- generating consistent earnings, investing in businesses well positioned to drive growth and continuing to strengthen our capital planning process. We believe this solid foundation will enable us to deliver more of the capital we generate from earnings, DTA utilization and divestments back to our shareholders, while also positioning our firm for long-term success.” \nRepurchases by Citi under the common stock repurchase program may be effected from time to time through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules or other means, depending on satisfactory market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The common stock repurchase program does not obligate Citi to repurchase any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended at any time at Citi's discretion. \nAbout Citi \nCiti, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management. \nAdditional information may be found at www.citigroup.com | Twitter: @Citi | YouTube: www.youtube.com/citi | Blog: http://blog.citigroup.com | Facebook: www.facebook.com/citi | LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/citi View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161121005525/en/ Contacts:",

      "text": "Citi becomes first U.S. bank supervised by ECB since Brexit vote Reuters Photo: \nBy Francesco Canepa \nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - The U.S. bank Citi <C.N> on Monday became the first global lender to come under European Central Bank supervision since Britain's vote to leave the European Union - an option several UK-based companies are exploring to keep their access to the single market. \nBanks are looking for ways to ensure they can easily sell their services into the EU, a market of 450 million people, after Britain leaves. One option is to shift enough assets to a euro zone country to qualify for ECB supervision. \nCiti's Irish unit, Citibank Holdings Ireland, was added to a list of large banks directly supervised by the ECB on Monday, after it expanded its balance sheet through last year's merger with UK-based Citibank International. \nThe merger predates the June 23 Brexit referendum, but Citi's move will still be closely watched by competitors weighing a move to the euro zone. \nGoldman Sachs <GS.N> is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt and ECB board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said last week several banks are talking to the central bank about similar moves. \nCiti itself has said it might have to re-allocate certain businesses to the EU, but it would not \"hot foot\" it out of Britain. \nThe Irish subsidiary houses Citi's retail banking operation in Europe and has around 46 billion euros ($48.93 billion) in assets. But it could not accommodate Citi's brokerage or trading businesses. \nUnder U.S. regulation, those must be housed in entities separate from deposit-taking operations. Consequently, Citi's brokerage and trading are a separate operation, based in London. \n\"This is an important milestone for Citi in Europe and we look forward to a strong engagement with the (ECB),\" Citi said in a statement after passing an ECB health check earlier this month. \nMEDIOLANUM \nEuro zone banks with assets of less than 30 billion euros are generally supervised by national authorities, unless they meet other criteria, such as being one of the three largest lenders in their country. \nThe total number of \"significant\" banks directly supervised by the ECB fell to 127 from 129 after a merger and two restructurings. \nItaly's Banca Mediolanum <BMED.MI>, which had also passed the ECB health check along with Slovenia's Abanka, was not added to the list because its assets have since fallen, chief risk officer Massimo Rella told Reuters. \nThe ECB, which has the power to reject the acquisition of holdings in any bank in the euro area, has opposed former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlsuconi's owning a significant stake in Mediolanum through his Fininvest holding company. \n($1 = 0.9401 euros) \n(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies and Rachel Armstrong in London, and Maria Pia Quaglia in Milan, editing by Larry King) Related Links",

One option is to shift enough assets to a euro zone country to qualify for ECB supervision. \nCiti's Irish unit, Citibank Holdings Ireland, was added to a list of large banks directly supervised by the ECB on Monday, after it expanded its balance sheet through last year's merger with UK-based Citibank International. \nThe merger predates the June 23 Brexit referendum, but Citi's move will still be closely watched by competitors weighing a move to the euro zone. \nGoldman Sachs ( GS.N ) is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt and ECB board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said last week several banks are talking to the central bank about similar moves. \nCiti itself has said it might have to re-allocate certain businesses to the EU, but it would not \"hot foot\" it out of Britain. \nThe Irish subsidiary houses Citi's retail banking operation in Europe and has around 46 billion euros ($48.93 billion) in assets. But it could not accommodate Citi's brokerage or trading businesses. \nUnder U.S. regulation, those must be housed in entities separate from deposit-taking operations. Consequently, Citi's brokerage and trading are a separate operation, based in London. \n\"This is an important milestone for Citi in Europe and we look forward to a strong engagement with the (ECB),\" Citi said in a statement after passing an ECB health check earlier this month. \nMEDIOLANUM \nEuro zone banks with assets of less than 30 billion euros are generally supervised by national authorities, unless they meet other criteria, such as being one of the three largest lenders in their country. \nThe total number of \"significant\" banks directly supervised by the ECB fell to 127 from 129 after a merger and two restructurings. \nItaly's Banca Mediolanum ( BMED.MI ), which had also passed the ECB health check along with Slovenia's Abanka, was not added to the list because its assets have since fallen, chief risk officer Massimo Rella told Reuters. \nThe ECB, which has the power to reject the acquisition of holdings in any bank in the euro area, has opposed former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlsuconi's owning a significant stake in Mediolanum through his Fininvest holding company. \n($1 = 0.9401 euros) \n(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies and Rachel Armstrong in London, and Maria Pia Quaglia in Milan, editing by Larry King)  ",

      "text": "By Huw Jones\nLONDON (Reuters) - Citi has joined JPMorgan at the top of global regulators' list of systemically important banks, replacing HSBC and meaning the U.S. bank will have to hold extra capital from 2019 to help preserve financial stability.\nThe group of 20 economies (G20) agreed after the 2007-09 financial crisis that top banks, whose size and complexity mean a collapse could wreak havoc in markets, should hold extra capital, according to the level of risk they present.\nMembers of the list of 30 lenders will also have to begin holding bonds from 2019 that can be written down to help replenish capital that is burnt through in a crisis.\nIn the annual update of rankings published on Monday by the G20's Financial Stability Board (FSB), Citi has replaced HSBC in the top \"bucket\" facing a 2.5 percent capital surcharge on top of global minimum requirements.\nNo lender joined or dropped out of the top 30 list this year.\nLenders on the list typically already meet or exceed the amount of capital they must hold due to pressure from regulators and markets to dispel any doubts about their resilience.\nHSBC joins BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank in the next category down, with a surcharge of 2 percent. Bank of America rose a category to join them.\nBarclays dropped a category to the 1.5 percent surcharge group. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Wells Fargo rose a category to join the UK bank.\nMorgan Stanley fell a category to the 1 percent surcharge group.\nThe FSB is also due to agree a higher leverage ratio for the 30 lenders. \nThe ratio, a broad measure of capital to non-risk-weighted assets, has been set at a minimum of 3 percent for all other banks across the world.\nThe FSB has yet to decide if the 30 should be subject to the same leverage ratio \"surcharge\" or whether it too should adopt a \"bucket\" approach.\n\nThe watchdog also updated its list of nine globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year.\nInsurers still on the list in 2017 will be required to comply with tougher \"loss absorbency\" requirements from January 2019.\nThe list comprises Aegon, Allianz, AIG, Aviva, Axa, MetLife, Ping An, Prudential Financial, and Prudential.\nThe FSB's latest list makes no mention of reinsurers, a category still being considered for inclusion.\nGlobal insurance regulators have said they may take into account the activities of insurers when they decide if they are globally systemic, rather than just focusing on size and global reach.\nMetLife, the biggest U.S. life insurer, has also been designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of the heads of U.S. financial regulators.\nThe company is fighting the U.S. designation in the country's courts.\n\n(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Carolyn Cohn and Mark Potter)",

      "text": "A Citibank booth at the Singapore Fintech Festival in Singapore Thomson Reuters\nBy Francesco Canepa\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - The U.S. bank Citi on Monday became the first global lender to come under European Central Bank supervision since Britain's vote to leave the European Union - an option several UK-based companies are exploring to keep their access to the single market.\nBanks are looking for ways to ensure they can easily sell their services into the EU, a market of 450 million people, after Britain leaves. One option is to shift enough assets to a euro zone country to qualify for ECB supervision.\nCiti's Irish unit, Citibank Holdings Ireland, was added to a list of large banks directly supervised by the ECB on Monday, after it expanded its balance sheet through last year's merger with UK-based Citibank International.\nThe merger predates the June 23 Brexit referendum, but Citi's move will still be closely watched by competitors weighing a move to the euro zone.\nGoldman Sachs is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt and ECB board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said last week several banks are talking to the central bank about similar moves.\nCiti itself has said it might have to re-allocate certain businesses to the EU, but it would not \"hot foot\" it out of Britain.\nThe Irish subsidiary houses Citi's retail banking operation in Europe and has around 46 billion euros ($48.93 billion) in assets. But it could not accommodate Citi's brokerage or trading businesses.\nUnder U.S. regulation, those must be housed in entities separate from deposit-taking operations. Consequently, Citi's brokerage and trading are a separate operation, based in London.\n\"This is an important milestone for Citi in Europe and we look forward to a strong engagement with the (ECB),\" Citi said in a statement after passing an ECB health check earlier this month.\nMEDIOLANUM\nEuro zone banks with assets of less than 30 billion euros are generally supervised by national authorities, unless they meet other criteria, such as being one of the three largest lenders in their country.\nThe total number of \"significant\" banks directly supervised by the ECB fell to 127 from 129 after a merger and two restructurings.\nItaly's Banca Mediolanum , which had also passed the ECB health check along with Slovenia's Abanka, was not added to the list because its assets have since fallen, chief risk officer Massimo Rella told Reuters.\nThe ECB, which has the power to reject the acquisition of holdings in any bank in the euro area, has opposed former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlsuconi's owning a significant stake in Mediolanum through his Fininvest holding company.\n($1 = 0.9401 euros)\n(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies and Rachel Armstrong in London, and Maria Pia Quaglia in Milan, editing by Larry King)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "Home | International Business | Citi And JPMorgan Top List Of Globally Systemic Banks Members of the list of 30 lenders will also have to begin holding bonds from 2019 that can be written down to help replenish capital that is burnt through in a crisis. Thomson Reuters | Last Updated: November 21, 2016 20:03 (IST) Thomson Reuters EMAIL COMMENTS London : Citi has joined JPMorgan at the top of global regulators' list of systemically important banks, replacing HSBC and meaning the US bank will have to hold extra capital from 2019 to help preserve financial stability.The group of 20 economies (G20) agreed after the 2007-09 financial crisis that top banks, whose size and complexity mean a collapse could wreak havoc in markets, should hold extra capital, according to the level of risk they present.Members of the list of 30 lenders will also have to begin holding bonds from 2019 that can be written down to help replenish capital that is burnt through in a crisis. In the annual update of rankings published on Monday by the G20's Financial Stability Board (FSB), Citi has replaced HSBC in the top \"bucket\" facing a 2.5 per cent capital surcharge on top of global minimum requirements.No lender joined or dropped out of the top 30 list this year.Lenders on the list typically already meet or exceed the amount of capital they must hold due to pressure from regulators and markets to dispel any doubts about their resilience.HSBC joins BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank in the next category down, with a surcharge of 2 per cent. Bank of America rose a category to join them.Barclays dropped a category to the 1.5 per cent surcharge group. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Wells Fargo rose a category to join the UK bank.Morgan Stanley fell a category to the 1 per cent surcharge group.The FSB is also due to agree a higher leverage ratio for the 30 lenders.The ratio, a broad measure of capital to non-risk-weighted assets, has been set at a minimum of 3 per cent for all other banks across the world.The FSB has yet to decide if the 30 should be subject to the same leverage ratio \"surcharge\" or whether it too should adopt a \"bucket\" approach.The watchdog also updated its list of nine globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year.Insurers still on the list in 2017 will be required to comply with tougher \"loss absorbency\" requirements from January 2019.The list comprises Aegon, Allianz, AIG, Aviva, Axa, MetLife, Ping An, Prudential Financial, and Prudential.The FSB's latest list makes no mention of reinsurers, a category still being considered for inclusion.Global insurance regulators have said they may take into account the activities of insurers when they decide if they are globally systemic, rather than just focusing on size and global reach.MetLife, the biggest US life insurer, has also been designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of the heads of US financial regulators.The company is fighting the US designation in the country's courts. © Thomson Reuters 2016 Story first published on : November 21, 2016 20:03 (IST) Related",

S.bank will have to hold extra capital from 2019 to help preserve financial stability.\nThe group of 20 economies (G20) agreed after the 2007-09 financial crisis that top banks, whose size and complexity mean a collapse could wreak havoc in markets, should hold extra capital, according to the level of risk they present.\nMembers of the list of 30 lenders will also have to begin holding bonds from 2019 that can be written down to help replenish capital that is burnt through in a crisis.\nIn the annual update of rankings published on Monday by the G20’s Financial Stability Board (FSB), Citi has replaced HSBC in the top “bucket” facing a 2.5 per cent capital surcharge on top of global minimum requirements.\nNo lender joined or dropped out of the top 30 list this year. \nLenders on the list typically already meet or exceed the amount of capital they must hold due to pressure from regulators and markets to dispel any doubts about their resilience.\nHSBC joins BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank in the next category down, with a surcharge of 2 per cent. Bank of America rose a category to join them.\nBarclays dropped a category to the 1.5 per cent surcharge group. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Wells Fargo rose a category to join the UK bank.\nMorgan Stanley fell a category to the 1 per cent surcharge group.\nThe FSB is also due to agree a higher leverage ratio for the 30 lenders.\nThe ratio, a broad measure of capital to non-risk-weighted assets, has been set at a minimum of 3 per cent for all other banks across the world.\nThe FSB has yet to decide if the 30 should be subject to the same leverage ratio “surcharge” or whether it too should adopt a “bucket” approach.\nThe watchdog also updated its list of nine globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year.\nInsurers still on the list in 2017 will be required to comply with tougher “loss absorbency” requirements from January 2019.\nThe list comprises Aegon, Allianz, AIG, Aviva, Axa, MetLife, Ping An, Prudential Financial, and Prudential.\nThe FSB’s latest list makes no mention of reinsurers, a category still being considered for inclusion.\nGlobal insurance regulators have said they may take into account the activities of insurers when they decide if they are globally systemic, rather than just focusing on size and global reach.\nMetLife, the biggest US life insurer, has also been designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of the heads of US financial regulators.\nThe company is fighting the US designation in the country’s courts.\n— Reuters",

      "text": "Banking Citi and JP Morgan top regulators' list of banks posing systemic risk \nHSBC and Barclays move down Financial Stability Board’s rankings, meaning they are required to hold less capital The offices of Barclays Bank, Citi and HSBC in London’s Canary Wharf. Photograph: Frank Baron for the Guardian Monday 21 November 2016 18.44 GMT Last modified on Monday 21 November 2016 18.46 GMT View more sharing options Share on Messenger Close \nTwo US banks – Citi and JP Morgan – have been designated as potentially posing the greatest risks to the global financial system in an annual ranking by regulators. \nCiti has replaced HSBC and joined JP Morgan in the highest ranking issued by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international alliance of central bankers, policy makers and regulators that sorts 30 major banks into five categories. \nThe more systemically important the bank, the more capital it must hold to absorb losses during time of crisis. No bank has ever been placed in the highest, fifth category – which adds 3.5 percentage points to a bank’s capital requirement – since the FSB rankings were introduced five years. Citi and JP Morgan are in the fourth category. The Big Short: is the next financial crisis on its way? Read more \nHSBC , Britain’s biggest bank, has been moved out of the fourth category for the first time to the third, reducing the top up to its capital by half a percentage point to 2%. Barclays has also had its status cut by one category, from the third to the less risky second bracket. \nCiti is among three US banks which have been pushed up the rankings: the other two are Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The rising importance of Chinese banks is also illustrated as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has moved up one ranking. \nTomas Kinmonth, a fixed income strategist at ABN Amro, said the changes reflected the revised business models of some of the banks. “The European and UK banks are both retrenching and are trying to return to their core businesses. Thus the lowering of Barclays within the ranking comes partly as the bank moves to focus just on the American and European markets,” said Kinmonth. \n“Counterintuitively, a decrease in the systematic importance of the banks can actually be a positive for the institution. The bank can be expected to have less equity set aside, and can in theory allow them to return more proceeds to existing shareholders,” he said. \nHSBC has also been scaling back its global presence – it recently sold its operations in Brazil – and also reducing its exposure to risky loans. \nDeutsche Bank , which was described by the International Monetary Fund as the world’s riskiest bank, remained in the third category – where HSBC, Bank of America and French bank BNP Paribas also reside – requiring it to top up its capital by two percentage points. Deutsche was in the fourth category in 2012. \nThe FSB is chaired by Bank of England governor Mark Carney. Its role is to act a body coordinating policy towards the financial services sector around the world and monitor and assess vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system. \nIt is playing a key role in trying to end the “too big too fail” problem that was highlighted by the 2008 banking crisis. Assessing the so-called globally systemic banks – known as “G-Sibs” – is part of its role. \nThe banks are unlikely to need to raise more capital as many of them ready hold enough to appease regulatory demands. A list of the globally systemic insurers was also published, which includes Prudential and Aviva. ",

      "text": "FRANKFURT: The US bank Citi on Monday became the first global lender to come under European Central Bank supervision since Britain’s vote to leave the European Union - an option several UK-based companies are exploring to keep their access to the single market.\nBanks are looking for ways to ensure they can easily sell their services into the EU, a market of 450 million people, after Britain leaves. One option is to shift enough assets to a euro zone country to qualify for ECB supervision.\nCiti’s Irish unit, Citibank Holdings Ireland, was added to a list of large banks directly supervised by the ECB on Monday, after it expanded its balance sheet through last year’s merger with UK-based Citibank International.\nThe merger predates the June 23 Brexit referendum, but Citi’s move will still be closely watched by competitors weighing a move to the euro zone.\nGoldman Sachs is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt and ECB board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said last week several banks are talking to the central bank about similar moves.\nCiti itself has said it might have to re-allocate certain businesses to the EU, but it would not “hot foot” it out of Britain.\nThe Irish subsidiary houses Citi’s retail banking operation in Europe and has around 46 billion euros ($48.93 billion) in assets. But it could not accommodate Citi’s brokerage or trading businesses.\nUnder US regulation, those must be housed in entities separate from deposit-taking operations. Consequently, Citi’s brokerage and trading are a separate operation, based in London.\n“This is an important milestone for Citi in Europe and we look forward to a strong engagement with the (ECB),” Citi said in a statement after passing an ECB health check earlier this month.\nEurozone banks with assets of less than 30 billion euros are generally supervised by national authorities, unless they meet other criteria, such as being one of the three largest lenders in their country.\nThe total number of “significant” banks directly supervised by the ECB fell to 127 from 129 after a merger and two restructurings.\nItaly’s Banca Mediolanum, which had also passed the ECB health check along with Slovenia’s Abanka, was not added to the list because its assets have since fallen, chief risk officer Massimo Rella told Reuters.\nThe ECB, which has the power to reject the acquisition of holdings in any bank in the euro area, has opposed former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlsuconi’s owning a significant stake in Mediolanum through his Fininvest holding company.",

      "text": "Copy \nCiti leads US banks higher in systemic risk \nLONDON • Global banking regulators said some American lenders present a bigger risk to the financial system than last year and should face stiffer capital requirements to ward off threats. \nCitigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo all face higher capital surcharges after they rose in the Financial Stability Board's (FSB's) latest ranking of the most systemically important banks in the world. \nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley and British lenders HSBC Holdings and Barclays saw their buffer levels fall, the FSB said in a statement yesterday. The new capital buffers apply, starting in 2018. \nHSBC's capital surcharge falls to 2 per cent of risk-weighted assets from 2.5 per cent, while Citigroup's buffers rise to 2.5 per cent from 2 per cent, the FSB said. \nBLOOMBERG \nRio Tinto to cut iron ore jobs in Australia \nSYDNEY • Miner Rio Tinto is preparing to cut hundreds of jobs at its Australian iron ore business, following a restructuring of the global giant's most profitable sector, the company said yesterday. \nA Rio Tinto spokesman declined to say how many jobs would go, although local media reported up to 500 management and support positions were on the line. \n\"There will be cuts,\" a Rio spokesman said, adding that the move was part of a wider review to streamline the company as it braces itself for continued volatility in minerals commodities markets. \nThe company currently employs about 11,000 workers after shedding about 700 people early this year and about 800 early last year. \nREUTERS \nCredit Suisse's Swiss unit kicks off \nGENEVA • Credit Suisse Group's Swiss unit began life as a legally independent company, enabling the bank to pursue plans to sell part of the business in a public offering next year. \nIn carving out a separate entity, Credit Suisse also fulfils a regulatory requirement to make banks easier to break up in a crisis, the bank said yesterday. \nCredit Suisse (Schweiz) has its own licence, allowing it to function if its parent has to file for bankruptcy. \nBLOOMBERG   'Money Briefs'.

      "text": "Reuters | November 21, 2016 Banks are looking for ways to ensure they can easily sell their services into the EU, a market of 450 million people, after Britain leaves. \nFRANKFURT : The US bank Citi on Monday became the first global lender to come under European Central Bank supervision since Britain’s vote to leave the European Union – an option several UK-based companies are exploring to keep their access to the single market. \nBanks are looking for ways to ensure they can easily sell their services into the EU, a market of 450 million people, after Britain leaves. One option is to shift enough assets to a euro zone country to qualify for ECB supervision. \nCiti’s Irish unit, Citibank Holdings Ireland, was added to a list of large banks directly supervised by the ECB on Monday, after it expanded its balance sheet through last year’s merger with UK-based Citibank International. \nThe merger predates the June 23 Brexit referendum, but Citi’s move will still be closely watched by competitors weighing a move to the euro zone. \nGoldman Sachs is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt and ECB board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said last week several banks are talking to the central bank about similar moves. \nCiti itself has said it might have to re-allocate certain businesses to the EU, but it would not “hot foot” it out of Britain. \nThe Irish subsidiary houses Citi’s retail banking operation in Europe and has around 46 billion euros ($48.93 billion) in assets. But it could not accommodate Citi’s brokerage or trading businesses. \nUnder U.S. regulation, those must be housed in entities separate from deposit-taking operations. Consequently, Citi’s brokerage and trading are a separate operation, based in London. \n“This is an important milestone for Citi in Europe and we look forward to a strong engagement with the (ECB),” Citi said in a statement after passing an ECB health check earlier this month. \nMediolanum \nEuro zone banks with assets of less than 30 billion euros are generally supervised by national authorities, unless they meet other criteria, such as being one of the three largest lenders in their country. \nThe total number of “significant” banks directly supervised by the ECB fell to 127 from 129 after a merger and two restructurings. \nItaly’s Banca Mediolanum, which had also passed the ECB health check along with Slovenia’s Abanka, was not added to the list because its assets have since fallen, chief risk officer Massimo Rella told Reuters. \nThe ECB, which has the power to reject the acquisition of holdings in any bank in the euro area, has opposed former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlsuconi’s owning a significant stake in Mediolanum through his Fininvest holding company.",

      "text": "By Francesco Canepa\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - The U.S. bank Citi <C.N> on Monday became the first global lender to come under European Central Bank supervision since Britain's vote to leave the European Union - an option several UK-based companies are exploring to keep their access to the single market.\nBanks are looking for ways to ensure they can easily sell their services into the EU, a market of 450 million people, after Britain leaves. One option is to shift enough assets to a euro zone country to qualify for ECB supervision.\nCiti's Irish unit, Citibank Holdings Ireland, was added to a list of large banks directly supervised by the ECB on Monday, after it expanded its balance sheet through last year's merger with UK-based Citibank International.\nThe merger predates the June 23 Brexit referendum, but Citi's move will still be closely watched by competitors weighing a move to the euro zone.\nGoldman Sachs <GS.N> is considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt and ECB board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger said last week several banks are talking to the central bank about similar moves.\nCiti itself has said it might have to re-allocate certain businesses to the EU, but it would not \"hot foot\" it out of Britain.\nThe Irish subsidiary houses Citi's retail banking operation in Europe and has around 46 billion euros ($48.93 billion) in assets. But it could not accommodate Citi's brokerage or trading businesses.\nUnder U.S. regulation, those must be housed in entities separate from deposit-taking operations. Consequently, Citi's brokerage and trading are a separate operation, based in London.\n\"This is an important milestone for Citi in Europe and we look forward to a strong engagement with the (ECB),\" Citi said in a statement after passing an ECB health check earlier this month.\nMEDIOLANUM\nEuro zone banks with assets of less than 30 billion euros are generally supervised by national authorities, unless they meet other criteria, such as being one of the three largest lenders in their country.\nThe total number of \"significant\" banks directly supervised by the ECB fell to 127 from 129 after a merger and two restructurings.\nItaly's Banca Mediolanum <BMED.MI>, which had also passed the ECB health check along with Slovenia's Abanka, was not added to the list because its assets have since fallen, chief risk officer Massimo Rella told Reuters.\nThe ECB, which has the power to reject the acquisition of holdings in any bank in the euro area, has opposed former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlsuconi's owning a significant stake in Mediolanum through his Fininvest holding company.\n($1 = 0.9401 euros)\n(Additional reporting by Anjuli Davies and Rachel Armstrong in London, and Maria Pia Quaglia in Milan, editing by Larry King)",

      "text": "Citi and JPMorgan top list of globally systemic banks, replaces HSBC Last Updated: Monday, November 21, 2016 - 20:36 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nLondon: Citi has joined JPMorgan at the top of global regulators` list of systemically important banks, replacing HSBC and meaning the U.S. bank will have to hold extra capital from 2019 to help preserve financial stability. \nThe group of 20 economies (G20) agreed after the 2007-09 financial crisis that top banks, whose size and complexity mean a collapse could wreak havoc in markets, should hold extra capital, according to the level of risk they present. \nMembers of the list of 30 lenders will also have to begin holding bonds from 2019 that can be written down to help replenish capital that is burnt through in a crisis. \nIn the annual update of rankings published on Monday by the G20`s Financial Stability Board (FSB), Citi has replaced HSBC in the top \"bucket\" facing a 2.5 percent capital surcharge on top of global minimum requirements. \nNo lender joined or dropped out of the top 30 list this year. \nLenders on the list typically already meet or exceed the amount of capital they must hold due to pressure from regulators and markets to dispel any doubts about their resilience. \nHSBC joins BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank in the next category down, with a surcharge of 2 percent. Bank of America rose a category to join them. \nBarclays dropped a category to the 1.5 percent surcharge group. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Wells Fargo rose a category to join the UK bank. \nMorgan Stanley fell a category to the 1 percent surcharge group. \nThe FSB is also due to agree a higher leverage ratio for the 30 lenders. \nThe ratio, a broad measure of capital to non-risk-weighted assets, has been set at a minimum of 3 percent for all other banks across the world. \nThe FSB has yet to decide if the 30 should be subject to the same leverage ratio \"surcharge\" or whether it too should adopt a \"bucket\" approach. \nThe watchdog also updated its list of nine globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year. \nInsurers still on the list in 2017 will be required to comply with tougher \"loss absorbency\" requirements from January 2019. \nThe list comprises Aegon, Allianz, AIG, Aviva, Axa, MetLife, Ping An, Prudential Financial, and Prudential. \nThe FSB`s latest list makes no mention of reinsurers, a category still being considered for inclusion. \nGlobal insurance regulators have said they may take into account the activities of insurers when they decide if they are globally systemic, rather than just focusing on size and global reach. \nMetLife, the biggest U.S. life insurer, has also been designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of the heads of U.S. financial regulators. \nThe company is fighting the U.S. designation in the country`s courts.

      "text": "By Huw Jones, Reuters   \nCiti has joined JPMorgan at the top of global regulators' list of systemically important banks, replacing HSBC and meaning the U.S. bank will have to hold extra capital from 2019 to help preserve financial stability. \nThe group of 20 economies (G20) agreed after the 2007-09 financial crisis that top banks, whose size and complexity mean a collapse could wreak havoc in markets, should hold extra capital, according to the level of risk they present. \nMembers of the list of 30 lenders will also have to begin holding bonds from 2019 that can be written down to help replenish capital that is burned through in a crisis. \nIn the annual update of rankings published on Monday by the G20's Financial Stability Board (FSB), Citi has replaced HSBC in the top \"bucket\" facing a 2.5 % capital surcharge on top of global minimum requirements. \nNo lender joined or dropped out of the top 30 list this year. \nLenders on the list typically already meet or exceed the amount of capital they must hold due to pressure from regulators and markets to dispel any doubts about their resilience. \nHSBC joins BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank in the next category down, with a surcharge of 2 %. Bank of America rose a category to join them. \nBarclays dropped a category to the 1.5 % surcharge group. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Wells Fargo rose a category to join the UK bank. \nMorgan Stanley fell a category to the 1 % surcharge group. \nThe FSB is also due to agree a higher leverage ratio for the 30 lenders. \nThe ratio, a broad measure of capital to non-risk-weighted assets, has been set at a minimum of 3 % for all other banks across the world. \nThe FSB has yet to decide if the 30 should be subject to the same leverage ratio \"surcharge\" or whether it too should adopt a \"bucket\" approach. \nThe watchdog also updated its list of nine globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year. \nInsurers still on the list in 2017 will be required to comply with tougher \"loss absorbency\" requirements from January 2019. \nThe list comprises Aegon, Allianz, AIG, Aviva, Axa, MetLife, Ping An, Prudential Financial, and Prudential. \nThe FSB's latest list makes no mention of reinsurers, a category still being considered for inclusion. \nGlobal insurance regulators have said they may take into account the activities of insurers when they decide if they are globally systemic, rather than just focusing on size and global reach. \nMetLife, the biggest U.S. life insurer, has also been designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of the heads of U.S. financial regulators. \nThe company is fighting the U.S. designation in the country's courts.

      "text": "By Huw Jones\nLONDON (Reuters) - Citi has joined JPMorgan at the top of global regulators' list of systemically important banks, replacing HSBC and meaning the U.S. bank will have to hold extra capital from 2019 to help preserve financial stability.\nThe group of 20 economies (G20) agreed after the 2007-09 financial crisis that top banks, whose size and complexity mean a collapse could wreak havoc in markets, should hold extra capital, according to the level of risk they present.\nMembers of the list of 30 lenders will also have to begin holding bonds from 2019 that can be written down to help replenish capital that is burnt through in a crisis.\nIn the annual update of rankings published on Monday by the G20's Financial Stability Board (FSB), Citi has replaced HSBC in the top \"bucket\" facing a 2.5 percent capital surcharge on top of global minimum requirements.\nThe measure announced by the FSB does not have an impact on any of Citi's binding regulatory metrics, the bank said in an e-mailed statement.\nNo lender joined or dropped out of the top 30 list this year.\nLenders on the list typically already meet or exceed the amount of capital they must hold due to pressure from regulators and markets to dispel any doubts about their resilience.\nHSBC joins BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank in the next category down, with a surcharge of 2 percent. Bank of America rose a category to join them.\nBarclays dropped a category to the 1.5 percent surcharge group. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Wells Fargo rose a category to join the UK bank.\nMorgan Stanley fell a category to the 1 percent surcharge group.\nThe FSB is also due to agree a higher leverage ratio for the 30 lenders.\nThe ratio, a broad measure of capital to non-risk-weighted assets, has been set at a minimum of 3 percent for all other banks across the world.\nThe FSB has yet to decide if the 30 should be subject to the same leverage ratio \"surcharge\" or whether it too should adopt a \"bucket\" approach.\nThe watchdog also updated its list of nine globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year.\nInsurers still on the list in 2017 will be required to comply with tougher \"loss absorbency\" requirements from January 2019.\nThe list comprises Aegon, Allianz, AIG, Aviva, Axa, MetLife, Ping An, Prudential Financial, and Prudential.\nThe FSB's latest list makes no mention of reinsurers, a category still being considered for inclusion.\nGlobal insurance regulators have said they may take into account the activities of insurers when they decide if they are globally systemic, rather than just focusing on size and global reach.\nMetLife, the biggest U.S. life insurer, was also designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of the heads of U.S. financial regulators.\nThe insurer successfully challenged the U.S. designation in court, but the U.S. government has appealed with the outcome generally expected sometime in the next few months.\n\"MetLife is no longer designated as a systemically important financial institution in the United States, and believe we should not be designated as a global systemically important insurer, either,\" MetLife said on Monday.\n(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Carolyn Cohn and Mark Potter)",

      "text": "by Gary Leff on November 22, 2016 \nI receive compensation for many links on this blog. You don’t have to use these links, but I am grateful to you if you do. American Express, Citibank, Chase, and other banks are advertising partners of this site. Any opinions expressed in this post are my own, and have not been reviewed, approved, or endorsed by my advertising partners. I do not write about all credit cards that are available -- instead focusing on miles, points, and cash back (and currencies that can be converted into the same). \nI’ve gotten over a dozen emails from readers sharing with me that their annual fee on the Citi Prestige Card had dropped from $450 to $350 and that other benefits had been added to their account. \nThis has generally been chalked up to increased competition — Chase has come out with new premium cards most recently the Ink Business Preferred℠ Credit Card with an 80,000 point signup bonus card (after $5000 spend within 3 months), American Express has aggressive signup bonuses like the ability to earn 100,000 Membership Rewards points from the The Enhanced Business Platinum® Card from American Express OPEN . \nEven though readers received a letter in the mail from Citibank confirming these new benefits, they will not actually be receiving these changes . It was a mistake. \nOdds on everyone who got the mailing will also receive an email, a letter, or both apologizing for the error. Lower annual fees are a benefit of premium banking relationships with Citi, though instead of sending the mailing only to people who had recently created such a relationship they sent the mailing to a large portion of their cardmember database. \nHere’s the email I received: \nYou may have received a letter from us notifying you of changes to your Citi Prestige® account. This letter was sent to you in error, your card terms have not changed. You can find details about your Citi Prestige benefits here or review the Terms and Conditions in your Directory of Services. \nWe apologize for any confusion this may have caused. As a courtesy, we’re adding 1,000 ThankYou® Points to your account, you’ll see these points in your account in the next 1-2 billing periods. \nThe benefits listed in the letter—including a lower annual fee, no late fees, return check fees and a relationship bonus—are only available to cardmembers who also have a Citigold®, Citi Priority or Private Bank account. If you are interested in receiving the additional benefits, you can find more information about these bank accounts here or by visiting your local Citi branch. \nA $350 annual fee would be a really good deal, and a nice way to compensate for changes to the product (considering the card has a $250 airline credit that can even be used directly for airfare purchases). And a 15% annual bonus on points earned with the card would be also. These are benefits of Citigold and other accounts. But without significant assets on deposit with Citi you won’t get them, Citibank isn’t actually extending the benefits to all cardmembers. More From View from the Wing",

Even before President Trump throws off their shackles, three of them have been getting a little friskier . No prizes for guessing which ones . \nCitigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, as well as the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, all moved up in the latest ranking of so-called global systemically important banks by the Financial Stability Board, a Switzerland-based group of central bankers and financial regulators from the world’s largest economies. \nAt least one Wall Street bank, however, is still living as though we are not in a post-risk world. \nOn Monday, the Financial Stability Board also deemed three banks less risky to global financial stability than they were last year: Barclays, HSBC and Morgan Stanley. All three have sold part of their riskier businesses or reduced the size of some of them in the past year. \nNow that academic exercise is out of the way, let’s talk about some rankings that really matter: The ones that make, rather than restrict the making of, money. In spite of its aforementioned efforts, Brian Moynihan & co. simply weren’t able overtake hometown favorites UBS as the biggest equities house in Europe. But at least there’s a ranking now that puts BriMoy ahead of Jamie Dimon and James Gorman. \nThe quartet of Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase & Co took joint third with a market share of about 7 percent each…. \nUBS was helped by its healthy lead in market share for algorithmic trading which accounts for a significant portion of regional equity volumes. Its 13.9 percent market share in this area was ahead of Morgan Stanley’s 9.3 percent market share…. \nMorgan Stanley topped Greenwich’s list of market share leaders in European research and advisory. UBS and Exane BNP Paribas tied for second.",

Today’s stock prices reflect future expectations for the companies. Rises in stock prices often imply positive future expectations. Fertilizer stocks \nAgricultural fertilizer companies’ recent 3Q16 earnings have renewed investor interest and sparked a buying spree. Agrium ( AGU ) has outperformed the S&P 500 ( SPY ) with a return of 12% versus 9% YTD. PotashCorp ( POT ), which had so far delivered negative YTD returns, closed at $17.9 on November 23, up 3% YTD. \nHowever, some stocks remained in the negative territory like CF Industry ( CF ) with -30% YTD returns and Intrepid Potash ( IPI ) with -55% YTD returns. Mosaic ( MOS ) and Israel Chemicals ( ICL ) have delivered YTD returns of -4% and -6%, respectively. \nThe VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ( MOO ) ETF has returned 10% YTD, which still outperformed the S&P 500. Series overview \nWhile this optimism has pushed stocks up, investors often weigh both sides of the story before making an investment. Yesterday we published a series titled Why 2017 Looks to Be Better for Potash Fertilizer Prices in which we outlined the reasons for optimism in fertilizer stocks. \nIn this series, we’ll explore Citi’s view on fertilizer companies and why Citi is suggesting investors be cautious.

      "text": "Citi Reiterates Buy, Ups PT on HP Enterprise (HPE) By Shoshanna Delventhal | November 23, 2016 — 7:01 PM EST \nHewlett Packard Enterprise Co. ( HPE ) reported fiscal FY16 and fourth-quarter revenues Tuesday after market close. The corporate hardware and enterprise software firm posted mixed earnings results, as the stock trades up 1.3% at a price of $23.17 per share on Wednesday afternoon. Mixed Earnings in Fiscal 2016 Q4 \nThe Palo Alto, Calif.-based company posted fiscal FY16 top-line numbers down 4%, missing the Street’s estimates. Earnings were up 4% in the most recent fiscal year, in line with guidance and analysts’ forecasts. (See also: HP Enterprise's Fiscal FY16 Results .) \nIn the fiscal fourth quarter, revenue came in at $12.46 billion, below the consensus forecast of $12.85 billion, along with EPS of $0.61 for the quarter ending Oct .31, which met the Street’s projections. Management offered outlook foreseeing fiscal 2017 first quarter non-GAAP EPS between $0.42 and $0.46, the high end reflecting consensus estimates. The tech firm reiterated its guidance for FY17 of adjusted earnings between $2.00 to $2.10 per share, in line with analysts’ forecasted $2.06 in FY17. (See also: HPE Reports Mixed Fiscal Q4 Earnings .) Analyst Forecasts Upside in Tech Services \nCiti Group’s Jim Suva reiterated a buy rating on HPE stock, while raising his price target up from $25 to $27. Suva noted 2% constant currency growth in technology services for the second consecutive quarter. The analyst also pointed out that while HPE did not qualify the exact amount, the firm expects to benefit form potential tax policy reform. \nThe Citi analyst also sees upside in the completion of HP Enterprise’s large spinoffs of its software and enterprise services segments, as the firm expressed confidence in its stranded cost targets. While the company faces challenges in the core server market, with legacy storage on the decline and a slowdown in the EMEA region following Brexit, Suva says management is working to introduce new products and focus on high-growth markets. \n“While there are many moving parts to the business with divestitures, accelerated restructuring and separation payments, we believe investors are underappreciating the FCF generation and net cash improvement for HPE,” Suva stated.

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 \nOn Nov 24, 2016, we issued an updated research report on Citigroup Inc. ( C - Free Report ) . Amid the current regulatory pressure and challenging revenue environment across the banking sector, this New York-based banking giant remains focused on its streamlining moves and product enhancements, while maintaining a strong capital position.Citigroup’s third-quarter 2016 earnings per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by decline in operating expenses. Though the company witnessed decline in overall revenues, it recorded higher fixed income markets revenues, supported by an improved trading environment. Also, investment banking revenues improved owing to rise in industry-wide debt underwriting activity during the quarter.As of Sep 30, 2016, the company’s loans were up 2% year over year at $638 billion, while deposits climbed 4% year over year to $940 billion.In the earnings conference, management stated that it expects growth in the developed and emerging markets to pick up next year, while uncertainties tied with Brexit still persist.Management noted that North America Consumer Banking achieved volume growth in the third quarter despite persistently shrinking branch footprint. It highlighted that while over the past several years the company has reshaped its branch network, enhanced technology and remained focus in its core six markets, it will undertake further investments for growth.Citigroup now remains focused on its segmentation strategy associated with Citigold wealth management platform and improving digital and mobile banking capabilities. Additionally, the company will continue to upgrade the branch network with smart branches and Citigold centers.Notably, Costco acquisition will not be really accretive to Citigroup‘s earnings until in the later part of 2017 and certainly in 2018. Management projects increased profitability driven by the cards business, throughout 2019.The company will invest around $1 billion in Mexico over the next four years, primarily in technology, branches and ATMs. It anticipates maintaining positive operating leverage in fourth-quarter 2016 and every year, throughout the investment period, on the back of revenue growth and cost savings from technology upgradation.Shares of the company gained more than 20% over the past three months. \nCITIGROUP INC Price \nCITIGROUP INC Price | CITIGROUP INC Quote \nThe restructuring and streamlining efforts, along with an attractive core business, should support future performance. In addition, Citigroup remains committed to enhance shareholders’ value on the back of a solid capital position. However, sustained pressure on the company’s net interest income remains a concern amid the lingering low-rate environment. Moreover, several issues, such as a stringent regulatory landscape and litigation burden, remain key concerns.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved north 2% to $4.69 for 2016, while it edged down 1% $5.10 for 2017.Citigroup currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

      "text": "EPL on Citi FM: Liverpool reclaim top spot, Swansea pile pressure on Pardew   6:08 pm \nLiverpool moved back to the top of the Premier League after a hard fought win over Sunderland at Anfield. \nJurgen Klopp’s side were struggling to breakdown David Moyes’ ‘double-decker bus’ and looked set to fire blanks in front of goal for a second consecutive game. \nBut Divock Origi’s goal 15 minutes before full time broke the deadlock as his cross-cum-shot found the back of the net to give the Reds a deserved lead. And James Milner made sure of the result from the penalty spot, as he tucked his effort past Jordan Pickford. \nHowever, Liverpool’s biggest cause for concern came when Philippe Coutinho was forced off with a foot injury on the half-hour mark. The Brazilian midfielder, who has been in stunning form this season, was stretchered off following a clash with Ibrahim N’Dong. \nLeicester City 2 – 2 Middlesbrough Leicester City rescued a dramatic point at the King Power Stadium to deny Middlesbrough an impressive win at the home of the champions. \nAlvaro Negredo scored only his second goal of the season when he gave Boro the lead after fine work by Gaston Ramirez. The midfielder teed up Negredo, who expertly chipped the ball over a number of defenders, before the ball nestled in the top corner. \nLeicester were given the opportunity to level when Callum Chambers handled in the area. Riyad Mahrez stepped up to take the spot-kick, and he made no mistake, as he found the bottom corner via the post. \nNegredo looked to have given the away side all three points when he capitalised on some poor defending by the Foxes. Adam Forshaw’s lofted pass split the defence with ease, before Negredo volleyed past Ron-Robert Zieler. \nBut Islam Slimani scored a last minute penalty after Wes Morgan was fouled in the area to give his side a share of the spoils. \nSwansea City 5 – 4 Crystal Palace Bob Bradley secured his first league win since taking charge as his side beat Crystal Palace in a crazy game at the Liberty Stadium. \nWilfried Zaha opened the scoring for the Eagles midway through the first half after Christian Benteke’s knockdown allowed the winger to swivel and smash home. \nBut Swansea drew level thanks to a Gylfi Sigurdsson free-kick 10 minutes before the break, as the Icelandic midfielder left Wayne Hennessey with no chance. \nLeroy Fer scored a quick-fire double to give the home side a comfortable 3-1 lead before Crystal Palace incredibly came back to lead 4-3, thanks to goals from James Tomkins, an own goal from Jack Cork and a strike from Benteke. \nBut the Swans astonishingly scored two goals in added on time through Fernando Llorente to secure the most dramatic of wins and pile the pressure on Eagles boss Alan Pardew. \nHull City 1 – 1 West Bromwich Albion Hull and West Brom played out an entertaining draw at the KCOM Stadium as the home side came from behind to secure a point. \nThe Baggies took a deserved lead when Gareth McAuley headed past a line of defenders following good work by the in-form Matt Phillips. \nBut Michael Dawson levelled for the home side in the second half after Robert Snodgrass’ free-kick was bundled into the net. \n–",

      "text": "EPL on Citi FM: Liverpool reclaim top spot, Swansea pile pressure on Pardew By CitiFMonline \nLiverpool moved back to the top of the Premier League after a hard fought win over Sunderland at Anfield. \nJurgen Klopp's side were struggling to breakdown David Moyes' 'double-decker bus' and looked set to fire blanks in front of goal for a second consecutive game. \nBut Divock Origi's goal 15 minutes before full time broke the deadlock as his cross-cum-shot found the back of the net to give the Reds a deserved lead. And James Milner made sure of the result from the penalty spot, as he tucked his effort past Jordan Pickford. \nHowever, Liverpool's biggest cause for concern came when Philippe Coutinho was forced off with a foot injury on the half-hour mark. The Brazilian midfielder, who has been in stunning form this season, was stretchered off following a clash with Ibrahim N'Dong. \nLeicester City 2 – 2 MiddlesbroughLeicester City rescued a dramatic point at the King Power Stadium to deny Middlesbrough an impressive win at the home of the champions. \nAlvaro Negredo scored only his second goal of the season when he gave Boro the lead after fine work by Gaston Ramirez. The midfielder teed up Negredo, who expertly chipped the ball over a number of defenders, before the ball nestled in the top corner. \nLeicester were given the opportunity to level when Callum Chambers handled in the area. Riyad Mahrez stepped up to take the spot-kick, and he made no mistake, as he found the bottom corner via the post. \nNegredo looked to have given the away side all three points when he capitalised on some poor defending by the Foxes. Adam Forshaw's lofted pass split the defence with ease, before Negredo volleyed past Ron-Robert Zieler. \nBut Islam Slimani scored a last minute penalty after Wes Morgan was fouled in the area to give his side a share of the spoils. \nSwansea City 5 – 4 Crystal Palace Bob Bradley secured his first league win since taking charge as his side beat Crystal Palace in a crazy game at the Liberty Stadium. \nWilfried Zaha opened the scoring for the Eagles midway through the first half after Christian Benteke's knockdown allowed the winger to swivel and smash home. \nBut Swansea drew level thanks to a Gylfi Sigurdsson free-kick 10 minutes before the break, as the Icelandic midfielder left Wayne Hennessey with no chance. \nLeroy Fer scored a quick-fire double to give the home side a comfortable 3-1 lead before Crystal Palace incredibly came back to lead 4-3, thanks to goals from James Tomkins, an own goal from Jack Cork and a strike from Benteke. \nBut the Swans astonishingly scored two goals in added on time through Fernando Llorente to secure the most dramatic of wins and pile the pressure on Eagles boss Alan Pardew. \nHull City 1 – 1 West Bromwich Albion Hull and West Brom played out an entertaining draw at the KCOM Stadium as the home side came from behind to secure a point. \nThe Baggies took a deserved lead when Gareth McAuley headed past a line of defenders following good work by the in-form Matt Phillips. \nBut Michael Dawson levelled for the home side in the second half after Robert Snodgrass' free-kick was bundled into the net. \n–",

      "text": "I just signed up for a Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select card and to my surprised, I wasn't instantly approved. My FICO score is currently over 800 with few credit card debts. Any ideas why I wasn't approved instantly ? In my previously experience, all my applications ended up being denied when I wasn't instantly approved.\n\nIs it possible that it may be related to the fact that I have a HELOC (recent) and mortgage with Citibank so my overall credit limit is \"maxed\" out with Citi?\n\nor maybe because it was just recently that I paid off one of my big credit cards and Citibank doesn't have the most up to date information ? (I think this is unlikely since my credit karma and capital one creditwise score already reflected the debt payoff).\n\nNew to this forum, thank you in advanced for your help! ",

      "text": "On Nov 24, 2016, we issued an updated research report on Citigroup Inc. C . Amid the current regulatory pressure and challenging revenue environment across the banking sector, this New York-based banking giant remains focused on its streamlining moves and product enhancements, while maintaining a strong capital position.\nCitigroup’s third-quarter 2016 earnings per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by decline in operating expenses. Though the company witnessed decline in overall revenues, it recorded higher fixed income markets revenues, supported by an improved trading environment. Also, investment banking revenues improved owing to rise in industry-wide debt underwriting activity during the quarter.\nAs of Sep 30, 2016, the company’s loans were up 2% year over year at $638 billion, while deposits climbed 4% year over year to $940 billion.\nIn the earnings conference, management stated that it expects growth in the developed and emerging markets to pick up next year, while uncertainties tied with Brexit still persist.\nManagement noted that North America Consumer Banking achieved volume growth in the third quarter despite persistently shrinking branch footprint. It highlighted that while over the past several years the company has reshaped its branch network, enhanced technology and remained focus in its core six markets, it will undertake further investments for growth.\nCitigroup now remains focused on its segmentation strategy associated with Citigold wealth management platform and improving digital and mobile banking capabilities. Additionally, the company will continue to upgrade the branch network with smart branches and Citigold centers.\nNotably, Costco acquisition will not be really accretive to Citigroup‘s earnings until in the later part of 2017 and certainly in 2018.

      "text": "by Paul Clarke 16 minutes ago \nGoldman Sachs continues to lose senior traders in the U.S. after a series of job cuts hitting its New York operation.  en/254896/254896/ \nThe churn in the senior ranks in Goldman Sachs’ markets division continues. So far this month, at least two long-serving managing directors have departed for Wall Street competitors. \nDerek Brown, a managing director in Goldman Sachs’ equities division, joined Citigroup as a managing director earlier this month. He was bumped up to MD in 2005 at Goldman, and had been working at the firm for over 19 years. \nMeanwhile, Thomas Harrop, a managing director in Goldman’s global liquidity products division in New York, has just joined Credit Suisse. Again, Harrop spent a long time at Goldman Sachs – he joined in March 2004, as a prop trader focused primarily on credit derivatives. He was promoted to managing director in 2012. \nHarrop spent nearly three years in Hong Kong where he was APAC co-treasurer and a managing director in its global liquidity products group. He returned to New York in July this year, but departed Goldman earlier this month. \nGoldman’s bi-annual promotion of partners earlier this month was always likely to see the departure of some managing directors who failed to make the cut. However, Goldman has also been making some deep cuts to its U.S. operation – 443 employees have been affected by numerous announcements throughout this year stating its intentions to cut staff in New York. Most of the job cuts earlier this year hit senior sales and trading staff within its fixed income currencies and commodities division. \nCitigroup, meanwhile, has been quietly shoring up its equities business since the departure of its equities head Derek Bandeen earlier this year. It brought in Armando Diaz from hedge fund Millennium Capital Management to run its cash equities business in the Americas, while Dirk Keijer and Quentin Andre also joined from Goldman Sachs in senior derivatives sales roles.",

John Chandler Reports. (Published Thursday, Oct. 20, 2016) City leaders and lawmakers met Monday to discuss the future of Citi Bike across the five boroughs and how best to expand the bike-share program. The current expansion of the program -- called Phase 2 -- is bringing Citi Bike into parts of Astoria, Harlem and Crown Heights. By the end of next year, there will be more than 100 new stations and 2,000 new bikes in New York City. Citi Bike Expansion in Brooklyn Pits Driver Against Cyclist City officials said Phase 3 is not yet planned but they have their eye on getting into the Bronx and Staten Island eventually. New York City Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg made her case to the City Council Monday. The biggest issue involves logistics, she said -- making sure stations aren't in the way of sidewalks and parking spots, and that there are always bikes available. Top Tri-State News Photos \"As the system gets bigger and bigger, making sure you have the bikes in the places where people need them is one challenge, and the other discussion we have is about when we put in public dollars you heard a lively discussion of when would you do that, what would be appropriate,\" she said. Trottenberg also compared costs for commuters, arguing that a monthly Citi Bike membership costs about $15, while a monthly MetroCard is more than $150. Cops Tackle Citi Biker as He Rides Toward Obama Motorcade The City Council is currently not on board with using city money to fund the bike share program. Though Citi Bike is prepared with private funding for its expansion plan through next year, it's not yet clear how the expansion into the Bronx and Staten Island will be paid for.

      "text": "Citi Bike expansion in NYC would require taxpayer dollars, City Council says By Ivan Pereira Advertise here \nThe City Council wants to bring bike share to every neighborhood within the next four years, with taxpayer dollars making that goal a reality. \nCouncilman Ydanis Rodriguez set forth that proposal during Monday’s transportation committee hearing on the future of Citi Bike and emphasized the need to focus on outer borough neighborhoods where lower-income residents have virtually no transit options, such as the South Bronx, parts of Staten Island and central Queens. \nAlthough the privately funded bike share service has a fleet of 10,000 rides available across Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan and nearly 120,000 active annual riders, the councilman said public dollars should be earmarked to get bikes in every community by 2020. \n“Working, middle and upper class communities should have the ability to enjoy this resource equally,” Rodriguez said. \nCiti Bike is currently going through its Phase II expansion and this year opened new stations in upper Manhattan and Brooklyn neighborhoods such as Gowanus, Carroll Gardens, Red Hook and Park Slope. The service is expected to reach 12,000 bikes and 750 stations, with new locations in Harlem, Astoria, Prospect Heights and Crown Heights, by the end of 2017, according to the city’s Department of Transportation. \nDOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg said it would take at least 70,000 to 80,000 bikes to meet Rodriguez’s goal. Currently the agency has been able to install 2,000 bikes a year at an annual cost of $12 million, according to Motivate, Citi Bike’s operator. \nThe commissioner agreed that public funds likely would be necessary for a Phase III expansion, but added that bringing taxpayer dollars into the mix would also require a change in the way the city works with Motivate. \n“Many program factors, such as the ownership of equipment, funding sources, percentage of revenue share, siting and maintenance will need to be carefully considered and renegotiated as part of any new agreement,” Trottenberg said. \nMotivate’s CEO, Jay Walder agreed that a rapid expansion would need some city funding and said the company has begun discussions with the city over Phase III. \nSarah Kaufman, the assistant director for technology programming at the NYU Rudin Center for Transportation, said the bikes would make a major difference in many areas in the city, singling out the neighborhoods in Brooklyn that will be affected by the looming L train shutdown. \n“I hope the city will make a place for it in the budget,” she said. \nKaufman questioned how a bike share program largely seen as complementary to subway or bus commutes would fit into neighborhoods lacking immediate access to primary modes of commuting. \n“The question is will it be a substitute for those outer borough residents,” she said. \nWalder said Motivate has focused on boosting Citi Bike’s appeal in low-income and minority communities. Annual Citi Bike membership in Bed-Stuy went up 50% over the last year since Motivate began working with the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration, a community development nonprofit, on outreach efforts, the company said. \n“This is really about making sure that community members feel that Citi Bike is for them as part of a well-balanced transportation network that provides affordable, useful options for all residents,” he said. \nHere are some key points in the proposed plan. \n— The expansion would be focused on neighborhoods that would benefit the most from bike share such as the North Shore of Staten Island, the South Bronx, central Queens. \n— Motivate currently installs 2,000 bikes a year at a combined privately-funded cost of $12 million. \n— In order for every community to have Citi Bike access, there would need to be at least 70,000 bikes, according to the DOT.",

      "text": "City council talks public money for Citi Bike push into poorer neighborhoods NYC talks funding for Citi Bikes in poorer neighborhoods Citi Bikes stationed next to the Bowling Green Subway Station in Manhattan. (Rose Abuin/New York Daily News) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, November 29, 2016, 2:04 AM \nTo get blue Citi Bikes cruising in more neighborhoods around the city, lawmakers on Monday raised the idea of putting public money behind the privately run bike share system. \nCouncilman Ydanis Rodriguez said at a Transportation Committee hearing said tax dollars should fund an aggressive expansion of Citi Bike to neighborhoods that are far removed from the bike share network’s footprint, which is centered around the city’s business district. \nCiti Bike is the only U.S. bike share system that receives no public money to run. \n“I am setting a goal today that Citi Bike should be available in every single community board in the city of New York by 2020,” Rodriguez, chair of the Transportation Committee, said. “It is imperative that we turn Citi Bike fully into a public good and resource for our lowest income communities.” \nThe Citi Bike system — operating on membership fees and sponsorships — is on its way to double in size to 12,000 bikes and 750 stations by the end of next year. It currently has 10,000 bikes and 610 stations in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. \nBronx and Staten Island remain Citi Bike free. \nLawmakers, meanwhile, grilled DOT officials to see when Citi Bikes will be rolling in their districts. \nCouncilwoman Debi Rose (D- Staten Island) said she it was “counterintuitive” for the city to put bike lanes in her north shore district without Citi Bike docks. \nCouncilman Carlos Menchaca (D-Brooklyn) inquired about putting stand-alone set of docks in his Sunset Park district, far removed from the bike-share system’s Manhattan-centric footprint. \n“We want to see Citi Bike on every corner,” he said. \nJay Walder, CEO of Motivate, which runs Citi Bike, said if the Council members wanted a more robust bike share system in more neighborhoods around the city, public money would be needed. \n“To achieve the goals that have been articulated at the Council today cannot be done without public support,” Walder said. \nCouncilwoman Helen Rosenthal (D-Manhattan) went against the pack, questioning a new public subsidy to fund Citi Bike, when the city’s future federal funding is up in the air at the moment. \n“I’m not ready to open the door to subsidizing a new service and calling it now a public service because there’s city dollars in it,” she said. \nTransportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg said she was open to publicly financing the third phase of Citi Bike’s growth, though making sure it’s operating efficiently will be a challenge. The system, operated by bike share company called Motivate, has struggled to make sure demand is met and there are enough bikes at docks where they’re needed. Trottenberg, who estimated that at least 70,000 bikes were needed to cover the entire city, warned lawmakers of the challenges in expanding bike share. \n“All city bike systems follow the same principle, which is, they want to be in dense areas and they want to be in contiguous areas,” she said. “The further the system gets out ... you’re going to have more complexity in terms of the number of riders you’re going to get, the potential for advertising revenue, tourist dollars.” Join the Conversation:",

      "text": "The city should pony up public funds for Citi Bike to expand into poorer neighborhoods, City Council members said Monday.\nSeveral members — noting that the privately run bike-share program isn’t offered in disadvantaged areas because it likely wouldn’t be profitable there — called for the city to create a public-private financial partnership.\nThey said using public funds is the only way to bring the blue cruisers to all corners of the five boroughs.\n“One of the most celebrated parts of Citi Bike is that the network has done all of this without any direct public financing,” said Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez (D-Washington Heights/Inwood) at\na council Transportation Committee hearing.\n“The one concern about this, however, is that the network has expanded to predominantly affluent areas, with concerns that to do otherwise would be financially unsustainable.”\nCiti Bike currently has docks throughout Manhattan below 125th Street, a handful of neighborhoods in the northwest corner of Brooklyn,and the Long Island City section of Queens.\nMotivate, the company that runs Citi Bike, also plans to install docks in Prospect Heights and Crown Heights in Brooklyn and Astoria, Queens, by the end of 2017.\nRiders took more than 10 million trips on Citi Bikes in 2015 and are on track to hit 14 million by the end of this year.\nBut council members from The Bronx, Staten Island and other parts of Queens complained that their constituents deserve the program too.\n“We have a lot of neighborhoods that rely only on the [No.] 7 train, and they need other options to get to work,” said Queens Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer (D-Sunnyside/Woodside/Long Island City).\nWhen city Transportation Department Commissioner Polly Trottenberg suggested that Staten Island have a separate unconnected system, Councilwoman Deborah Rose, who represents that borough, balked.\n“We are a burgeoning waterfront community, and there seems to quite a bit of opportunity here,” Rose said.\n“It seems counter-intuitive to have a Citi Bike that isn’t connected to the rest of the system. We have been a part of New York City for a very long time.”\nNo one floated any suggested dollar amounts for how much the city could contribute, and Trottenberg cautioned that it would have to be a continued investment. \nShe also argued that the city and Motivate might clash over how much involvement the city would get to have on major company decisions.\nCiti Bike said that while it welcomes the money, it’s going to have to seriously weigh any strings attached.\n“We are eager to work with the city to figure out how to continue to grow the program to reach more and more New Yorkers after the completion of our current agreement,” said a company spokesperson.\nThere are currently about 10,000 Citi Bikes on the road, and Trottenberg said that it costs $6,000 in full costs to get each bike into the system.\n ",

      "text": "Print This Priscilla, Sammi and most of Citi FM staff names were wrongly written After disqualifying some Presidential candidates on the basis of clerical errors and some other errors, the electoral commission today proved to the world that after all no one is perfect. The Election Management body released its accreditation for media personnel ahead of the 2016 election and names of Journalist were spelt wrongly. Among the names spelt wrongly included Richard Sky which was spelt Richard Sly, Umaru Sanda which was spelt Sandra Amadu, Nana Boakye Yiadom which was also spelt Nkna Boakye Yiadom. These mistakes did not go down well with some Ghanaians who thought the EC preached virtue and was practicing vice. See the reactions to EC Related Articles:",

      "text": "No Stopping The Rally? Cramer's Mad Money (11/28/16) (Seeking Alpha) \nCiti’s Mark Kelley believes the 16 percent decline in Etsy Inc (NASDAQ: ETSY ) shares, following Q3 2016 results, was driven by the announcement of the departure of CFO Kristina Salen in March 2017 and comments regarding a deceleration in Seller Services. \nKelley reiterated a Buy rating on the company, with a price target of $20. Decelerating Seller Services \nManagement commented that a deceleration was expected in Seller Services, as Etsy had recently lapped the Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: PYPL ) integration that occurred in October 2015. \n“We believe investors have been primarily focused on Seller Services growth and, after this exercise, believe shares have correctly recovered,” the analyst mentioned. \nHowever, Kelley expects upside to the Q4 2016 estimates, as well as the out-year estimates and for the stock to rise toward the price target. Upside Expected \nThe analyst noted that the PayPal integration increased the annual growth rate by about 30 percent for Direct Checkout to reach closer to an average of 48 percent year-on-year for the past four quarters, but was likely to return to about 28 percent year on year in Q4. \n“Even taking this into account, we would not be surprised to see 4Q revenue $4-5M head of our above-street estimates, which would equate to revenue growth of +28 percent y/y vs. our currently modeled +24 percent y/y,” Kelley stated.

      "text": "Top 5 Hiltons Within the US for Two Free Nights on Hilton Reserve By 0 146 \nThe Citi® Hilton HHonors™ Reserve Card offers two free weekend nights (Fri, Sat, Sun) at almost any Hilton worldwide after spending $2,500 in the first four months. \nCredit card links have been removed from posts and added to the menu bar at the top of every page of MileValue under the heading Top Travel Credit Cards. \n“Almost any Hilton” basically excludes only all inclusive properties and time shares. This is the full list of excluded properties: \nThat leaves a ton of beautiful properties to choose from to use your Free Night certificates on, properties that cost thousands of dollars in exotic locations. But the actual fact of the matter is that one person is only going to earn two free nights, and the free nights are good for rooms with double occupancy (no more than two people), so the most you could stretch your stay at any of these aspirational properties is three nights since they are only good for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights (and still have one free night leftover to use at a different time). \nUnless you can build in the free nights into an already planned international trip, you probably don’t want to spend a lot of money or miles to go somewhere for two or three nights. That’s why I’m going to tell you about the best properties within (or very close) to the United States to spend your free night certificates on. \nYou should be able to use your Free Weekend Night Certificates any time a standard room is available– no blackout dates apply. So use your certificates on a holiday weekend to really save yourself some money. Certificates also cover taxes, but not resort fees. \nCategory 9 Conrad New York \nThe Conrad in New York is stunning. Located in Battery Park City on the Hudson River, it is just minutes from the World Trade Center memorial and would provide a lovely base from which to explore the city. Conrad New York Waldorf Astoria Park City \nCategory 9 \nAll you have the energy to do after a day of skiing (or golfing) is relax in your hotel, so why not splurge your Free Night Certificates on this ultra-luxurious Hilton in Park City, Utah? \nRetail value for two nights: $1,609.58 (resort fees are not covered by the Free Night Certificates, so you will have to pay the $35 resort fee per night out of pocket) \nIf you’re into skiing and hiking, another solid option is the Hilton Whistler Resort & Spa in Canada. \nYou’ll have a half-mile stretch of your own private beach in Boca Raton, Florida. \nNot to mention two championship golf courses. \nRetail value for two nights: $1,053.02 ($30 per night of that will not be covered by the Free Night Certificate as it’s a resort charge) Waldorf Astoria Chicago \nCategory 10 \nPlan ahead for next year’s Lollapalooza to stay at the Waldorf Astoria Chicago, one of only two category 10 Hiltons in the Continental United States– the other is the DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel New York City – Times Square , and you’ll have an extravagant spa to recover in between stints at the music festival. \nThis hotel (which used to be The Elysian) has glowing reviews, like this one from One Mile At A Time . \nRetails value of two nights: $1,109.43 Grand Wailea on Maui \nCategory 10 \nHawaii is in the United States people– as Scott likes to remind us. It’s not out of the question for a weekend getaway (especially if you and your travel companion both sign up for the Citi® Hilton HHonors™ Reserve Card and you can stretch out your stay to four nights!) \nThe Grand Wailea on Maui looks not only beautiful, but like a ton of fun for adults and kids alike. \nRetail value of two nights: $1,261.91 ($30 per night of that will not be covered by the Free Night Certificate as it’s a resort charge) The Miles to Use to Get There \nWe recently wrote a series of posts of that aims at helping you master redeeming awards within the United States using transferrable points. So far we’ve written about ThankYou Points and Ultimate Rewards, and will be getting to Membership Rewards and SPG points shortly. By the time the series is finished, all the major loyalty programs will be covered. How to Maximize Domestic Award Redemptions Series: SPG Points Card Offer Details \nYou already know that the Citi® Hilton HHonors™ Reserve Card comes with Two Free Nights worldwide at top tier Hiltons after spending $2,500 in four months (note that you have four months to meet the minimum spending requirement– most card offers require you to meet the spending threshold within three months). \nHere are the other offer details: Earn 10 Hilton HHonors Bonus Points per $1 spent on hotel stays within the Hilton Portfolio Earn 5 Hilton HHonors Bonus Points per $1 spent on airline and car rental purchases Earn 3 Hilton HHonors Bonus Points per $1 spent on all other purchases Enjoy the benefits of HHonors Gold status as long as you are a cardmember No foreign transaction fees on purchases Travel with ease and enjoy global acceptance with your Citi chip credit card $95 annual fee that is not waived the first year Two Opposite Strategies to Maximize Hilton (Hilton Reserve vs. Hilton Points) \nSo far I have just discussed strategies for maximizing the two free night certificates you earn from the Citi® Hilton HHonors™ Reserve Card. The other strategy for maximizing Hilton’s reward program is collecting the 75,000 point bonus from the Citi® Hilton HHonors™ Visa Signature® Card , which you get after spending $2,000 in the first three months after opening the card, and using your HHonors points for booking up to 20 free nights at category 1 Hiltons , ten free nights at category 2 Hiltons , or five free nights at category 3 Hiltons . \nThe point is that Hilton has an extreme award chart , on which some free nights cost 19 times other free nights. That requires us to adopt an extreme strategy and either try to get value with points at the bottom end (for lots of free nights with the Citi® Hilton HHonors™ Visa Signature® Card ), with free night certificates at the top end (for two free nights at a five star hotel via the Citi® Hilton HHonors™ Reserve Card ). \nUnfortunately you can’t get both of Citi’s Hilton cards at once due to their new sign up bonus rule . However, you can get the Hilton HHonors Surpass Card from American Express that , for a limited time , comes with 100,000 bonus Hilton points after making $3,000 in purchases in the first three months. If you want to go for the strategy of getting value with points at the bottom (for lots of free nights), then sign up for both the Citi® Hilton HHonors™ Visa Signature® Card and the Hilton HHonors Surpass Card from American Express and after spending a total of $5,500 on the cards collectively you’ll have at least 188k Hilton points , which you could use for:",

Others, though, doubt Trump would push through or even endorse meaningful regulatory reform and are wary of his protectionist rhetoric. Here's what some bankers have to say to the president-elect.",

A “culture of gender discrimination” permeates the bank, the lawsuit alleges, disadvantaging women like plaintiff Erin Daly, a former Citi financial adviser. \nIt’s not the first time an employee has leveled these charges against a major Wall Street bank, let alone Citigroup. In 2010, a group of six women sued the bank , similarly alleging a “boys’ club” mentality that subordinated women to their male colleagues. Retrograde as these alleged conditions are, they still don’t come as a surprise. We’ve all seen the DiCaprio movie. \nBut the lawsuit also alleges that the bank retaliated against Daly, not just over her complaints of unfair treatment, but for blowing the whistle on alleged violations of insider trading rules – including on the 2014 Alibaba IPO that Citigroup helped arrange, which remains biggest public offering ever. \nIf substantiated, these allegations would go beyond the typical claims of chauvinism in big banks to reveal securities misdeeds at the center of Citigroup’s profitable investment banking operations. \n“We believe the claims alleged are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them,” Citigroup spokesperson Danielle Romero-Apsilos said. The plaintiff’s lawyer, Michelle Daly, declined to comment. \nErin Daly began at Citigroup’s brokerage department in 2007 and wound up working in the Private Bank, where she developed expertise in securities laws and helped advise on sensitive deals in which the bank sold off IPO shares to clients, the complaint claims. \nIt was there the trouble first began. For reasons that remain mysterious, Daly in 2012 lost her access to view the trading book and allocate stock within the private bank. “Because of the discretion afforded the Desk in distributing stock of certain ‘hot’ IPOs,” the lawsuit claims, “individuals who had this power were seen as extremely valuable by clients and by other employees.” \nDaly asked repeatedly why she was the only member of her desk without access to the book, eventually lodging a complaint asking, “Is this because I am female?” Her superiors responded testily, according to the lawsuit, going so far as to demand an apology for the grievance. \n“Clients, analysts, assistants, everyone heard the message,” the lawsuit reads. “The boys were in charge. The men were doing business. Erin was just a glorified secretary.” \nThen things got worse. \nIn the course of her eight-year career at Citi, the Upper West Side resident built up expertise in the complicated regulations around allocating IPO stock to bank clients, according to the lawsuit. That meant Daly had access to some information of a sensitive – and potentially profitable – nature. \nAmong the colleagues angling for that information was Daly’s manager, James Messina, the lawsuit claims. Messina “constantly demanded that Erin disclose material nonpublic information” and “harassed Plaintiff to tell him protected inside information so that he could pass the information along to his favored clients,” according to the complaint. \nSuch demands would have represented breaches of the firewall required between bankers working on an IPO and those who hope to trade the stock. Daly blew the whistle on the alleged mischief in November, 2015. Five days later, she was told to pack up her belongings. Soon afterward she was terminated. \nOn her U5 form – a crucial document that follows financial professionals from job to job – Citi allegedly wrote that Daly had been chronically tardy and insubordinate, and had forwarded sensitive information without approval. The latter charge, the lawsuit claims, referred to a call Citi lawyers asked her to make. \nCiti, of course, denies the allegations in full, and at present there’s nothing to substantiate claims of employees reaching “over the wall” for privileged information in advance of hot IPOs at Citi. \nEven if there is substance, the lawsuit – together with simultaneous complaints to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and New York’s Labor Department – has one big weakness: timing. Let’s see a Trump administration go after this one. Shares 0",

      "text": "  12:00 PM EST Citi Launches In-App Replacement Credit Card Tracker Starting today, U.S. Citi credit cardmembers can track the steps of their replacement card delivery in real-time within the Citi Mobile App for iPhone or Android or through Citi Online. Citi cardmembers will be able to track the status of their cards in instances of natural reissuance (card expired and chip upgrade), during product conversions, or if it’s been lost, stolen, or damaged. Citi is the first major credit card issuer to offer real-time card replacement tracking online and on its mobile app. \nStarting today, U.S. Citi credit cardmembers can track the steps of their replacement card delivery in real-time within the Citi Mobile App for iPhone or Android or through Citi Online. Citi cardmembers will be able to track the status of their cards in instances of natural reissuance (card expired and chip upgrade), during product conversions, or if it’s been lost, stolen, or damaged. Citi is the first major credit card issuer to offer real-time card replacement tracking online and on its mobile app. \n“As we redesign the banking experience to be increasingly in the palms of our cardmembers’ hands, Citi is quickly creating simple, next-gen solutions for our customers’ banking needs,” says Alice Milligan, Chief Customer and Digital Experience Officer for Citi Global Cards and Consumer Services . “Having real-time insight into the status of their card delivery will provide our customers with more peace of mind and enable them to plan ahead.” \nCiti customers will now be able to monitor when their replacement card was processed and its expected arrival. They will also be able to track the package if it was sent via FedEx. Finally, customers will be able to activate their card through the tracker. \nThis launch follows the recent introduction of Citi Quick Lock, which is a new functionality that enables Citi customers to “lock” their account with a simple tap or click within Citi Online or the Citi Mobile App. The Citi Quick Lock feature helps ensure that no unauthorized charges are made while a card is misplaced and upon locating a misplaced card, Citi customers can simply “unlock” their account just as easily. Citi also recently introduced the ability to dispute certain credit card charges, view or download PDF statements, as well as view FICO scores for free within the Citi Mobile App. \nAbout Citi \nCiti, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management. \nAdditional information may be found at www.citigroup.com | Twitter: @Citi | YouTube: www.youtube.com/citi | Blog: http://blog.citigroup.com | Facebook: www.facebook.com/citi | LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/citi \nApple, the Apple logo, and iPhone are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries. \nAndroid is a trademark of Google Inc .

      "text": "Blog This \nStarting today, U.S. Citi credit cardmembers can track the steps of their replacement card delivery in real-time within the Citi Mobile App for iPhone or Android or through Citi Online. Citi cardmembers will be able to track the status of their cards in instances of natural reissuance (card expired and chip upgrade), during product conversions, or if it’s been lost, stolen, or damaged. Citi is the first major credit card issuer to offer real-time card replacement tracking online and on its mobile app. \n“As we redesign the banking experience to be increasingly in the palms of our cardmembers’ hands, Citi is quickly creating simple, next-gen solutions for our customers’ banking needs,” says Alice Milligan, Chief Customer and Digital Experience Officer for Citi Global Cards and Consumer Services . “Having real-time insight into the status of their card delivery will provide our customers with more peace of mind and enable them to plan ahead.” \nCiti customers will now be able to monitor when their replacement card was processed and its expected arrival. They will also be able to track the package if it was sent via FedEx. Finally, customers will be able to activate their card through the tracker. \nThis launch follows the recent introduction of Citi Quick Lock, which is a new functionality that enables Citi customers to “lock” their account with a simple tap or click within Citi Online or the Citi Mobile App. The Citi Quick Lock feature helps ensure that no unauthorized charges are made while a card is misplaced and upon locating a misplaced card, Citi customers can simply “unlock” their account just as easily. Citi also recently introduced the ability to dispute certain credit card charges, view or download PDF statements, as well as view FICO scores for free within the Citi Mobile App. \nAbout Citi \nCiti, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management. \nAdditional information may be found at www.citigroup.com | Twitter: @Citi | YouTube: www.youtube.com/citi | Blog: http://blog.citigroup.com | Facebook: www.facebook.com/citi | LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/citi \nApple, the Apple logo, and iPhone are trademarks of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries. \nAndroid is a trademark of Google Inc .

      "text": "Email \nThe Citi Bike bike share program has had its ups and downs in New York City, but after a few hiccups some would argue most New Yorkers have come around on the topic. \nNow, however, you have some — like Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr. asking — when is our neighborhood next? \n“Now is the time for Bronxites that we are thinking differently about ourselves, we deserve the very best,\" Diaz said. \"We deserve what the rest of the city is getting.\" \nAsk Bronx residents and most say they would absolutely use Citi Bikes in their borough. But when can they? \nAccording to Citi Bike's own expansion map, by the end of 2016 the system will have 10, 000 bikes and by the end of 2017, 12,000 bikes. \nYet not a single one will be in the Bronx or Staten Island. \n“When they announced a couple of years ago that they would expand to other parts of the city to New Jersey, but not the Bronx, we took exception to that,” recalled Diaz. \nA City Council Transportation Committee hearing addressed these concerns among others on Monday. \n“We strongly believe that it is time to bring some public and increase of private dollars to this important mode of transportation,” explained Transportation Committee Chair, Councilmember Ydanis Rodriguez. \nTracy Capers is from a nonprofit organization out of Bedford-Stuyvesant and she's worked with Citi Bike to bring the program to her neighborhood. \nCapers said she's seen first hand how Citi Bikes went from a \"not in my neighborhood\" conversation to a \"what about my neighborhood\" discussion instead. \n“One of the things we’ve been fighting is trying to change the conversation that bike share is a tool regardless of income and for people of color and low income communities. It's not a tool of gentrification,\" Capers said. Related stories ",

Citi Names Vanessa Colella Innovation Chief, Head of Citi Ventures 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue \nDebby Hopkins, chief innovation officer at Citigroup and chief executive of Citi Ventures, the bank's venture capital investment arm, is set to retire at the end of the year. \nHopkins will be replaced in both roles by Vanessa Colella, who has been Citi Ventures' global head of venture investing and strategic growth initiatives since 2013, according to an internal memo from John Gerspach, Citi's chief financial officer, shared with American Banker Tuesday morning. \nStarting Jan. 1, Colella will lead Citi Ventures as it pursues venture investments in early-stage startups and working with other Citi businesses to test new innovations and ideas through its Global Lab Network and external partners.

      "text": "Citi recently added a couple new features to their website and mobile app.\nCard Replacement Tracking Press Release \nStarting today, we can track the steps of Citi credit card replacement delivery in real-time within the Citi Mobile App for iPhone or Android or through Citi Online.\nCiti cardmembers will be able to track the status of their cards for replacement of expired cards, product changed cards, and lost/stolen cards.\nI tried finding the feature in their iOS app and don’t see it there yet. In the desktop login, there are a couple of tabs in the Account Management section which relate to replacement cards and might show this info. I don’t have any cards in transit to say for sure.\nRecurring Charges View Another addition I noticed in the online login and in the app is the ability to view recurring charges on your cards. This is helpful when cancelling a card to know which merchants you’ve been using the card consistently.\n\nThe system doesn’t only tell you automatic recurring charges, rather, any charge they see repeatedly comes up in the list. In practice, it seems to show some repeated charges but not others; I don’t know exactly what criteria it uses.\nTo find this feature, go to Account Management > View Recurring Charges on desktop. Go to Services > Recurring Charges in the app.\nIn a related development, Citi also added Quick Lock a few months ago. \nThe post Citi adds Card Replacement Tracking and Recurring Charges View appeared first on Doctor Of Credit .\n",

      "text": "by Gary Leff on November 29, 2016 \nArguably the most difficult program in the world for US members to redeem miles with has been SkyTeam member Garuda Indonesia. They’re certainly the most difficult program to redeem miles with that partners with a transferable points currency . You can move Citi ThankYou points to GarudaMiles. \nHowever up until now if you wanted to redeem GarudaMiles for travel on their own flights you had to endure “award redemption in six easy steps.” \nRoughly speaking Garuda Indonesia’s frequent flyer program thought it was Korean. North Korean: Call Garuda Indonesia or go in person to a ticket office to set up your reservation. \nComplete an award ticket application form \nSubmit this form, a valid ID, and your original GarudaMiles membership card (note: you therefore cannot simply sign up for the program and redeem – wait for that card!) to the staff at the Garuda Indonesia Sales Office . \nThen claim the award ticket in person at the sales office . You can send someone to have the award ticket issued in person for you, but if you do you must provide them “with a legally valid letter of authority” \nIt’s precisely because of this process that I was never willing to mess with a GarudaMiles redemption. These are the only ticket offices in the U.S. : \nHowever Garuda Indonesia has said they want to fly from Jakarta to Los Angeles via Tokyo in 2017. And first class onboard their Boeing 777-300ER looks fantastic. \nWhat’s more there’s virtually no competition for redeeming first class awards on SkyTeam member Garuda Indonesia. Delta miles, of course, cannot be used for international first class. \nTheir award chart isn’t great although shorter flights especially in economy and business are reasonable. \nGaruda route is priced separately, and roughly based on distance. Economy awards start at 4000 miles each way and business starts at 7000 miles each way. \nThe shortest first class redemptions are 45,000 miles one-way, and upgrades from business to first are roughly half the cost of an award. Longer flights do get pricey in first class. \nJakarta – Syndey is 90,000 miles one-way in first class Jakarta – Abu Dhabi is 105,000 miles one-way in first class Jakarta – London is 190,00 miles one-eway in first class \nThe big news though is that you can now redeem GarudaMiles for Garuda Indonesia flights online or by phone. \nVisit www.Garuda-Indonesia.com or contact Garuda Indonesia Contact Center at +62 21 2351 9999 or 0804 1807 807 (from Indonesia) to book your flight and redeeming your miles. Award Ticket can only be processed 4 (four) hours prior to departure at the latest. \nFor all intents and purposes this makes Garuda Indonesia an actual partner of Citi ThankYou Rewards, not merely a theoretical one. \n(HT: Lynn S. )",

      "text": "I did an online application for a Citi Aadvantage card. I haven't had one for 2 years and wanted to get the 50K AA bonus under the current offer. I have had many Citi cards over the last 25 years, have 1 Chase Ink cards, 1 Chase UA currently. I have a 775 credit score and am a high earner and high spender as I use the cards for my business.\n\nThe application was not instantly approved. I called after 24 hours to provide additional information. They still will not approve the card. They say they have to send me a letter verifying additional information but they won't tell me what info they need.\n\nI have never had this problem getting a credit card approved. it's like they really don't want my business. I was hoping to pay my property taxes with the card to get the bonus right away as it will put me over the $3000 spend in one transaction but I don't know if it will be approved before the end of the year.\n\nWhat's going on with this bank?
