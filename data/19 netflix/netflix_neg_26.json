Those wishing to use the latest feature must download the most recent version of the Netflix iOS or Netflix Android app. Click here for more details. \n\nNot all content will be immediately available for downloading, though Netflix announced more shows and movies will be available in the future. \nThe company did say Netflix original shows \"Orange is the New Black,\"\"Narcos\" and \"The Crown\" are available to start downloading. \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their \"Stranger Things\" binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,” Eddy Wu, Netflix’s director of product innovation, wrote in a blog post on Wednesday.

      "title": "Now, Netflix Users Can Watch Movies Offline on Their Mobile Devices",
      "text": " count=\"241\" data-total-count=\"241\"> Netflix announced on Wednesday that users worldwide can download some videos to their mobile devices instead of streaming them over cellular data, a feature that could keep eyeballs on the app when internet signals are spotty or unavailable. Users boarding an airplane, leaving on a road trip or ducking into the subway, for example, could use Wi-Fi to download their favorite movies and TV shows beforehand, then view them when the cellular signal dips out.\nNetflix said that initially, only some of the content in its library will be available offline via the feature, available in the latest version of its app on phones and tablets using iOS or Android. The company did not specify how many programs would become available for download later, saying only that there would be “more on the way.”\nEven in areas with strong cellular coverage, watching content offline would allow users to avoid depleting their monthly data limits, addressing a major frustration of mobile video, which eats up data ravenously.\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy Customers who watch only a limited amount of video before incurring overage fees with their cellular carriers are more likely to stop watching videos — an unpalatable option for media companies like Netflix that want to keep eyes glued to their products.\nAT&T also appears to have come to a similar conclusion. In announcing DirecTV Now , a television service that can be streamed on mobile devices, the company said on Monday that its cellular customers would be able to watch shows without that usage counting toward their monthly data limits.\n “The last thing you want to do when you’re binging or enjoying entertainment is trying to calculate how many gigs I’m using or where I am in my data plan,” Brad Bentley, AT&T’s chief marketing officer, said on Monday, referring to gigabytes of data.\nNetflix is not the first video streaming company to introduce the offline option. Amazon Video, one of Netflix’s biggest competitors, has made some videos available offline since September 2015 .\nHulu does not offer offline viewing, but Ben Smith, Hulu’s head of experience and a senior vice president, said on Tuesday that the company was working on it, according to CIO , an industry publication.\n“We’ll get there, for sure, in our industry,” he said.",

Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com , has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. Keep up with money news, sent   \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

      "text": "If there has been one major complaint regarding Netflix's service, it is that the streaming giant has not allowed users to download shows and movies for future viewing, a feature that is available on Amazon Prime. This, of course, means no watching Breaking Bad on the plane (without paying for internet access) and no binging Stranger Things when the power goes out (a terrifying endeavor, anyway).\nWell, Netflix has heard your complaints and has just announced that for no extra fee, users of the streaming service will be able to download select programs, starting immediately.\nHere's how to download Netflix titles for watching offline. For those that are looking to start downloading on Netflix immediately, make sure that you have updated to the most recent version of the streaming app. Once your app is updated, \"available for download\" should become an option.\nSo, go update the Netflix app on iOS and Android, and download away. Binging just got a whole lot easier. Check out some images below.\nA \"Download & Go\" window appears after you update the Netflix app. Source: Screenshot/Netflix These are all the titles currently available for download on Netflix. Source: Screenshot/Netflix\nLook for the download button and click it to start the process! Source: Screenshot/Netflix According to the press release, users can already start downloading shows like Orange is The New Black , Narcos and The Crown . If your favorite shows and movies are not yet available to download, do not fret, as Netflix has announced that they will be continuously rolling out new options.",

      "text": "The holidays are for family togetherness, eating tons of food, and binge-watching Netflix shows. (Or at least having their yule log playing constantly on the television.) Now, you can keep watching shows like The Crown , even on the bus ride to and from your parents' house. That's because Netflix is letting you download your favorite movies and TV shows, so you can watch them when you have no signal.\nThe company made the announcement on Twitter on Wednesday morning:\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8\n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 According to a company blog post , you can now go to the details page on a movie or show, and click the download button, so you can watch it later. Some titles are already available for download, and more will become available later. Downloads are now available for all plans, for no extra cost, but only for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. Just make sure you have the most recent update on the Netflix app.\nThe feature is similar to what is already available for Amazon Prime members. If you're a Prime subscriber, you can use the Amazon Video app to download select videos and TV shows to your phone or tablet, sometimes for a limited time, so you can watch while you lack signal or simply don't want to rack up data charges. But the Netflix announcement changes the game when it comes to the site's original series and movie catalog.\nThe Netflix app now has an \"Available for Download\" section that can help you find stuff to pre-install for your next long trip or subway commute. Though Gilmore Girls is weirdly not on there, Black Mirror , Stranger Things , and Orange Is the New Black are there for you when you need an escape from family.\nFrom: Marie Claire\n ",

      "text": "Netflix allows subscribers to binge-watch shows offline Reuters Posted at Dec 01 2016 07:12 AM \nShare Facebook The Netflix logo is shown in this illustration photograph in Encinitas, California October 14, 2014. Mike Blake, Reuters \nVideo streaming pioneer Netflix Inc has added an option that allows subscribers to download shows at no additional cost on their mobile device to watch without an internet connection. \nNetflix signaled in recent months it would add an offline viewing option to better compete as the streaming video market becomes more and more crowded. Amazon.com Inc’s rival streaming video service, Prime Video, has had this option for about a year. \nWhile the new option announced on Wednesday is available for all of Netflix’s subscribers, it could have greater appeal in international markets such as Africa and Asia, where internet service is less ubiquitous than it is in the United States. \nThe international market is becoming the main driver of growth for Netflix. Of their 86.7 million subscribers, 47.5 million of them come from the United States. \nGrowth among U.S. subscribers has slowed in 2016. Netflix added just 370,000 subscribers during the third quarter and only 4.3 million since the third quarter of last year, suggesting they are reaching a saturation point. \nIn that same time frame, Netflix has added 13.2 million international subscribers, including 3.2 million in the third quarter. Much of that has to do with Netflix’s expansion by more than 130 countries earlier this year to over 190 nations currently. China is a notable holdout. \nNot everything in Netflix’s vast library is available to download just yet, including the recently released “Gilmore Girls” revival. Currently available shows include Netflix-owned “Stranger Things,”“The Crown” and “Narcos” along with licensed shows and movies like “Parks and Recreation” and “Spotlight.” \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, wrote in a blog post. \nThe new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Alphabet Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS platforms, the company said. \nNetflix shares rose as much as 2.4 percent before it eased, up 0.1 percent to $117.62 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq. \nThe new option received widespread praise on social media Wednesday. \n“You can now download stuff off Netflix to watch without internet,” wrote Twitter user kt (@Katie_Ottaway_), “what did we do to deserve this miracle.” \n#NetflixOffline was also the top-trending hashtag on Twitter, worldwide. \n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru and Tim Baysinger and Amy Tennery in New York; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Jeffrey Benkoe) \nShare ",

      "text": "The opening scene in the third episode of Netflix's new \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" features Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ) and her daughter, Rory (Alexis Bledel) sitting by a pool in Stars Hollow, doing their usual quick banter. But the snappy dialogue turns obnoxious as they start mocking their fellow poolgoers.\n\"Belly alert,\" Lorelai mutters as an overweight man passes by. \"Holy moly,\" Rory echoes. They scoff at a woman in a bikini (\"Just go naked\") and then dub a heavy man in a Speedo \"Back Fat Pat.\" Meanwhile, people drop by to welcome Rory back to town, since she moved home after a rough patch in her journalism career. \"I'm not back!\" she repeatedly whines to her well-wishers, even though it sure looks like she's back for good.\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR \nThe scene exemplifies the worst parts of \"Gilmore Girls,\" the acclaimed WB series that ran from 2000 to 2007: Lorelai and Rory's banter that could turn cruel and grating; Rory's blindness to her unbelievable privilege; the main characters simply thinking they're better than everyone else. Already, viewers are calling out this particular scene: \"The 'Gilmore Girls' Fat-Shaming Scene Was Unnecessary.\"\"About The Body-Shaming On 'Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.'\"\"'Gilmore Girls' fans are dragging the revival for its 'cringe-worthy' fat-shaming.\")\nWhile every great TV series has its flaws, a major problem with TV reboots is that they often focus a glaring spotlight on all of the show's initial problems, which ultimately make for a subpar viewing experience - and threaten to tarnish the original series.\nMake no mistake, the highly-anticipated \"Gilmore Girls\" revival, which landed on Netflix the day after Thanksgiving, was thrilling to many fans, some of whom can't find a negative thing to say. But it has also garnered lots of criticism over the past several days, from diehard loyal viewers to people who never saw the original show but decided to watch the revival because of all the hype.\nThe main issues mostly involve Rory, who started the series as a quiet, brainy introvert who loved to read and didn't need a social life because her mother was her best friend. Eventually, she came out of her shell, and throughout the seven seasons, wound up in various romantic entanglements and career woes as she embarked on her dream to become a journalist. Rory's evolution was frustrating at times, especially because she never seemed to recognize how many advantages she had, thanks to her wealthy grandparents, and was often deemed \"special\" even if she didn't display extraordinary qualities.\nIn the revival, Rory, as many have pointed out, has become insufferable - a disappointment to the fans that used to look up to her. She cheats on her boyfriend, Paul (Jack Carpenter), and is embroiled in an affair with her college boyfriend, Logan (Matt Czuchry), who is engaged. Rory's career is in shambles and she can't land a full-time job. Multiple critics have pointed out that this is because she seems to be a terrible reporter, one who sleeps with a source and then doesn't prepare for a job interview at a website because she thinks she's too good for the position. (She doesn't get the job.) As one piece in The Washington Post sums it up, \"Rory Gilmore is a monster.\"\nOther complaints include the terrible Stars Hollow musical, which in the original series would be a quick scene; in the revival (which runs 90 minutes per episode), it's a 20-minute gag that goes on and on. Some people are upset about the infamous \"last four words\" of the show, in which Rory reveals her pregnancy and ends the series on an infuriating cliffhanger.\nA disappointing revival - or even one that doesn't live up to sky-high expectations - happens all the time: Just look at Season 4 of \"Arrested Development,\" or \"Fuller House,\" or even \"Heroes Reborn.\" Worst-case scenario, they result in fans' hesitation to re-watch the original series. After all, it might look different now that they know how the characters turn out in the future. Why get invested in Luke (Scott Patterson) and Lorelai's love story when they turn out to be such a boring couple?\nAnd forget potential viewers who were curious about all the publicity about the revival and decided to tune in - if they can't stand the reboot, there's no way they'll go back and watch the first seven seasons.\nTherein lies the conundrum of TV reboots. They're essentially fan service, so they're destined to alienate new viewers. But when the fans are also disappointed in the revival, then there's the risk of damaging the show that they loved all along.\nRELATED STORIES: \n10 questions we still have after the 'Gilmore Girls' revival \nRory Gilmore's long road to ... nowhere \n'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' review: Overstuffed, but warm and reassuring \n'Gilmore Girls': 7 must-watch episodes of the original series \nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.\nCopyright © 2016, Hartford Courant Lauren Graham",

      "text": "Video streaming pioneer Netflix Inc has added an option that allows subscribers to download shows at no additional cost on their mobile device to watch without an internet connection. Netflix signaled in recent months it would add an offline viewing option to better compete as the streaming video market becomes more and more crowded. Amazon.com Inc’s rival streaming video service, Prime Video, has had this option for about a year.\nWhile the new option announced on Wednesday is available for all of Netflix’s subscribers, it could have greater appeal in international markets such as Africa and Asia, where internet service is less ubiquitous than it is in the United States. The international market is becoming the main driver of growth for Netflix. Of their 86.7 million subscribers, 47.5 million of them come from the United States.\nGrowth among U.S. subscribers has slowed in 2016. Netflix added just 370,000 subscribers during the third quarter and only 4.3 million since the third quarter of last year, suggesting they are reaching a saturation point. In that same time frame, Netflix has added 13.2 million international subscribers, including 3.2 million in the third quarter. Much of that has to do with Netflix’s expansion by more than 130 countries earlier this year to over 190 nations currently. China is a notable holdout.\nNot everything in Netflix’s vast library is available to download just yet, including the recently released “Gilmore Girls” revival. Currently available shows include Netflix-owned “Stranger Things,” “The Crown” and “Narcos” along with licensed shows and movies like “Parks and Recreation” and “Spotlight.” “While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their ‘Stranger Things’ binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, wrote in a blog post.\nThe new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Alphabet Inc’s Android and Apple Inc’s iOS platforms, the company said. Netflix shares rose as much as 2.4 percent before it eased, up 0.1 percent to $117.62 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq. The new option received widespread praise on social media Wednesday.\n“You can now download stuff off Netflix to watch without internet,” wrote Twitter user kt (@Katie_Ottaway_), “what did we do to deserve this miracle.”\n#NetflixOffline was also the top-trending hashtag on Twitter, worldwide.\nReuters \nThe post Netflix starts allowing subscribers everywhere to watch a selection of content offline appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "  04:55 AM EST Netflix (NFLX) Attacks the Mobile Video World   Netflix (NFLX) Attacks the Mobile Video World Written by Ophir Gottlieb PREFACE Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) has made a powerful move to become mobile friendly, and the impetus is larger than you might have imagined. STORY Netflix is going after the fastest growing part of technology in the world that is mobile video, and it’s doing it aggressively. First, we start with the current success, then the next step: Netflix Inc is famously known for turning the world upside down by essentially killing of video rental services like Blockbuster. Then, Netflix went a step further, by essentially saving TV shows from cancellation through its streaming video on demand (SVOD) pivot. Most notable here was the revival of the what is now considered the most critically acclaimed show in television history, AMC’s ‘Breaking Bad.’ Here’s what the shows creator said several years ago: “I am grateful as hell for binge-watching. But I’m just as grateful for an entirely different company that I have no stake in whatsoever: Netflix. I don’t think you’d be sitting here interviewing me if it weren’t for Netflix. In its third season, Breaking Bad got this amazing nitrous-oxide boost of energy and general public awareness because of Netflix.\" Here is the broader theme of SVOD and its growth (via Statista): Now, while that looks like a great growth trajectory, there is a serious pivot happening in how people consume video, and Netflix Inc will not be left behind. THE FUTURE IS NOW It turns out, as a populace we are turning away from standard video consumption from a traditional television to going on line in a major way. Check out these next charts, starting with the average amount of time spent per day for U.S. adults with online video (via Statista): Next we go to weekly time spent watching online video for the United States (again, via Statista): And finally, the frequency of online video consumption is already at high levels (via Statista): Nearly two-thirds of the population in the United States watch online video at least weekly, with a third watching it daily. WHAT NETFLIX IS DOING Finally, here’s what Netflix Inc just announced surrounding mobile capabilities (emphasis added): “Netflix Inc has added an option that allows subscribers to download shows at no additional cost on their mobile device to watch without an internet connection.\" While this means airplane binge watching in the US is now a reality, Reuters’ Supantha Mukherjee, Tim Baysinger, and Amy Tennery wrote an article that went further than the obvious. Before we get to it, we note what CML Pro broke earlier this year – the Netflix international expansion: Earlier this year at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Netflix CEO Reed Hastings announced significantly expanded reach to 190 countries, making its Internet TV service available in 130 new markets. The bright green areas are the newest additions. But, many of these nations have poor or no internet connectivity, which is to say, almost everything is consumed over mobile connections. Now, Netflix Inc has stepped into the fray by enabling a feature to watch video on mobile even when its offline. Netflix said “The new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Alphabet Inc’s Android and Apple Inc’s iOS platforms.” This is a brilliant move into mobile that could propel Netflix adoption worldwide to much higher rates, in particular the enormous populations in India and the nations of Africa. The author has no position in Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).

      "text": "Posted November 30, 2016 10:34 pm Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access \nBy Michael Liedtke \nAssociated Press \nSAN FRANCISCO — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix’s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service’s decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its “Red” premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on HBO’s internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix’s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service’s most popular shows, including Orange Is The New Black , House of Cards , and Stranger Things , are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include Spotlight , this year’s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, Calif., company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix’s expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix’s steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix’s DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix’s DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

It’s the most popular today which is also now available in many countries around the globe. More videos are added to the library so you know you will not run out of things to watch. Of course, with those thousands of episodes and movies in the lineup, there’s now way you can watch all of them even if you are a self-confessed couch potato. \nTo make things better for members, Netflix has made an important change that will delight everyone who depend on the service to catch up on their shows. Streaming is convenient already because you can do it anytime and anywhere as long as there is Internet connection but watching them offline is way better for some people. Downloading content is now possible as an added feature that doesn’t require any extra payment. \nThis update means you can watch episodes of your favorite shows even when there is no Internet. In some areas where connection is limited or expensive, this will be much appreciated. Simply download the video and watch it later offline wherever. This is one change that many Netflix subscribers have been requesting for and we’re glad the company finally gave in. \nNot all movies and series are ready for download but most of the people’s favorites are available for both Android and iOS users among the Netflix members. To see this change, get the latest version of the Netflix app from the Google Play Store.",

      "text": "Netflix Finally Adds Offline Viewing By Chance Kinney · On November 30, 2016 \nIt’s not quite the Holy Grail of Netflix, but it’s close — an update to the iOS and Android Netflix apps is enabling downloads for offline viewing. There are plenty of restrictions, unsurprisingly, but it’s a step toward finally having Netflix on flights or ground-bound public transportation without running through your data cap in the span of hours. \nAt the outset, a handful of Netflix originals like Stranger Things , Orange is The New Black , Narcos and The Crown are available to be downloaded for offline viewing. Some Netflix originals have been left off the list, along with most other media produced by other companies — so no, Jessica Jones , Luke Cage , and Daredevil won’t be taking to the skies with you just yet. It’s possible in the future, but Netflix would have to get approval from other production houses individually. \nThe hurdles are there because downloading for offline use raises piracy fears. It’s clear that’s being treated as a concern — not only can shows and movies not be downloaded to a PC or Mac, they can’t be downloaded onto a phone’s Micro SD card, or any kind of easily transferable storage. So, while downloading for offline use is cool, don’t expect the tap to be opened fully for a long time to come, if it ever is.",

      "text": "The trailer for Netflix’s new science-investigation series, White Rabit Project, has finally climbed out of it’s hole. The series starring Mythbuster’s alums Kari Byron , Tory Belleci , and Grant Imahara is set to premiere at midnight on Dec 9th when all 10 episodes will become available. The trio will use their scientific and investigative skills to investigate events from pop culture, science, and history.\nUnder their microscope are topics as diverse as jailbreaks, superpower technology, heists and crazy world war two weapons. In each episode the hosts immerse themselves in experiments, builds and tests as they sleuth the truth behind these and other well googled themes. In the trailer we get glimpses of some of the things they’ll be investigating, including the daring jail escape of Pascal Payet, and the air robbery of D.B. Cooper. There’s also a scene of Kari sexing a cockroach, and if nothing else, we’ve got to find out what context that comes from.\nIn speaking with Imahara on what it was like to get to work with the others again on the new series, he said, “It was great getting the band back together again. One of the great things about working with a team for so long is that it felt like almost no time had passed. We were back in the zone on day one.”\nIf that’s the case it’ll be a real treat to get to see them all in action once again – investigating through science and blowing stuff up. Plus with that cover image of Kari on the video below, don’t you want to see what happens when she pulls the trigger? (I think it’s a net-throwing gun, but am kind of hoping it’s a plasma rifle that they’ve cobbled together)",

      "text": "2016 5 Netflix Movies To Watch The Second Thanksgiving Is Over Holiday music starts playing the instant the turkey is eaten. Why not prepare your Netflix queue? Netflix November 30, 2016 T he second Thanksgiving ends, Christmas lights go up and holiday music begins to flow ubiquitously. Even if you’re not standing anywhere near speakers, it will somehow find its way to you. Depending on what kind of person you are, you either enjoy this or find it tiresome. But whether or not you’re looking to get into the holiday spirit, Netflix is currently streaming a perfect mixture of classics and movies that are generally heartwarming. Whether your a holiday enthusiast or a scrooge, there’s something for everyone in this selection. In particular, check out these five. 1. Amelie If you’re not necessarily looking for a full-on holiday flick — not in the mood for It’s A Wonderful Life or Miracle on 34th Street — but you want to dip your toes into the vibe, start with Amelie . Don’t listen to what the nearest French person says, it’s a pure delight. It combines warmth, whimsey, magic, and pretty much everything but goddamn unicorns. Not only does it work, it’s got a killer soundtrack to boot. 2. Love Actually This might be a controversial opinion, but Love Actually is not good at all. Why is it on this list, then? Firstly because many consider it a holiday classic, so there’s a chance you might. But second and most importantly, the movie’s existence is justified for Bill Nighy’s fabulously unhinged turn as a washed-up self-important rock star. Even if a Love Actually grinch can enjoy his performance. 3. Scrooged You could spend your holidays watching A Christmas Carol for the fiftieth time, or instead you could watch Bill Murray’s madcap take on the famous tale. Elf might not be on Netflix at the moment, but give this film a shot. 4. Hot Fuzz Like Amelie , Hot Fuzz is not strictly a holiday movie. But its idyllic small-town setting — give or take a handful of grisly murders — and its cozy yet labyrinthine plot creates a surprisingly perfect movie for watching with a mug of hot chocolate and a fire crackling in the background. 5. White Christmas Because you’ll hear the song everywhere anyway, for the next few weeks. You might as well watch it in context. The holiday atmosphere is here to stay for the next month. Whether you enjoy it or not, you might as well curl up and add it to your Netflix and Chill schedule.",

It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its “Red” premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on HBO’s internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nNot all of the selections in Netflix’s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service’s most popular shows, including “Orange Is The New Black,” ”House of Cards,” and “Stranger Things,” are now available to watch offline.\nDownloadable movies include “Spotlight,” this year’s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix’s expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix’s steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix’s DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix’s DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com , has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection.

      "text": "There haven't been too many times over its history that Netflix's ( NFLX ) streaming services have had to play catch-up to rivals, or (the Qwikster debacle excluded) where the company had to backtrack on a position it had dug its heels on. But Wednesday was an exception, and the company likely has Amazon's ( AMZN ) popularity and slew of emerging markets service launches to thank for it.\nAbout two years after a Netflix exec said offline viewing support is \"never going to happen\" for his company's services, the streaming giant announced on Wednesday it's adding the feature , courtesy of updated versions of its iOS and Android apps. Users can download movies and shows for offline viewing at either \"standard\" or \"higher\" resolutions.\nOnly a fraction of Netflix's popular material is currently available -- the company needs to have a licensing deal in place with a given rights holder that allows for downloads -- but there's arguably enough to satisfy most users interested in the feature. Hit Netflix original shows such as House of Cards , Stranger Things and Narcos are covered, as are popular third-party shows such as Breaking Bad , Dexter , Mad Men and Twin Peaks . Covered movies include Pulp Fiction , Good Will Hunting , Trainspotting and Jaws .\nUsers of Amazon's Prime Video, which is bundled with Prime subscriptions, are likely aware the service has long supported offline viewing for a chunk of its library. The fact Amazon's Prime user base has soared probably isn't lost on Netflix -- research firm CIRP estimated Prime had 63 million Prime members in the U.S. alone as of June, up from 44 million a year earlier.\nNetflix also likely acutely aware that Amazon is aggressively upping its video spend on both originals and licensed material; during its third quarter earnings call , Amazon said its spending on video content and marketing is expected to nearly double annually in the second half of 2016.",

By Michael Passalacqua \nNetflix will now let you download select titles for offline viewing on iOS and Android devices. \nThe new feature will be offered at no additional cost and can be used by clicking on the download button on the details page of select titles. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" said Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation. A look at the new feature, via Netflix Although a full list of titles with the download feature wasn't given, Netflix did reveal that popular shows like the aforementioned Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black, Narcos, and The Crown are all available for download today, with \"more on the way.\"\nThe service didn't shed light on when new downloadable titles will be available, or whether eventually all its content will be available on the move. \nIn the past, Netflix has been against offline viewing capabilities for users, but expressed interest in the feature earlier this year. Amazon Prime Video has offered offline viewing since last year. \nMichael Passalacqua is a freelance writer for IGN. Chat with him on Twitter about the New York Giants’ unsurprising mediocrity.",

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access Associated Press Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) \nSAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix’s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service’s decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its “Red” premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on HBO’s internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix’s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service’s most popular shows, including “Orange Is The New Black,” ”House of Cards,” and “Stranger Things,” are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include “Spotlight,” this year’s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix’s expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix’s steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix’s DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix’s DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

CST November 30, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST As the temperature drops, it gets harder and harder to find excuses to leave your couch. Netflix has another great reason to stay in: Plenty of new original series coming in December. As the streaming service loses a few classics, including \"Top Gun\" and \"American Beauty,\" its making way for debuts of shows including a movie inspired by Barack Obama (\"Barry\") an animated comedy (\"Pacific Heat\"), political thriller (\"Fauda\") and a science show with some former members of the MythBusters team (\"White Rabbit Project\".) Also on the way: Season 2 of \"Fuller House,\"\"Captain America: Civil War,\" and a Reggie Watts comedy special, before 2017 brings new Dave Chappelle shows . Here's the full list of content landing in December (and to see what was added/eliminated for November, go here ):",

      "text": "Image source: Netflix.\nYou no longer need a healthy internet connection to binge on Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) . The top dog in premium streaming video announced that offline viewing is now available for some of its content through its Netflix app for Android and iOS phones and tablets. The ability to download video to watch later is being made available at no additional cost.\nNetflix isn't a trailblazer on that front. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) introduced offline viewing for select content on Android and iOS mobile devices two summers ago. It took a shot at Netflix at the time.\n\"Amazon Video is the only online subscription streaming video service that enables downloads of titles, meaning unlike other subscription streaming services such as Netflix, Prime members can enjoy movies and TV shows as part of their membership even when they don't have an Internet connection available,\" Amazon's press release read 14 months ago.\n We can't even say that the move comes as a surprise. Industry insiders were rumbling about this happening earlier this year.\nOffering offline streaming of select shows on mobile app devices doesn't seem like a game changer. It'll help the next time you're going on a flight and don't want to spring for pricey Wi-Fi, but no one's going to cancel the service because they could't download a few episodes of The Crown ahead of a cabin retreat. If Netflix wants to copy Amazon's practices, the real gem has to be pay-per-stream.\n ",

      "text": "The days of being stuck on an airplane with only the in-flight movie to keep you occupied are over. Netflix will allow users of its streaming service to save certain movies and TV shows onto mobile devices for offline viewing.\nThe new feature, announced today (Nov. 30) and available now via an update to its iOS and Android apps, means you can fill your tablet or smartphone with things to watch during your commute, flights and other situations where streaming high-res video doesn't work well.\nCredit: Diabluses / Shutterstock.com \nThe majority of the programs available to save for offline viewing are Netflix Originals such as Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black and Luke Cage. The non-Netflix Original content available to stream ranges from TV shows such as The Office and Friday Night Lights and films such as Moonrise Kingdom, Love Actually and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\nMORE: Best Streaming Video Services \nTo see everything that's available to save for offline, tap the menu button at the top left corner and select Available for Download . Saving a video for later is rather simple, as you just need to navigate to content and tap the Download button . \nUsers don't need to worry about any additional fees for downloaded video, as this option is available at no extra cost to all streaming subscribers, no matter their plan. We hope Netflix keeps it that way.\n\nThe addition of offline streaming puts Netflix on par with competitors including Amazon Instant Video, Hulu and Vudu, as well as YouTube Red. It also gives device owners a reason to think about buying a higher capacity tablet or smartphone when it comes time to upgrade.\n\nSee Also : Best Gifts for Cordcutters \nOur Favorite Streaming Media Players and Sticks Netflix Hidden Gems: Best Shows and Movies You've Missed Our Favorite Soundbars for Small and Big TVs About the author Henry T.

      "text": "1 \nIn other Trek media news, Netflix has released a long-awaited offline viewing mode for many of their streaming titles, allowing users to download compressed versions of their catalog without an active data connection – and all six Star Trek television series have been included in their downloadable listings. \nNew updates released today for Android and iOS versions of the Netflix app have launched this functionality in the United States – and presumably other regions, though we’ve not tested outside of the USA. The updated Android app, featuring the new Netflix video download option. \nIf you’re a regular visitor to TrekCore, you know we’re huge proponents of physical media – we love our remastered Blu-rays and the DVD editions of the other Trek selections, and of course Netflix doesn’t include the dozens of hours of bonus material or audio commentary tracks – but this will surely be a convenience for those of you wanting to binge on the Roddenberry universe without running up your mobile bill.

      "text": "Netflix Allows Viewers to Download Content for Offline Use Moving beyond a streaming-only model December 1, 2016 | Advertising & Marketing | Video Share Print \nNetflix has updated its mobile app to allow subscribers to download videos and watch them offline. The new feature reflects intense competition in the subscription video-on-demand space, as platforms race to add features to match or beat rivals. \nThe move comes on the heels of AT&T’s entrance into the growing streaming TV market . The carrier is offering consumers a $35 a month package of more than 100 channels via its DirecTV Now service. The over-the-top (OTT) market is expected to get even more crowded as other players like Hulu and YouTube unveil new services next year. \nNetflix’s new feature is fairly simple. Once subscribers download the latest update, they can click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and watch it later without an internet connection. The app also has a separate “Available for Download” page where users can access the video content. Currently, the selection available is limited, and most of the choices are Netflix’s own original content like “Orange is the New Black” and “Stranger Things.” The company says more content will be offered in the near future. \nThe download feature is already available on some SVOD platforms, but not all. YouTube Red and Amazon’s Prime Video, for example, offer limited content available for download. \neMarketer estimates that 70.4% of US internet users watch videos via over-the-top services, with relatively little growth forecast for the next few years. But that reflects the fact that the measure covers a wide range of platforms, particularly YouTube, making it difficult for overall penetration levels to grow. eMarketer estimates that 67.3% of internet users are YouTube viewers, while 44.9% of internet users are Netflix viewers.

      "text": "Share Tweet \nThe law of averages suggests that the more jokes a comedy makes, the fewer laughs each individual goof will get. Netflix’s new Australian import Pacific Heat manages to apply a sort of comedic theory of relativity to that premise, delivering what feels like an infinite number of gags in its interminable 22-minute run time, and somehow managing to not let a single one of them be good. \nThe animated series—originally broadcast on Australia’s The Comedy Channel—centers on an undercover police unit operating on Australia’s Gold Coast, tasked with stopping drug dealers, international terrorists, and other paint-by-number espionage plots. The show’s creator, Santo Cilauro, has answered criticisms of the show’s style—and its liberal surface similarities to another series about wisecracking, idiotic secret agents —by saying that he’s never really watched much Archer . Maybe he should: If some of that long-running FX series’ care for its characters, dedication to style, and sense of restraint rubbed off on Pacific Heat , it might ascend from “garbage” up into the relatively classier world of “refuse.” \nThe show’s characters all have names, but they don’t matter, any more than its bare-bones plots. There’s Dumb Guy (co-writer Rob Sitch), Dumber Guy (Cilauro), Ditzy Girl (Lucia Mastrantone), and that old comedy stand-by, The Nag (Rebecca Massey). Together, they sleepwalk through long, meandering conversations and the occasional explosion, never letting enough air slip into the dialogue for anyone to breathe. Sitch is burdened with the hardest job of all as the show’s main character, Todd, attempting to wring some kind of comedy out of a dim-witted sociopath with a tendency to run every joke so thoroughly into the ground that they wind up emerging in Duluth. \nSitch has been funny in other things. He’s the creator of the Aussie sitcom Utopia —not to be confused with the cultishly adored British sci-fi series of the same name, or the short-lived Fox reality series—where his character had a point of view and intelligence that are entirely absent here. There’s nothing inherently wrong with amoral characters in a comedy—the aforementioned folks at FX have managed to build an entire brand out of them —but Pacific Heat ’s bland ciphers have no definable traits, only a willingness to queue up for the next rapid-fire quip. And maybe it’s some quirk of the audio engineering, or the Australian accents, but it feels like every line is dryly mumbled by a cast that can only barely keep itself awake. \nHave we mentioned that it’s ugly, too? The animation is stiff, the action scenes are listless, and every character looks like they were drawn by someone whose only reference to human anatomy was one of those old How To Draw Manga Characters books. That doesn’t stop the plots—a drug deal in the first episode reviewed, and a terrorist caper in the second—from finding excuses to strip the female characters to their underwear, to ostensibly titillating effect. \nOutside of confused Archer fans, or adult-oriented cartoon aficionados who’ve already burned their way through BoJack Horseman , F Is For Family , Family Guy , Futurama , American Dad , South Park , Brickleberry —yes, Brickleberry —and all 600 extant episodes of The Simpsons , it’s impossible to figure out who Netflix acquired this series for. It’s visually unpleasant. The jokes make up in repetition what they lack in elegance or wit. And the dialogue doesn’t just flirt with racism: Occasionally, it takes racism to bed and makes sweet, discomfiting love to it. Pacific Heat is a bad show, but a worse comedy. In 44 minutes—and roughly 200 or so jokes—it didn’t elicit a single laugh. Find something else to watch—it’s not like Pacific Heat is hurting for companions in Netflix’s “Adult Animated TV Comedies” category. \nCreated by: Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, and Rob Sitch Starring: Rob Sitch, Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Rebecca Massey, Lucia Mastrantone Debuts: December 2 on Netflix Format: Half-hour animated comedy",

      "text": "Comment Teaser image for Netflix's ''Longmire'' series. YouTube / Netflix U.S. & Canada \nAs with any other good rumor out there (or basically, any rumor, in fact), you should always take it with a pinch of salt -- and so the same applies when it comes to news or word concerning the sixth season of the TV series Longmire that is currently shown on Netflix. Basically, Longmire Season 6 is an on-off affair with nothing concrete surrounding the renewal of the TV series, even with whispers of Robert Taylor actually asking for a spin off in order to make things more juicy. While many viewers out there would like to see the Longmire series head into season 6, fan power alone might not be enough to see it through -- and it does not help ease the suspense and tension either, that the producers as well as showrunners of Longmire failed to divulge any details concerning a possible spin off or renewal information. \nStill, as the fat lady has not sung just yet, why not check out what are some of the possible story arcs that might just make its way into Longmire Season 6? While it would be difficult for any person to arrive at the end of a particular project, especially if it has played a major role in one’s life, all good things must eventually come to an end. Actors and actresses might find life after Longmire to be a tough journey, but that is a different story for another day. \nWhispers have been going around that Robert Taylor and Katee Sackhoff, the main stars of the Longmire series, might be under fire -- with Netflix mulling over the cancellation of the TV series some time down the road. Other rumors claim that Longmire Season 6 has been given the green light to go ahead, and in the final season, viewers might have expectations that a new romantic relationship will be part of the excitement as the story unfolds further, exploring the different aspects of life in various characters. \nWalt will most probably see additional challenges in Longmire Season 6, and with speculation of Walt and Vic’s budding romance, there might be wedding bells by the time the series comes to an end. However, there might be a bump (in more ways than one) in their relationship, as Vic happens to be pregnant with somebody else’s child -- and not Walt’s, while Walt is free from his previous relationship. Could this love child be a stumbling block between the blossoming love of the couple? If so, how will the two come about to overcome this challenge should they decide to finally walk down the aisle? \nLet us turn back the clocks a bit to jog our memories. Vic was a victim in Season 5 of Longmire, resulting in her being pregnant. Will she continue to carry the baby in her to full term, or will she decide to go ahead with an abortion? This should be a question that ought to be answered in Longmire Season 6, and it remains to be seen just what kind of reaction that Walt will have to this particular bit of news. ",

      "text": "Netflix's Ted Sarandos Sticks Up for Network Neutrality Amid Repeal Concerns Updated: November 30, 2016 — 8:16 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Debra Birnbaum \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos spoke out in support of the FCC's network neutrality policy Wednesday as speculation swirls that the policy could be repealed during the presidency of Donald Trump. \n\"This is an unpredictable new administration, for sure,\" said Sarandos at the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce's state of the entertainment industry conference in Los Angeles. \"The decision to preserve net neutrality that President Obama came to was based on the public good. It's politically popular. It serves the public good.\" \nSarandos' comments follow weeks of speculation that the Trump administration could engineer a reversal of the FCC's policy on network neutrality, which prevents Internet service providers like Comcast from favoring or impeding the streams that flow through its distribution pipes from content providers like Netflix. \nSarandos also questioned the motives of future FCC commissioners. \"Some of the people that are being batted around for FCC -- people are concerned that they have personal interest in not having net neutrality,\" he said. \"It's a really inefficient way to advance your personal initiatives to get into government. You can be much more effective outside.\" \nSarandos didn't specify which potential appointees he was referring to but he was alluding to economists Jeff Eisenach and Mark Jamison, who Trump recently tapped to review FCC policies as part of the president-elect's transition team. Both men, who have worked as consultants to Verizon and Sprint, respectively, have publicly opposed network neutrality and are reportedly to be under consideration for FCC commissioners under a Trump administration. Trump hasn't spoken out recently against network neutrality, though he tweeted criticism of President Obama over it years ago. \nNetflix is among several tech giants that have been vocal proponents of network neutrality in the past in order to prevent ISPs from either degrading the company's streams or giving preferential treatment to other streaming services. CEO Reed Hastings has taken on ISPs like AT&T and Comcast, to which Netflix could find itself shouldering increased payments known as interconnection fees if network neutrality is repealed. \nWhile other analysts have suggested there is some upside for Netflix in such a scenario, such as reduced competition from other content providers, fears on Wall Street of a negative impact sent the Los Gatos, Calif.,-based company's stock down in the weeks after the election, while share prices for cable ISPs rose. \nEarlier this year, a federal appeals court upheld the rules pushed through by current FCC commissioner Tom Wheeler classifying broadband providers as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act. But Wheeler may not stick around during the Trump administration, which could reclassify ISPs under Title I or make other moves that would essentially neuter net neutrality. \nWho will be joining the FCC next year is unclear until Wheeler discloses his plans, which is factoring into delays in the confirmation of another FCC commissioner, Jessica Rosenworcel. \nSarandos made his comments in a keynote interview with Variety co-editor-in-chief Andrew Wallenstein at the conference, where Sarandos was presented with the Chamber of Commerce's \"Commitment to California\" award. \nThe executive also talked about Netflix's strategy as a studio, given its planned expansion to 1,000 hours of programming for 2017, as compared to its competition. He emphasized that the studio won't be creating series for any other outlet. \n\"We're not going to build out the Netflix studio to make content for other people,\" he said. \"We're going to build it as an internal efficiency in how to make the best shows for Netflix for our subscribers around the world.\" \nSarandos argued that the usual practice of studios creating series for others was an inherent conflict. \"We're not looking not to make shows we don't own,\" he said, \"[But] we want to buy the content that is the best storytelling.\" One example of that is the recent series \"Gilmore Girls,\" which is owned by Warner Bros. TV. \nAt the event, Sarandos was presented with the award by Drew Barrymore, star of Netflix's upcoming series \"The Santa Clarita Diet,\" for its upcoming move to expansive new office space in Hollywood in January. \"We're not just going to live and work here. We're going to shoot here,\" said Sarandos. \nHe reported the streaming service has filmed 10 features and 16 scripted series in California this year. \"Beyond tax credits, the reason we like to do it is the magic,\" he said. \"The notion that when you call out for talent, most of the people that are going to be ready with a great experience, you're much assured of that in Hollywood.\" \nBarrymore praised Netflix for offering her the opportunity to film in her home state. \"It was the best writing I'd seen in so long, and you brought me back to California,\" she said of the series. \"And you built your studios here!\" Published: November 30, 2016 — 7:41 PM EST | Updated: November 30, 2016 — 8:16 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

CST November 30, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST As the temperature drops, it gets harder and harder to find excuses to leave your couch. Netflix has another great reason to stay in: Plenty of new original series coming in December. As the streaming service loses a few classics, including \"Top Gun\" and \"American Beauty,\" its making way for debuts of shows including a movie inspired by Barack Obama (\"Barry\") an animated comedy (\"Pacific Heat\"), political thriller (\"Fauda\") and a science show with some former members of the MythBusters team (\"White Rabbit Project\".) Also on the way: Season 2 of \"Fuller House,\"\"Captain America: Civil War,\" and a Reggie Watts comedy special, before 2017 brings new Dave Chappelle shows . Here's the full list of content landing in December (and to see what was added/eliminated for November, go here ):",

      "text": "For all the fanfare and fuss, Netflix's Gilmore Girls revival has been met with mixed feelings. Some die-hards love it purely for the sake of seeing the show's lead characters Lorelai and Rory speaking at hyper-speed once again, others are less convinced. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life has been criticised for how some of the characters develop. *SPOILER ALERT...* For instance, take-out loving TV-fiend Lorelai finds happiness in nature, brainiac journalist Rory fails to show essential reporting skills and matriarch Emily losing her airs and graces and becoming easy-going. All very unlikely pills to swallow for dedicated fans of the show. But star Lauren Graham does not want to hear it. She's covering her ears and eyes and just enjoying being back on screen. During a panel discussion hosted by SAG-AFTRA in New York on Tuesday night, Graham said: \"We don't pay attention to anything... we don't know. None of us are on the internet, almost at all. \"So I know what you mean, but the show has a sense of humour, and that's its sense of humour.\" On the topic of Rory and how unlikely her relationship with the infinitely forgettable Paul is, she explained: \"I think maybe it feels a little different. Rory's not in high school anymore, so yes, as grown women constantly forgetting… I just thought it was a funny runner. \"But the whole show has a kind of heightened theatrical quality. I mean, just like Donald Trump, don't take it literally. But unlike that, to me it was more of a metaphor for, this isn't the right guy, and this is how they communicate about it, and does it go 10 steps too far? \"I don't know, but it was 90 minutes. We had a lot of time to fill.\" Scott Patterson, who pays Luke Danes, added: \"Paul was a sacrificial lamb, and he knew it! The audience knew it!\" Rory actress Alexis Bledel chipped in: \"I think I'm always trying to understand where Rory's coming from in the choices she makes in her romantic life, because she's so together and so successful in everything she does, really, until these episodes start. \"But she's just so hardworking, and I think it's an interesting part of her character, but one that I've always struggled to understand. She always kind of picks people who are very different from one another and who challenge her, fortunately, but who don't necessarily bring out the best in her.\" And Kelly Bishop, who plays Emily Gilmore, defended her character's development tool. \"In the first seven years, never — and this is the most amazing thing about Amy Sherman-Palladino — I never had a moment where I thought, 'She wouldn't say that',\" she expained. \"Now strange things start happening to Emily, as you might have noticed, which is really fun, because she was so severe and so structured… Now this character is going off in a very wild way.\" Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is available to watch on Netflix now.

Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 — Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nNetflix has been signaling it would add a downloading option in recent months, as a way to continue increasing its subscriber base and match video-streaming rival Amazon.com Inc. Offline viewing will make Netflix shows more accessible to customers around the world, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa. \nShares of the Los Gatos, California-based company rose as much as 2.4 percent to $120.37 in New York Wednesday. \nNetflix has 86.7 million customers worldwide, 47.5 million of whom live in the U.S. The company now relies on international markets for most of its growth, and earlier this year expanded its footprint to the entire world, save for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea. “While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their ‘Stranger Things’ binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,” said Eddy Wu, Netflix’s director of product innovation, in a web post. As part of an update to Netflix’s mobile app, a “download and watch later” icon will now appear for subscribers below program information. \nThe new feature is included at no extra charge in all plans and available on both Alphabet Inc.’s Android and Apple Inc.’s iOS platforms, the company said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. ",

      "text": "Netflix don't release viewing figures for their shows. It sends a bold, confident message that they care about art rather than commerce. Which is rubbish, of course. Obviously they care about the bottom line, they have shareholders like everyone else. They just don't think it's anyone else's business how well individual shows are doing, because subscribers (86 million worldwide and counting) don't buy individual shows, they buy into the whole service, a month at a time. That drives media types, ourselves included, absolutely mad with curiosity. Fortunately for us, a startup company called Symphony AM does something highly technical with audio-recognition matrixes on individual devices across a panel of volunteers (much like the old-fashioned rating system does with televisions) and this month provided The Wrap with figures purporting to represent Netflix's biggest successes. Specifically, how many viewers each of Netflix's original series got over their first three days in 2016. It's worth noting that Netflix themselves have called Symphony AM's figures \"remarkably inaccurate\", but we're going to report them anyway – with that caveat – because there's no one else out there giving even plausible figures for Netflix and we're nosy. So, in reverse order for added suspense, here is the Netflix top ten for 2016, to be taken with a pinch of salt… 10. F Is For Family – 1,463,000 viewers An animated comedy about a suburban family, centred around its irascible dad. Before you can say Simpsons, Family Guy, American Dad, King of the Hill or even The Flintstones, forget the familiarity of the genre: it's set in the '70s and has the likes of Justin Long, Laura Dern and Sam Rockwell in its voice cast. 9. Wet Hot American Summer: First Day Of Camp – 1,595,000 viewers A prequel to the cult comedy Wet Hot American Summer, it stars the likes of Paul Rudd, Kirsten Wiig and Janeane Garofalo as teen summer camp counsellors, even though they're really obviously in their forties. 8. Marvel's Jessica Jones – 1,967,000 viewers The everyday adventures of a New York city detective girl with PTSD, super strength and a grudge the size of Manhattan against David Tennant's supernaturally persuasive villain. The first of Netflix's partnerships with Marvel, they pretty much hit it out of the park from the off. 7. House Of Cards season four – 2,320,000 viewers House Of Cards was Netflix's first ever original series and could arguably take credit for the network's early success. By Season 4, fans were hooked to the tale of devilishly manipulative politician Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey). 6. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt season two – 2,340,000 viewers Like a walking, talking bag of pick-and-mix, the relentlessly joyful and primary-coloured Kimmy (Ellie Kemper) returned for more comedic misunderstandings and vicious satire dressed up in pink denim, as scripted by Tina Fey. 5. Stranger Things – 2,986,000 viewers The one everyone was talking about – a glorious homage to '80s teen sci-fi and horror, featuring amazing child actors, genuine suspense, lens flare, night-time BMX rides and Matthew Modine sporting David Cronenberg hair. 4. Marvel's Daredevil season two – 3,201,000 viewers The further adventures of Matt Murdock, blind superhero, saw the introduction of comicbook favourites Elektra and Frank Castle, aka The Punisher, to much critical applause. 3. Marvel's Luke Cage – 3,388,000 viewers The most recent fruit of Netflix's relationship with Marvel is a bruising trip through Harlem's history and culture in the company of invulnerable black superhero Luke Cage. 2. Orange Is The New Black season four – 5,843,000 viewers One of Netflix's earliest hits (it launched five months after House Of Cards), OINTB began as a black comedy grounded in the experiences of a white, middle-class woman in prison. It quickly hit its stride by celebrating voices rarely heard on TV: black women, latina women, gay women, transgender women… By season four, it stepped the drama up to new levels with a series of tragic deaths. 1. Fuller House – 7,330,000 viewers Who'd have thought it? Netflix's most popular show is the most traditional, conservative sitcom on their books. A reboot of the '80s comedy Full House – and aimed squarely at the nostalgia market – it sees the daughter of the original family return to her house to raise her three sons with the help of her sister and best friend when her husband unexpectedly dies. (A mirror of the original premise, where her dad's brother and friend helped raise his three daughters. AKA Three Men and Three Babies.) Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

      "text": "November 30, 2016 1:12 PM Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access FILE - In this Friday, Jan. 17, 2014, file photo, a person displays Netflix on a tablet in North Andover, Mass. Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. Elise Amendola, File AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story SAN FRANCISCO \nNetflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\"\"House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

      "text": "by Kevin Bruce Francisco · December 1, 2016 \nOnline streaming service Netflix has just announced that its subscribers can now enjoy their favorite movies and series even on-the-go by downloading them free of charge. \nBasically, you just have to look for the Download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection. As of the time of writing, not every single title from their library is ready for download but the company says there is “more on the way”. Some of the big titles that are already available for download are Narcos, Orange is the New Black, and The Crown. \nTo be able to download, just update your Netflix app to the latest version. This new feature is included in all plans and is ready for phones and tablets on Android and iOS.",

Williams said female athletes should receive the same pay as their male counterparts, and encouraged women to dream big: “Women have to break down many barriers on the road to success. One of those barriers is the way we are constantly reminded we are not men, as if it is a flaw.” She noted that she is referred to as one of the “world’s greatest female athletes,” while stars like LeBron James, Tiger Woods and Roger Federer are just referred to as “the best.” \nLove @serenawilliams for continually putting these messages out there. #SocialResponsibility #GameChanger #Pioneer #Legacy https://t.co/4xOLcTYB9s \n— Anna Kessel (@Anna_Kessel) November 30, 2016 \n\nRejoice — Netflix is now available off-line. \n\nGetty Images Airplane mode.

      "text": "For years, binge-watching your favourite shows has been a streamable struggle. What if you were forced to watch on the fly, or subjected to the middling internet connection of a hotel? Well, in the past, that meant no more Netflix — leaving you open to spoilers of shows like Black Mirror, House of Cards and Narcos. But the streaming giant is finally, really, actually about to put an end to buffering, announcing on Wednesday that users will be free to download select movies and TV shows for offline playback. Woo! Related: How to delete your embarrassing Netflix history Users have craved the feature for years, with rumours initially swirling back in June before Netflix's Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos hinted at the idea earlier this month. Like with anything in this life, though, it's not all as perfect as it seems. Offline playback won't be available for all content. Currently, Netflix has only said that \"many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way\". Stories so good, you want to take them everywhere. Download some of your favourite shows on Netflix and binge on the go. pic.twitter.com/d6Y7gm9m6l — Netflix UK &amp; Ireland (@NetflixUK) November 30, 2016 This is obviously subjective, but with original content like Orange is the New Black, Stranger Things and The Crown all up for offline grabs, early signs are positive. If you want to get in on the fun, you can download content for offline playback on iOS and Android after an app update. We made it, people. Now go forth and bask in the glory of a buffer-less world.

      "text": "The opening scene in the third episode of Netflix's new \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" features Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ) and her daughter, Rory (Alexis Bledel) sitting by a pool in Stars Hollow, doing their usual quick banter. But the snappy dialogue turns obnoxious as they start mocking their fellow poolgoers.\n\"Belly alert,\" Lorelai mutters as an overweight man passes by. \"Holy moly,\" Rory echoes. They scoff at a woman in a bikini (\"Just go naked\") and then dub a heavy man in a Speedo \"Back Fat Pat.\" Meanwhile, people drop by to welcome Rory back to town, since she moved home after a rough patch in her journalism career. \"I'm not back!\" she repeatedly whines to her well-wishers, even though it sure looks like she's back for good.\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\nThe scene exemplifies the worst parts of \"Gilmore Girls,\" the acclaimed WB series that ran from 2000 to 2007: Lorelai and Rory's banter that could turn cruel and grating; Rory's blindness to her unbelievable privilege; the main characters simply thinking they're better than everyone else. Already, viewers are calling out this particular scene: \"The 'Gilmore Girls' Fat-Shaming Scene Was Unnecessary.\"\"About The Body-Shaming On 'Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.'\"\"'Gilmore Girls' fans are dragging the revival for its 'cringe-worthy' fat-shaming.\")\nWhile every great TV series has its flaws, a major problem with TV reboots is that they often focus a glaring spotlight on all of the show's initial problems, which ultimately make for a subpar viewing experience - and threaten to tarnish the original series.\nMake no mistake, the highly-anticipated \"Gilmore Girls\" revival, which landed on Netflix the day after Thanksgiving, was thrilling to many fans, some of whom can't find a negative thing to say. But it has also garnered lots of criticism over the past several days, from diehard loyal viewers to people who never saw the original show but decided to watch the revival because of all the hype.\nThe main issues mostly involve Rory, who started the series as a quiet, brainy introvert who loved to read and didn't need a social life because her mother was her best friend. Eventually, she came out of her shell, and throughout the seven seasons, wound up in various romantic entanglements and career woes as she embarked on her dream to become a journalist. Rory's evolution was frustrating at times, especially because she never seemed to recognize how many advantages she had, thanks to her wealthy grandparents, and was often deemed \"special\" even if she didn't display extraordinary qualities.\nIn the revival, Rory, as many have pointed out, has become insufferable - a disappointment to the fans that used to look up to her. She cheats on her boyfriend, Paul (Jack Carpenter), and is embroiled in an affair with her college boyfriend, Logan (Matt Czuchry), who is engaged. Rory's career is in shambles and she can't land a full-time job. Multiple critics have pointed out that this is because she seems to be a terrible reporter, one who sleeps with a source and then doesn't prepare for a job interview at a website because she thinks she's too good for the position. (She doesn't get the job.) As one piece in The Washington Post sums it up, \"Rory Gilmore is a monster.\"\nOther complaints include the terrible Stars Hollow musical, which in the original series would be a quick scene; in the revival (which runs 90 minutes per episode), it's a 20-minute gag that goes on and on. Some people are upset about the infamous \"last four words\" of the show, in which Rory reveals her pregnancy and ends the series on an infuriating cliffhanger.\nA disappointing revival - or even one that doesn't live up to sky-high expectations - happens all the time: Just look at Season 4 of \"Arrested Development,\" or \"Fuller House,\" or even \"Heroes Reborn.\" Worst-case scenario, they result in fans' hesitation to re-watch the original series. After all, it might look different now that they know how the characters turn out in the future. Why get invested in Luke (Scott Patterson) and Lorelai's love story when they turn out to be such a boring couple?\nAnd forget potential viewers who were curious about all the publicity about the revival and decided to tune in - if they can't stand the reboot, there's no way they'll go back and watch the first seven seasons.\nTherein lies the conundrum of TV reboots. They're essentially fan service, so they're destined to alienate new viewers. But when the fans are also disappointed in the revival, then there's the risk of damaging the show that they loved all along.\nRELATED STORIES:\n10 questions we still have after the 'Gilmore Girls' revival\nRory Gilmore's long road to ... nowhere\n'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' review: Overstuffed, but warm and reassuring\n'Gilmore Girls': 7 must-watch episodes of the original series\nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.\n Lauren Graham",

      "text": "Netflix announced Wednesday that users worldwide can download some videos to their mobile devices instead of streaming them over cellular data, a feature that could keep eyeballs on the app when internet signals are spotty or unavailable.\nUsers boarding an aeroplane, leaving on a road trip or ducking into the subway, for example, could use Wi-Fi to download their favourite movies and TV shows beforehand, then view them when the cellular signal dips out.\nNetflix said that initially, only some of the content in its library will be available offline via the feature, available in the latest version of its app on phones and tablets using iOS or Android. The company did not specify how many programmes would become available for download later, saying only that there would be “more on the way”.\nEven in areas with strong cellular coverage, watching content offline would allow users to avoid depleting their monthly data limits, addressing a major frustration of mobile video, which eats up data ravenously.\nCustomers who watch only a limited amount of video before incurring overage fees with their cellular carriers are more likely to stop watching videos — an unpalatable option for media companies like Netflix that want to keep eyes glued to their products.\nMonthly data limits\nAT&T also appears to have come to a similar conclusion. In announcing DirecTV Now, a television service that can be streamed on mobile devices, the company said Monday that its cellular customers would be able to watch shows without that usage counting toward their monthly data limits.\n“The last thing you want to do when you’re binging or enjoying entertainment is trying to calculate how many gigs I’m using or where I am in my data plan,” Brad Bentley, AT&T’s chief marketing officer, said Monday, referring to gigabytes of data.\nNetflix is not the first video streaming company to introduce the offline option. Amazon Video, one of Netflix’s biggest competitors, has made some videos available offline since September 2015.\nHulu does not offer offline viewing, but Ben Smith, Hulu’s head of experience and a senior vice president, said Tuesday that the company was working on it, according to CIO , an industry publication.\n“We’ll get there, for sure, in our industry,” he said.",

      "text": "Netflix unveils downloading feature  22   Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an Internet connection, The Boston Globe reports. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday, November 30 gives Netflix’s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service’s decadelong history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the United States and other countries where the site sells its ‘‘Red’’ premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on HBO’s Internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix’s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service’s most popular shows, including ‘‘Orange Is The New Black,’’‘‘House of Cards,’’ and ‘‘Stranger Things,’’ are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include ‘‘Spotlight,’’ this year’s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an Internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, Calif., company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane, or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix’s expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive Internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the United States. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix’s steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an Internet connection. Netflix’s DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix’s DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

      "text": "Home » Entertainment » Netflix launches downloads for travelers and those without persistent internet Netflix launches downloads for travelers and those without persistent internet Posted By Zoe Hawkins on Dec 1, 2016 | 0 comments \nI’ve had Netflix for about five years now. I used to need Unotelly to access it, but lately I’ve been happily enjoying the South African version of the service. No, it doesn’t have everything from the American version, and I’m still jonesing for the latest season of Orange is the New Black, but I managed to watch the latest Gilmore Girls, and currently I’m bingeing on 3%. I’m lucky enough to have fiber at home now, so my viewing is way better than it was five years ago when it would pause often to buffer and drive me crazy. But now, all my woes will be a thing of the past as Netflix is introducing offline viewing thanks to downloads. \nHere is the announcement for the new service: Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nAnd in the subsequent press release , the company explained: \nWhile many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection. \nMany of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline. For example, Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown are available for download today. \nOkay, so not everything is available for download just yet, but this is a very welcome move. I’d love to be able to have Kung Fu Panda downloaded on my iPad for baby emergency moments, and imagine how much more efficiently I could binge series if I could continue to watch while on the go. Most importantly for locals, this means that even if your internet is only stable at work, you can download a series and bring it home to watch. This would have saved me a couple of years ago when I was still watching The Walking Dead… Related: You’ll need to upgrade if you want 4K Netflix on PC \nYou will need to update your app to the latest version, of course, and then a download button should appear. I’m just curious how long it stays downloaded – is this a forever thing or will it magically erase itself after viewing or after a couple days? Either way, I’m looking forward to long-haul flights a lot more now. Share this:",

This means you can finally watch Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. \nUp until now, you need a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download a new content. \nIt is unclear as of now if there’s a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once. \nNetflix did not immediately respond to CNNMoney’s request for comment ",

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access By MICHAEL LIEDTKEAP Technology Writer \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage - access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

The streaming video company has begun to allow customers to download offerings including Orange is The New Black , Narcos , and The Crown , Director of Product Innovation Eddy Wu says in a blog post.\nThere’s no additional cost to download, and it’s available on all plans worldwide. Videos will play on Android and iOS devices.\n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” Wu says. “Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.”\nHe adds that “many” movies and series are available now with “more on the way.”\nCEO Reed Hastings told analysts in October that downloading was “something we’re looking at,” but declined to offer any details. It’s seen as an especially attractive feature for many overseas markets where subscribers can’t depend on a consistently strong internet connection.\nNetflix shares are up 1.9% in early trading.\nRelated stories\nNetflix Orders 'The Kissing Booth'; YA Adaptation To Be Produced By Komixx\nSinger-Songwriter Tori Amos On New Track For Netflix Doc 'Audrie & Daisy,' Issues Of Sexual Assault And Social Media\n'Santa Clarita Diet' Gets Premiere Date; First-Look Photos\nGet more from Deadline.com : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.",

      "text": "Netflix Offline Viewing Functionality Is Here 9:01 am By Conner Flynn \nNetflix is one of the most popular online streaming services in the world. Other services all wish they were Netflix. It is used by tens of millions of people across the world. One thing that many of its users have wanted is the ability to save content for viewing offline, but Netflix was initially against the idea. \nThen we heard a few months ago that the company was warming up to it. If you subscribe to the service, you will be happy to find out today that Netflix offline viewing functionality is finally here. Better late than never. Downloading content for offline viewing is easy. Just tap on the download button on the details page for a TV show or movie and let the app do the rest. This is currently limited to mobile devices only and will not be available on desktop. At least right now. This doesn’t mean that all of the content available on Netflix will support the functionality. It’s basically limited to all of Netflix’s original series but the company does say that more content will eventually support offline viewing for users. \niOS and Android users should update their Netflix app today to use the new feature. It took the company a while, but it is finally here. Rivals like Amazon Instant Video already have it provide this functionality to users. Netflix offline is available to all subscribers.",

Netflix lets users watch videos offline -- no DVDs required Computerworld | Nov 30, 2016 7:11 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this Inside Google's Loon and Wing \nRemember when you could watch Netflix videos without an internet connection? With something called \"DVDs\"? \nWell, now you can again, and you don't even need those circular shiny things. Netflix has finally made movies and TV shows available to download, so you can watch them offline, whenever you want, wherever you are. \nIn IT Blogwatch, we can't decide what to binge watch first. \nSo what exactly is going on? Laura Roman has the background : On Wednesday, Netflix announced and implemented...the ability to download TV and movie titles on mobile devices. ... At no extra cost...Netflix subscribers will now be able to save select content to their iOS or Android devices, then watch on the go without the need for an internet connection. Say goodbye to...in-flight movies, Netflix is now airplane-mode compatible. \nDon't some other services already have offline viewing options? Michael Liedtke has the details : Netflix is matching a downloading feature that...Amazon.com has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s...also...available on YouTube...though a subscription is required in the United States and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. ... The new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on...HBO Now or Hulu, although that service has...said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nSo how do you actually download the videos? Pretty easily. Rexly Peñaflorida has some instructions : Find the “Available for Download” section on the app’s sidebar. From there, you can view the...content available for offline viewing...in...multiple categories such as New Releases, Recently Added and recommendations...just tap on your favorite show or movie...and press the download button. To view your now-offline content, go to the My Downloads tab in the sidebar. ... If you go back to the sidebar...you can...delete all downloaded content from your device and restrict downloads to a Wi-Fi connection...For iOS users, there’s an...option to change the video quality...By default, the video quality is set to \"Standard,\" but you can change it to the \"Higher\" setting. \nAnd why is Netflix doing this now? Netflix's Eddy Wu tells us himself : While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve...heard they...want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited...Many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way...For example, Orange is The New Black , Narcos and The Crown are available for download today. \nOverall, people are pretty excited. Jenna Ezarik summed up most people's reactions pretty well : THANK YOU. LOVE YOU.

A feature that they have been requesting for years is finally here. Netflix subscribers will now be able to download movies and shows that they want to watch and then check them out later even without connecting to the web. This feature is available for all Netflix subscribers around the world. \nVariety reported this great news and mentioned the new app features that will help users download their shows. The new mobile app will have a \"download\" button located at the details section of a movie or TV series. There is also a new item located at the menu section that tells subscribers what they can download. Take note that not all movies and series on Netflix are available for download but it looks like a number of great shows are a part of the list. Advertisement \nOriginal Netflix shows available for download are \" Orange Is the New Black ,\" \"House of Cards,\" \"Marcos,\" ''Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\" \"Stranger Things,\" \"The Clown\" and \"Master of None.\" Advertisement \n\"Breaking Bad,\" \"The Flash,\" \"The Office,\" \"Supernatural,\" \" Minions ,\" \"Kung Fu Panda 3\" and \"The 100\" are also available for downloads. \nThe following are not included: the new \"Gilmore Girls\" series, \"Fuller House,\" Marvel greats like \"Luke Cage,\" \"Jessica Jones\" and \"Daredevil.\" Disney movies like \"Zootopia,\" \"Lilo & Stitch\" and \" Jungle Book \" are also excluded. \nMeanwhile, The Seattle Times reported that one of the main reasons Netflix has added this feature is that they are trying to match Amazon.com's downloadable videos option. By adapting this offline viewing feature, Netflix overtakes HBO Now and Hulu which also have plans to introduce this kind of option for their subscribers soon. \nThe new downloading feature is available in all plans. It is also available for iOS phones, Android devices and tablets. A device needs to have an iOS of 8.0 or Android 4.4.2 or later along with the latest version of the Netflix app on mobile. \n© 2016 Mstars News, All rights reserved.

      "text": "Share \"Minions\", one of the movies available for download on Netflix. 1 Dec - It's been a long time coming, and Netflix has finally rolled out its much-anticipated download function. The U.S.-based provider of on-demand Internet streaming media now gives its subscribers the option to download shows and movies to be watched later without internet connection. \"Many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline,\" Eddy Wu, Director of Product Innovation, stated on Netflix's blog. Netflix subscribers have been flooding social media with their joy over the new function. No doubt, it is a function that will be even more highly appreciated this side of the world where internet stability is often a cause of concern. With the option to download, wary users can now say goodbye to long loading time and choppy streaming. Spot this button to download your favourite shows and movies. Some of the TV series available for download include \"Orange is The New Black\", \"Narcos\" and \"The Crown\". While offline movies consist of animated movies such as \"Minions\" and \"Kung Fu Panda 3\" as well as older titles that include \"Begin Again\" and \"Moonrise Kingdom\". Content that is currently excluded for downloads are the rebooted \"Gilmore Girls\" and \"Fuller House\", Marvel series \"Jessica Jones\", \"Luke Cage\" and \"Daredevil\", and Disney movies such as \"Zootopia\" and \"The Jungle Book\". All the available content will be listed under \"Available for Download\" and downloaded content can be viewed under \"My Downloads\". The download function is currently only available on phones and tablets. Bear in mind that the download button is only visible in the up-to-date version of the Netflix app, on devices using Android 4.4.2 or later or iOS 8.0 software or later.",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an internet connection.\nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix’s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service’s decade-long history.\nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its “Red” premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on HBO’s internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nNot all of the selections in Netflix’s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service’s most popular shows, including “Orange Is The New Black,” ”House of Cards,” and “Stranger Things,” are now available to watch offline.\nDownloadable movies include “Spotlight,” this year’s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix’s expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix’s steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix’s DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix’s DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.",

      "text": "Download and watch Netflix movies offline More 1 Dec – It's been a long time coming, and Netflix has finally rolled out its much-anticipated download function. The U.S.-based provider of on-demand Internet streaming media now gives its subscribers the option to download shows and movies to be watched later without internet connection. \"Many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline,\" Eddy Wu, Director of Product Innovation, stated on Netflix's blog. Netflix subscribers have been flooding social media with their joy over the new function. No doubt, it is a function that will be even more highly appreciated this side of the world where internet stability is often a cause of concern. With the option to download, wary users can now say goodbye to long loading time and choppy streaming. Some of the TV series available for download include \"Orange is The New Black\", \"Narcos\" and \"The Crown\". While offline movies consist of animated movies such as \"Minions\" and \"Kung Fu Panda 3\" as well as older titles that include \"Begin Again\" and \"Moonrise Kingdom\". Content that is currently excluded for downloads are the rebooted \"Gilmore Girls\" and \"Fuller House\", Marvel series \"Jessica Jones\", \"Luke Cage\" and \"Daredevil\", and Disney movies such as \"Zootopia\" and \"The Jungle Book\". All the available content will be listed under \"Available for Download\" and downloaded content can be viewed under \"My Downloads\". The download function is currently only available on phones and tablets. Bear in mind that the download button is only visible in the up-to-date version of the Netflix app, on devices using Android 4.4.2 or later or iOS 8.0 software or later.",

      "text": "Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access The Associated Press Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) FILE - In this Friday, Jan. 17, 2014, file photo, a person displays Netflix on a tablet in North Andover, Mass. Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix’s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service’s decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its “Red” premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on HBO’s internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix’s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service’s most popular shows, including “Orange Is The New Black,””House of Cards,” and “Stranger Things,” are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include “Spotlight,” this year’s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix’s expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix’s steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix’s DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix’s DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

      "text": "Why Netflix's Latest Reveal Is A Surprise To Subscribers And Industry Dec. 1.16 Send Message Summary \nFor years Netflix has resisted adding “off-network” viewing options to its service but this week finally gave in and added the feature. \nPreviously the company had said it didn’t see value in the proposition and if it did roll out the option it may just be to international markets. \nWhile the company didn’t give a reason for the about-face, a large factor had to be the fact that other rivals already have the option and they are gaining ground. \n“Off-network” viewing options are limited to start, but include a large number of Netflix’s original series, which are likely the programs its subscribers and investors care about the most. Finally! After years of the industry prodding Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), on Wednesday it gave its subscribers a surprise early holiday gift - off-network viewing options. Now users can at long last download Netflix content to watch when a steady Internet or Wi-Fi connection isn't around. It's a big deal for a number of reasons but the most important one is because Netflix had long said it wasn't a priority and wasn't going to happen. In fact it was reported earlier this year that Netflix had come around to the idea but ONLY for international markets. Many had attributed Netflix's reluctance to its executive board believing that if users had the ability to download shows, they would be so over-whelmed by the amount of content to choose from that they wouldn't use it. Personally I never liked that thinking because I think it makes Netflix's users seem incapable of making up their minds. Not to mention that if they can navigate the company's much-maligned main menu screens, anything is possible. Still you have to give Netflix credit for finally listening to its audiences despite the company's own opinions. Of course that's not the only reason for the about-face. Netflix may be the industry leader in streaming video but its rivals are gaining…and fast. Rivals like Amazon already allow for off-network viewing and even traditional networks like Starz and Epix have been dabbling in the concept as well. Given Starz has seen a rise in ratings in recent months it stands to reason that along with moving its original programming to Sunday night, the added viewing options have likely helped. Netflix has done a number of things right and done them before anyone else, so much to the point that I don't want to question their leadership. They've been right more times than they've been wrong, but this is clearly where the industry is headed and its strong reluctance to the concept has always been of interest to me. I also understand the potential rights issues that would come with a deal of this level, but that was never the company's stance. It was always they didn't see value in the proposition. Although speaking of rights, you'll notice not all of the company's offerings are not downloadable. Right now it is just a select group of titles…but that's okay. The appeal of these off-network download options is that it allows more people to watch a network's original content. And that is exactly what Netflix has greenlit here so if you're traveling you can catch-up on House of Cards or get hooked on The Crown . That is in addition to a few top tier films that you may have been meaning to watch (at some point) but never got around to seeing. This is also part of a larger strategy for Netflix that has focused on making its service easier to access. Shareholders may remember recent deals have closed to allow Comcast and TiVo to further integrate the service into its boxes. The more eyeballs that can watch the service the more the company justify that $6 billion in content. It all ties together for investors and while the stock did rise in early trading, the boost eventually subsided and ended the day down. After all this wasn't designed to create a short term spike, this was done with the long game in mind. The company's stock tends to move more tied to subscriber count information; whereas this news was more about sending a message -Netflix was shoring up its current market share. The battle for global streaming supremacy is something Netflix is heavily invested in and this new addition is certainly going to help.

      "text": "Video streaming services are on the rise with media networks in India following the Netflix strategy. Most services are aimed at providing content to consumers hooked on to the internet, those who don’t the have time to consume content on the idiot box, or in the traditional sense, television. Yesterday, Netflix finally added the most requested feature that its customers had long been asking for. The media streaming giant now allows users to download content to watch it offline at some later point. This brought back the debate of how important the addition of offline video is and which is the best video streaming platform out there.\nWe tried out 11 video streaming services and decided to pit them against each other. The video streaming platforms that we used were a mix of Indian as well as international video streaming services which comprised of ditooTV, Google Play Movies & TV, HOOQ, Hotstar, Jio Cinema, JioTV, Netflix, OZEE, SonyLIV, TVFPlay and Voot. We could not compare Amazon Prime Video as the service is set to launch in India soon according to rumours.\nWe have mentioned the parameters that we measured the services against and there was no particular standard when we looked at Quality, Languages and Pricing as most platforms had their interpretation of the term. Most of the platforms did not define what “High Quality” meant for the platform in technical terms, so we took the highest available measure and assumed that to be 720p unless stated otherwise. Similarly, some platforms offered multiple tiers of price points which we standardised to pricing on the cheapest level per month.\nVideo Service ditooTV Play Movies & TV HOOQ Hotstar Jio Cinema JioTV Download option No Yes (only paid) Yes (up to 5 shows) Yes No Yes (Recording) Live TV Yes No No Yes No Yes Movies No Yes Yes Yes Yes No TV shows Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No Quality High High (1080p) High High (720p) High High Languages Hindi, English English, Hindi English, Thai, Bahasa English 10 languages 10 languages Interface App, Web App App, Web App, Web App App Registration Required Required Required No Required Required Tariff (Rs/Month) 20 Depends on Content 249 199 199 349  \nVideo Service Netflix OZEE SonyLIV TVFPlay Voot Download option Yes No No Yes No Live TV No No Yes No No Movies Yes Yes Yes No No TV shows Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Quality High (1080p, 4k) High (480p) High High (720p) High Languages English, Hindi 5 languages English, Hindi English, Hindi 6 languages Interface App, Web App, Web App, Web App, Web App, Web Registration Required No No Required Yes Tariff (Rs/Month) 500 Free 149 Free Free Conclusion \nLooking at all the video services available online and going by the experience, Hotstar and Netflix came out on top. We chose these two services keeping in mind the features offered, along with the quality of the mobile apps (UI), their websites and variety of content (movies, TV shows, documentaries etc.) offered. Netflix also allows 4K streaming for Windows 10 PCs which no other video streaming app provides from the list. Google Play Movies & TV lags slightly behind with regards to features offered but these three services seem to offer better quality, variety and value for the money and these are the very factors that matter to most users.\nThe post Netflix starts offline viewing; here is what the competition has on offer appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Netflix unveils download feature for offline binge-watching Lucas Shaw Bloomberg 14 hrs ago ( … ) Netflix Inc. is making some TV shows and movies available for download to watch offline, providing its users a feature that has become a must-have for binge-watchers. \nMany fans have requested to watch Netflix content without an internet connection, especially those in emerging markets with limited internet access. The world's largest online TV network will roll out the feature on phones and tablets for all subscribers, but only for select shows such as \"The Crown\" and \"Orange is the New Black\" at first, according to a statement Wednesday. \nNetflix has been signaling it would add a downloading option in recent months, as a way to continue increasing its subscriber base and match video-streaming Amazon.com . Offline viewing will make Netflix shows more accessible to customers around the world, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa. \nNetflix has 86.7 million customers worldwide, 47.5 million of whom live in the U.S. The company now relies on international markets for most of its growth, and earlier this year expanded its footprint to the entire world, save for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" said Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation, in a web post.",

The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com , has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. Get breaking news sent instantly   Breaking News   \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

On Jan. 1, Brown will start as a contributor for ABC News, and the network hopes he can offer a unique perspective to \"inform [their] reporting\" in the new presidency. \nBrown was nationally-praised this year for his handling of the July 7 police ambush in downtown Dallas. Brown spoke out and encouraged protesters to work with police to keep their neighborhoods safe. Brown was on the police force for 33 years, six of those as chief. He retired in October.

US stocks rose early on October 18, 2016 following a handful of mostly solid earnings reports, with on-demand television service Netflix surging 19.0 percent after subscriber results topped expectations. Ryan Anson/AFP/Getty Images Netflix introduces offline downloading \nRejoice, fellow streamers! Netflix announced (and launched) offline downloads for the popular subscription service. While not all shows and movies are downloadable (Sorry, Marvel fans!), many of the company's original shows are, like Orange is the New Black and The Crown . \nThe feature, which is available at no extra charge, is for those that want to binge their favorite shows on the go without having to connect to the internet or use data.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people than ever are being diagnosed in their later years. In 2009, one in three people diagnosed with HIV was over the age of 50. \nIn the case of Helen Goldenberg, new drug regimens have allowed her to remain active in the 32 years since her HIV-positive diagnosis at age 36. Now, about to celebrate her 70th birthday, Goldenberg is staying proactive, along with other Americans living longer with advances in medicine. Immigrants detained in Texas could soon receive bond hearings as the result of a case heard Wednesday by the Supreme Court. (Karen Bleier/Agence France-Presse) Supreme Court considers holding non-citizens without bond hearing \nAsylum seekers and immigrants are often kept in prolonged detention without being given a bond hearing. For U.S. citizens, it is a constitutionally guaranteed right, but a Supreme Court hearing Wednesday may have some changes in store for the practice. \nThe case, Jennings v Rodriguez, centered around individuals who have \"fallen through the cracks\" of the legal system, and fall victim to unauthorized punishment. Some individuals, ones that were brought to the U.S. legally, end up caught in a similar cycle. They're hoping this case could change that.

The event, which will be hosted by the Dallas Observer in February, is called The Morning After, dedicated to celebrating that little thing we call brunch. \nMore than 25 local restaurants will have bite-sized portions for sampling, specialty cocktails and more.

      "text": "\nChelsea Handler is still on the air with her titular Netflix talk show. Why she is still on TV eludes me but she is. Since the show is still receiving a lackluster response , Chelsea tries to get out and stir the pot to get people interested in between taking swipes at Angelina Jolie. She recently spoke to People magazine about what drives her. According to Chelsea, it was her less than affluent childhood. Chelsea grew up one of six children. Her father was a used car salesman and her mother a homemaker. Because of her ‘humble’ childhood, Chelsea set her sights on becoming successful and she worked hard to do it.\nAn outspoken talk show host, bestselling author and producer, Chelsea Handler isn’t one to shy away from a little hard work.\n“I love to be creative,” says Handler, 41, whose chat show Chelsea, airs on Netflix. “It’s a worker. That’s all I got going on. It’s not like I’m married or have babies. The show is like a dream come true for me. Work hard, play hard.”\n“I wanted the opposite of what I had growing up,” says Handler, who has said she felt insecure around friends who had money. “I wanted to be comfortable and I wanted someone in my house, cleaning!”\nMost importantly, the television star strove to find a way to stand on her own. “I didn’t ever want to rely on a man to provide for me,” says Handler. “I wanted to create something that was completely and utterly mine. And I didn’t want anybody in my life dictating what I do.”\nNow, Handler says she’s open to a relationship, but is perfectly content with everything she’s accomplished thus far. “I don’t really have anyone to answer to,” she says. “That’s nice for work and it’s nice for life!”\n\n[From People] \nAs I said yesterday , I appreciate a good work ethic. Although I am generally a little dubious about how hard somebody who was sleeping with their boss had to work, I’m willing to take Chelsea at her word here. Primarily because she never stops hustling but also because I very rarely can take Chelsea at her word. For example: her meager upbringing. She’s spoken before of her impoverished childhood, one that had her summering at her family home in Martha’s Vineyard. She claimed that she knew she was disadvantaged because she would go to her, “friends’ houses and I could tell things were different.” However, she wrote in her book, Are You There Vodka? It’s Me Chelsea , that her family was most decidedly not poor but she compared them with those around her who had trust funds and drove Mercedes. There’s nothing wrong with ambition. If you want to be fabulously wealthy and buy the house on the hill, do so. But don’t creative a false narrative about your upbringing to justify doing so. \nAs for her not wanting to “rely on a man to provide” part, nowhere is it written that the moneymaker gets to dictate anything. In many partnerships, there is a fairly clear understanding that it is because the non-working partner is managing their home that the working partner can get ahead professionally. Why can’t Chelsea just say she wants to be self-reliant without implying that a partner who makes less money is subservient? She clearly favors accomplished men and yet, I can accept that has nothing to do with a power imbalance in her relationships. I wonder if Chelsea will ever be able to support any thought she has without putting someone else down? I doubt it; it’s probably a lesson she learned during her hardscrabble summers in Martha’s Vineyard.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Fame/Flynet Photos \n",

      "text": "Netflix downloads: everything you need to know Michael Nunez 1 Dec 2016, 12:38 p.m. The announcement is already being championed by binge-watchers and frequent travellers. But it's also raised some questions. \nNetflix announced today that subscribers will be able to download select movies and TV shows for offline playback. The feature had been requested by users for a long time, and it's reportedly been in the works since June. Now, anyone with a Netflix subscription can download movies and TV shows to watch when they're not connected to the internet. \nIn the past, the predominant belief was that Netflix offline viewing would be targeted at countries without reliable internet access. However, since that's not the case any more, the announcement is already being championed by binge-watchers and frequent travellers. It's also raised some questions among the tech community. With that in mind, here is everything you need to know about downloading videos from Netflix, and how you can plan to take advantage of this sweet new feature. How to start downloading movies \nYou can only download Netflix videos using the iOS or Android app. Netflix requires users to have at least iOS 8.0 or Android 4.4.2, in addition to having the latest version of the app. Downloading videos will consume about as much data as streaming, so if you plan on saving a bunch of videos, we'd recommend connecting to a reliable Wi-Fi connection to prevent any unexpected mobile data charges. How much storage space you'll need \nThe size of downloadable Netflix files depends on how long the video is. For example, one episode of Black Mirror with a running time of one hour and three minutes is about 280 megabytes in standard definition. The high-definition version of the same episode clocks in at 440 megabytes (about twice the size). How much storage space you'll need to binge \nLet's be honest: This new offline viewing feature is cool because it allows you to load up a bunch of content for long trips. Say you're taking a six-hour flight and want to watch downloaded Netflix videos the whole time. You'll need six Black Mirror episodes which would require 1.68 gigabytes of free space for SD and 2.64 gigabytes for HD. So unless you're flying further than Southeast Asia you probably won't need much more than that. How to get the best quality video \nYou can choose whether you want standard-definition video — which is faster to download and takes up less space — or high-definition video. In order to keep downloads quick, Netflix sets downloads to standard video (720x480) by default. According to a Netflix spokesperson, HD support will vary by device. You can find the option to change in the app's settings. For most users, standard definition will be good enough, especially if you're watching on a small screen like a phone or tablet. How to manage the files \nNetflix declined to comment on the file type that is saved, and you can't view it in a file manager app, either. It works similarly to other subscription apps like Spotify. According to a Netflix spokesperson, \"The downloads can only be viewed within the Netflix mobile app; they aren't like videos you download from the internet and store to your device.\" It's safe to say this is a digital rights management (DRM) scheme to protect the copyrights of videos being offered. How to move files to a desktop or laptop (Spoiler: You can't) \nYou must use the Netflix app to download and view saved videos. How to keep downloads from expiring \nEach Netflix download has a different expiration time. Movies and TV shows that expire from your device in less than seven days will display how much time is left in the \"My Downloads\" section of the Netflix app. For some movies and shows, offline viewing must be completed within 48 hours of the moment you press play. When you start playing one of these titles, you'll see how many hours you have left in the \"My Downloads\" section of the Netflix app. Explore the smart design, breakthrough science and awe-inspiring tech shaping your future at Gizmodo Australia .

      "text": "How to download Netflix movies and shows to your phone or tablet for offline viewing Nov. 30, 2016 1:16pm Meh \nIf you've been cutting cords, then there's a high chance that Netflix is a go-to spot for watching movies and TV shows. Trouble is, if you're on the road, binge-watching the The Crown can result in you going over your monthly mobile data plan. And if you're on an airplane? Who wants to pay a high price just to get a grainy stream of Supernatural , assuming WiFi is even available on your flight? \nThankfully, those problems can now be eased considerably — just in time for holiday travel. Netflix reaches out to binge watchers, unveiling download feature for offline viewing \nNetflix is giving all subscribers the ability to download movies and shows straight to their mobile device for offline viewing. So you can download a bunch of movies at home with your primary internet connection and rest assured that you won't be bored as you drive four hours to Houston with your husband's bad taste in music cluttering the car speakers. \nThe catch? Not all Netflix content is available to download. But much of it is, including hit shows like Parks & Recreation, popular movies like Minions and Netflix original content like Stranger Things . So how does it work? \nFirst, make sure you have the latest version of the Netflix app on your phone or tablet. The ability to download shows was added in a Nov. 30 update. \nIf you're up-to-date, you should have a new option under the menu button at the top of the screen: \"Available for Download.\" There will also be a button above it called \"My Downloads,\" where you can find the stuff that is already on your device. \nThat will take you to a handy list of suggested content that you can download right this second, including stuff that's popular on Netflix and recommendations based on things you've already watched before. Yes, I did watch \"Christmas with the Kranks\" last week. Shut up. Tim Allen is a national treasure. \nYou don't have to go to this section, though. You can simply navigate to a show or movie you're interested in to see if it's downloadable. If it is, you'll see a download icon (an arrow pointing down) to the right of the title. \nOnce you've started a download, you'll see a \"stop\" symbol next to it if you want to cancel. You will also get a blue bar at the bottom of your screen letting you know, \"Hey, this thing you wanted to download is currently downloading.\" \nWhen it's done, you can simply navigate to that \"My Downloads\" page, select thing thing you want to download and voila! Now you're catching up on Legends of Tomorrow , and you can do it even when you don't have an internet connection! \nNote: When in Airplane Mode, Netflix is smart enough to go straight to your list of downloads, so you can jump straight into the stuff stored on your device. \nHere's the catch with downloaded content: Once you start watching something, it expires in 48 hours . This means that your kids can't watch Nanny McPhee over and over and over again during a week-long vacation unless you find a spot to re-download it. Kind of a pain, but it's to offset piracy concerns of you just walking around with gigabytes of shows in your pocket to do with as you see fit. How much storage space do I need for this? \nA typical episode of a \"long\" (read: 43-minute) show like The Flash will take up roughly 150-250MB, based on what we've seen so far. A movie will be bigger, weighing in at more than 300-400MB. So if you have a lot of free space on your device (considering 64GB and 128GB phones aren't uncommon at this point), you can theoretically store a lot of stuff. Does this cost more? \nNope! It's a free benefit for all Netflix subscribers, even at the lowest price plan. Help! My favorite show/movie isn't available to download! \nNetflix likely has to renegotiate their deals with certain content providers in order to let customers download those movies and shows. One of the notable holdouts right now is Disney, so you won't be able to download Zootopia to your iPad right now, unfortunately. (Or Luke Cage , since it's a Marvel property.) \nNetflix says that they're working with content providers to get more content available to download soon. Goes Well With...",

Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) SAN FRANCISCO Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. The long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. Netflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. The new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. Netflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. Not all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. Downloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. The Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. Earlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. The change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. Netflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. The offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. Netflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years. View Comments 0 Sign up for e-newsletters Want more news?

      "text": "The opening scene in the third episode of Netflix's new \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" features Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ) and her daughter, Rory (Alexis Bledel) sitting by a pool in Stars Hollow, doing their usual quick banter. But the snappy dialogue turns obnoxious as they start mocking their fellow poolgoers.\n\"Belly alert,\" Lorelai mutters as an overweight man passes by. \"Holy moly,\" Rory echoes. They scoff at a woman in a bikini (\"Just go naked\") and then dub a heavy man in a Speedo \"Back Fat Pat.\" Meanwhile, people drop by to welcome Rory back to town, since she moved home after a rough patch in her journalism career. \"I'm not back!\" she repeatedly whines to her well-wishers, even though it sure looks like she's back for good.\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\nThe scene exemplifies the worst parts of \"Gilmore Girls,\" the acclaimed WB series that ran from 2000 to 2007: Lorelai and Rory's banter that could turn cruel and grating; Rory's blindness to her unbelievable privilege; the main characters simply thinking they're better than everyone else. Already, viewers are calling out this particular scene: \"The 'Gilmore Girls' Fat-Shaming Scene Was Unnecessary.\"\"About The Body-Shaming On 'Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.'\"\"'Gilmore Girls' fans are dragging the revival for its 'cringe-worthy' fat-shaming.\")\nWhile every great TV series has its flaws, a major problem with TV reboots is that they often focus a glaring spotlight on all of the show's initial problems, which ultimately make for a subpar viewing experience - and threaten to tarnish the original series.\nMake no mistake, the highly-anticipated \"Gilmore Girls\" revival, which landed on Netflix the day after Thanksgiving, was thrilling to many fans, some of whom can't find a negative thing to say. But it has also garnered lots of criticism over the past several days, from diehard loyal viewers to people who never saw the original show but decided to watch the revival because of all the hype.\nThe main issues mostly involve Rory, who started the series as a quiet, brainy introvert who loved to read and didn't need a social life because her mother was her best friend. Eventually, she came out of her shell, and throughout the seven seasons, wound up in various romantic entanglements and career woes as she embarked on her dream to become a journalist. Rory's evolution was frustrating at times, especially because she never seemed to recognize how many advantages she had, thanks to her wealthy grandparents, and was often deemed \"special\" even if she didn't display extraordinary qualities.\nIn the revival, Rory, as many have pointed out, has become insufferable - a disappointment to the fans that used to look up to her. She cheats on her boyfriend, Paul (Jack Carpenter), and is embroiled in an affair with her college boyfriend, Logan (Matt Czuchry), who is engaged. Rory's career is in shambles and she can't land a full-time job. Multiple critics have pointed out that this is because she seems to be a terrible reporter, one who sleeps with a source and then doesn't prepare for a job interview at a website because she thinks she's too good for the position. (She doesn't get the job.) As one piece in The Washington Post sums it up, \"Rory Gilmore is a monster.\"\nOther complaints include the terrible Stars Hollow musical, which in the original series would be a quick scene; in the revival (which runs 90 minutes per episode), it's a 20-minute gag that goes on and on. Some people are upset about the infamous \"last four words\" of the show, in which Rory reveals her pregnancy and ends the series on an infuriating cliffhanger.\nA disappointing revival - or even one that doesn't live up to sky-high expectations - happens all the time: Just look at Season 4 of \"Arrested Development,\" or \"Fuller House,\" or even \"Heroes Reborn.\" Worst-case scenario, they result in fans' hesitation to re-watch the original series. After all, it might look different now that they know how the characters turn out in the future. Why get invested in Luke (Scott Patterson) and Lorelai's love story when they turn out to be such a boring couple?\nAnd forget potential viewers who were curious about all the publicity about the revival and decided to tune in - if they can't stand the reboot, there's no way they'll go back and watch the first seven seasons.\nTherein lies the conundrum of TV reboots. They're essentially fan service, so they're destined to alienate new viewers. But when the fans are also disappointed in the revival, then there's the risk of damaging the show that they loved all along.\nRELATED STORIES:\n10 questions we still have after the 'Gilmore Girls' revival\nRory Gilmore's long road to ... nowhere\n'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' review: Overstuffed, but warm and reassuring\n'Gilmore Girls': 7 must-watch episodes of the original series\nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Lauren Graham",

      "text": "Read Article \nSAN FRANCISCO — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix’s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service’s decadelong history. Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch when they're not online. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday. Associated Press/Elise Amendola Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its “Red” premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on HBO’s internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix’s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service’s most popular shows, including “Orange Is The New Black,”“House of Cards,” and “Stranger Things,” are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include “Spotlight,” this year’s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. Share",

      "text": "Twitter \nNetflix is now allowing users to download content from its catalog to watch offline. Netflix users have been requesting this feature for several years, but the company has resisted enabling it. Until now… \nAs streaming services go, Netflix is one of the best Why You Should Be Happy to Pay More for Netflix Why You Should Be Happy to Pay More for Netflix Every time Netflix increases its prices, millions of binge-watching users balk at the prospect of paying a couple of dollars more. But this is dumb, because Netflix is an absolute steal. Read More . It has an amazing UI, awesome original content, and a catalog that ensures most people can spend their weekends binge-watching on the sofa. \nHowever, Netflix isn’t perfect 7 Reasons You Should Avoid Subscribing to Netflix 7 Reasons You Should Avoid Subscribing to Netflix Just as there are pitfalls to cutting the cord, there are downsides to Netflix you might consider to be deal-breakers. So before you sign up to Netflix, take a moment to consider these imperfections. Read More , and its lack of download options has been one of its negatives up to now. Especially as Amazon Prime Video offers downloads How to Download Amazon Prime Videos to Watch Offline How to Download Amazon Prime Videos to Watch Offline Amazon has announced that Instant Video now allows offline viewing of movies and television shows on Android and iOS devices, and we have the full lowdown on how you can initiate this fantastic feature. Read More . However, Netflix has finally joined the party, with Netflix announcing downloads are now available on both Android and iOS. How to Download Netflix Content \nNetflix is offering downloads to people on all plans. All you need to do is update the Netflix app on Android or iOS to enable the option. Once you have done that, a Download button (a down arrow on top of a horizontal line) should appear beside the existing Play button. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nWhat’s not yet clear is exactly what content is going to be available for download. In the press release announcing the feature Netflix mentions a trio of Netflix Originals. Netflix then states that “many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way”. \nAllowing users to download original content is a no-brainer for Netflix, as the company owns the rights. Allowing users to download other content could be a more complicated affair, however, as the rightsholders may not want to allow their content to be downloaded for offline viewing. Why Downloads, and Why Now? \nThe addition of a Download button appears to have come out of nowhere. There was talk of introducing the option in developing countries where stable internet connections are harder to find, but Netflix has always seemed against the idea in the U.S. and elsewhere. \nI suspect downloads have been introduced as a direct result of recent negative press. After all, Netflix has raised its prices for many people It Turns Out Netflix Was Right to Raise Prices It Turns Out Netflix Was Right to Raise Prices Netflix has enjoyed a fantastic quarter. Which strongly suggests that its decision to raise prices for existing subscribers hasn't harmed the company in the slightest. Result!

We now know the number of titles available on Netflix has been halved since 2012 to fund original content. Read More . Which is bound to have upset some people. \nDo you subscribe to Netflix? Will you be making use of the download button? When and where will you be watching your downloads? Does this make Netflix better value for money? What other features do you want Netflix to add?

      "text": "Netflix has launched offline viewing for films and TV series with its latest app update. The new feature will let users download content in both HD and SD on Android & iOS phones and tablets. The feature is not available on desktops/web version of Netflix.\nUsers will also need to have a device updated to iOS 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 and above to use the feature. There is still no guarantee it will work – we couldn’t see the download feature on our device, and on asking the help center, were told that the feature is currently available only on some devices, without specifying which ones.\nNot all shows and movies are available for download either. Currently some shows like Narcos, The Crown, Black Mirror etc. (essentially Netflix originals), are available for download, and the company mentions that it will keep adding to the list. Note that the downloaded content will take up as much bandwidth as if the user had streamed the content, and will additionally require spare space on the user’s device to store the files. The download will be by default in SD quality, depending on the screen size and resolution it’s being downloaded on.\nInterestingly, Netflix will use its own DRM format to ensure the content it not pirated. Users will not find the video on their devices in any playable format, but the file will rather be saved in a proprietary format that will expire at a predefined time. Saved downloads have variable expiry dates, and downloads expiring within a week will be displayed in the ‘My Downloads’ section. However, once users start playing a downloaded file, it will expire in 48 hours.\nNote that during the #NAMA event on content and payments on 4G , content providers described offline viewing as an intermediary model till connections in India got better, and were not clogged during peak times. However, Netflix, rather than target spotty connections in developing countries, seems to be targeting users that tend to travel or are on short trips etc., and in need of entertainment, unlike, say, YouTube’s offline feature for India. Amazon’s Prime also offers a similar feature , letting users download files on their mobile devices for watching on the go.\nImage source : Flickr user MoneyBlogNewz under CC BY 2.0 ",

The streaming service will finally allow users to download its vast library of films and television shows which will allow for offline streaming. No more wi-fi, no more 4G, it can all be downloaded and watched at your leisure.\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \n\nNot all items are available for download yet, but sooner or later all titles will be available. Users just need to view the details page of any movie or tv show, and a button will be available to click to select to download it for later. This feature is available to everyone with a Netflix account and will not be added with an additional charge. This feature, as of now, is only available to mobile and tablet users, and as long as thy have downloaded the most recent update of the app.\nThere is also an “Available for Download” section within the app which will make your offline viewing options all the easier to spot! Gilmore Girls isn’t on there yet, but reportedly Black Mirror , Stranger Things , and Orange Is the New Black are all there waiting for you!\nVia Cosmopolitan \n",
