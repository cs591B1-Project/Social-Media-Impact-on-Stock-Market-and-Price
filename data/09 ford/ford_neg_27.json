      "text": " 30   Ford Motor Co said on Friday it was recalling about 650,000 vehicles in North America to fix issues that could prevent seat belts from functioning properly in a crash. \nThe recall includes certain 2013–16 Ford Fusion, 2015–16 Ford Mondeo and 2013–15 Lincoln MKZ cars, Ford said. \nIn the affected vehicles, increased temperatures generated during deployment of the seat belt anchor pretensioner cables could cause them to separate, potentially reducing the seat belt's ability to adequately restrain an occupant in a crash, Ford said. \nPretensioners tighten up any slack in the seat belt webbing in the event of a crash and work in tandem with air bags. \nFord said it was aware of two accidents and two injuries associated with the issue.",

Advertisement \nDuring an appearance on \"The View\" on Wednesday , Ford said he had been asked to dress Melania Trump \"quite a few years ago\" and declined because \"she's not necessarily my image.\" \nFord said he is a Democrat and voted for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, but added that even had Clinton won, she shouldn't have worn his clothes because \"they're too expensive.\" He said his clothes cost a lot to make and the president needs to \"relate to everybody.\" \nAsked if Melania Trump should wear expensive clothes, Ford replied: \"I'm going to leave that to Melania.\" \nDesigner Sophie Theallat wrote an open letter last month urging colleagues not to dress Melania Trump.

If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Related content",

If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. \nCopyright © 2016 The Washington Times, LLC.",

      "text": "DETROIT (AP) — Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash.\nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars.\nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem.\nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping.\nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16.\nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "title": "Ford, industry blast Obama on EPA's greenhouse regs",
      "text": "Pinterest \nFord on Wednesday accused the Obama administration of playing “eleventh-hour politics” after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it would recommend keeping strict greenhouse emission standards in place through 2025, despite a major industry lobbying effort aimed at relaxing those standards.. \nFord signaled that it hopes that President-elect Donald Trump will roll back the regulations. \nFord’s uncharacteristically harsh public statement was at the forefront of a chorus of criticism hurled at the EPA and the Obama administration after the government tossed aside concerns repeatedly expressed by the industry since July about emission regulations that will take effect between 2020 and 2025. \nThe battle between the industry and the Obama administration also sets up the the potential that the incoming Trump administration could take control of the review process and scale back the regulations automakers initially agreed to in 2012. \n“It is deeply disappointing that eleventh-hour politics in a lame-duck Administration has short-circuited a data-driven process for developing regulation,” Ziad Ojakli, Ford’s group vice-president of government and relations, said. “Ford and the industry stand ready to work with the next Administration and Congress to find a way forward.” \nThe Auto Alliance, the industry’s leading lobbying group, sent a letter to Trump’s transition team that specifically asked the incoming team take part in the mid-term evaluation of automotive regulations “to ensure that these are consistent with the policy objectives of the new administration.” \nGloria Bergquist, vice president of the alliance, said it’s an open question whether the EPA can conclude a public comment period and “turn it around and finalize” the decision before Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. The U.S. Department of Transportation, which oversees a related set of fuel economy standards, has not completed its regulatory review. \nBergquist said the EPA made its announcement without coordinating with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “What if NHTSA comes up with a different standard?” said Bergquist. \nThe Trump transition team did not immediately respond to questions Wednesday. \nThe auto industry argues that the regulations scheduled to take effect from 2020-25 will cost automakers billions and will force the industry to introduce technology consumers are not willing to pay for, pushing consumers out of the new vehicle market. \nThe U.S. EPA and the Obama administration view the regulations as one of the current president’s signature achievements because automakers have aggressively improved fuel economy and cut emissions as they complied. \nAccording to the EPA, the average per vehicle cost for automakers to meet the 2025 standards, compared to the 2021 standards, is just $875. With the fuel efficiency gains from the new vehicles the EPA estimates a consumer with a five-year loan would break even on the additional vehicle cost within one year. \nBy law, the EPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation, which separately regulates fuel economy, had until April 2018 to make a final determination. \nJanet McCabe, EPA acting assistant administrator for the office of air quality division, repeatedly denied the agency was trying to speed up the mid-term review process in an attempt to prevent a Trump administration from making changes. \nThe agency’s decision to reach its conclusion early was “based on exhaustive analysis, public comments, and thorough consideration of an extensive technical record,” she said. Outraged reaction \nHere is roundup of key reactions from automakers, industry groups and politicians: \n“The evidence is abundantly clear that with low gas prices, consumers are not choosing the cars necessary to comply with increasingly unrealistic standards. Wishing this fact away does no one any favors, and getting this wrong has serious implications.”— Auto Alliance, which represents 12 major automakers \n“Washington today decided to make new cars and trucks more expensive for America’s working men and women. The outgoing administration has chosen to halt progress on fuel economy by enacting a policy that will delay the introduction of safer and cleaner vehicles by making them more expensive.”–Peter Welch, president of the National Automobile Dealers Association \n“General Motors is disappointed that EPA changed the process and decided to advance the timetable for completing the Mid-term Review of the 2022-2025 model year fuel economy requirements. This unexpected action appears to dismiss the many comments and questions raised by automakers.”— General Motors \n“I look forward to working in the next congress with the new administration to pare back all of the legacy saving regulatory actions this administration will continue to advance as their January 20th deadline approaches.”–U.S. Sen Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., chairman of the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee \n“Today I spoke with Administration officials and expressed concerns about the Environmental Protection Agency’s process in developing today’s proposal.” \n–U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. \n“This action is completely unnecessary and will have grave consequences on jobs and manufacturing … with the clock ticking on the administration, the regulatory frenzy is under way”— Fred Upton, R-Kalamazoo, and two other Republican members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee \n“What’s not to like about a plan, agreed to by the automakers, that cuts oil use, saves money at the pump and reduces pollution? Numerous studies demonstrate that automakers have ample, affordable technology to achieve the program’s cost-effective goals, including certainty for the industry.”–Dan Becker, director of the safe climate campaign \n“The decision today was based on a lengthy, technical review. It simply reaffirms an existing regulation. For this process to be undone, an equally significantly technical analysis would have to be completed and would have to come up with contradictory findings.”–John Boesel, president and CEO of CALSTART, a lobbying group for clean transportation technology. \n___ \n(c)2016 the Detroit Free Press \nVisit the Detroit Free Press at www.freep.com \nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. \n—- \nThis content is published through a licensing agreement with Acquire Media using its NewsEdge technology.

The recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. Ford says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. Pre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. Dealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. Most of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Today's Deals",

      "text": "Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ Recalled, Ford Mondeo Too / Home / News / Recalls 680,872 vehicles. That’s how many Fusions, MKZs, and Mondeos are due a visit to the dealers over an issue. As if that wasn’t enough, a handful of 2017 Ford Fusion vehicles were recalled too. In the first of two campaigns announced today, Ford explains why a humongous number of mid-size sedans need to be fixed in due time as follows: “to insulate front driver and passenger seat belt anchor pretensioners to prevent cable separation in a crash.” How is that possible? As it happens, the temperature generated when the pretensioner deploys is labeled as the cause as to why the cables are prone to separate. In the event of a crash, this condition equals inadequate occupant protection for the front passengers. Ford is aware of two accidents and two injuries associated with the condition. The first of the three affected nameplates is the 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion , vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly and at Flat Rock Assembly from August 13, 2012 through April 2, 2016. Then there’s the 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ . More specifically, vehicles built between November 12, 2012 and July 31, 2014. As for the Mondeo, affected vehicles include 2015 and 2016 models made at the Valencia plant between August 5, 2014 and July 31, 2016. Authorized dealerships were instructed by FoMoCo to fix the defect by injecting “a conformal coating into the front driver and passenger seat belt anchor pretensioner.” The manufacturer’s number for this recall in the United States is 16S42, with more information available on Ford’s website . For the second campaign, the Blue Oval eyed 27 units of the 2017 Fusion . Yes, the facelifted Fusion. Affected cars need to have their second-row left-rear seat back frame replace because Ford might’ve built them with “improperly welded pivot pins.” Happily, however, the manufacturer isn’t aware of any crashes or injuries connected to this problem. If you own a 2017 Fusion built between September 27 and September 28, 2017, you might want to give your nearest dealer a call and inquire about recall 16S43.",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo FILE - This Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2011, file photo shows a Ford sign at the Salem Ford dealership in Salem, …\nDETROIT (AP) — Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash.\nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars.\nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem.\nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping.\nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16.\nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",

      "text": "Ford Increasing Virtual Crash-Test Capability \nIf you don’t like the weather in Cologne, Germany, you won’t have to wait five minutes for it to change. Just flick a switch. \nFord ’s weather factory, now under construction in the German city, will simulate a range of the world’s most demanding weather conditions – from Arctic frost and desert heat to rainforest humidity. \nThe Environmental Test Center, due to be fully operational later next year, also will be the first automotive facility to simulate altitudes of 17,060 ft. (5,200 m), about 1,280 ft. (390 m) higher than Mont Blanc, the tallest Alpine peak. \nThe facility will cover 5.5 million sq.-ft. (515,500 sq.-m) and includes two climate wind tunnels, a high-altitude lab and four temperature-controlled test chambers, three of which also will handle humidity testing. \nIt will simulate snow, glaring sunlight and rain, and extremes of -40° F (-40° C) – the average winter temperature in eastern Siberia – to 131° F (55° C) – just short of the highest air temperature ever recorded – as well as 95% humidity. \nIt will allow Ford engineers to test upcoming vehicles in the most demanding conditions from around the world with vehicle and wind speeds of up to 155 mph (250 km/h). \nThe center will enable engineers to simultaneously work on up to nine different vehicles, testing comfort, safety and operational capabilities including electrical performance, braking, air conditioning and pulling heavy loads. \nThe Cologne center will facilitate testing of Ford’s expanded lineup of performance cars and sports cars, which includes the Focus RS, Focus ST and Ford Mustang, in conditions of higher wind speeds. \nIt also will be capable of testing all front-, rear- and all-wheel-drive vehicles. \nJoe Bakaj, Ford Europe vice president-product development, says the Cologne facility is a significant step forward that will allow the automaker to efficiently simulate the most demanding environments around the globe under repeatable conditions. \n“With industry-first features, such as the high-altitude testing and the ability to simulate heavy snow, this new test facility offers a toolkit that will help us to continue to develop future best-in-class vehicles,” Bakaj says in a statement.",

Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners.

Post to Facebook Ford issues seat-belt recall after 2 injuries Seat belts prone to fail have prompted a recall of more than 680,000 vehicles.  //usat.ly/2guJLL5   Join the Nation's Conversation To   Ford issues seat-belt recall after 2 injuries Nathan Bomey , USA TODAY 9:44 a.m. EST December 2, 2016 Ford Fusion will come in a hot Sport version (Photo: Ford) \nSeat belts prone to fail during accidents have prompted a new recall of more than 680,000 vehicles globally at Ford Motor. \nThe Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker said Friday that it would recall certain versions of the 2013 through 2016 model-year Ford Fusion, 2015-16 Ford Mondeo and 2013-15 Lincoln MKZ to fix the defect. \nThe problem stems from faulty seat belt anchor pretensioners that can overheat and cause the cable to snap during deployment in a crash. \nThe issue \"may inadequately restrain an occupant in a crash, increasing risk of injury,\" Ford said in a statement. \nThe company said it had linked at least two injuries and two accidents to the matter. \nThe recall covers 602,739 vehicles in the U.S., 35,614 in Canada, 8,665 in Mexico and 653 elsewhere. \nRepair staff will inject a coating to insulate the cables from heat and prevent breakage. \nVehicle owners will be notified if they are affected by the recall, which affects models built during certain time periods at plants in Michigan and Mexico. \nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @ NathanBomey . 2 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2guJLL5 Find New & Used Cars",

      "text": "SHARES Bryan Woolston | Reuters Brandon Malone assembles a Ford truck at the Louisville Ford truck plant in Louisville, Kentucky, September 30, 2016. \nNovember's stunning 4.6 percent unemployment rate, and the fact the economy is still adding jobs at a healthy clip, should give the Fed the green light to hike interest rates when it meets later this month. \nUnemployment was at its lowest since August 2007, and job gains continued to be strong in November , coming in at 178,000, in line with this year's average of 180,000. However, wage growth backtracked, with a surprise 0.1 percent drop in average hourly wages, compared with expectations of 0.2 percent. \n\"Average hourly earnings is disappointing. The drop in the unemployment rate — this is the best of the cycle. You had a huge drop in the level of unemployment and an increase in employment. They're saying things are improving,\" said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. \nUnemployment had been 4.9 percent in October and was expected to stay the same for November. show chapters 2 Hours Ago | 06:10 \nAverage hourly wages had increased by 0.4 percent in October, a pace that had it continued would signal wage growth heading toward 5 percent annually. Wages had been growing at about 2.5 percent annually. The November 0.1 percent decline was the lowest since December, 2014. \nAfter the report, stocks were slightly lower, and bond yields fell. On Thursday, yields rose sharply ahead of the number as speculation swirled that the employment report could be very strong and show wage pressures, which would be a sign the Fed may have to hike more than expected next year. The slightly disappointing report brought in buyers for Treasurys, as did concerns about the Italian referendum this weekend . \n\"It wasn't a slam dunk number by any means. The wages (number) is the most important, but it's important to know it came off a surge last month,\" said Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics. \"It's a hiccup in wages, but not enough to stop the Fed.\" \nThere was also a decline in a broader measure of unemployment from 9.5 percent to to 9.3 percent, now the lowest since August 2008. The U6 rate captures a wider group including those who work part-time but would like full time jobs, as well as people who have stopped looking for work. \n\"The thing that's going to be taken away from this a few days from now is going to be the drop in the unemployment rate to 4.6 percent. Even the U6 number fell. It was a broad-based drop in the unemployment rate,\" said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. \"At the end of the day, we made another notch down in the unemployment rate and ultimately that's going to be leading to more pressure on wages and costs. With wages down today, that may not be the story today, but it will be in a week. A huge drop in unemployment … I think that's going to be the part that sticks.\" \nA big focus for markets and economists has been wage growth, which has lagged with stubbornly low inflation. But there are signs that both are picking up, and the November number is going against the trend, said Swonk. \n\"You've got to take it in context. Last month was an extraordinary jump,\" she said. \"I'm not happy with it … but at the end of the day the wage number was really strong in October, so you take a moving average and that's what the Fed will do.\" The Fed rate announcement is expected after its meeting on Dec. 14. \nThe Commerce Department Wednesday reported that personal income rose in October by 0.6 percent, the fast growth rate since April and up from 0.4 percent in September. \nThe employment report also showed that the labor participation rate declined slightly to 62.7 percent, signalling fewer Americans in the work force and a factor in the unemployment rate.

If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo More (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Friday it will recall about 680,000 of its Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans to fix a seat belt issue. About 602,000 of the vehicles recalled are in the U.S. market and about 650,000 of them are in North America as a whole. A small amount of Ford Mondeo sedans are also being recalled, but none of them are in North America. Ford said it is aware of two accidents and two injuries associated with the issue. Model years of the cars involved differs, depending on the specific versions, but all in a range of 2013 to 2016. The recall campaign seeks to fix seat belts that do not operate properly in high temperatures. (Bernie Woodall)",

      "text": "Follow KRLD: Facebook | Twitter \nDETROIT (AP) – Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.   rewritten or redistributed.)",

When the pretensioners are activated, the heat generated can cause the cables connected to the belts to separate, which in turn can prevent the seat belts from effectively restraining the occupant. This can lead to injuries.\n\nInjuries/Deaths: Ford reports two accidents and two injuries have occurred that are related to this recall.\n\nThe fix: A dealer technician will inject an insulation coating around the pretensioner. This should effectively keep the heat away from the cables, ensuring the seat belt will properly restrain the user in a collision.\n\nIf you own one: Affected owners should bring in their vehicles to a local dealer to have the issue corrected. The dealer will implement the fix free of charge to the owner.",

But analyst Dennis DesRosiers said in a note to clients that the automaker sold 20,674 vehicles during the month, down 1.7 percent compared with the same period a year earlier.\nAnalysts said the November rebound in industry volumes, following a trend of weakening demand over the last three months, keeps Canada on track to set another record this year, with sales rising to around 1.96 million vehicles from a record-breaking 1.90 million units in 2015.\n\"For those claiming that 2016 had run out of steam, November 2016 light vehicle sales showed a different picture altogether as sales increased 10.4 percent year-over-year,\" DesRosiers wrote Thursday afternoon.\nScotiabank economist Carlos Gomes wrote in a note the rebound was driven by a surge in light truck volumes, especially large SUVs and mid-size pickup trucks.\nDespite November's rebound, Gomes wrote that he expects \"Canadian passenger vehicle sales to begin to edge lower in 2017, as manufacturers raise prices due to the recent weakness of the Canadian dollar.\"\nGM dealers delivered 28,523 vehicles in November, up 31 percent compared with November 2015, the company said in a statement. GM Canada sales are up 2 percent year-to-date.\nFord said it sold 24,472 vehicles in November, up 18 percent compared with the same month a year earlier. Ford reported a 10 percent rise in Canadian auto sales for the first 11 months of 2016, on an annual basis.\nAutomaker Toyota <7203.T> reported 16,492 units sold in Canada last month, up 4.2 percent compared with November 2015.\nIn the United States, hefty consumer discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4 and 5 percent, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015, economists and industry analysts said on Thursday.\n(Reporting by Allison Lampert; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and James Dalgleish)",

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) The Associated Press \nDETROIT • Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping.",

      "title": "Ford Seatbelt Recall: How To Get It Fixed For Free And Find Out If Your Vehicle Is Affected",
      "text": "12/02/16 AT 10:48 AM Close \nFord Motor Co. announced Friday a recall of 650,000 vehicles because of issues with seatbelts. The problem could mean that in the event of a crash, the seatbelt might not be able to properly restrain a passenger. \nIn its press release announcing the recall, Ford said it was aware of two injuries related to the issue. The problem could apparently allow important cables in the seatbelt to separate during a crash. \n\"In the affected vehicles, increased temperatures generated during deployment of the seat belt anchor pretensioner could cause pretensioner cables to separate, which may inadequately restrain an occupant in a crash, increasing risk of injury,\" Ford wrote. \nThe recall affects certain Ford Fusions, Ford Mondeos and Lincoln MKZs with model years between 2013 and 2016. Of the more than 680,000 affected vehicles, 602,739 are in the U.S., 35,615 in Canada, 8,665 in Mexico and 653 elsewhere. Related Stories Heinz Recalls Gravy Over Mislabeling \nOwners of affected vehicles will be notified, USA Today reported . To repair the issue, a Ford dealer will inject insulation to keep the cables from overheating at higher temperatures. The vehicle owner won't have to pay for the work. \nThere have been a number of recent recalls, reportedly costing automakers some $6.9 billion last year. Most notably, some 11 million Takata airbags have been recalled over the past two years affecting dozens of carmakers, including BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Toyota and Volkswagen. Safety officials in the U.S. have linked at least 11 deaths to the airbags, which can explode and send dangerous shrapnel flying. Some 70 million Takata airbags could be defective. \nOutside of the large seatbelt recall, Ford also announced Friday a much smaller recall of 27 2017 Fusions. The company said it has to \"replace the second-row left-rear seat back frame, which may have been built with improperly welded pivot pins.\" Ford said it was not aware of any injuries related to the issue, but that in the event of a crash the affected vehicles may not \"adequately retain cargo,\" which increased that chance of injury.",

If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Related Items:",

      "text": "SHARE \nWith wide-open highways and multilane suburban streets, U.S. roads are friendly proving grounds for self-driving vehicles. By contrast, the narrow streets of European cities are more challenging territory for autonomous technology. Ford intends to gain autonomous experience in European environments, and the company said it will deploy at least one of its Fusion hybrid research vehicles in Europe early next year. \nEngineers from Ford’s research and development facilities in Aachen and Cologne, Germany, and the company’s engineering center in Essex, England, are jointly leading the testing program, according to a company spokesperson. Their focus will be on adapting autonomous technology for European conditions. \n“Rules of the road vary from country to country here, traffic signs and road layouts are different, and drivers are likely to share congested roads with cyclists,” said Thomas Lukaszewicz, manager of automated driving for Ford of Europe. \nThe program will start with a single vehicle in early 2017, but that number is expected to grow. Even with a few more cars, those numbers will still be small in comparison with Ford’s autonomous operations in the United Sates, where the company tripled the size of its fleet from 10 to 30 cars this year and intends to triple it again in 2017 for continued testing in California, Arizona, and Michigan. \nFord is the first American manufacturer to extend its autonomous testing overseas, although it won’t be the first time the company has looked to Europe to test some of its forward-looking technologies. Earlier this year, Ford conducted a pilot project in London that explored how customers could summon on-demand shuttles via an app.",

      "text": "DEARBORNE, Mich. – About 680,000 Ford Fusions and Lincoln MKZs are being recalled by the manufacturer because a problem that could cause seat belts to fail during a crash.\nFord Motor Company announced Friday that certain 2013-16 Ford Fusion, 2015-16 Ford Mondeo and 2013-15 Lincoln MKZ vehicles are being recalled. The company said the seat belt anchor pretensioners on the driver and front passenger seat belts need to be serviced to prevent them from failing during a crash. If the pretensioner cables separate during a collision, the belts may not adequately restrain passengers during a crash, the company said. \nFord said that at least two accidents and two injuries have been linked to the seat belt problem. \nThe affected vehicles include: \n2013-15 Fusion vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Nov. 2, 2012 to July 31, 2014 2013 Fusion vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Aug. 13, 2012 to Nov. 1, 2012 2015-16 Fusion vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Aug. 1, 2014 to April 2, 2016 2015-16 Fusion vehicles built at Flat Rock Assembly Plant, Aug. 1, 2014 to Feb. 22, 2016 2014-15 Fusion vehicles built at Flat Rock Assembly Plant, April 12, 2013 to July 31, 2014 2013-15 MKZ vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Nov. 14, 2012 to July 31, 2014 2015-16 Mondeo vehicles built at Valencia Assembly Plant, Aug. 5, 2014 to July 31, 2016 Ford dealers will service the seat belts at no cost to the owner.\nThe Ford website has more information on the recall.

If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem.\nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping.\nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16.\nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The month keeps Canada on track to set another record this year, with sales rising to around 1.96 million vehicles from a record-breaking 1.90 million units in 2015. \nIn a note to clients, Canadian autos analyst Dennis DesRosiers said auto sales hit double-digit growth during November and were up 3 percent year-to-date. \n\"For those claiming that 2016 had run out of steam, November 2016 light vehicle sales showed a different picture altogether as sales increased 10.4 percent year-over-year,\" DesRosiers wrote on Thursday. \nScotiabank economist Carlos Gomes wrote in a note that the rebound was driven by a surge in light truck volumes, especially large SUVs and mid-size pickup trucks. \nDespite November's rebound, Gomes said he expects \"Canadian passenger vehicle sales to begin to edge lower in 2017, as manufacturers raise prices due to the recent weakness of the Canadian dollar.\" \nGM dealers delivered 28,523 vehicles in November, up 31 percent compared with November 2015, the company said in a statement. GM Canada sales are up 2 percent year-to-date. \nFord said it sold 24,472 vehicles in November, up 18 percent compared with the same month a year earlier. Ford reported a 10 percent rise in Canadian auto sales for the first 11 months of 2016, on an annual basis. \nToyota reported 16,492 units sold in Canada last month, up 4.2 percent compared with November 2015. \nIn the United States, hefty consumer discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4 and 5 percent, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015, economists and industry analysts said on Thursday.

      "text": "Privacy policy | More Newsletters Getty Images, File A Ford Fusion seen on a Miami dealership lot on September 26, 2014. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. The recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. Ford says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. Pre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. Americans To Spend 1.5 Times More on Christmas For Pets It looks like pets made Santa's \"nice\" list this year, as Americans are set to spend 1.5 times the amount of cash on their furry friends as they did in 2015. (Published 3 hours ago) Dealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. Most of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",

If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc. All  ",

      "title": "Manufacturing Coming Back To The U.S.? Look At Cognex",
      "text": "Manufacturing Coming Back To The U.S.? Look At Cognex Dec. 2.16 Send Message Summary \nFord and United Technologies both seem to have agreed to keep manufacturing jobs inside the United States, great news for investors and employees. \nEven Apple has been rumored to be kicking around the idea of making the iPhone inside the United States. \nFactory jobs of old are romanticized by the media. Instead, classic assembly line jobs are being replaced with lean manufacturing and incredible automation. \nThere are many ways for investors to approach this but I'm suggesting going with a mid-cap company that already has a solid footing in the machine vision and automation industry. President-Elect Donald Trump based most of his campaign on a few key issues, one of which was keeping jobs in America and punishing companies who outsourced to foreign labor. Regardless of how you feel about Mr. Trump his victory has sent shockwaves through the investing world. Beaten down companies like Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ) and John Deere (NYSE: DE ) enjoyed significant rallies with the hopes that infrastructure spending would ramp up. The defense sector saw substantial appreciation as well based on his remarks on the size of our military and his desire to eliminate the sequestration. Banks and finance stocks saw the best gains they've ever experienced in such a short period of time and added hundreds of billions to their valuations just based on the hope that Mr. Trump would be more friendly and perhaps ease some regulations. Yes, Mr. Trump was incredibly disruptive to the markets, and so far his promise to keep jobs in the US seems to be working out. On the 28th it was announced that Carrier, a subsidiary of United Technologies (NYSE: UTX ), agreed to keep about 1,000 manufacturing jobs in Indiana instead of shipping them to Mexico where labor is cheaper. Earlier in the month Mr. Trump announced that Ford (NYSE: F ) had agreed to keep about 4,700 jobs in Kentucky. Whether or not Ford had ever planned to move the jobs is in question, but Mr. Trump was incredibly critical of the auto maker during his campaign. Lately the big rumor has been that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) would be moving some iPhone production to the United States seemingly to avoid a quarrel with the new administration since the President-Elect had been hyper-critical of Apple and called them out by name multiple times during many speeches. The promise to keep manufacturing and factory jobs in the United States materializes images of bedraggled salt-of-the-earth men toiling at an assembly line for a fair wage to support their families. (Source: Ford ) The reality is actually quite different, at least in a truly modern factory. Gone are throngs of employees and loud clanky machines that pushed the product further down the line. Many of today's factories, especially ones that manufacture electronics, look more like laboratories. (Source: TheStreet ) Robots and machines that can \"see\" what they are doing are quickly overtaking factories. Investors may remember when Foxconn ( OTC:FXCOF ), a primary manufacturer of the iPhone, replaced 60,000 human workers with robots and machines earlier this year. This is not a singular event and year after year we are seeing more human jobs get replaced by robots. Whether it be the hotel in Japan that has nothing but robots , or the robot McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) in Phoenix, the writing is on the wall and chances are a robot is putting it there; robots are here to stay. Just like sewing machines replaced dozens of humans and the automobile put hundreds of horses out of a job and into the glue factory, robots will keep replacing human workers and there is nothing we can do about it. As investors we shouldn't get caught up in the emotional responses many of us may have, instead we should focus our energy on how we can win and make our portfolios great again. Many large industrial companies have machine automation segments such as Emerson Electric (NYSE: EMR ) and 3M (NYSE: MMM ), but all those robots need a way to see and there aren't many pure-play \"machine-vision\" companies. Enter Cognex (NASDAQ: CGNX ), a machine-vision company with a long history in the industry. (Source: Cognex ) I've written about Cognex once before , and so far the investment has actually worked out quite well since that time appreciating nearly 42%. Cognex is an interesting one right down to their corporate culture. Check out their 2015 Annual Report for a good example. As zany as their founder may appear, he must be doing something right because the company has been growing revenue at a 7.4% annualized clip for the past nine years and is set for another great year of 8% plus revenue gains. Earnings per share has grown by 19.7% annualized during this time giving us insight into the quality management team that leads Cognex. They enjoy great margins with the past couple years hovering around 77% gross margins and almost 30% operating margins. The company makes their money by selling into several end markets such as automotive manufacturing, electronics manufacturing, food and beverage processing and manufacturing and consumer products manufacturing such as razors and furniture. Cognex's double-edged sword comes in the form of a certain customer they have in the consumer electronics. This from their most recent 10-Q is pretty telling: \nRevenue for the third quarter of 2016 totaled $147,952,000, representing an increase of $40,365,000, or 38%, from the third quarter of 2015. Although the majority of this increase came from a material customer in the consumer electronics industry... That customer is Apple as disclosed in the 2014 10-K , and last year the company accounted for 18% of their total revenue according to their 10-K for that year (Page 2). Though Apple is their largest customer and their revenue from them keeps growing year over year, they do sell to other large manufacturers such as Proctor and Gamble (NYSE: PG ), Unilever (NYSE: UL ) (NYSE: UN ), BMW ( OTCPK:BMWYY ), Johnson and Johnson (NYSE: JNJ ), Bosch ( OTC:BSWQY ), Kia Motors ( OTC:KIMTF ), and Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) ( OTC:SSNNF ) to name a few of the dozens . The company invests heavily into research and development and in their third quarter spent $15 million to push the envelope of their business. The investment is paying off and the company disclosed a breakthrough in an essential part of their business with the In-Sight camera line. \nMoving on to new product introductions. We expanded our In-Sight product line to include the world's worst multi-smart camera vision system. The new In-Sight VC200 can connect and manage up to four smart cameras at the same time without diminished performance, unlike any of our competitors' solutions. This is important as manufacturers look for vision systems to work together to solve inspection tasks that require multiple views of an object on fast-moving production lines. The gap is being closed between what a machine and camera can do and what a human being can do. The current valuation is what some would describe as \"nose-bleed\" and they are reaching back into historically high levels. CGNX PE Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts The price has also been running away from the underlying valuation metrics for most of 2016. At these levels, that is concerning, but with strong sales to Apple and strong year over year increases in revenue and earnings the company may be able to grow into their price. If you are looking for a way to profit off of manufacturing potentially returning to the United States consider Cognex. The company is a time-tested success in the machine-vision industry and is already selling to many of the companies that may increase their presence in the United States to avoid protectionist policies that may or may not come out of the incoming administration.

      "text": "Friday, December 02, 2016 10:44AM DETROIT -- Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash.The recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars.Ford says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem.Pre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping.Dealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16.Most of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Related Topics:",

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) \nDETROIT (AP) — Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. More Headlines",

      "text": "December 2, 2016 — American | 3 Comments Lacquered Flatty: 1929 Ford Roadster \nThis 1929 Ford roadster is a great looking custom powered by a 239ci 59A flatty V8 wearing some cool period speed parts. Somewhat unusually, it hasn’t been channeled, helping to preserve interior space that’s already at a premium to begin with, and a modern 5-speed manual should make for good drivability, too. The seller says it runs and drives excellently, and that it’s ready to go anywhere. Find it here on Jalopy Journal in Orange, California for $38,500. \nA-V8’s like this are the bread and butter of vintage hot rodding, but it’s rare to see one this nicely finished. A Deuce grill joins a claimed original bronze Doty DuVall windshield, and paint is proper lacquer–in combo with minimal brightwork and smooth sides, it makes for a sleek, mean, all-business look. While provided details are few, we’re guessing that the car wears “juice” brakes (given the dual reservoir master cylinder on the firewall), although the real centerpiece here is definitely the full-dress flatty. Wearing finned, higher compression heads, a dual-carb intake and Fenton-style headers, it’s a safe bet that the car is making more than the factory-rated 100 HP. \nThe A’s classic lines shine here, and it’s clear that considerable time was spent on body prep, as paint finish looks miles deep. Hairpin radius rods suspend the front axle, and staggered bias-ply blackwalls on black steelies with FORD caps are perfect. Other details like the race-style fuel filler, ’39 Ford taillights, perhaps a partial belly-pan and barely visible pencil-tip twice-pipes really shine. We’re intrigued by the two early hemi-powered cars in the above photo, in particular the magnesium wheeled coupe to the right. \nTraditionally styled inside, red leather and carpets look used though not not abused, while a modified seat gets you down out of the wind. The shifter for the T5 appears to fall right to hand, but the ad is frustratingly mute on mechanical spec. While some might argue that the modern-style steering column ruins an otherwise period styled interior, we’re happy to let it slide given that the tilt function alone should increase the comfort level by a big margin.

      "text": "Trump''s Carrier Talks Up the Ante for Ford December 02, 2016, 12:42:00 PM   Trump's Carrier Talks Up the Ante for Ford By John D. Stoll \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's deal with United Technologies Corp.'s Carrier this week to keep some jobs from moving to Mexico raises the stakes for another company that faced substantial criticism during the campaign: Ford Motor Co. \nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker offered an olive branch to Mr. Trump last month by deciding to keep production of a low-volume Lincoln product in Kentucky, rather than stick to its plan to eventually build it in Mexico. That is just a minor victory for the incoming administration because Ford is well on its way to spending $1.6 billion to build a new factory in Mexico for production of much higher-volume compact Focus cars. \nWhat's behind Ford'sMexico strategy? \nFord'sMexico plan has been long in the making and is the only way that executives expect they can stanch the losses associated with small-car production. Compacts, sedans and coupes aren't popular and command far lower prices than the trucks and SUVs that deliver most of the profits for auto makers selling in the U.S. Still, many industry participants see them as necessary to meet fuel-economy standards because they help bring down the fleet average. That is why cars like the Focus are referred to as \"compliance cars\" in the industry. \nMr. Trump's administration is expected to take another look at stringent fuel-economy standards in place through 2025, but auto makers need to make investment decisions several years before they actually produce a car. Mexican production not only cuts the labor costs going into a Ford Focus, it also opens up more markets for export seeing that Mexico has dozens of free-trade agreements. More export destinations lessens the potential for unused factory capacity, which is the most common reason that auto makers burn cash. \nIs moving to Mexico the only way to deal with unprofitable small car production? \nNo. \nGeneral Motors Co. builds several models of small cars in the U.S. and has made no indication it plans to change that strategy. In 2009, as part of terms of its government bailout, the auto maker agreed to keep a small car plant open in Michigan. That factory operates well below its capacity, but it appears to be under no threat of closing. The auto maker also utilizes other factories in Michigan and Ohio for small-car output. GM hasn't disclosed the financial performance of its individual vehicle lines. \n(GM's CEO is among a group of business leaders set to meet periodically with Mr. Trump beginning in February). \nFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV doesn't see small-car sales as a key method for meeting fuel-economy requirements. As a result, it is converting all of its U.S. car-assembly capacity into light-truck capacity. This means that Dodge Darts and Chrysler 200s are no longer made in the U.S. as of Friday. Next year, the company will complete costly conversions of plants in Illinois and Michigan for production of the small Jeep Cherokee SUV and the large Ram pickup truck. Fiat Chrysler cut 1,300 jobs earlier this year due to slack demand for the 200; the company estimates 1,000 will be added when the converted factories begin humming again. \nDo Detroit auto makers rely much on Mexico? \nAbout 17% of the Detroit 3's North American output is currently sourced from Mexico, according to WardsAuto.com, but all three auto makers could see that percentage increase in coming years due to planned investments. That compares to 21% for the broader auto industry. \nHow many people will lose their jobs due to Ford'sMexico move? \nFord has repeatedly said no one will lose their jobs as a result of moving small cars to Mexico. Here's why: U.S. auto factory workers are relatively expensive and executives want them building their highest-margin vehicles. In the case of Ford, that means taking the United Auto Workers members currently assembling Focuses and redeploying them in 2018 to make a new model of a pickup truck and a new SUV. Because so few people want a Ford Focus these days, the transition could actually be a win for the UAW. \nBut it isn't all good news. It wasn't too long ago Ford was saying UAW labor could profitably build small cars. The company has thrown in the towel on that idea, and so there will be thousands of new workers on Ford's payroll who aren't located in the U.S. -- and that is a defeat for the UAW and ultimately a blow to U.S. manufacturing. \nAnd, Ford is putting all its American manufacturing eggs in the light-truck basket, a move that could come back to bite the company if gasoline prices were to spike and demand for pickups and SUVs plummets as a result. More than 60% of vehicles sold in November were light trucks; but it was only a few years ago when that light-truck mix was well below 50%. Memories don't need to be too long to remember when Ford and its domestic counterparts cut a lot of jobs because truck demand was drying up. \nHow would a Trump tariff of 35% affect the price of a Ford Focus? \nA basically equipped Ford Focus can currently be had for about $15,000, factoring in incentive, making it one of the more affordable cars on the market. To get Ford's most basic SUV, the Escape, the price tag goes up to about $23,000 even though the two vehicles aren't radically different when it comes to underlying parts. \nMr. Trump has proposed slapping a 35% tariff on a product like the Focus if it were to move to Mexico, and that would jack the price tag to above $20,000. Based on today's sales levels of between 150,000 to 200,000 Focuses sold a year, such a tax would add hundreds of millions in additional cost that the buyer or the auto maker would need to shoulder. \nWrite to John D.

      "text": "Ford Motor Co.'s stock slumped 1.5% in midday trade Friday, reversing an earlier 1.2% intraday gain, after the auto maker issued two safety recalls involving more than 650,000 Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ model cars. \"In the affected vehicles, increased temperatures generated during deployment of the seat belt anchor pretensioner could cause pretensioner cables to separate, which may inadequately restrain an occupant in a crash, increasing risk of injury,\" Ford said in a statement. The recall is for Fusions built from 2013 to 2016 and for Lincolns built from 2013 to 2015. Ford said 680,872 vehicles are affected, including 602,739 in the U.S., 35,614 in Canada and 8,665 in Mexico. Ford shares had closed Thursday at a two-month high after Ford's November sales report. They have now shed 13% year to date, while General Motors Co.'s stock has gained 4.5% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.03% has climbed 7.2%.",

Advertisement \nDuring an appearance on \"The View\" on Wednesday , Ford said he had been asked to dress Melania Trump \"quite a few years ago\" and declined because \"she's not necessarily my image.\" \nFord said he is a Democrat and voted for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, but added that even had Clinton won, she shouldn't have worn his clothes because \"they're too expensive.\" He said his clothes cost a lot to make and the president needs to \"relate to everybody.\" \nAsked if Melania Trump should wear expensive clothes, Ford replied: \"I'm going to leave that to Melania.\" \nDesigner Sophie Theallat wrote an open letter last month urging colleagues not to dress Melania Trump.

      "title": "Trump's Carrier Talks Up the Ante for Ford",
      "text": "By John D. Stoll\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's deal with United Technologies Corp.'s Carrier this week to keep some jobs from moving to Mexico raises the stakes for another company that faced substantial criticism during the campaign: Ford Motor Co.\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker offered an olive branch to Mr. Trump last month by deciding to keep production of a low-volume Lincoln product in Kentucky, rather than stick to its plan to eventually build it in Mexico. That is just a minor victory for the incoming administration because Ford is well on its way to spending $1.6 billion to build a new factory in Mexico for production of much higher-volume compact Focus cars.\nHere's the background on where things stand:\nWhat's behind Ford's Mexico strategy?\nFord's Mexico plan has been long in the making and is the only way that executives expect they can stanch the losses associated with small-car production. Compacts, sedans and coupes aren't popular and command far lower prices than the trucks and SUVs that deliver most of the profits for auto makers selling in the U.S. Still, many industry participants see them as necessary to meet fuel-economy standards because they help bring down the fleet average. That is why cars like the Focus are referred to as \"compliance cars\" in the industry.\nMr. Trump's administration is expected to take another look at stringent fuel-economy standards in place through 2025, but auto makers need to make investment decisions several years before they actually produce a car. Mexican production not only cuts the labor costs going into a Ford Focus, it also opens up more markets for export seeing that Mexico has dozens of free-trade agreements. More export destinations lessens the potential for unused factory capacity, which is the most common reason that auto makers burn cash.\nIs moving to Mexico the only way to deal with unprofitable small car production?\nNo.\nGeneral Motors Co. builds several models of small cars in the U.S. and has made no indication it plans to change that strategy. In 2009, as part of terms of its government bailout, the auto maker agreed to keep a small car plant open in Michigan. That factory operates well below its capacity, but it appears to be under no threat of closing. The auto maker also utilizes other factories in Michigan and Ohio for small-car output. GM hasn't disclosed the financial performance of its individual vehicle lines.\n(GM's CEO is among a group of business leaders set to meet periodically with Mr. Trump beginning in February).\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV doesn't see small-car sales as a key method for meeting fuel-economy requirements. As a result, it is converting all of its U.S. car-assembly capacity into light-truck capacity. This means that Dodge Darts and Chrysler 200s are no longer made in the U.S. as of Friday. Next year, the company will complete costly conversions of plants in Illinois and Michigan for production of the small Jeep Cherokee SUV and the large Ram pickup truck. Fiat Chrysler cut 1,300 jobs earlier this year due to slack demand for the 200; the company estimates 1,000 will be added when the converted factories begin humming again.\nDo Detroit auto makers rely much on Mexico?\nAbout 17% of the Detroit 3's North American output is currently sourced from Mexico, according to WardsAuto.com, but all three auto makers could see that percentage increase in coming years due to planned investments. That compares to 21% for the broader auto industry.\nHow many people will lose their jobs due to Ford's Mexico move?\nFord has repeatedly said no one will lose their jobs as a result of moving small cars to Mexico. Here's why: U.S. auto factory workers are relatively expensive and executives want them building their highest-margin vehicles. In the case of Ford, that means taking the United Auto Workers members currently assembling Focuses and redeploying them in 2018 to make a new model of a pickup truck and a new SUV. Because so few people want a Ford Focus these days, the transition could actually be a win for the UAW.\nBut it isn't all good news. It wasn't too long ago Ford was saying UAW labor could profitably build small cars. The company has thrown in the towel on that idea, and so there will be thousands of new workers on Ford's payroll who aren't located in the U.S. -- and that is a defeat for the UAW and ultimately a blow to U.S. manufacturing.\nAnd, Ford is putting all its American manufacturing eggs in the light-truck basket, a move that could come back to bite the company if gasoline prices were to spike and demand for pickups and SUVs plummets as a result. More than 60% of vehicles sold in November were light trucks; but it was only a few years ago when that light-truck mix was well below 50%. Memories don't need to be too long to remember when Ford and its domestic counterparts cut a lot of jobs because truck demand was drying up.\nHow would a Trump tariff of 35% affect the price of a Ford Focus?\nA basically equipped Ford Focus can currently be had for about $15,000, factoring in incentive, making it one of the more affordable cars on the market. To get Ford's most basic SUV, the Escape, the price tag goes up to about $23,000 even though the two vehicles aren't radically different when it comes to underlying parts.\nMr. Trump has proposed slapping a 35% tariff on a product like the Focus if it were to move to Mexico, and that would jack the price tag to above $20,000. Based on today's sales levels of between 150,000 to 200,000 Focuses sold a year, such a tax would add hundreds of millions in additional cost that the buyer or the auto maker would need to shoulder.\nWrite to John D.
