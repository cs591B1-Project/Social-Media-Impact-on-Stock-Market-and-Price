      "text": "Ford will be the first automaker to import cars from India to the U.S. by Chris Isidore @CNNMoney November 16, 2016: 11:55 AM ET Ford CEO: 35% tariff would impact U.S. workers Ford Motors, already under fire from President-elect Trump for importing cars from Mexico, will soon become the first U.S. automaker to import vehicles from India. \nThe company said the EcoSport compact crossover, introduced for the U.S. market at the Los Angeles auto show Monday, will be shipped here from India starting in 2018. \nThe EcoSport, which is a small SUV, has been built at a Ford's assembly plant in Chennai, India for more than 100 markets around the world since 2013. About a 15% of the plant's production sold in India. Subcompact SUVs are a huge business in the U.S., accounting for the biggest segment of the auto market, according to data from Kelley Blue Book. The EcoSport will be Ford's smallest SUV. \nRelated: Ford unveils new SUV on Snapchat \nGM ( GM ) started importing the Buick Envision , another compact crossover, from China to the U.S. market in May, and has sold about 8,500 of them so far. Volvo, which is owned by Chinese automaker Geely , started importing the S60 Inscription from China in September 2015. \nBut Ford will be the first automaker to ever import cars from India into the U.S. market, despite the growing auto industry there, and its lower labor costs. U.S. trade data shows Canada exports the most vehicles to the United States, by dollar volume, followed by Japan, Europe and then Mexico. About 80% of cars sold in the United States are made at U.S. auto plants, according to sales tracker Autodata. \nRelated: Ford CEO - Donald Trump is wrong about Mexico \nFord's plan to shift all of its small car production to Mexico has became a hot-button topic during the recent presidential election. Ford ( F ) is not laying off any U.S. workers as a result of the move. Instead Ford's U.S. workers will be build larger, more profitable SUVs. \nStill, Trump has vowed to impose a 35% tax on cars that are built in Mexico for the U.S. market, which he says will force automakers to bring jobs back to U.S. plants. Experts question whether that tax will bring any cars back to U.S. auto plants, speculating that it's more likely that automakers will simply stop building small cars if they can't be built in low wage countries like Mexico. \nFord CEO Mark Fields told CNN on Tuesday that said a tariff would hurt the U.S. economy and workers.

      "text": "Filed in: Entertainment , Television Steve Harvey speaks at the 2015 Ford Neighborhood Awards Hosted By Steve Harvey at Phillips Arena on August 8, 2015 in Atlanta, Georgia. (Photo by Moses Robinson/Getty Images for Neighborhood Awards) \nAfter five seasons, Steve Harvey ‘s talk show is drawing to a close, but he won’t be leaving daytime television. \n“ The Steve Harvey Show ” is on its way out, but a new talk show will start up in September to take its place. The new show would be based in Los Angeles, which will be much easier for Harvey, as that is where NBC’s “Little Big Shots” and ABC’s “Funderdome” are produced, with “Celebrity Family Feud” being filmed in Atlanta but in batches, allowing Harvey easier travel. \nHarvey will also reportedly gain ownership and creative control with the new show, which he has long sought, and with the show set in LA, it is likely that it will be more celebrity-driven than before, though of course, it will retain the comedy that its host is known for. \n“The Steve Harvey Show” will wrap production in May. The show has consistently done well in talk television, ranking fourth after “Dr. Phil ,” “Ellen” and “Live With Kelly” among viewers. So Harvey’s continued talk show presence will be a relief to longtime fans of his, even if it is in a different location and a different show. Related Posts",

      "text": "Ford will be the first automaker to import cars from India to US EcoSport will be shipped from India in 2018 Author: By Chris Isidore William Walker/CNN NEW YORK (CNNMoney) - \nFord Motors, already under fire from President-elect Donald Trump for importing cars from Mexico, will soon become the first U.S. automaker to import vehicles from India. The company said the EcoSport compact crossover, introduced for the U.S. market at the Los Angeles auto show Monday, will be shipped here from India starting in 2018. Related Content Auto safety champion Ditlow dies \nThe EcoSport, which is a small SUV, has been built at a Ford's assembly plant in Chennai, India for more than 100 markets around the world since 2013. About a 15% of the plant's production sold in India. Subcompact SUVs are a huge business in the U.S., accounting for the biggest segment of the auto market, according to data from Kelley Blue Book. The EcoSport will be Ford's smallest SUV. \nGM started importing the Buick Envision, another compact crossover, from China to the U.S. market in May, and has sold about 8,500 of them so far. Volvo, which is owned by Chinese automaker Geely, started importing the S60 Inscription from China in September 2015. \nBut Ford will be the first automaker to ever import cars from India into the U.S. market, despite the growing auto industry there, and its lower labor costs. U.S. trade data shows Canada exports the most vehicles to the United States, by dollar volume, followed by Japan, Europe and then Mexico. About 80% of cars sold in the United States are made at U.S. auto plants, according to sales tracker Autodata. \nFord's plan to shift all of its small car production to Mexico has became a hot-button topic during the recent presidential election. Ford is not laying off any U.S. workers as a result of the move. Instead Ford's U.S. workers will be build larger, more profitable SUVs. \nStill, Trump has vowed to impose a 35% tax on cars that are built in Mexico for the U.S. market, which he says will force automakers to bring jobs back to U.S. plants. Experts question whether that tax will bring any cars back to U.S. auto plants, speculating that it's more likely that automakers will simply stop building small cars if they can't be built in low wage countries like Mexico. \nFord CEO Mark Fields told CNN on Tuesday that said a tariff would hurt the U.S. economy and workers. \nCopyright 2016 by CNN NewSource .

      "text": "Report: Ford F-150 Getting Next-Gen 4.8L V-8   Edward A. Sanchez \nFor the last five years, Ford has been aggressively pursuing downsized, turbocharged engines across its vehicle lineup. However, a significant percentage of F-150 buyers still prefer the naturally aspirated 5.0L Coyote V-8 over the 3.5L or 2.7L EcoBoost V-6 engines. Although the Coyote is still fairly fresh, dating from just 2011 and producing a competitive 385 hp and 387 hp from its 302 cubic inches, Ford is not letting up on the innovation and development. In a Reuters report about Ford’s $447 million investment in its Windsor, Ontario, Canada, engine plants, a report about a next-generation 4.8L V-8 engine leaked out. \nLittle is known about the engine other than the fact it will replace the 5.0L at the Essex engine plant and is expected to be a “high volume” engine. An engine specifically made for the Super Duty is also planned, presumably replacing the current 6.2L gas engine. The 6.8L V-10 will also reportedly continue to be produced for applications such as the F-650 and the E-Series cutaway vans. \nThe 4.8L will likely top the current 5.0L in power and fuel economy and will almost certainly be paired to the new 10-speed automatic that debuted on the 2017 F-150 with the 3.5L EcoBoost V-6 . Direct or dual (direct and port) fuel injection will likely be part of the plan, as well as auto stop-start. Some sort of cylinder deactivation system could also appear to optimize economy at light loads. Taking the speculation a step further, it’s likely the 4.8L could be the basis for a future Mustang engine, either with or without forced induction. Interestingly, the 4.8L displacement translates to approximately 292 cubic inches, a displacement most commonly associated with the Ford Y-block V-8 from the ’50s.",

      "text": "Ford in fight for teams’ title at WEC season finale Ford in fight for teams’ title at WEC season finale   Ford GT \nThe Ford Chip Ganassi Racing team is in the Kingdom of Bahrain this week for the final round of the 2016 FIA World Endurance Championship. \nAfter two wins in a row for the #67 Ford GT, the GTE Pro teams’ title is within reach, although the latest Balance of Performance changes will make it a challenging target. Andy Priaulx (GB) and Harry Tincknell (GB) need to finish ahead of the current leader (#95 Aston Martin) to snatch the title. Anything could happen though, as the Ferraris are still in the hunt as is the sister #66 Ford GT crew of Stefan Mücke (GER) and Olivier Pla (FRA) who will be pushing hard for their first win of the season. \n“Who would have thought that in our debut World Endurance Championship season we would be heading into the final race with a long shot at the teams’ title?” said Dave Pericak, Ford Performance global director. “The last two races have been incredible for the team. The Fuji track suited us but the win in Shanghai was even sweeter as we had to work harder for it. We now have a very exciting finale to look forward to in Bahrain.” \nIt was the #67 Ford GT crew of Andy Priaulx and Harry Tincknell who took the wins in Fuji and Shanghai so they are hoping for a hat trick in Bahrain, as Tincknell explains. \n“Confidence is really high in the camp, especially on the #67 side of the garage where we've had two wins in a row,” Tincknell said. “The mechanics have worked so hard on the car and improving their pit stops, while the car is getting faster with every race. I said going into Fuji that I wanted three podiums from the last three races so to have won the last two is really incredible. I want to reach that target and it will be extra hard now with the performance adjustments but going for a hat trick of wins would be a fantastic achievement for a team reaching the end of its first year in the World Championship. \n“If we can take the title for the team it will be a huge testament to every single person who has worked on the programme this year,” he continued. “Once the race starts Andy and I will be pushing 100 per cent to achieve just that.” \nBahrain is expected to be a hot and humid race where tyre degradation will once again be key. It's a high-speed circuit with some long straights, fast corners and big stops, which should suit the Ford GT. \nStefan Mücke and Olivier Pla are highly motivated to grab their first win of the season in Bahrain. \n“We’re feeling good going into the last race of the season,” Mücke said. “I really like the Bahrain circuit; it has an interesting layout and I have always had good pace there. Bahrain is a special race as we run into the night, which can make tyre choice a real challenge as the temperature can drop quickly. We are more than ready for this and can’t want to get into the battle.” \nThe final pole position of the WEC season will be decided during a 20-minute qualifying session on Friday at 17:00 local time (15:00 CET). The Bapco 6 Hours of Bahrain gets underway on Saturday at 16:00 (14:00 CET).",

The long answer is as follows. \nEleven Triad high school teams will travel to Western North Carolina on Friday for football playoff games. Ten of those teams will play in areas affected by raging wildfires. So far, none of the games have been canceled or postponed to a different day. \nNorthwest Guilford Vikings will play against Myers Park in Charlotte, an area where smoke is billowing over the city. \n“It could change dramatically within a day from morning to evening and from day to day as different weather patterns affect the way the air pollution is mixing and being dispersed in the atmosphere,” said Minor Barnett. \nBarnett’s team at the Forsyth County Office of Environmental Assistance and Protection is tasked with making air quality forecasts. Currently, Charlotte is under a code red. \n“Code Red i ndicates a forecast that's is high enough to potentially affect healthy people without underlying health conditions.” \nThe forecast changes to code orange for Thursday. Orange indicates a level of pollution that would only impact people with asthma, heart and lung diseases and so forth. \nBut, Barnett said it would be hard to predict where the smoke from the wildfires would be on game day. \nThe North Carolina High School Athletic Association said they have not postponed any games and will probably wait until game day to make the final decision. A spokesperson with the association said they are in contact with schools in the affected areas and will let them make the call. \nHendersonville High School in Henderson County will host Lexington High School on Friday. Henderson County is another area currently in code red. \nJohn Bryant, the Assistant Superintendent of Henderson said they will keep in contact with their local health department and see what the recommendations are come Friday. \n“We treat this in the same way that we treat inclement weather. You know, you might have sleet in the forecast but you have to kind of wait and see how those conditions start to show themselves,” said Bryant. \nFor NW Guilford, postponing the game would mean moving the match to Saturday. But players would still travel to Charlotte. \n\"We deal with this all the time with rain and to a certain extent thunderstorms but smoke is unique it's not common but it's the same idea. Where you kind of have the wind speed and direction and where the fires are today compared to Friday,” said NW Guilford Athletics Director, John Hughes. \nFor now, Hughes said, coaches and players remain focused on the game, but continue to keep an eye on the conditions. \nCopyright 2016 WFMY ",

      "text": "Teresa Giudice Changes Her Tune On Ford Vehicles? by Marenah on November 17th, 2016 \nWhen Teresa Giudice was questioned during the Real Housewives of New Jersey reunion episodes about getting a Lexus when she got out of prison, she didn’t understand why she wouldn’t drive a Lexus because it’s not like she would drive a Ford . And even asked host Andy Cohen , “Would you drive a Ford?” and she dug a real deep hole for herself by looking down on the brand. Well, I have a feeling that she got a lot more heat for this comment than I could I have imagined because Teresa’s latest Instagram post is an ode to the Ford brand. \nI totally get why people were put off by someone who went to jail for money-related crimes receiving a luxury vehicle straight out of jail, but Teresa did not seem to understand how that could come off. Well apparently she gets it now since she posted an apology on Instagram. \nCLICK “CONTINUE READING” FOR MORE \nTeresa posted a video of herself smiling in a Ford along with a super apologetic caption to make up for the backlash from the reunion comments. Usually Teresa just posts adorable photos of her children or sponsored ads to make money, but this post is different. \nAlong with the photo, Tre wrote, “As I was traveling in Florida this week I had the pleasure of renting a Ford, it was a great car.” It looks like she’s really eating crow with this one. I also can’t help wondering if she rented a Ford or if she “rented” a Ford in the same way that pretty much every reality star gets to stop paying for things once they get famous. Don’t get me wrong, I would do the same thing though. How could you not? \nBut anyway, Teresa went on and on about the benefits of driving a Ford: “Pretty nifty how it shows you how many miles you have till the tank is empty! I’m always driving mine to the last drop & wondering if I’m going to run out of gas!” This testimonial is giving me more reason to think that she got a comped car rental. \nNevertheless, Teresa emphasized that the Giudice family actually does support Ford and doesn’t look down on the brand when she wrote, “again, we own Fords, they are great cars. Sometimes my delivery comes off wrong, I shouldn’t have said it like that and I’m sorry. #iloveddrivingaford.” \nTeresa rarely apologizes for anything, so it could be saying a lot that she actually did say sorry. Then again, reality stars do get paid to talk about products, so who knows. \nTELL US- DO YOU THINK TERESA IS SINCERELY SORRY FOR THE FORD COMMENTS? DID SHE GET COMPED FROM FORD?",

      "text": "How to Diagnose a Ford Expedition Transmission Problem? Stalling at Stop Without Clutch Engaged Updated September 05, 2016 . Question: Ford Expedition Transmission Diagnosis \nI have a 2000 Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer, 5.4 liter Triton V-8 with 85,000 miles. It is clean with no problems of any kind since new. Last week, the transmission slipped three times in about 30 to 40 miles when pulling away from a stop, once it chattered in reverse. \nLast Saturday, the engine just quit when pulling up to a stop sign as if I didn't push in the clutch, It's an automatic transmission. I tried to re-start but the battery was dead, it was the factory battery. \nAfter testing and replacing the battery with a new fully charged one, I re-started the engine, with no problem. The charging system tests out fine. Now the gear shift lever gets no response. \nThe engine idle changes slightly as the lever is moved through the different positions but no transmission response what so ever. The shift lever cable connects to an electronic switch underneath mounted on the transmission with wires going to the top of the transmission. \nAll the fuses and relays under the dash and in the engine compartment test out okay. The transmission fluid is clean and full and was flushed with a new filter about 10,000 miles ago. \nI'm guessing that it is an electrical problem, not mechanical. Is the transmission is controlled by the computer? Is there a transmission reset switch or procedure? Could there be a solenoid or something on the trans that could have gone out? \nI purchased a Chilton manual, but it just talks about generic R&R, not transmission diagnosis and doesn't even show or discuss the electronic shift switch. Where can I get documentation that will discuss how the electronic shifter and transmission work and how to diagnose it? \nHave you heard of this problem before? Please let me know what your thoughts on this are. \nThank you,Dave Answer: Possible Bad Torque Converter Control TCC Solenoid \nThe stalling at a stop when not pushing in the clutch is indicative of a bad Torque Converter Control (TCC) solenoid. Not an uncommon problem on any vehicle. \nI can help you out with a description of how the Electronic Transmission works. As for troubleshooting, your best bet would be to get the Motors Manual Transmission book from the library. Troubleshooting this transmission is complex and requires some special test equipment that the average DIY does not have, or is cost effective for them to purchase. Electronic System Description \nThe Powertrain Control Module (PCM) and its input/output network control the following transmission operations: Shift timing Line pressure (shift feel) Torque converter clutch operation. The transmission control is separate from the engine control strategy in the powertrain control module, although some of the input signals are shared. When determining the best-operating strategy for transmission operation, the powertrain control module uses input information from certain engine-related and driver-demand related sensors and switches. \nUsing all of these inputs signals, the powertrain control module can determine when the time and conditions are right for a shift, or when to apply or release the torque converter clutch. It will also determine the best line pressure needed to optimize shift feel. To accomplish this, the powertrain control module uses six output solenoids to control transmission operation. \nThe following provides a brief description of each of the sensors and actuators used by the PCM for transmission operation. Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor \nThe Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor measures the mass of air flowing into the engine. The MAF sensor output signal is used by the powertrain control module to calculate injector pulse width. For transmission strategies, the MAF sensor is used to regulate Electronic Pressure Control (EPC), shift and torque converter clutch scheduling. Throttle Position (TP) Sensor \nThe Throttle Position (TP) sensor is a potentiometer mounted on the throttle body. The TP sensor detects the position of the throttle plate and sends this information to the powertrain control module. The TP sensor is used for shift scheduling, electronic pressure control and Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) control. Intake Air Temperature (IAT) Sensor \nThe IAT sensor is installed in the air cleaner outlet tube. The IAT sensor is also used in determining Electronic Pressure Control (EPC) pressures. Powertrain Control Module (PCM) \nThe operation of the transmission is controlled by the powertrain control module. Many input sensors provide information to the powertrain control module. The powertrain control module then controls actuators which determine transmission operation. Transmission Control Switch (TCS) and Transmission Control Indicator Lamp (TCIL) \nThe Transmission Control Switch (TCS) is a momentary contact switch. When the switch is pressed, a signal is sent to the powertrain control module to allow automatic shifts from first through fourth gears or first through third gears only. The powertrain control module energizes the Transmission Control Indicator Lamp (TCIL) when the switch is off. The TCIL indicates overdrive cancel mode activated (lamp on) and Electronic Pressure Control (EPC) circuit shorted (lamp flashing) or monitored sensor failure. Anti-Lock Brake Speed Sensor \nThe Programmable Speedometer/Odometer Module (PSOM) receives input from the rear brake anti-lock sensor. After processing the signal, the PSOM relays it to the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) and the speed control module. Turbine Shaft Speed (TSS) Sensor \nThe Turbine Shaft Speed (TSS) sensors a magnetic pickup that sends the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) information on the rotation speed of the coast clutch cylinder assembly The Turbine Shaft Speed (TSS) sensor is mounted externally on the top of the transmission case. The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) uses Turbine Shaft Speed (TSS) sensor signals to help determine Electronic Pressure Control (EPC) pressure, shift scheduling the Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) operation. Output Shaft Speed (OSS) Sensor \nThe Output Shaft Speed (OSS) sensor is a magnetic pickup that provides transmission output shaft rotation speed information to the powertrain control module. The Output Shaft Speed (OSS) sensor is mounted externally on the top of the transmission extension housing. The YCM uses the Output Shaft Speed (OSS) sensor signal to help determine Electronic Pressure Control (EPC) pressure, shift scheduling and Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) operation./P> Transmission Solenoid Body Assembly \nThe powertrain control module controls the transmission operation through three on/off shift solenoids, one Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) shift solenoid, and one variable force shift solenoid. These solenoids and transmission fluid temperature sensor are housed in the transmission solenoid body assembly. All are part of the transmission solenoid body and are not replaced individually. Transmission Fluid Temperature (TFT) Sensor \nThe Transmission Fluid Temperature (TFT) sensor is located on the solenoid body assembly in the transmission sump. It is a temperature-sensitive device called a thermistor. The resistance value of the transmission liquid temperature sensor will vary with temperatures change. \nThe powertrain control module monitors voltage across the transmission fluid temperature sensor to determine the temperature of the transmission fluid. \nThe powertrain control module uses this signal to determine whether a cold start shift schedule is necessary. The cold start shift schedule lowers shift speeds to allow for better cold engine operation. The powertrain control module also uses the transmission fluid temperature sensor input to adjust electronic pressure control pressure for temperature effects and to inhibit torque converter clutch operation during the warm-up period. \nCoast Clutch Solenoid (CCS) The coast clutch solenoid provides coast clutch control by shifting the coast clutch shift valve. The solenoid is activated by pressing the transmission control switch or by selecting the 1 or 2 range with the transmission range selector lever. In MANUAL 1 and 2, the coast clutch is controlled by the solenoid and also hydraulically as a fail-safe to ensure engine braking. In reverse, the coast clutch is controlled hydraulically, and the solenoid is not on. \nTorque Converter Clutch (TCC) Solenoid The Torque Converter Clutch (TCC) solenoid provides torque converter clutch control by shifting the converter clutch control valve to apply or release the torque converter clutch. Electronic Pressure Control (EPC) Solenoid \nCAUTION : The Electronic Pressure Control (EPC) solenoid pressure output from the variable force solenoid is NOT adjustable. Any modification to the electronic pressure control solenoid may void the transmission warranty. \nThe electronic pressure control solenoid is a variable force solenoid. The variable-force type solenoid is an electro-hydraulic actuator combining a solenoid and a regulating valve. It supplies electronic pressure control that regulates transmission line pressure and line modulator pressure. This is done by producing resisting forces to the main regulator and the line modulator circuits. These two pressures control clutch application pressures. Shift Solenoids SSA and SSB \nShift solenoids SSA and SSB provide gear selection of first through fourth gears by controlling the pressure to the three shift valves. Digital Transmission Range (TR) Sensor \nThe digital transmission range sensor is located on the outside of the transmission at the manual lever. The sensor completes the start circuit in Park and Neutral, the back-up lamp circuit in Reverse and a neutral sense circuit for GEM control of 4 x 4 low engagement. The sensor also opens/closes a set of four switches that are monitored by the Powertrain Control Module (PCM) to determine the position of the manual lever (P, R, N, (D), 2, 1). 4x4 Low (4x4L) Switch \nThe 4x4 low (4x4L) range switch is located on the transfer case cover. It provides an indication of when the 4x4 transfer case gear system is in the low range. The powertrain control module then modifies shift schedule for 4x4L operation. Brake Pedal Position (BPP) Switch \nThe Brake Pedal Position Switch (BPP) tells the powertrain control module when the brakes are applied. The torque converter clutch disengages when the brakes are applied. The BPP switch closes when the brakes are applied and opens when they are released. Electronic Ignition (EI) System \nThe electronic ignition consists of a crankshaft position sensor, two four tower ignition coils, and the powertrain control module. The ignition control module operates by sending crankshaft position information from the crankshaft position sensor to the ignition control module. The ignition control module generates a Profile Ignition Pickup (PIP) signal (engine rpm) and sends it to the PCM. The PIP is one of the inputs that the PCM uses to determine transmission strategy, Wide-Open Throttle (WOT) shift control, torque converter clutch control, and EPC pressure. Distributor Ignition (DI) System \nThe profile ignition pickup sensor sends a signal to the powertrain control module indicating the engine rpm and the crankshaft position. Air Conditioning (A/C) Clutch \nAn electromagnetic clutch is energized when the clutch cycling pressure switch closes. The switch is located on the suction accumulator/drier. The closing of the switch completes the circuit to the clutch and draws it into engagement with the compressor drive shaft. When the A/C clutch is engaged, Electronic Pressure Control (EPC) is adjusted by the PCM to compensate for additional load on the engine. Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) Sensor \nThe Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor senses atmospheric pressure to produce an electrical signal. The frequency of this signal varies with intake manifold pressure. The powertrain control module monitors this signal to determine altitude. The powertrain control module then adjusts the 4R100 shift schedule and EPC pressure for altitude. On diesel engines, the manifold absolute pressure sensor measures boost pressure. The powertrain control module monitors this signal and adjusts EPC pressure. \nAdditional Information provided courtesy of ALLDATA",

      "text": "\n\nQuote: Ford is bringing what it calls its 'smallest SUV' to the U.S. market. \n\nThe Ford EcoSport has been sold in world markets since 2003 and it will begin hitting dealerships in the U.S. by early 2018.\n\nPowering this pint-sized SUV will be a choice between the 1.0-liter turbocharged three-cylinderEcoBoost engine or a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine. All-wheel drive will come standard with the 2.0-liter engine, while both are matched with a six-speed automatic transmission .\n\nFour different models – S, SE, SES and Titanium – will be available with the EcoSport , each offering its own set of features.

      "text": "Ford’s Baby SUV, The New EcoSport, Lands In The US | By Share Ford took the covers off the North American version of the EcoSport in LA, adding the subcompact SUV to its US range. The new Ford EcoSport is a facelifted version of the global model we know, with the company redesigning mostly the front end which was one of the most controversial areas of the original model. The new look does make the EcoSport a much better fit into Ford’s SUV range while the cabin layout is also completely new, with a fresh dashboard design and the company’s latest SYNC3 infotainment system packed in an 8-inch touchscreen display. The available engine range for the US market will include the turbocharged 1.0-litre Ecoboost engine and a naturally aspirated 2.0-litre unit that will be paired exclusively with AWD. Both engines will be mated to a standard six-speed automatic gearbox. Ford didn’t mention any figures yet, but we expect them to do so in a closer to launch date. The cabin will also benefit from a range of attractive features, including a 675-watt 10-speaker B&O Play audio system, seven ambient lighting options, HD Radio technology, SiriusXM satellite radio and a dual FM radio antenna that boosts the range and clarity of FM signals. The new Ford EcoSport will be available in no less than 10 exterior colors and four trim levels – S, SE, SES and the range-topping Titanium. The SES trim level will offer AWD, sports-tuned suspension and bold styling details like bold copper accents for the interior and sport seats. Ford will start selling the new EcoSport in early 2018, where it will go against models like the Nissan Juke, Jeep Renegade and the Chevrolet Trax. PHOTO GALLERY",

      "text": " J.D. Power\nCaptive Finance Firms for Lincoln (Luxury), Ford (Mass Market) Top Overall Satisfaction\nCOSTA MESA, Calif. , Nov. 17, With the pace of new-vehicle retail sales slowing, dealers and lenders are focusing on building a relationship with their customers to increase satisfaction and business retention, according to the J.D. Power 2016 U.S. Consumer Financing Satisfaction Study, SM released today.\nRetail light-vehicle sales in the United States are expected to reach 14.0 million units in 2016, down 1.5% from 2015. 1 With increased competition for sales, dealers and lenders that perform well in the basics of financing-including helping the customer get financing quickly and at the best rate-can boost customer satisfaction and generate repeat business for both the dealer and the lender. As an example, the simple task of establishing an automatic payment method with a lender can lead to increased customer satisfaction and business retention.\n\"The small drop in sales is making for a very competitive auto lending market, which means dealers and lenders in many ways need to get back to the basics to satisfy customers,\" said Jim Houston , senior director of auto finance at J.D. Power . \"Lenders need to move beyond a transactional relationship and create a customer-centric culture that helps them build a relationship with their customers. The lenders-and dealers-that are able to do that are the ones most likely to excel.\"\nFive Fundamentals to Improving Satisfaction\nThe study identifies five aspects that can lead to an improved overall customer financing experience:\nUnderstanding the Deal: In the luxury brand segment, overall satisfaction is 49 points higher among customers whose dealer or finance manager explained account features, services, or benefits of their financing than among those whose dealer or finance manager did not (880 vs. 831, respectively, on a 1,000-point scale). Reference Guide: A lender welcome package that answers basic loan servicing questions (e.g., how to make payments and how to sign up for auto-pay) can reduce the number of inbound contacts. Specifically, among luxury customers who say they \"completely\" understand all of the servicing information, problem incidence drops to 8%, compared with the overall luxury problem incidence of 10%. Accessible Self-Help Tools: When email customer service is available, satisfaction improves by 42 points among luxury brand customers and 61 points among mass market brand customers. When online bill pay is available, satisfaction improves by 53 points in the luxury segment and by 86 points in the mass market segment. \"One and Done\": Satisfaction declines significantly when a customer has to contact their lender more than once to resolve a problem. Overall satisfaction among luxury brand customers resolving a problem with one call is 875 points but declines to 821 among those whose resolution requires two calls. Satisfaction Equals Loyalty: Highly satisfied luxury and mass market customers (overall satisfaction scores above 900) can have a significant effect on dealers and lenders, as they are nearly twice as likely to return to a particular dealership and are more than twice as likely to lease or purchase the same brand again as those who are less satisfied (scores between 801 and 900). \"In the seemingly complicated environment of vehicle financing, it's the sometimes-overlooked customer handling steps that can bring clarity to the customer and give dealers and lenders a unique competitive advantage,\" Houston said. \"Working together on the steps that clearly affect satisfaction levels can enable dealers and lenders to turn first-time customers into repeat customers.\"\nStudy Rankings\nLincoln Automotive Financial Services ranks highest among luxury brands, with a score of 879. BMW Financial Services (866) ranks second and Audi Financial Services (864) ranks third.\nFord Credit ranks highest among mass market brands, with a score of 856. Bank of America (854) ranks second and Kia Motors Finance (851) ranks third.\nAbout the Study\nThe 2016 U.S. Consumer Financing Satisfaction Study measures overall customer satisfaction in four factors (listed alphabetically): billing and payment process; onboarding process; phone contact; and website. Satisfaction is calculated on a 1,000-point scale. The study is based on responses from more than 19,000 customers who financed a new- or used-car purchase or lease within the past four years and was fielded in July- August 2016 .\nFor more information about the 2016 U.S. Consumer Financing Satisfaction Study, visit\nhttp://www.jdpower.com/resource/us-consumer-financing-satisfaction-study .\nSee the online press release at http://www.jdpower.com/pr-id/2016230 .\nMedia Relations Contacts\nJohn Tews ; Troy, Mich. ; 248-868-0621; media.relations@jdpa.com\nGeno Effler ; Costa Mesa, Calif. ; 714-621-6224; media.relations@jdpa.com\nAbout J.D.

(KRQE) – Their white Ford truck was stolen, with their two dogs inside and the Albuquerque couple thought they’d never see the duo again. \nKRQE News 13 first told you about Pete and Sue Hedrick’s plea Tuesday night to get their dogs back from thieves. \nSue said it’s common for her two pups, Peña Blanca and Mocha, to go to work with her husband. Pete works for Budget Blinds. Tuesday, he was working at a home near Unser and Montono. He left the doors to his truck open, with the two dogs in the back seat. \nPete said he was just about 15 feet from the truck when he looked up and saw thieves taking in it, dogs and all. \n“We were crying and crying and wondering where dogs are were,” Sue said. \nWednesday morning Sue got a call. \n“Both dogs are micro-chipped,” she said. “They told us that our dogs had just been turned into a Veterinarian hospital less than a mile from our house.” \nSomeone turned the two dogs into one of the VCA Animal Hospital locations in Albuquerque. The clinic said a good Samaritan found Mocha and Peña Blanca wandering in in the Winrock parking lot. \nBoth dogs were found unharmed. \n“I don’t know if maybe they heard the story from the night before and had a change of heart or what but there they were both of our dogs in perfect condition. They weren’t dirty or hurt in anyway,” Sue said. \nThe couple said they filed a police report, but their truck has yet to be found. ❯❯ Click the Icon below to share this post...",

(JEFF KOWALSKY/AFP/Getty Images) Thursday, November 17, 2016, 10:59 PM \nDonald Trump thinks America is built Ford tough. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump took credit Thursday for preventing a move that was never going to happen in the first place. \n“Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky — no Mexico,” Trump tweeted. \nIt was unclear exactly what he was talking about. \nJapanese PM has ‘great confidence’ in President-elect Trump \nWhile Ford has made clear the company will move production of small cars from Michigan to a plant in Mexico, there’s no indication the automakers two plants in Kentucky were even in danger of closing. \n“We’re going forward with our plan to move production of the Ford Focus to Mexico, and importantly that’s to make room for two very important products we’ll be putting back into Michigan plants,” Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields told Reuters Tuesday at the Los Angeles Auto Show. “There will be no job impact whatsoever with this move.” Trump tweets on Thursday to announce Ford will be keeping jobs in Kentucky. (Donald Trump via Twitter) \nLast month, Ford Motor Co. announced some temporary downtime was slated at five North American plants to cut inventory. \nThe car makers two Kentucky plant make SUVs and pickup trucks. \nTop Republicans head to Trump Tower as cabinet rumors swirl \nWhile campaigning, Trump relentlessly targeted Ford as an example of companies exploiting the NAFTA trade deal and moving jobs to Mexico. \n“Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio,” Trump said at the first presidential debate. \nThe company announced last month that production of the Focus and the C-Max will be moved to Mexico. Trump went on Twitter to pat himself on the back. (Donald Trump via Twitter) \nThe Michigan plant where the cars are currently assembled will be used for other purposes and the automaker said the move would not result in any job losses. \nQueens man dodges $41G fine for putting Trump signs on trees \nYet Trump later continued to pat himself on the back Thursday. \n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” he wrote. \nEarlier in the day, Ford CFO Bob Shanks told investors that it was too early to assess Trump’s impact on business. \n“Look at how people seem to be responding, acting, now that (Trump) needs to govern as opposed to campaign. I think it's different. So let’s just wait and see,” Shanks said, according to CNBC. Ford is moving is production of small cars to Mexico, but that will create room to manufacture other vehicles. (Brian Bohannon/AP) \nBill Ford, the great-grandson of Henry Ford, reportedly met with Trump over the summer to talk about the real estate mogul’s heated rhetoric. \nTrump’s “basic premise is wrong,” Ford said at the time. “For over 100 years we’ve been in markets all over the world making vehicles. We’ve made vehicles in Mexico for a long time.” \nMeanwhile, General Motors Co. said Wednesday it will permanently lay off 2,000 hourly workers in January at two Michigan car plants as sales of small cars continue to slow. \nIn a statement Thursday, Ford said it will continue to engage with Trump and Congress, but was not clear about the circumstances of the call. \n“Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky. We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the U.S,\" the company said.

(Olivier Douliery / TNS) Privacy Policy \nPresident-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines. \nOn Thursday night, Trump tweeted: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico \nThen followed it up with this tweet: I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \nFord has never announced any plans to move either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC, to Mexico. \nIn a statement on Thursday night, following Trump's tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model - the MKC - from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky. \n\"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \nIn a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico. \nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan. \nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead. \nIn an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants -- most notably, in Kentucky. \nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs. \nBill Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate's frequent campaign attacks on Ford's decision to move small-car production to Mexico. \n\"I've had a very good meeting with him,\" Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. \"He's a very good listener and he knows the facts.\"",

In the automaker’s 2015 contract with the UAW, it agreed to phase out the MKC in Louisville by the end of the contract, which expires in September 2019. Ford and the UAW have not shared where that production was headed.\nTrump criticized Ford during his presidential campaign for plans to build plants in Mexico and shift production of vehicles from the U.S. to Mexico. Ford has said since the election that it has been engaging the Trump transition team and that it has shared its commitment to investing in the U.S.\nSince 2011, Ford has added nearly 28,000 jobs in the U.S. and invested $12 billion in U.S. plants, according to Ford’s statement Thursday.\n“Ford continues to employ more American autoworkers and produce more American made vehicles than anyone,” the statement read.\nA Trump spokesman did not immediately return messages Thursday night.\nTrump punched back at Ford throughout his presidential campaign, using the company’s decision to invest billions in Mexico and move   He called for severe penalties for automakers who send production overseas.\nFord already operates two assembly plants, two stamping plants and an engine plant in Mexico. It builds the Fiesta, Fusion, Fusion Hybrid, Lincoln MKZ, Lincoln MKZ Hybrid, four-cylinder and diesel engines in Mexico, and the quality of those products has long been on par with its American-made products.\nmburden@detroitnews.com\nStaff Writer Chad Livengood contributed this report.",

AP\nPresident-elect Donald Trump said on Twitter Thursday night that he convinced Ford executives to keep a production plant from moving to Mexico.\n\"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,\" Trump said on Twitter.\n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\"\nBut there's one problem: Ford never planned to move its Louisville, Kentucky plant to Mexico.\nFord originally had plans to shift production of its Lincoln MKC vehicle from its Louisville plant to Mexico, according to The Courier-Journal, but the shift was not expected to affect employment levels at the plant.\nFord has now opted to keep building the line at the Louisville facility.\nThe company never announced it would be shutting down the plant and moving it across the border as Trump asserted.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Donald Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" Ford said in a statement.\nFord announced on Tuesday that it would move production of its Ford Focus line of vehicles from Michigan to Mexico in order to make room at the factory for two new products. There will be no job loss due to the move however, CEO Mark Fields told Reuters.\nDuring his campaign Trump railed against American companies that he said outsourced jobs overseas and left some Americans unemployed.\nThe president-elect threatened to put a 45% tariff on goods from China to in an effort to punish companies that build products overseas.\nNOW WATCH: How to move to Canada and become a Canadian citizen Donald Trump Ford Bill Ford Mark Fields Kentucky Reuters",

      "text": "Don Lemon Panel (Photo: Screen capture) Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory \nCNN host Don Lemon nailed President-Elect Donald Trump’s surrogate Paris Denard on Thursday night’s show. Trump is drawing criticism after taking credit for Ford Motor Company not moving to Mexico . Denard attempted to explain that the truth doesn’t matter and Lemon wouldn’t let it slide. \nTrump tweeted Thursday night, “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” \nTrump made the accusation that Ford was moving a Kentucky plant to Mexico in September’s presidential debate. Ford fact-checked Trump’s statement with a graphic showing that they have more American workers than any other auto company. Ford is also bound by a labor contract with the worker’s union that they cannot move their plant to Mexico. It was never in the cards for Ford to move to Mexico, despite Trump’s claims. Ford has more hourly employees and produces more vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker. pic.twitter.com/k15cqknsvX \n— Ford Motor Company (@Ford) September 27, 2016 \nSellers couldn’t take it, calling it a “fake news story.” \n“I think that this builds into a larger narrative and the larger narrative is Donald Trump is himself a fake news story,” Sellers said. “What we’ve seen is this — it’s this cycle of fake news stories that pop up and drive the narrative. Donald Trump will flat out lie and said he did something, which we can have objectable proof he did not do and it’s category categorically false.” \nTrump surrogate Paris Denard tried to explain that Trump was instrumental in this latest achievement. \nThe facts are, Mr. Trump was outspoken and talking about how he was going to make America great again. He was outspoken and talking about how he wanted to bring jobs back,” Denard said. “When it comes to Ford, Mr. Ford, Trump was very factual and talking about, how he was not going to allow that to happen under his watch, meaning leave the American soil and go across the boarder to Mexico.” \nSellers seemed as if he didn’t believe what he was hearing. “But they weren’t going to,” he said. \n“It doesn’t matter,” Denard said, before continuing what he was saying. \nHost Don Lemon pushed back. “Paris, are you sure it doesn’t matter?” \n“It’s not about the truth. It’s about raising awareness,” he insisted. \nLemon pushed back again. “You’re saying the truth doesn’t matter? He’s taking a victory lap, Paris. Let’s be honest and you’re sitting here on international television and telling people the truth doesn’t matter?” \n“Don, if I may briefly,” Sellers continued. “One of the things about this whole dynamic of President-Elect is you have Paris say it doesn’t matter and now we’re saying maybe it was a step too far but what we’ve created over the past 18 months, and something we’ll have to deal with is a culture of low exception. The fact is Donald Trump told a lie. He had to be corrected by the CEO of Ford. Ford was not leaving the United States going to Mexico. They had a contract with the union that said they could not leave, something that had nothing to do with Donald Trump at all and they were never going to Mexico. Now people pick up on this story. It’s a fake news story that goes around and it’s below the office of the presidency. I mean if he can’t tell the truth in a tweet about Ford, I mean, how will we believe him about anything else.” \nAccording to CNN Money correspondent Christina Alesci, this is not the first time Trump has taken credit for something he didn’t do. In 2015, Trump told a New Hampshire crowd that Ford would be building a massive plant in the United States because he’d been attacking them. \nSee the video below:",

      "text": "Ford wasn't planning to move plant to Mexico Trump takes credit for something that wasn't going to happen Author: By Chris Isidore Zach Gibson/Getty Images, Justin Sullivan/Getty Images NEW YORK (CNNMoney) - \nPresident-elect Donald Trump took credit Thursday night for stopping Ford from moving jobs from Kentucky to Mexico. Related Content Another election winner: For profit-colleges \nThe only problem with the claim? Ford had never said it planned to move its Louisville, Ky, assembly plant to Mexico. \nIn fact the automaker had already made a commitment to the United Auto Workers union in their legally binding contract a year ago to invest $700 million in the plant and to build the Ford Escape there. On Thursday it said it will also keep production of the Lincoln MKC at the plant as well, though that won't change employment. \nIt had planned to shift production of the much smaller volume Lincoln MKC to another plant as Escape production increased. Mexico was a possible location for that luxury model. But even under that plan, it had planned to keep employment near the current 4,700 workers. \nThat decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was enough for the president-elect to take a victory lap on his favorite medium of Twitter on Thursday night. \n\"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,\" he tweeted. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" \nFord issued a statement Thursday in which it repeated earlier statements that it has invested $12 billion in U.S. plants and added 28,000 jobs there in the last five years. That represents nearly a 50% increase in U.S. jobs at Ford during that period. \n\"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" said the statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \nFord had temporarily shut its Louisville plant the weeks of Oct. 17 and Oct. 31. \nBut that is due to slowing sales and excess inventory, not a plan to move production to Mexico. And most of the 4,700 workers there continued to receive 80% of their normal play during this temporary shutdown. \nFord has announced plans to move small car production to a new plant under construction in Mexico, but the workers who now build those models -- the C-Max and Ford Focus -- will keep their jobs and be put to work building more profitable and popular vehicles, likely the new Ford Bronco SUV. \nFord did announce plans this week to be the first automaker to import a passenger vehicle from India to the United States when it introduces the EcoSport to the U.S. market in 2018. That compact crossover SUV has always been built at the plant in India, though, and has never been built in the United States. \nThis is not the first time that Trump has claimed credit for getting Ford to change its mind on Mexico production when in fact Ford was only following the terms of a contract it had reached with the UAW. \nA year ago when Ford started building the heavy duty F-Series trucks in Ohio rather than in Mexico, where they had been built, Trump again claimed credit. \n\"I brought [Ford's Mexican investment plans] up in so many speeches, and frankly I think I embarrassed 'em,\" he told a crowd in New Hampshire in October 2015. \"But Ford is now gonna build a massive plant in the United States, and every single person, even my harshest critics gave me credit for it.\" \nHowever Ford wasn't building a new plant, simply shifting production to an existing U.S. plant. And that shift had been agreed to four years earlier in a 2011 labor deal with the UAW. \nCopyright 2016 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved.

      "text": "Ford cuts 2017 profit forecast for credit arm Ford cuts 2017 profit forecast for credit arm Ford Motor Co on Thursday lowered the 2017 pretax profit forecast for its financial services arm by $300 million due to lower auction values for used vehicles in the United States. By: Reuters | Published: November 18, 2016 6:08 AM Ford affirmed that it expects full company pretax profit in 2017 to be down from 2016, and to improve in 2018. In September, Ford lowered its forecast for pretax profit this year by 0 million to .2 billion. (Reuters) \nFord Motor Co on Thursday lowered the 2017 pretax profit forecast for its financial services arm by $300 million due to lower auction values for used vehicles in the United States. \nThe company now expects Ford Credit to record a pretax profit of about $1.5 billion in 2017. \nFord affirmed that it expects full company pretax profit in 2017 to be down from 2016, and to improve in 2018. In September, Ford lowered its forecast for pretax profit this year by $600 million to $10.2 billion. \nFord expects its core automotive business to improve in 2017 and 2018. The full company’s pretax profit will be down in 2017, it reaffirmed, due to investment in three areas of the business: electrified vehicles, self-driving vehicles, and shared mobility such as ride-sharing. \nBob Shanks, Ford’s chief financial officer, told industry analysts in New York on Thursday that Ford is not changing its investment plans in electric and hybrid-electric vehicles because of expected changes to U.S. regulations in a Donald Trump administration. \nShanks also said it was too early to assess the impact of Trump’s election on the No. 2 U.S. automaker. \nDuring the campaign, Trump targeted Ford as an example of U.S. companies moving jobs to Mexico. \nFord, which earlier had said the greatest declines in used vehicle auction values were for small cars, said the trend of significant declines had now spread over more of its product lineup. \nFord shares were down 0.8 percent at $11.90 in afternoon trading.

      "text": "by williambanzai7 - Nov 17, 2016 10:59 AM \nColonel STFU You Two Faced Turncoat! by Trader Scott - Nov 17, 2016 1:05 PM \nNetflix presents a new exclusive series, \"The Deportables\". Islamic Gold - Game Changer In Gold Market by GoldCore - Nov 17, 2016 8:12 AM \nIslamic gold - 1.6 billion reasons why gold will surge as Islam enters the very rare 'centre court of Wimbledon' physical gold market. Ford CEO Folds? Trump Confirms Carmaker Won't Move Production To Mexico Nov 18, 2016 3:00 AM 0 SHARES \nJust hours after Ford CEO complained of the \"huge impact\" of Donald Trump's proposed trade plans, following the company's plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan, Donald Trump tweeted “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky -- no Mexico,\" seemingly winning his first 'america-first' victory. \nAs WSJ reported yesterday, Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Mark Fields issued a warning about President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed trade policies, saying high tariffs on automobiles and other products coming into the U.S. would be a blow to the auto industry and broader U.S. economy. \nMr. Fields, speaking with reporters on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday, said Ford has talked to Mr. Trump’s transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. During a separate interview, he said, “We all share the same objective; we want a vibrant and healthy U.S. economy.” \n\nThe two sides, however, appear to be at odds on how to achieve that goal. \n\nFord’s plan to move a substantial portion of its passenger-car production to Mexico from a factory in Michigan was heavily criticized by Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. Like many of its rivals, Ford is building more-profitable light trucks in the U.S. while investing in new capacity in Mexico to produce lower-margin small cars. \nAnd then hours later, Donald Trump tweeted... Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nWhich was followed by a statement from Ford confirming Trump's comment... \n\"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,” Ford spokesperson Christin Baker says in e-mail statement. \n\n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States” \nLeaving Donald Trump with his first victory since being elected. \nThe question is - why didn't, wouldn't President Obama do this?",

      "text": "On Thursday, Trump posted on Twitter: \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\"\n...\nBut Ford has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019.\n.\nThis is not the first time Trump's comments about Ford production have been called into question. Last year, he took credit for Ford moving work from Mexico to Ohio, while the automaker had already made the decision in 2011 - long before Trump announced a run for president.\n...\nFord has sold about 20,000 MKC SUVs this year in the United States, compared with 258,000 Escape SUVs.\n \nFord said last month it would suspend production of the Escape and MKC at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for two weeks because of low demand.\n \nIn 2015, it told workers at the plant that it planned to phase out MKC production by 2019 and move it elsewhere.\n \nThe U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border.\n...\nIn April 2015, Ford said it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018.\n \nIn September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result. \n.\nFord has repeatedly said no U.S. jobs will be lost because of the move - and it will produce two new vehicles at a Detroit area plant that built the small cars.\n.\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-ford-motor-idUSKBN13D08J?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Reuters%2FPoliticsNews+%28Reuters+Politics+News%29",

      "title": "Ford Confirms It Will Keep Lincoln Production in Kentucky",
      "text": "Ford Motor Co. Chairman Bill Ford called Donald Trump to tell the president-elect the auto maker won't move production of Lincolns out of Kentucky, a sign the car company aims to work with a new administration on protecting American manufacturing workers.\nMr. Trump, in a tweet posted to his Twitter account late Thursday, said he had \"just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky—no Mexico.\" He then added in a second tweet \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky.\"\nThe auto maker confirmed in a statement that production of the Lincoln MKC crossover will remain at its assembly plant in Louisville, Ky. Ford had initially planned to move output of the Lincoln model to another plant to boost production of the Escape, which is built at the same factory. The company didn't say where it had planned to move production of the Lincoln crossover.\nFord communicated that plan to the United Auto Workers in 2015 as part of a broader contract negotiation. The Louisville plant, employing about 4,700 workers, wasn't in danger of closing.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" the company said.\nMr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to bring U.S. manufacturing jobs back and took aim at Ford's separate plans to move small-car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion factory it is building in Mexico. That product, the Focus, is separate from the Lincoln Mr. Trump referred to, and Ford is still planning to move those small cars to Mexico, Chief Executive Mark Fields said earlier this week.\nAs the Republican candidate for president, Mr. Trump proposed a 35% tariff on vehicles or other products built abroad and imported by the U.S. by companies like Ford. Mr. Fields said a tariff would have negative consequences for the broader auto industry and the U.S. economy.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Trump didn't immediately return a request for comment.\nFord executives, including Mr. Ford, have repeatedly stressed the company's shift in factory output to Mexico won't cost any U.S. jobs and the Michigan factory losing small-car production will eventually get new models to keep the assembly lines running.\nFord says it has invested $12 billion in its U.S. factories over the past five years creating 28,000 jobs.\nMr. Fields told reporters Ford has talked to Mr. Trump's transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. \"We all share the same objective,\" Mr. Fields said.\nFord's Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks was also encouraged by Mr. Trump's recent remarks, saying earlier Thursday he believes the president-elect is pursuing \"pro-growth\" policies, including on trade.\nLike many of its rivals, Ford is increasing production of more profitable trucks and sport-utility vehicles in the U.S. while investing to boost output in Mexico for lower-margin small cars.\nMr. Trump has said he would begin renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement that covers Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.\nIf Mexico doesn't agree to improve terms, the U.S. will leave the pact, Mr. Trump said. He blames unfair trade, in particular with Mexico and China, for the loss of millions of factory jobs–a message that resonated with voters in Michigan during the election. Mr. Trump won Michigan, the first Republican candidate to do that since 1988.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\n 18, 2016 01:25 ET (06:25 ",

      "title": "OVERHEARD AT TOSCA -- Pelosi’s challenge -- TRUMP versus Ford on keeping jobs in the U.S. -- DAVID BROCK’s new project -- DAVID REMNICK interviews Obama -- JARED KUSHNER profile -- B’DAY: Megyn Kelly",
      "text": "Driving the Day Listen to Playbook in 90 Seconds http://bit.ly/2fCseAx ... Subscribe on iTunes http://apple.co/2f1856A \nOVERHEARD -- BILLY TAUZIN , the former Louisiana Democratic congressman turned lobbyist, at Tosca, “Drain the swamp? I’m an alligator. I just go eat the fish at the bottom.” \n \nSPOTTED at the bar at the Trump International Hotel last night: incoming Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist.\nGood morning. It’s Friday. Congress is gone. Next week is Thanksgiving. Take a deep breath.\nNANCY PELOSI has a challenger for her job as House minority leader. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio is running against her in the closed election after Thanksgiving. Everyone expects Pelosi (D-Calif.) to win. But Pelosi has set the bar high: “Without even asking anybody for a vote, I have over two-thirds of the caucus supporting me,” she has said. Her notoriously good whipping skills -- and her staying power -- will be put to a test. There are 194 Democrats. Will she get 129 votes -- two-thirds of the House Democratic Caucus? Remember: Heath Shuler, the former congressman from North Carolina, got 43 votes in 2010 when he tried to topple Pelosi. Anyone heard from him lately?\nWE HEAR that Donald Trump’s meeting with Mitt Romney this weekend is more of a potential kumbaya moment than a job interview. Top allies of both Romney and Trump do not believe the former Massachusetts governor will be offered a slot in the new GOP administration. They have irreconcilable views on foreign policy, to put it mildly. And Romney, let’s recall, is the guy who said the president-elect’s promises “are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.”\nWE ALSO HEAR that outgoing Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) -- who was defeated in a primary -- is unlikely to be Agriculture secretary. He has floated himself for the job. The three-term congressman -- who wrote his American University Ph.D. thesis on federal agriculture policy -- told reporters that he is an outsider.\nBY THE WAY , what is an outsider these days? For example: Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) says he can’t wait to “drain the swamp” with Donald Trump -- but he’s been in Congress for nearly 14 years, worked for a senator before that and was the executive director of the NRSC.\n**SUBSCRIBE to Playbook : http://politi.co/1M75UbX \nDEPT. OF SWAMP DRAINING -- NYT A19, “How Rudolph Giuliani, Possible Cabinet Pick, Made Millions as Ex-Mayor,” by Eric Lipton and Russ Buettner: “Mr. Giuliani stipulated that his remarks could not be recorded, nor could ‘general press or other media coverage’ of the remarks be allowed without his explicit permission. He also had some elaborate demands, including that if he traveled by private plane, it be a Gulfstream IV or bigger, a plane that costs about $40,000 for a one-day trip within the United States. ... In one month alone during 2006, he gave 20 speeches. From 2001 to 2008, the year he ran for president, he was on the road as much as 200 days a year.” http://nyti.ms/2f6uagG \nKEEPING HIM HONEST -- “Trump just took credit for stopping Ford from moving a plant to Mexico. But it wasn’t planning to,” by WaPo’s Jim Tankersley: “President-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines.” ...\n-- @realDonaldTrump : “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico … I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!”\n“Ford has never announced plans to move to Mexico either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC and the Ford Escape. In a statement on Thursday night, following Trump's tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model — the MKC — from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky, because Escape production would replace lost MKC production. ‘Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,’ the company said in a statement. ‘We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.’” http://wapo.st/2gmCaPR \n*",

      "text": " 44 am By Jim Tankersley The Washington Post Trump took credit for stopping Ford from moving a plant to Mexico, but it wasn’t planning to. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines. \nOn Thursday night, Trump tweeted: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico \nThen followed it up with this tweet: I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \nFord has never announced any plans to move either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC, to Mexico. \nIn a statement on Thursday night, following Trump’s tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model - the MKC - from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky. \n“Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,” the company said in a statement. “We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.” \nIn a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico. \nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan. \nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead. \nIn an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants — most notably, in Kentucky. \nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs. \nBill Ford Jr., the company’s executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate’s frequent campaign attacks on Ford’s decision to move small-car production to Mexico. \n“I’ve had a very good meeting with him,” Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. “He’s a very good listener and he knows the facts.” Advertisement",

He also said he would terminate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which lets goods flow between Mexico, the US and Canada without tariffs.\nFord confirmed late Thursday it has told Trump its Lincoln SUV made at the Louisville assembly plant will stay in Kentucky.\n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the US,” the automaker said in an emailed statement.",

      "text": "\n-Striving to expand its reach into mobility—beyond its traditional building-cars-and-selling-them business—Ford started an ongoing discussion with its employees, named Cult of Disruption, looking for interesting new solutions to the problem of moving people around. In this, its second year, Ford issued a Last Mile Mobility Challenge. Workers were tasked to dream up alternatives to walking that could get people from a train, bus, or parked car to their destinations. Among the 633 proposals that came in, Ford chose these three: an autonomous electric wheelchair that can stow itself (a legitimately good idea), an electric tricycle that can also be used as a golf-bag carrier or a shopping companion (has potential), and what’s basically a Roomba with a face that you stand on and ride, or a Segway without the handle (okay?). \n-Let’s start with the most practical idea, the eChair. If you’ve ever been in a wheelchair or accompanied someone who uses one, you know that the world is not very accommodating. This is particularly true if the wheelchair user is alone and needs to use a car. The process of transferring out of the chair into the driver’s seat, then stowing the chair and perhaps crutches or a walker, can become a major hassle. The eChair pretty much eliminates all that fumbling around. Once a person is seated inside the vehicle, he or she can use a smartphone app or controls built into the car’s infotainment unit to tell the chair to drive itself to the trunk and automatically store itself. Three engineers from Ford’s Belgium proving grounds came up with eChair. It’s actually shocking something this logical hasn’t been invented already. It could make a lot of people’s lives much easier.\n-\n-Another finalist is the TriCiti, which is literally just a folding electric tricycle that can also be used as a golf-bag cart or a shopping companion or to transport heavy items. The TriCiti, dreamed up by three vehicle-architecture employees from Ford of Europe, has a 19-mile range and a 12-mph top speed. This is not a bad idea, if you can imagine it could be built at low enough cost to make it something more than a toy for the Sharper Image catalog.\n- \n- - Commuter Drones: Uber Hopes to Transcend Gridlock with, Yes, Flying Cars - This Is BMW’s Carbon-Fiber Racing Wheelchair for Team USA - Yes, Lexus Has a Hoverboard. No, It Won’t Sell One to You - -And then there’s the Carr-E, a combination of a Roomba knockoff and those things people incorrectly call hoverboards that you ride from your car to your office, or Taco Bell, or wherever a car won’t fit and walking is too boring. This project came from the mind of Ford systems engineer Kilian Vas, and it tucks away nicely in that convenient space that used to hold the spare tire that carmakers don’t give you anymore. According to Vas, Carr-E could help people park farther out from crowded city centers and avoid messy midtown traffic jams. Like the eChair, there’s smartphone connectivity; like the TriCity, it can also be used as a little robotic butler to transport your things, staying close by following an electronic transmitter you carry with you.\n-Will these ever get made? Ford revealed no production plans, but if it was our money, we’d invest in the eChair.\n-\n- ",

(Olivier Douliery / TNS) Privacy Policy \nPresident-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines. \nOn Thursday night, Trump tweeted: \"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\" \nThen followed it up with this tweet: \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" \nFord has never announced any plans to move either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC, to Mexico. (Greg Gardner) \nIn a statement on Thursday night, following Trump's tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model - the MKC - from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky. \n\"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" North American Free Trade Agreement ... \nFord Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement ... (Tribune news services) \nIn a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico. \nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan. \nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead. \nIn an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants -- most notably, in Kentucky. \nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs. \nBill Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate's frequent campaign attacks on Ford's decision to move small-car production to Mexico. \n\"I've had a very good meeting with him,\" Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. \"He's a very good listener and he knows the facts.\"",

      "text": "Donald Trump bragged Thursday night that the chairman of Ford Motor Company called him personally to inform him that the auto maker would be keeping one of its plants in Kentucky instead of moving it to Mexico. “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,” the president-elect wrote on Twitter.\n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” he added in a subsequent post.\nA spokeswoman for Ford confirmed that the company’s chairman had called Trump to inform him that the Lincoln plant would remain in Kentucky. She said “we are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.”\nThe problem with Trump’s claim, according to a report from Reuters , is that Ford was never planning to move the facility in question to Mexico. In fact, Ford has regularly reiterated that it has no plans to close any of its U.S. manufacturing locations, something that would likely be impossible under the terms of its current contract with the United Auto Workers.\nAccording to the Washington Post , Ford was planning to move production of the MKC model out of Kentucky, but scrapped the idea. Ford didn't say where production would move to when it initially stated the line would be moving.\nThe Manhattan billionaire made restoring America’s manufacturing economy a major part of his presidential platform, pledging to institute tariffs on the products of companies who move jobs abroad. In his stump speeches, Trump would regularly cite an unnamed factory-building friend of his who described Mexican manufacturing plants as “the eighth wonder of the world.”",

      "text": "Individual Trader Summary \nFord had a poor October sales-wise in the US. Demand will continue to fall off going into next year. \nInterest rates will rise because of a spike in inflation. This will hurt borrowers - the fuel of this industry. \nInvestors holding out for a special dividend next year may see a far different share price then to what we have now. The new incoming President is already doing victory laps for saving Ford (NYSE: F ) jobs. He announced on his Twitter account recently the following. \nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico The only problem (the press are saying) is that the facility was never going to up stakes and head south. It was only a production line which was on Ford's agenda for the move but now also this will be staying put. It doesn't really matter though if Trump deserves some credit here or not. What matters is this looks very positive for him and in my opinion is an early win. Why? Because he has been championing all through his campaign (He really singled out Ford) for US auto factories to stay in the US and not to head to Mexico to avail of cheaper labor. Mexican manufacturing will be difficult to stop though despite what happens in the US with relation to NAFTA or the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Why? Because it's a huge hub used by all of the large auto manufacturers as the country has multiple free trade agreements with over 40 countries around the world. The president-elect Donald Trump wants to either move all production for the US market back to the states or slap a 35% import tax on any vehicle crossing the border. Bad news for Ford if this was to materialize but the manufacturer has other problems that investors should be mindful of going forward. Click to enlarge Firstly, if we really do see an import tax come into play in the US, cars are going to get a lot more expensive. This has to be bearish for Ford considering that we now definitely seem to have a top in the SARS metric (Seasonally Adjusted Annualized Selling Rate..) despite a strong October which was the best of the year (SARS of 17.98 million). However on an annual setting, auto sales are declining which is worrying. Ford though didn't have a strong October which saw its sales fall almost 12% compared to the same period of 12 months prior. The reason for caution now is that all of Ford's divisions fell in the US in October ( SUV's, Trucks & Cars) despite the Super Duty stopping a multi-month decline in the F-series and Lincoln sales growth due to the launch of new sedans (Continental & MKZ). Moreover inventory levels were higher than normal in October (11 days more than October 2015) and Ford has tried to pivot by stopping production at various plants for certain models (F-150 & Lincoln MKC) to keep demand aligned to the best of its ability with supply. However with Janet Yellen's hawkish comments yesterday combined with the carnage we are seeing in the US bond market, the real fear here is a meaningful hike in interest rates over the next few years. US auto loans are their max levels in terms of how much Americans are spending every month plus how long the loans are lasting for. The average auto loan in the US is now over $30k and the average monthly payment is over $500. Furthermore the average term now for auto loans in the US is approaching 70 months. Of course all of these loans have been earmarked as sales in Ford's income statement. The question is \"Will they all be made good in due time ?\" With Yellen stating yesterday that all metrics are pointing towards an interest rate hike in December, things are going to start getting a lot tighter for borrowers. Furthermore don't believe the unemployment and job numbers as the reasons to increase rates. Inflation has doubled to 1.6% since July. This reason and no other is why the Fed will raise in December. For Ford investors, the special dividend that the company pays out of the start of the year remains enticing. However look at the big picture. General Motors (NYSE: GM ) has already announced substantial job cuts. Credit is what moves this industry and that may be harder to get in the US going forward.  ",

      "text": "Trump takes credit for stopping Ford from moving a plant to Mexico, but it wasn't planning to Friday Nov 18, 2016 at 8:28 AM Jim Tankersley The Washington Post \nPresident-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines. \nOn Thursday night, Trump tweeted: Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico \nThen followed it up with this tweet: I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! \nFord has never announced any plans to move either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC, to Mexico. \nIn a statement on Thursday night, following Trump's tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model - the MKC - from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky. \n\"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \nIn a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico. \nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan. \nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead. \nIn an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants -- most notably, in Kentucky. \nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs. \nBill Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate's frequent campaign attacks on Ford's decision to move small-car production to Mexico. \n\"I've had a very good meeting with him,\" Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. \"He's a very good listener and he knows the facts.\" \nAuthor Information: \nJim Tankersley covers economic policy for The Post.

      "text": "Ford Motor Co. Chairman Bill Ford called Donald Trump to tell the president-elect the auto maker won't move production of Lincolns out of Kentucky, a sign the car company aims to work with a new administration on protecting American manufacturing workers.\nMr. Trump, in a tweet posted to his Twitter account late Thursday, said he had \"just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky—no Mexico.\" He then added in a second tweet \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky.\"\nThe auto maker confirmed in a statement that production of the Lincoln MKC crossover will remain at its assembly plant in Louisville, Ky. Ford had initially planned to move output of the Lincoln model to another plant to boost production of the Escape, which is built at the same factory. The company didn't say where it had planned to move production of the Lincoln crossover.\nFord communicated that plan to the United Auto Workers in 2015 as part of a broader contract negotiation. The Louisville plant, employing about 4,700 workers, wasn't in danger of closing.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" the company said.\nMr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to bring U.S. manufacturing jobs back and took aim at Ford's separate plans to move small-car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion factory it is building in Mexico. That product, the Focus, is separate from the Lincoln Mr. Trump referred to, and Ford is still planning to move those small cars to Mexico, Chief Executive Mark Fields said earlier this week.\nAs the Republican candidate for president, Mr. Trump proposed a 35% tariff on vehicles or other products built abroad and imported by the U.S. by companies like Ford. Mr. Fields said a tariff would have negative consequences for the broader auto industry and the U.S. economy.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Trump didn't immediately return a request for comment.\nFord executives, including Mr. Ford, have repeatedly stressed the company's shift in factory output to Mexico won't cost any U.S. jobs and the Michigan factory losing small-car production will eventually get new models to keep the assembly lines running.\nFord says it has invested $12 billion in its U.S. factories over the past five years creating 28,000 jobs.\nMr. Fields told reporters Ford has talked to Mr. Trump's transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. \"We all share the same objective,\" Mr. Fields said.\nFord's Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks was also encouraged by Mr. Trump's recent remarks, saying earlier Thursday he believes the president-elect is pursuing \"pro-growth\" policies, including on trade.\nLike many of its rivals, Ford is increasing production of more profitable trucks and sport-utility vehicles in the U.S. while investing to boost output in Mexico for lower-margin small cars.\nMr. Trump has said he would begin renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement that covers Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.\nIf Mexico doesn't agree to improve terms, the U.S. will leave the pact, Mr. Trump said. He blames unfair trade, in particular with Mexico and China, for the loss of millions of factory jobs–a message that resonated with voters in Michigan during the election. Mr. Trump won Michigan, the first Republican candidate to do that since 1988.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\n 18, 2016 01:25 ET (06:25 ",

      "title": "Trump: Ford told me they’ve decided not to move their plant in Kentucky to Mexico after all",
      "text": "Lots of confusion about this last night on social media.\nJust got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky – no Mexico\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \n\nI worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \n\nTrump fan Matt Drudge is hyping the news this way:\n\nDid Bill Ford speak to Trump yesterday? Yep, sure did, according to the company . He told Trump that production of the Lincoln MKC would in fact remain in Kentucky after having been slated to move to Mexco. Does that mean the plant was going to close, though? No, and it never was . Here’s a story that ran shortly after the new CBA was signed last November:\nFord Motor Co. intends to move production of the Lincoln MKC out of the Louisville Assembly Plant, but labor leaders insisted that the loss of the model won’t cut employment levels …\nâ€œWhatever happens in Louisville it will not lose employment. â€ŚThey cannot make enough Escapes,â€ UAW Vice President Jimmy Settles, the chief negotiator for the Ford contract, told the Detroit Free Press in an interview.\nTop UAW officials meeting Monday morning in Detroit approved the proposed contract and made the 28-page document public. Next the deal will face a ratification vote by nearly 53,000 Ford employees, including about 8,800 at LAP and the Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville.\nMoving Lincoln production to Mexico was never about moving jobs. In fact, the collective bargaining agreement between Ford and the union would likely prevent the company from closing any U.S. plants before 2019 at the earliest . The company’s plan for Kentucky, it seems, is merely to shift production of the low-selling MKC to Mexico while ramping up production of the Escape in Louisville. No closed plant, no jobs lost, just a different vehicle model to build. Their Michigan plant was, and maybe still is, set for the same kind of shift . As of last month, small-car production was headed to Mexico so that the plant in Wayne, MI could focus on the Ford Ranger pick-up and Bronco SUV. Now, per Trump, Ford’s reversing course: The Kentucky plant will continue to manufacture MKCs alongside Escapes. It’s possible, I guess, that they’ll expand hiring in Kentucky so that they can meet their original target for the Escape and maintain production of the MKC, but I haven’t read anything to that effect. It looks like, at least for now, they’re simply going to allocate existing resources between the two models in Louisville and make fewer Escapes than they initially intended . Less business for Mexico, but no more for the U.S.\nAn unanswered question at the moment is whether Ford changed its mind about moving the MKC to Mexico this week, as a reaction to Trump’s nationalist victory, or whether the decision was made before that and Bill Ford merely told Trump about it this week. Maybe we’ll find out more about that today. It’s no secret, though, that Ford execs have been annoyed at Trump for awhile for, they say, distorting their hiring practices in the U.S. The UAW contract struck last November requires the company to invest $9 billion in American plants, more than half of which goes to Michigan, and to create or retain more than 8,500 American jobs. Roughly $1.3 billion of that money went to Kentucky for the truck plant in Louisville. Ford has also been known to move jobs from Mexico to the U.S.: The company used to build its F-650 and F-750 south of the border but shifted production to a plant outside Cleveland last year. Even some Ford auto workers who otherwise like Trump think he’s giving the company a bad rap . Here’s Bill Ford himself talking about all of this last month. On the one hand, says Ford, he’s spoken to Trump about all of this and found him to be a receptive listener who’s up on the facts. On the other hand, it’s “infuriating” that Trump continues to circle back to Ford as an exemplar of evil corporations sending “American jobs” abroad. Maybe that explains why Ford was eager to tell Trump about the MKC staying put in Kentucky. Even if that won’t mean any extra jobs for U.S. workers, it’s something that might stick in Trump’s mind the next time he’s grasping for examples of companies that are shifting production. Ford isn’t — in this particular case. Although, as noted, it is with respect to small-car production generally.\n",

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) By Tom Krisher, AP Auto Writer Posted: # Comments \nDETROIT — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday night to announce that Ford Motor Co. won’t be moving Lincoln production from Kentucky to Mexico. \nBill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a Lincoln plant would stay in Louisville, Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for the decision. \nFord doesn’t have a plant that exclusively builds Lincolns, but it had planned to move production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV out of the Louisville Assembly Plant so it could make more Ford Escapes there. A company spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that Ford was considering MKC production at a factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico. The move was negotiated with the United Auto Workers union in 2015. \nCompany spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn’t know when the decision was made to keep the MKC in Louisville or if Trump had any impact on it. It’s possible the decision was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July, so additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” Baker said in an e-mail. \nThe development is the latest in a yearlong feud between Trump and Ford over plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,” Trump said in a tweet. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. Advertisement",

Having already erroneously claimed that a Michigan Ford plant was on the verge of moving to Mexico, the President-elect is now claiming that he saved Ford jobs in Kentucky.

      "text": "Report: Ford F-150 Getting Next-Gen 4.8L V-8 Truck Trend 1 day ago Edward A. Sanchez Report: Ford F-150 Getting Next-Gen 4.8L V-8\nFor the last five years, Ford has been aggressively pursuing downsized, turbocharged engines across its vehicle lineup. However, a significant percentage of F-150 buyers still prefer the naturally aspirated 5.0L Coyote V-8 over the 3.5L or 2.7L EcoBoost V-6 engines. Although the Coyote is still fairly fresh, dating from just 2011 and producing a competitive 385 hp and 387 hp from its 302 cubic inches, Ford is not letting up on the innovation and development. In a Reuters report about Ford’s $447 million investment in its Windsor, Ontario, Canada, engine plants, a report about a next-generation 4.8L V-8 engine leaked out.\nResearch ford f-150 See All Model Years See Pricing Little is known about the engine other than the fact it will replace the 5.0L at the Essex engine plant and is expected to be a “high volume” engine. An engine specifically made for the Super Duty is also planned, presumably replacing the current 6.2L gas engine. The 6.8L V-10 will also reportedly continue to be produced for applications such as the F-650 and the E-Series cutaway vans.\n© Truck Trend Network Staff 2015 Ford F 150 The 4.8L will likely top the current 5.0L in power and fuel economy and will almost certainly be paired to the new 10-speed automatic that debuted on the 2017 F-150 with the 3.5L EcoBoost V-6 . Direct or dual (direct and port) fuel injection will likely be part of the plan, as well as auto stop-start. Some sort of cylinder deactivation system could also appear to optimize economy at light loads. Taking the speculation a step further, it’s likely the 4.8L could be the basis for a future Mustang engine, either with or without forced induction. Interestingly, the 4.8L displacement translates to approximately 292 cubic inches, a displacement most commonly associated with the Ford Y-block V-8 from the ’50s.\nSource: Reuters\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Recode ^ | November 18, 2016 | Johana Bhuiyan \nPosted on 11/18/2016 10:17:13 AM PST by 2ndDivisionVet \nOn Thursday evening, President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he received a call from Ford chairman Bill Ford indicating that the automaker had chosen not to move an entire plant from Kentucky to Mexico. \nAs many reports rightly indicated, thats not entirely true. Ford never intended to close and move its Louisville Assembly Plant  to which Trump is referring  to Mexico. The plant currently employs a little more than 4,700 workers. \nThe Detroit-based automaker was only considering moving its Lincoln MKC production  only one of the vehicles manufactured at that plant  to its factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, according to a Ford spokesperson. \nAs part of a four-year contract with the United Auto Workers that Ford signed in 2015, the automaker was making room to produce the new Ford Escape at its Louisville plant and expected to balance out its MKC production. But now, the company has chosen to keep its MKC production in Kentucky. \nTrump wasnt wrong about his influence over that decision, however. In his tweets, he strongly suggests he had something to do with Fords move.... (Excerpt) Read more at recode.net ...",

      "title": "Donald Trump takes credit for keeping Ky. Ford plant from Mexico, though it never planned to move",
      "text": "View Comments Print By Andrew Blake - The Washington Times   \nPresident-elect Donald Trump patted himself on the back Thursday after the chairman of Ford told him the automotive giant isn’t moving its Lincoln plant from Louisville, Kentucky, to Mexico — a relocation that wasn’t in the works to begin with. \n“Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,” Mr. Trump tweeted Thursday evening. \n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” the president-elect said in a followup tweet moments later. \nFord said previously that it hadn’t planned to close any U.S. factories, however, and promised in 2015 to invest $700 million in its Louisville plant over the next four years under the terms of its contract with the United Auto Workers union. \nFollowing Mr. Trump’s tweets, Ford issued a statement saying the president-elect was told the company had nixed plans to move production of a single model, its Lincoln MKC SUV, from Kentucky to Mexico. \nFord spokeswoman Christin Baker wasn’t sure when that decision was made or if Mr. Trump had influenced it in any way, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported Thursday. When Ford previously announced plans to move MKC production to Mexico, however, union workers said layoffs were unlikely for the Louisville plant’s roughly 4,700 workers since the factory would stay open and shift attention towards a different vehicle. \nBoth the Ford Escape and the Lincoln MKC SUV are currently manufactured at the company’s Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford said last year that it planned to move MKC production out of Kentucky, but said in doing so it would increase Escape production at the Louisville plant, USA Today reported . \n“Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,” Ford said in a statement issued after Mr. Trump’s tweets. “We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.” \nMr. Trump said repeatedly while campaigning for the White House that he would prevent American jobs from going abroad if elected president, often targeting Ford in particular. \n“Word is that Ford Motor, because of my constant badgering at packed events, is going to cancel their deal to go to Mexico and stay in U.S.,” Mr. Trump tweeted in October 2015 prior to becoming the Republican Party’s nominee for president. \nAs of Monday this week, however, Ford said it still planned to move manufacturing of at least of one of its vehicles south of the border. \n“We’re going forward with our plan to move production of the Ford Focus to Mexico, and importantly that’s to make room for two very important products we’ll be putting back into Michigan plants,” Ford CEO Mark Fields told Reuters this week. “There will be no job impact whatsoever with this move.”",

      "text": "President Trump Ford says Trump influenced its decision to keep a Lincoln production line in Kentucky Unlike Trump indicated in his tweet, however, the company was never planning on moving an entire plant to Mexico. share Mark Wilson / Getty On Thursday evening, President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he received a call from Ford chairman Bill Ford indicating that the automaker had chosen not to move an entire plant from Kentucky to Mexico. As many reports rightly indicated, that’s not entirely true. Ford never intended to close and move its Louisville Assembly Plant — to which Trump is referring — to Mexico. The plant currently employs a little more than 4,700 workers. The Detroit-based automaker was only considering moving its Lincoln MKC production — only one of the vehicles manufactured at that plant — to its factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, according to a Ford spokesperson. As part of a four-year contract with the United Auto Workers that Ford signed in 2015, the automaker was making room to produce the new Ford Escape at its Louisville plant and expected to “balance out” its MKC production. But now, the company has chosen to keep its MKC production in Kentucky. Trump wasn’t wrong about his influence over that decision, however. In his tweets, he strongly suggests he had something to do with Ford’s move. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 When asked whether Trump’s tweets were correct in suggesting he influenced Ford’s decision to keep MKC production in Kentucky, a spokesperson said, “You are right.” The company also confirmed Bill Ford did speak to Trump yesterday, as he indicated in his tweets. “The potential tax and regulatory policies that will be pursued can help make production in the U.S. more competitive,” the spokesperson said when pressed, quoting from a comment the company was providing to reporters. (We’ve explicitly asked whether the decision was made post-election and what specific policies affected the move and are waiting to hear back.) It’s not clear whether Ford planned to continue MKC production by the time the contract expired in 2019. Here’s Ford’s full statement, which confirms the company spoke to Trump on Thursday: “We continue to engage with President-elect Trump’s team – and the new Congress – as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the U.S. and creating American jobs – building on the $12 billion we have invested in our U.S. plants and the nearly 28,000 U.S. jobs Ford has created in the past five years. Ford continues to employ more American autoworkers and produce more American made vehicles than anyone. Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky. We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.” This is happening just a few days after UAW president Dennis Williams said he was willing to work with Trump on a number of issues and reasserted the union’s opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement — a position Trump has touted throughout his campaign and has used to criticize Ford’s decision to move some of its vehicle production to Mexico. “We agree Nafta either needs to be renegotiated or ended,” Williams said. Ahead of Trump’s victory, Ford took the then-Republican nominee head on when he criticized the automaker for moving jobs to Mexico during the presidential debates, which he often did. Ford CEO Mark Fields went so far as to dismiss Trump in an interview with CNN. \"It's really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts,\" Fields said. Ford has more hourly employees and produces more vehicles in the U.S. than any other automaker. pic.twitter.com/k15cqknsvX — Ford Motor Company (@Ford) September 27, 2016 The automaker has softened its tone against Trump since the election, however. On numerous occasions, a Ford spokesperson has said that the automaker is “encouraged” by Trump’s policies and even congratulated the president-elect. “We congratulate the president-elect and new governors, members of Congress and elected officials across all levels of the U.S. government,” a spokesperson told Recode in the days after the election. “We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country — and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs.​” It’s a clear move on the part of the automaker to appease the incoming president who has made Ford the poster child for what is wrong with manufacturing in the United States. recode_divider",

In fact, peer General Motors  is also battling a  similar set of challenges.\nFord Motor's strongest market -- the U.S. -- is under a cloud. Third-quarter pre-tax profits in North America plummeted 57% from a year earlier.\nAnd as sales declined, costs increased correspondingly.\nFord Motor has  lost its way , and the lack of direction is evident in its retail sales numbers, showing that customers are clearly unhappy .\nThe entire automobile landscape is in the middle of a paradigm shift.\nElectric-vehicle owners prefer Tesla Motors,  despite its sluggish delivery standards.",

      "text": "In this 2014 file photo, Bill Ford Jr., Ford Motor Co. executive chairman, speaks during news conference on the 2015 F-150 pickup truck at the Dearborn Truck Plant in Dearborn, Mich. (Paul Sancya  01 A.M. Trump claims to save Ford plant. But it wasn’t closing. By Tom Krisher   \nDETROIT –   Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes. \nTrump said in a tweet that Bill Ford, the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a “Lincoln plant” would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there. \nA factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving the MKC production. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost. \nIt’s possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn’t know when that decision was made or if Trump had any impact on it. \n“I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,” Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for Ford’s decision. \nFord Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker’s plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. \n“We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,” she said in an e-mail.  01 a.m.",

(Source: WAVE 3 News file photo) \nLOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) - Ford Motor Co. confirmed Friday that it will continue to build its Lincoln MKC in Louisville. \nThe auto giant, which produces both Escapes and the MKC at one of its two Louisville-area facilities, made the confirmation following a pair of tweets Trump posted Thursday night. Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nNearly 15 minutes later, Trump sent out another tweet. I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016 \nThe tweets caused some confusion, particularly locally, prompting some Ford workers to reach out to WAVE 3 News for clarification. \nTo be clear, there is no Lincoln-specific plant in Kentucky, as Trump implied in both of the tweets. \nThe MKC is currently built at the Louisville Assemby Plant, and Ford has made it clear that there were never any plans to close that facility or reduce its workforce. The company has said publicly that it would shift MKC production so that it could produce more Escapes in Louisville. \nFord credited Trump's policies for its decision to keep producing the MKC in Louisville. \n\"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" Ford said in a release issued late Thursday. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \nMORE FROM WAVE3.COM",

      "title": "Trump says he kept Ford from relocating plant to Mexico",
      "text": "NEW YORK: Ford confirmed on Friday (Nov 18) that it will keep production of one SUV model in Kentucky, rather than relocating as planned, a decision US President-elect Donald Trump claimed as a personal victory.\n\"Just hung up on the phone with my friend Bill Ford, the chairman of Ford's board, who let me know he was going to keep the Lincoln site in Kentucky - No Mexico,\" Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday night.\nTrump's declaration was met with some derision since Ford had not publicly announced plans to move the Lincoln MKC production. And just this week Ford confirmed it will proceed with plans to move production of the Focus to Mexico from Michigan, a state Trump narrowly won in last week's election.\nBut under the last year's contract agreement with the powerful United Automobile Workers union, Ford had made plans to move the smaller Lincoln MKC production line to make room for the Escape. Ford's Louisville plant produces the Lincoln MKC as well as the Ford Escape, both small SUVs.\n\"Cuautilan plant in Mexico was likely the plant for MKC,\" Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker, told AFP in an email Friday.\nFord already produces the Lincoln MKZ sedan on the Hermosillo site, and in early April announced a US$1.6 billion investment in a new site in Mexico.\nBut, the company said in a statement, \"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky.\"\nOne of the main themes of Trump's campaign was to bring back manufacturing jobs that American companies had moved overseas in search of cheap labour. Ford and the IT giant Apple were his favourite targets.\nTrump even threatened to impose a 35 per cent punitive import duty on cars produced in Mexico, and to renegotiate the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nHis rhetoric seems to have worked since several states where the car industry is strongly represented and that traditionally voted Democratic, such as Michigan and Wisconsin, voted for Trump, tipping the election.\nFord said of the decision, \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nBut the company defended its record, saying it employs more American auto workers and produces more American-made vehicles than any other company, and has invested US$12 billion US plants in the past five years and created nearly 28,000 US jobs.\n\"We continue to engage with President-elect Trump's team - and the new Congress - as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the US and creating American jobs,\" Ford said.\n- AFP/de\nEmail More",

But it wasn't closing. 1 / 4 Back to Gallery DETROIT (AP) —   claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes. Trump said in a tweet that Bill Ford , the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a \"Lincoln plant\" would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant . Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there. A factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers , Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving production of the MKC. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost. \nThe world’s business leaders are busy assessing whether their companies will gain or suffer from US presidential election winner Donald Trump’s proposed policy changes. The biggest problem is that he has not fleshed out the slogans, threats and vague promises made during his campaign. Winners The pharmaceutical industry should be happy Hillary Clinton is not heading for the White House given that she had promised to crack down on what she called “excessive price increases”. The shares of firms like Pfizer and Merck rallied in relief. Tech firms like Apple, Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet have kept billions of dollars of profits out of the US rather than pay the current 39 percent corporation tax. Trump has proposed a one-off 10 percent rate for repatriated cash. Fossil fuel firms could benefit given the president elect has said global warming is “a hoax”. So might mining companies, steel manufacturers and builders from his infrastructure spending promises. Losers The likely losers include renewable energy companies as the Trump victory threatens to reverse US energy and environmental priorities. He has also pledged to pull the US out of the Paris agreement to cut emissions and fight climate changes. Share of Danish firm Vestas, the world’s second-largest wind turbine producer, fell along with those of Spain’s Gamesa and Germany company Siemens. US carmakers who have plants in Mexico to take advantage of lower labour costs would lose out from Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on vehicles shipped north. Toyota, Nissan and Volkswagen would also be hit as they too have factories south of the border. Oil drillers. Gas pipelines. Coal. The defense industry. These are the likely winners of a Trump administration. https://t.co/Zd7lay5sYX— nzherald Business (@nzheraldbiz) November 10, 2016 Read my FX op-ed FX Winners & Losers after a Trump victory on CNBC https://t.co/CbNJz5rHNb .CNBC .business GlobalFX #fx #fxtrading— Keith Underwood (Underwood_FX) November 9, 2016 Media: Euronews Business It's possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. On Friday, Ford would say only that the MKC decision was \"recent,\" but spokeswoman Christin Baker wouldn't say exactly when it was made or whether Trump directly influenced it. Related Stories",

(Al Drago/The New York Times) Photo: AL DRAGO, NYT Trump claims to save Ford plant 1  /  2 Back to Gallery DETROIT — President-elect Donald Trump claimed that he persuaded the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes.\nTrump said in a tweet late Thursday that Bill Ford , the company’s executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a “Lincoln plant” would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small sport utility vehicle at the Louisville Assembly Plant . Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant to build more Ford Escapes there.\nA factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers , Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving production of the MKC. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost.\nIt’s possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed.\nOn Friday, Ford would say only that the MKC decision was “recent,” but spokeswoman Christin Baker wouldn’t say exactly when it was made or whether Trump directly influenced it.\nThe MKC and Escape are essentially the same vehicle and are now built by the same workers on the same assembly line. But while Ford has sold more than 258,000 Escapes so far this year, it has only sold about 21,000 MKCs. So, moving the MKC would have had little impact on the factory even if Escape production was not increased.\nStill, Trump claimed credit for saving a factory from moving to Mexico. “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!” Trump said in one of two tweets on the subject.\nFord Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker’s plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday the presidential election didn’t change the company’s plan.\nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs.\nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Mich. But jobs at the plant would be preserved because it’s getting a new SUV and pickup truck.",

      "text": "Share View photos A newly remodeled Ford F250 Super Duty truck is displayed in front of the new Louisville Ford truck plant in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S. September 30, 2016. REUTERS/Bryan Woolston More By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N), one of Donald Trump's prime corporate targets on the campaign trail, offered the President-elect a chance to claim a victory late on Thursday by informing him it would not shift production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle to Mexico from Kentucky. Trump jumped at the chance, claiming in a tweet that he had \"worked hard\" with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to keep the plant in Kentucky, even though Ford had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border. In letting Trump claim a victory, Ford made what appeared to be a calculated, public appeal to the next president in an attempt to soothe concerns about outsourcing jobs and to gain some leverage with the new administration as the automaker pushes for favourable policy changes in Congress. \"Ford is not going to make a decision on a purely political basis,\" said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labour and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. \"They are going to make a decision that makes business sense, economic sense and if it happens to align with political goals, that's great,\" she said. The No. 2 automaker in the United States is not the only company in Trump's crosshairs working out how to deal with the new political reality in Washington. Apple Inc (AAPL.O), criticized by Trump for not building products in the United States, is studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, Japanese news service Nikkei reported on Thursday. Apple did not reply to a request for comment on Friday. JOBS = VOTES Trump campaigned heavily on bringing jobs to the United States and attacking companies such as Ford that plan to take some production overseas, a message that resonated in the economically ravaged centre of the country. Ford gave Trump plenty of ammunition, confirming in September that all of its remaining small-car production in the United States, at its facility in Wayne, Michigan, would go to lower-cost Mexico by 2019. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said no plants would be closed as a result, and no U.S. jobs would be lost as capacity at the Wayne plant would be taken up by two new models. The Mexico plans remain in place, despite the fact that Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop Ford opening a new plant in that country and promised to slap 35 percent tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. Ford went further this month, announcing on Election Day a new $195 million investment in India to add 3,000 jobs over the next five years in a technology and business centre in Chennai. Ford said this week it would import its Ford EcoSport built in India to the United States. Trump has not made any public comment on that plan. BOTH CLAIM VICTORY On Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky. As such, nothing changed, but letting Trump announce the decision gave him the opportunity to claim he saved U.S. jobs and cast Ford as a patriotic manufacturer. \"Both sides will claim a certain level of victory because nobody wants a significant negative impact on the industry,\" said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research. It was unclear how many, if any, jobs were actually saved by the decision. Ford decided last year to move MKC production by 2019, on the assumption that production of the Ford Escape, a similar vehicle made in the same plant, would grow. But recently Escape demand has slumped, which may have prompted Ford to reconsider. According to Cole, Ford's olive branch to Trump was a clear indication that it needs help from the next administration as it faces a host of issues from fuel economy standards and the rise of autonomous vehicles to trade and currency. Cole said Trump, who boasts about his dealmaking skills, may choose to focus on bargaining with companies he has targeted - even if only for small concessions - rather than pursue more punitive measures such as tariffs, which would take time to implement and potentially damage the economy. Ford nodded to those wider issues in a statement on Friday, saying it was encouraged that Trump's economic policies \"will help improve U.S. competitiveness.\" Ford, like other global U.S. corporations, agrees with key aspects of Trump's economic plans. It has called for U.S. tax reform and raised concerns about the costs of federal regulations. Ford also shares Trump's concerns about currency manipulation. (Editing by Bill Rigby)",

      "text": "Tip : Use comma (,) to separate multiple quotes. Learn more... \nSat, Nov 19, 2016, 11:37 AM SGT - Singapore Markets closed Trump says he kept Ford from relocating plant to Mexico AFP – 9 hours ago Print \nFord confirmed Friday that it will keep production of one SUV model in Kentucky, rather than relocating as planned, a decision US President-elect Donald Trump claimed as a personal victory. \n\"Just hung up on the phone with my friend Bill Ford, the chairman of Ford's board, who let me know he was going to keep the Lincoln site in Kentucky - No Mexico,\" Trump wrote on Twitter Thursday night. \nTrump's declaration was met with some derision since Ford had not publicly announced plans to move the Lincoln MKC production. And just this week Ford confirmed it will proceed with plans to move production of the Focus to Mexico from Michigan, a state Trump narrowly won in last week's election. \nBut under the last year's contract agreement with the powerful United Automobile Workers union, Ford had made plans to move the smaller Lincoln MKC production line to make room for the Escape. Ford's Louisville plant produces the Lincoln MKC as well as the Ford Escape, both small SUVs. \n\"Cuautilan plant in Mexico was likely the plant for MKC,\" Ford spokesman Christine Baker, told AFP in an email Friday. \nFord already produces the Lincoln MKZ sedan on the Hermosillo site, and in early April announced a $1.6 billion investment in a new site in Mexico. \nBut, the company said in a statement, \"Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky.\" \nOne of the main themes of Trump's campaign was to bring back manufacturing jobs that American companies had moved overseas in search of cheap labor. Ford and the IT giant Apple were his favorite targets. \nTrump even threatened to impose a 35 percent punitive import duty on cars produced in Mexico, and to renegotiate the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). \nHis rhetoric seems to have worked since several states where the car industry is strongly represented and that traditionally voted Democratic, such as Michigan and Wisconsin, voted for Trump, tipping the election. \nFord said of the decision, \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve US competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\" \nBut the company defended its record, saying it employs more American auto workers and produces more American-made vehicles than any other company, and has invested $12 billion US plants in the past five years and created nearly 28,000 US jobs. \n\"We continue to engage with President-elect Trump's team -- and the new Congress -- as they shape the policy agenda for 2017. We have shared our commitment to continue investing in the US and creating American jobs,\" Ford said. \nlo/jld/vog/hs/dw China's African population declines amid slowdown, crackdown Associated Press - 29 minutes ago Dreams are fading in China for African traders like Mouhamadou Moustapha Dieng, who in 2003 was among the first wave of Africans to set up homes and companies in this port city and forge trading links ... … More » Hong Kong, Chile ink investment deal at APEC meeting Associated Press - 39 minutes ago Hong Kong and Chile have signed a bilateral investment agreement on the sidelines of an Asian-Pacific summit in Peru.

      "text": "November 18, 2016 Shifting US policy to right, Trump taps Sessions, Flynn \nIn a statement on Thursday night, following Trump’s tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model – the MKC – from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky. \n“Today, we confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,” the company said in a statement. “We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.” \nIn a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico. \nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan. \nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead. \nIn an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants — most notably, in Kentucky. \nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs. \nBill Ford Jr., the company’s executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate’s frequent campaign attacks on Ford’s decision to move small-car production to Mexico. \n“I’ve had a very good meeting with him,” Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. “He’s a very good listener and he knows the facts.” Tags:",

But it wasn't closing. 1 / 4 Back to Gallery DETROIT (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes. Trump said in a tweet that Bill Ford , the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a \"Lincoln plant\" would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant . Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there. A factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers , Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving production of the MKC. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost. \nThe world’s business leaders are busy assessing whether their companies will gain or suffer from US presidential election winner Donald Trump’s proposed policy changes. The biggest problem is that he has not fleshed out the slogans, threats and vague promises made during his campaign. Winners The pharmaceutical industry should be happy Hillary Clinton is not heading for the White House given that she had promised to crack down on what she called “excessive price increases”. The shares of firms like Pfizer and Merck rallied in relief. Tech firms like Apple, Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet have kept billions of dollars of profits out of the US rather than pay the current 39 percent corporation tax. Trump has proposed a one-off 10 percent rate for repatriated cash. Fossil fuel firms could benefit given the president elect has said global warming is “a hoax”. So might mining companies, steel manufacturers and builders from his infrastructure spending promises. Losers The likely losers include renewable energy companies as the Trump victory threatens to reverse US energy and environmental priorities. He has also pledged to pull the US out of the Paris agreement to cut emissions and fight climate changes. Share of Danish firm Vestas, the world’s second-largest wind turbine producer, fell along with those of Spain’s Gamesa and Germany company Siemens. US carmakers who have plants in Mexico to take advantage of lower labour costs would lose out from Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on vehicles shipped north. Toyota, Nissan and Volkswagen would also be hit as they too have factories south of the border. Oil drillers. Gas pipelines. Coal. The defense industry. These are the likely winners of a Trump administration. https://t.co/Zd7lay5sYX— nzherald Business (@nzheraldbiz) November 10, 2016 Read my FX op-ed FX Winners & Losers after a Trump victory on CNBC https://t.co/CbNJz5rHNb .CNBC .business GlobalFX #fx #fxtrading— Keith Underwood (Underwood_FX) November 9, 2016 Media: Euronews Business It's possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. On Friday, Ford would say only that the MKC decision was \"recent,\" but spokeswoman Christin Baker wouldn't say exactly when it was made or whether Trump directly influenced it. Related Stories ",

Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost. \nIt's possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. \nOn Friday, Ford would say only that the MKC decision was \"recent,\" but spokeswoman Christin Baker wouldn't say exactly when it was made or whether Trump directly influenced it. \nThe MKC and Escape are essentially the same vehicle and are now built by the same workers on the same assembly line. But while Ford has sold more than 258,000 Escapes so far this year, it's only sold about 21,000 MKCs. So, moving the MKC would have had little impact on the factory even if Escape production was not increased. \nStill, Trump claimed credit for saving a factory from moving to Mexico. \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\" Trump said in one of two tweets on the subject. His initial tweet said: \"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico.\" \nFord Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker's plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. About Us",

      "text": "The 24 Hour War Is The Latest Documentary About Ford, Ferrari And Le Mans | By Share There has been countless stories about the Le Mans Ford-Ferrari rivalry , and this is the latest one. Back in the early 1960’s, Ferrari was the name of the game at the notorious 24 Hour race, and everybody else was trying to put an end to the Prancing Horse’s winning streak. To make matters even more complicated, the event wasn’t a walk in the park, making Ferrari even more unbeatable. For instance, between 1960 and 1969, there were six fatalities recorded. A win at Le Mans translated into a lot of prestige and Ford wanted to boost its sales through racing, but since the American car maker didn’t have any motorsport pedigree, it decided to buy the one with the most: Ferrari. However, after the deal fell through, Ford was determined to beat Ferrari at their own game, thus developing the famous GT40 . The rest is not history, contrary to popular belief, because it wasn’t easy for Ford to get the victory streak going against the Maranello team. In 1964 and 1965, none of the GT40s even finished the race, but everything changed after Carroll Shelby famously said “Next year, Ferrari’s ass is mine”. Like a fable, you might have heard the tale before, but the new documentary offers an alternative glimpse into the past with interactive, period-correct scenes, and through the words of countless racing drivers and automotive personalities.

      "text": "On Thursday evening, President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter to announce that he “Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico.” He followed up a few minutes later to assert his role in the decision: “I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!”\nThe tweets received almost immediate pushback: According to several news outlets, including The New York Times and The Washington Post , Ford had never planned to move the plant in question to Mexico. In fact, the company had simply been planning to phase out American production of one car model, the Lincoln MKC, by 2019—a move which would have had a net-zero effect on employment in the Louisville plant, since it’s ramping up production of other models. Though the connection between the phone call and Ford’s decision remains unclear, The Wall Street Journal later reported that “people close to [Bill Ford] … see the Lincoln move as a relatively painless but authentic way to give Mr. Trump a victory even before he moves into the White House.”\nRecommended: Progress Isn't Natural\nSo far, neither Trump nor anybody on his transition team has clarified Trump’s tweets, which, it should be noted, are not the first time that the president-elect has tweeted about the topic. In October of last year, Trump likewise claimed, both in a speech and via tweet , that Ford had decided against building a plant in Mexico because of attention he had drawn to the proposal. Although Ford quickly responded that it had not, in fact, cancelled this plan, Trump tweeted twice more to take credit for the alleged decision and assert that his opponents could not have done the same.\nThis type of interaction between Trump and a corporation has become significantly more noteworthy now that he will soon be occupying the most powerful office in the world. First and foremost, there is the question of the tweets’ veracity. Even if, as he claims, Ford’s ultimate decision not to shift production of the MKC to Mexico was due to his intervention, Trump’s initial statement was somewhat misleading: Not only did Ford not, in fact, have plans to move the plant in question out of the country, or even out of the state, but the company has said that it likely will not be able to move any plants out of the country until its current contract with the United Auto Workers union expires in 2019.\nA second notable aspect is the president-elect’s choice of forum in which to tell the public about the phone call: Twitter. There are two ways of thinking about what that means for the American economy. One the one hand, Trump’s cavalier use of the social network was already the subject of consternation throughout the campaign, including among his own staff, who reportedly took away his phone as the election approached . When he was merely a candidate, Trump’s more off-the-cuff statements—for instance, his calls to boycott major companies , including Apple, Macy’s, and Starbucks—were easy to write off. But when he becomes president in January, Trump’s tweets will be a de facto platform for the positions of the U.S. government. Some of his more antagonistic habits— railing against China, for instance , which has already prompted pushback from the Chinese government , or continually describing The New York Times as “failing” —could have real ramifications in the global market.\nRecommended: Why Silicon Valley May Warm to Trump\nBut on the other hand, if, as the Wall Street Journal implies, the substance of his tweet—that Trump’s phone calls with Ford executives led to the decision to keep MKC production in Kentucky—is correct, the president-elect’s use of Twitter could be the first window into how he intends to wield his power once he enters the Oval Office. Throughout the campaign, Trump bragged that he would use his bully pulpit to keep manufacturing jobs in the United States. Already, conservative news outlets are championing Ford’s decision as an example of a “ Trump Effect ,” citing both his stance in October 2015 and Thursday’s announcement as evidence that he will be able to publicly pressure companies into decisions they otherwise would not make. If so, Trump’s tweet may be the first implementation of a new strategy in which the president-to-be uses the publicity his office affords to directly influence private corporations.\nThe problem with this approach is that the government already has a robust framework for regulating corporate behavior through various bodies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission. As Timothy Lee observed at Vox , the idea of a president personally calling up executives to cajole them into cooperation challenges not only the existing regulatory apparatus but also long-held notions of corporate autonomy. “Given the vast powers of the modern administrative state,” Lee writes, “few CEOs could afford to take the risk of antagonizing a freshly-elected president,” especially if Trump stocks these agencies with administrators willing to carry out his threats.\nRecommended: My Life as a Retail Worker: Nasty, Brutish, and Poor\nAs was true with so many other aspects of his candidacy and electoral victory, President-elect Trump is likely to enter uncharted territory in his use of Twitter. Even since before his election, President Obama’s social-media feeds, both personal and presidential , have tended toward the anodyne, an apparent reflection of his relatively subdued public persona and his willingness to delegate most content creation to staffers. Trump, on the other hand, appears more inclined to embrace Twitter’s conduciveness to confrontation. Though his Ford tweets have not had any material effect on the company, they highlight how Trump’s use of Twitter could come to have major ramifications for any economic actor that threatens to cross him.\nRead more from The Atlantic :\nCan America’s Companies Survive America’s Most Aggressive Investors?

      "text": "Ford Motor Co. Chairman Bill Ford called Donald Trump to tell the president-elect the auto maker won't move production of Lincolns out of Kentucky, a sign the car company aims to work with a new administration on protecting American manufacturing workers.\nMr. Trump, in a tweet posted to his Twitter account late Thursday, said he had \"just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky—no Mexico.\" He then added in a second tweet \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky.\"\nThe auto maker confirmed in a statement that production of the Lincoln MKC crossover will remain at its assembly plant in Louisville, Ky. Ford had initially planned to move output of the Lincoln model to another plant to boost production of the Escape, which is built at the same factory. The company didn't say where it had planned to move production of the Lincoln crossover.\nFord communicated that plan to the United Auto Workers in 2015 as part of a broader contract negotiation. The Louisville plant, employing about 4,700 workers, wasn't in danger of closing.\n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" the company said.\nMr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to bring U.S. manufacturing jobs back and took aim at Ford's separate plans to move small-car production from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion factory it is building in Mexico. That product, the Focus, is separate from the Lincoln Mr. Trump referred to, and Ford is still planning to move those small cars to Mexico, Chief Executive Mark Fields said earlier this week.\nAs the Republican candidate for president, Mr. Trump proposed a 35% tariff on vehicles or other products built abroad and imported by the U.S. by companies like Ford. Mr. Fields said a tariff would have negative consequences for the broader auto industry and the U.S. economy.\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Trump didn't immediately return a request for comment.\nFord executives, including Mr. Ford, have repeatedly stressed the company's shift in factory output to Mexico won't cost any U.S. jobs and the Michigan factory losing small-car production will eventually get new models to keep the assembly lines running.\nFord says it has invested $12 billion in its U.S. factories over the past five years creating 28,000 jobs.\nMr. Fields told reporters Ford has talked to Mr. Trump's transition team and believes the company can work with the new administration. \"We all share the same objective,\" Mr. Fields said.\nFord's Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks was also encouraged by Mr. Trump's recent remarks, saying earlier Thursday he believes the president-elect is pursuing \"pro-growth\" policies, including on trade.\nLike many of its rivals, Ford is increasing production of more profitable trucks and sport-utility vehicles in the U.S. while investing to boost output in Mexico for lower-margin small cars.\nMr. Trump has said he would begin renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement that covers Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.\nIf Mexico doesn't agree to improve terms, the U.S. will leave the pact, Mr. Trump said. He blames unfair trade, in particular with Mexico and China, for the loss of millions of factory jobs–a message that resonated with voters in Michigan during the election. Mr. Trump won Michigan, the first Republican candidate to do that since 1988.\nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com\n(END) 18, 2016 01:25 ET (06:25 ",

      "text": "12:00 AM, November 20, 2016 / LAST MODIFIED: 12:00 AM, November 20, 2016 Under pressure on US jobs, Ford tries new gambit with Trump 0 Copy this link Reuters, Washington \nFord Motor Co, one of Donald Trump's prime corporate targets on the campaign trail, offered the President-elect a chance to claim a victory late on Thursday by informing him it would not shift production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle to Mexico from Kentucky. \nTrump jumped at the chance, claiming in a tweet that he had \"worked hard\" with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr to keep the plant in Kentucky, even though Ford had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border. \nIn letting Trump claim a victory, Ford made what appeared to be a calculated, public appeal to the next president in an attempt to soothe concerns about outsourcing jobs and to gain some leverage with the new administration as the automaker pushes for favorable policy changes in Congress. \n\"Ford is not going to make a decision on a purely political basis,\" said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. \"They are going to make a decision that makes business sense, economic sense and if it happens to align with political goals, that's great,\" she said. \nThe No. 2 automaker in the United States is not the only company in Trump's crosshairs working out how to deal with the new political reality in Washington. \nApple Inc, criticized by Trump for not building products in the United States, is studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, Japanese news service Nikkei reported on Thursday. \nApple did not reply to a request for comment on Friday. Trump campaigned heavily on bringing jobs to the United States and attacking companies such as Ford that plan to take some production overseas, a message that resonated in the economically ravaged center of the country. \nFord gave Trump plenty of ammunition, confirming in September that all of its remaining small-car production in the United States, at its facility in Wayne, Michigan, would go to lower-cost Mexico by 2019. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said no plants would be closed as a result, and no US jobs would be lost as capacity at the Wayne plant would be taken up by two new models. \nThe Mexico plans remain in place, despite the fact that Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop Ford opening a new plant in that country and promised to slap 35 percent tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there. \nFord went further this month, announcing on Election Day a new $195 million investment in India to add 3,000 jobs over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said this week it would import its Ford EcoSport built in India to the United States. Trump has not made any public comment on that plan. \nOn Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky.

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump claimed credit on Thursday for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky from moving to Mexico. But the company never planned to move the entire plant, only one of its production lines.\nOn Thursday night, Trump tweeted: \"Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\"\nThen followed it up with this tweet: \"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!\"\nFord has never announced any plans to move either its Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, which produces the Lincoln Navigator, or the Louisville Assembly Plant, which produces the Lincoln MKC, to Mexico.\nFord shifting all U.S. small-car production to Mexico Greg Gardner Ford is shifting all North American small-car production to Mexico, CEO Mark Fields told investors Wednesday.\n“Over the next two to three years, we will have migrated all of our small-car production to Mexico and out of the United States,” Fields said.\nThe auto industry has known for decades that...\nFord is shifting all North American small-car production to Mexico, CEO Mark Fields told investors Wednesday.\n“Over the next two to three years, we will have migrated all of our small-car production to Mexico and out of the United States,” Fields said.\nThe auto industry has known for decades that...\n(Greg Gardner) In a statement on Thursday night, following Trump's tweet, the company said it had told Trump it would cancel a plan to shift production of a single model — the MKC — from Kentucky to Mexico. The company last year indicated it would be moving MKC production out of Louisville, though it did not announce where it was going. At the time, union leaders said the shift would not cost any jobs in Kentucky.\n\"Today, we confirmed with the president-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly Plant will stay in Kentucky,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States.\"\nFord CEO says production plans on track despite election Tribune news services Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement ...\nFord Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields says the presidential election won't change the company's plans to move small car production to Mexico.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico. Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement ...\n(Tribune news services) In a follow-up email exchange, a Ford spokeswoman confirmed that the MKC production had been slated to move to Mexico.\nThis week, Ford chief executive Mark Fields reiterated that it was moving forward with plans to shift production of the Ford Focus to Mexico from Michigan.\nTrump has criticized those plans, which the company says will not cost any American jobs, because other models will be produced in the Michigan plant instead.\nIn an interview with Reuters, Fields highlighted the investments the company was making in domestic plants — most notably, in Kentucky.\nFord announced a $1.3 billion investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant late last year. It said the move would create 2,000 new jobs.\nBill Ford Jr., the company's executive chairman, said in October that he had met with Trump over the then-candidate's frequent campaign attacks on Ford's decision to move small-car production to Mexico.\n\"I've had a very good meeting with him,\" Ford Jr. told the Economic Club of Washington. \"He's a very good listener and he knows the facts.\"\n Mexico Donald Trump The Lincoln Motor Company",

      "text": "Back to Top Post by andyw on Apr 28, 2015 19:41:23 GMT So picking up the story once more, my good friend Josh in the 'States sent me over some US spec headlamp covers which improve the front end look getting rid of the fillet panels infront of the lights - strangely the Yanks want all our european spac stuff! They were a pain to fit and I had to chop them about a bit and drill new holes to fit the UK frames!Eyes were a temporary measure until I got the roller out again!The tyres were getting a bit old and starting to crack so I wanted to replace them. The way I see it, if you are going to replace something then if you can upgrade it for more or less the same money then you might as well.In this case cheap 15\" tyres didn't seem much cheaper than cheap 17\" tyres so I started to look out for some bigger rims. 15\" wheels look a bit small on a Probe so I started to reaearch other manufacturers who did large diameter steel rims.I did see some chrysler/dodge winter steels adertised new but they were £300+ for a set. They were the same bolt pattern and only 1mm difference in offset, even the centre bore matched. So they were what I needed but not at that price.After some careful watching on e-bay as set of Dodge Avenger steels came up - 99p start but collection only, in Guilford! After checking with a club mate to see if they would collect and store them I put in a bid! And won them for 99p! They also came with some brake pads and a set of trims. I managed to sell the trims on e-bay and got my 99p back! A local club member collected them at a show at Beaulieu and brought them up to the North East for me.Just checking them against the car I knew they would be a big improvement!",

      "text": "November 18, 2016 Trump took credit for stopping Ford from moving a plant to Mexico. But it wasn’t planning to. \nThink superhero speed and accuracy for forecasting. Super high-definition TV, versus black-and-white. \n“Really a quantum leap above any satellite NOAA has ever flown,” said Stephen Volz, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s director of satellites. \n“For the American public, that will mean faster, more accurate weather forecasts and warnings,” Volz said earlier in the week. “That also will mean more lives saved and better environmental intelligence” for government officials responsible for hurricane and other evacuations. \nAirline passengers also stand to benefit, as do rocket launch teams. Improved forecasting will help pilots avoid bad weather and help rocket scientists know when to call off a launch. \nThe first in a series of four high-tech satellites, GOES-R hitched a ride on an unmanned Atlas V rocket, delayed an hour by rocket and other problems. NOAA teamed up with NASA for the mission. \nThe satellite — valued by NOAA at $1 billion — is aiming for a 22,300-mile-high equatorial orbit. There, it will join three aging spacecraft with 40-year-old technology, and become known as GOES-16. After months of testing, this newest satellite will take over for one of the older ones. The second satellite in the series will follow in 2018. All told, the series should stretch to 2036. \nGOES stands for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. The first was launched in 1975. \nGOES-R’s premier imager — one of six science instruments — will offer three times as many channels as the existing system, four times the resolution and five times the scan speed, said NOAA program director Greg Mandt. A similar imager is also flying on a Japanese weather satellite. \nTypically, it will churn out full images of the Western Hemisphere every 15 minutes and the continental United States every five minutes. Specific storm regions will be updated every 30 seconds. \nForecasters will get pictures “like they’ve never seen before,” Mandt promised. \nA first-of-its-kind lightning mapper, meanwhile, will take 500 snapshots a second. \nThis next-generation GOES program — $11 billion in all — includes four satellites, an extensive land system of satellite dishes and other equipment, and new methods for crunching the massive, nonstop stream of expected data. \nHurricane Matthew, interestingly enough, delayed the launch by a couple weeks. As the hurricane bore down on Florida in early October, launch preps were put on hold. Matthew stayed far enough offshore to cause minimal damage to Cape Canaveral, despite some early forecasts that suggested a direct strike.",

      "text": "Close The Associated Press \nThen-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a national security meeting with advisers at Trump Tower in New York on Oct. 7 . Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. listens. AP Trump claims to save Ford auto plant. But it wasn't closing. Associated Press ( … ) The Associated Press \nThen-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a national security meeting with advisers at Trump Tower in New York on Oct. 7 . Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. listens. \nDETROIT — President-elect Donald Trump claimed Thursday that he convinced the chairman of Ford Motor Co. not to move an assembly plant from Kentucky to Mexico. But Ford never intended to move the plant, just production of one of the vehicles it makes. \nTrump said in a tweet that Bill Ford, the company's executive chairman, telephoned him with the news that a \"Lincoln plant\" would stay in Louisville. Instead Ford decided to keep production of the Lincoln MKC small SUV at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Ford had previously said it would move production of the MKC out of the plant in order to build more Ford Escapes there. \nA factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico, was likely to get the MKC. Under a contract negotiated last year with the United Auto Workers, Ford agreed to invest $700 million in the Louisville plant in return for moving the MKC production. Because Escape production would increase, no Louisville jobs would be lost. \nIt's possible the decision to keep the MKC in Kentucky was made before the election, because Escape sales have been falling since July and additional production capacity in Louisville may not be needed. Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said she didn't know when that decision was made or if Trump had any impact on it. \n\"I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!,\" Trump said in the tweet claiming credit for Ford's decision. \nFord Motor Co. and Trump have engaged in a yearlong feud over the automaker's plans to move production south of the border. The company plans to shift small-car production from suburban Detroit to Mexico to improve profitability of the lower-priced cars. CEO Mark Fields said Tuesday that the presidential election didn't change the company's plan. \nTrump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and has called for a 35 percent tariff on goods shipped from Mexico in an effort to preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs. \nFord plans to move production of the Focus and C-Max small cars to Mexico from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. But jobs at the Wayne plant would be preserved because it's getting a new SUV and small pickup truck. \nBill Ford met with Trump during the summer and spoke with him on Thursday, Baker said. \n\"We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,\" she said in an e-mail.

      "text": "Ford must be more selfish: Eddie Jones Duncan Bech - AAP on November 21, 2016, 12:25 pm England coach Eddie Jones has challenged his five-eighth George Ford to be more selfish. Share Ford must be more selfish: Eddie Jones - Yahoo New Zealand Eddie Jones rates George Ford above world player of the year winner Beauden Barrett, but insists England's five-eighth must become more selfish. \nFord produced the most assured performance of his 27 caps as Fiji were overwhelmed 58-15 at Twickenham on Saturday, his vision, timing and variety of passing instrumental in a nine-try rout that extended his team's winning run to 12 Tests. \nJones believes the next phase of his development will be to provide a greater running threat believing that he has the potential to eclipse Barrett, the New Zealand playmaker who was crowned World Rugby's player of the year last weekend. \n\"I think George can be better than Beauden Barrett - no doubt about that,\" Jones said. \n\"People rave about Beauden Barrett but I don't. I don't want to go into it any more than that. I'll leave it at that. \n\"I don't pick the Player of the Year but I always thought Barrett would get it because the Kiwis run everything. When you run everything, you've got a good chance of winning it. \n\"George probably now feels a sense of security and I think he enjoys the sort of rugby we're trying to play. He's got a beautiful skill-set. \n\"He's got a great feel for the game. He sees opportunities. He needs to work on his running game a bit, which we will work on. He needs to be more of a threat himself. \n\"He's actually too selfless. He needs to be a bit more selfish with the ball at times and he will start to develop that in his game.\" \nSouth Africa and Fiji have been swept aside so far this autumn, leaving Argentina and Australia as the final hurdles to be overcome before England's record 14-Test triumphant sequence can be equalled. \nThe victory over the Pacific Islanders marked the first-year anniversary of Jones' reign to the day and - while it has been a near-faultless procession for the Australian - he is aware that fortunes can change quickly. \n\"It's always fun when you are winning. Our big test is when you lose a game,\" Jones said.",
