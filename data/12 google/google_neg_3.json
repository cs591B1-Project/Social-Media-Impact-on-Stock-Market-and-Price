      "text": " Google+\nBy Bryan Marquard Globe Staff November 10, 2016\nHandout\nHelen Spaulding.\n“I love my city,” Helen Spaulding told the Globe a couple of years after joining the board of the Boston Foundation , an institution she helped reshape while chairing its board.\n“There are terrible problems, of course,” she continued in that 1994 interview, “but the way for me to grow and to find out all the wonderful things that are happening is through volunteering.”\nAdvertisement\nMrs. Spaulding, who died of complications from Alzheimer’s disease Saturday in the Falmouth By The Sea skilled rehabilitation center in Falmouth, Maine, had a far-reaching impact on some of Greater Boston’s enduring institutions through her decades as a volunteer. She was 88.\nServing on numerous boards, she was among the principal founders of the New England Aquarium, which rose on Boston’s waterfront due in no small part to her fund-raising. “Along with the other founders, she really made the aquarium happen,” said Nigella Hillgarth, the aquarium’s president and CEO. “She really broadened the reach of donors. We owe her a huge debt of gratitude.”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here At the Boston Foundation, meanwhile, Mrs. Spaulding helped change the organization’s structure from the trust form of its early-1900s beginnings to a charitable corporation, which gave the board greater control over governance and finances.\n“The biggest impact was her commitment to really allowing the Boston Foundation to become the dynamic engine of philanthropy it has become,” said the Rev. Ray Hammond, who is pastor of the Bethel AME Church in Jamaica Plain and succeeded Mrs. Spaulding as chairman of the foundation’s board. “And to that end, she really mentored a younger generation of leadership coming behind her, including myself. For all of that we are deeply grateful.”\nPaul Grogan, who became the foundation’s president during Mrs. Spaulding’s last year chairing the board, said she also helped lead the organization into a more public role. “Doing good quietly” had been the guiding principle, he said, but she asked: “Why can’t we play a larger role beyond grant-making to help this community face up to its challenges and act on them?” That led, for example, to the community forums the foundation holds to engage in public policy.\nAdvertisement\n“She really felt we could get more out of this institution and that it could carry a heavier load – that civic leadership could be as important as the other roles we play,” Grogan said.\nA longtime political activist, Mrs. Spaulding had campaigned for her late husband, Josiah A. Spaulding, a former state Republican Party chairman who ran for state attorney general and challenged US Senator Edward M. Kennedy in the early 1970s. After her husband died of a heart attack at 60 in 1983, Mrs. Spaulding shifted her political work to Democrats and raised funds for the presidential campaigns of Michael S. Dukakis and Bill Clinton.\n“I can’t remember a time when Helen wasn’t deeply involved in important issues – national, state, and local,” Dukakis said. “That’s the best form of citizenship, and she really was a great citizen.”\nThe second of three children, Helen Hamilton Bowdoin was born in New York City, a daughter of George Temple Bowdoin, who worked in finance for J.P. Morgan & Co., and the former Emily Ligon, who was from Montgomery, Ala.\nA descendent of James Bowdoin, the second Massachusetts governor and founder of Bowdoin College, and of Alexander Hamilton, the first US Treasury secretary, Mrs. Spaulding grew up in New York and Washington, D.C. She graduated from the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., and attended Holton-Arms Junior College in Washington.\nMrs. Spaulding also was a stepdaughter of Edward Foley, a Treasury undersecretary in the Truman administration who chaired John F. Kennedy’s inaugural committee. A longtime friend of Jacqueline Bouvier, Mrs. Spaulding was a bridal attendant at the Kennedys’ wedding in 1953.\nFour years earlier, she had married Josiah Augustus Spaulding, who was known as Si, in St. Mary’s Chapel of Washington National Cathedral. A former Marine lieutenant colonel and a decorated pilot, he was a partner in the Boston law firm Bingham, Dana & Gould, and was president of Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. The family lived in Manchester-by-the-Sea.\n“She was committed to something that she and my dad introduced to their children, and that was that you have a responsibility in this world to give back,” said their oldest son, Joe, who lives in Charlestown and is president and CEO of the Boch Center for the performing arts.\n“Mom lived up to that in a huge way,” he added. “At each one of the institutions she served, she was a leader and in some cases the founder to create a better world for all.”\nMrs. Spaulding joined the aquarium’s board in 1967 and was the board president from 1979 to 1983. She chaired the Boston Foundation’s board for the last five years of her tenure, which ran from 1992 to 2002. Among about 30 other boards she served were those for Georgetown University, Massachusetts General Hospital, the Smithsonian Institution, the Museum of Science, the Conservation Law Foundation, the World Wildlife Fund, and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.\nWhen Mrs. Spaulding began serving on boards, she often was the only woman in the room, and those early years brought some frustrations. “It makes me mad when I run into some professional who makes me feel I’m not really worthy of going on the board,” she said in the 1994 Globe interview, and added: “I’m not going to retreat. It’s my personality. I’m too interested in what makes the world go around.”\nMrs. Spaulding “was formidable, but absolutely a great delight,” Grogan said. “She was well-informed, she had opinions, and she was, I would say, very direct. She didn’t sneak up on things – she said what was on her mind. On the other hand, she was also a very good listener, which is critical to being a board leader.”\nDukakis recalled that Mrs. Spaulding “felt strongly about things and not only expressed those feelings, but acted on them, and nobody appreciated that more than I do.”\nJust as active away from boardrooms, she traveled to destinations as distant as Papua New Guinea, and the Galapagos Islands, and had sailed with her husband along the coast of Maine, where the family kept an island home on Vinalhaven.\nIn addition to her son Joe, Mrs. Spaulding leaves her two other sons, Jeb of Montpelier, Vt., and Sandy of Portland, Maine; her two sisters, Aileen Train and Judy Murray, both of Hobe Sound, Fla.; 11 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.\nA memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Dec. 3 in Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Charlestown.\nPolitics were a perpetual topic at the dinners Mrs. Spaulding held for family or friends, and the invite list for her dinner parties could run to 40 guests, who gathered around three or four tables. “She saved a book that had a listing of every single dinner party she did for 40 years, and the seating chart of every single one as well,” Joe said.\nIn keeping with her belief that people should spend their lives learning something new, he added, “at two or three occasions at each party she would stand and ask the person to your right to move two chairs to the right and start another conversation.”\nBryan Marquard can be reached at bryan.marquard@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Steve Annear Globe Staff November 10, 2016\nThe United States Postal Service is investigating after a man in Cambridge this week said he saw a postal worker shout at a person of color to leave the country, calling it “Trump land.”\nYarden Katz, a fellow in the department of systems biology at Harvard Medical School, said in a telephone interview that he was at a Shell gas station at the corner of Webster and Cambridge streets around 1 p.m. Wednesday when a postal worker told an unidentified person, who looked to be of Hispanic descent, to “Go back to your country.”\nAdvertisement\nKatz said the worker, whom he described as a white male with a beard, then said, “You ain’t getting your check no more.”\n“It’s incredibly alarming,” said Katz, who shared a picture of the complaint he filed with the USPS on Twitter this week. “Just one day after the election and you see this kind of stuff. It’s very disturbing. I would not have expected to see it in Cambridge — and so visibly.”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Steve Doherty, a spokesman with the USPS, said the agency received a copy of Katz’s tweet on Thursday. The incident is being investigated by the customer service manager at the Cambridge Post Office, he said.\n“Appropriate action will be taken based on the outcome of that investigation,” he said in a statement. “The Postal Service does not tolerate or condone behavior of the type described in this tweet.”\nIn his report to the USPS, Katz included the seven-digit code that was written on the side of the postal worker’s vehicle.\nAdvertisement\nCambridge police did not receive any reports related to the incident, according to a department spokesman.\nAccording to Katz’s account of the incident, the unidentified man went into the gas station after the worker’s initial comments, and was accosted again when he came back out.\n“This guy seemed totally empowered to do it,” Katz told the Globe. “It wasn’t hush-hush. He was visibly yelling at this guy all this horrible racist stuff.”\nThe alleged altercation is similar to other racist treatment minorities have faced since President-elect Donald J. Trump’s Tuesday victory over Hillary Clinton.\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @steveannear .",

Sign up for more newsletters here News organizations had for weeks tried to coordinate a pool of journalists who could begin to travel with Trump immediately after Election Day if he won election. But his campaign did not cooperate with those requests and his senior advisers refused Wednesday, the day after the election, to discuss any such press arrangements.\nView Story Obama, Trump to meet this morning at the White House The meeting between President Obama and President-elect Trump symbolically began the transition of power.\nTrump also broke from tradition as a candidate, refusing to allow a pool of campaign reporters, photographers or cameras to fly on his plane as he traveled to events.\nEvery president in recent memory has traveled with a pool of journalists when they leave the White House grounds. A pool of reporters and photographers were in the motorcade when President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas.\nAdvertisement\nThe pool was just steps away from President Ronald Reagan when he was shot outside a hotel in the District of Columbia, and was stationed outside his hospital room as he recovered. The pool also travels on vacation and foreign trips and at times captures personal, historic moments of the presidency.\nNews organizations take turns serving in the small group, paying their way and sharing the material collected in the pool with the larger press corps. The pool also covers official events at the White House when space doesn’t allow for the full press corps.\nThe Associated Press is among those reaching out to Trump advisers about press access.",

      "text": " Google+\nPablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press\nPresident-elect Donald Trump spoke to the media after meeting with President Obama Thursday at the White House in Washington, D.C.\nBy Evan Horowitz Globe Staff November 10, 2016\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is beginning to answer key questions about how he’s going to manage the transition from private businessman to public servant. One of Trump’s attorney’s said Thursday that the incoming president would establish a blind trust that gives his children control of his companies.\nIt’s not clear if this plan clears the high bar Trump himself established with his promise to “ drain the swamp ” and crack down on conflicts of interest in Washington, D.C.\nAdvertisement\nKeeping the business in the family, for instance, falls short of best practice, which usually means handing control to an independent third-party. In this arrangement, Trump’s decisions as president will still be shadowed by uncertainty about whether his children will personally benefit.\nAren’t there laws to prevent conflicts of interest? Most people in government are subject to fairly strict rules regarding conflicts of interest. Cabinet members, for instance, have to recuse themselves from any decisions that might benefit them financially — including issues that would affect close family members.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here But the president and vice president are largely exempt from these rules . They can’t do anything too brazen, like handing taxpayer money directly over to their own companies — say through a government contract . But there’s still a lot of wiggle room.\nImagine a president who owned large debt-collection agency. Hiring that agency to collect student loan debt would be unacceptable. But the president could still sign new laws to tighten bankruptcy rules, encourage high-risk mortgages, or loosen restrictions on payday lending — even though these changes would undoubtedly boost his income and his company’s’ bottom line.\nFor someone with Trump’s history of international wheeling and dealing, the risk of a conflict-of-interest is very real: think beachfront property and climate change, overseas golf courses and foreign policy, or tax laws and his own hidden tax returns.\nAdvertisement\nTheoretically, Congress could pass tighter conflict-of-interest laws for the President, but so far there’s been no talk of that.\nWhere might Trump’s conflicts-of-interest lie? Without access to Trump’s tax returns, it’s hard to know for sure whether he has any potentially problematic financial entanglements — or with whom. Which is very much part of the point. One big reason Americans generally insist on seeing candidates’ taxes is so they can rule out even the appearance of a conflict of interest. Only then can we be sure that foreign policy is being conducted in the interests of the country as a whole — not the spoils of office.\nWhen it comes to Trump’s possible conflicts of interest, reports have highlighted ties to India and Azerbaijan , along with debts to banks in Germany and China , but there’s also been a lot speculation focused on Russia.\nThroughout the campaign, Trump has taken an unusually friendly tack towards Vladimir Putin, praising his leadership, and casting doubt on the consensus assessment that Russia was using cyber-espionage to sway the election.\nTrump has insisted that he has no money invested in Russia, but the real question is whether Russians have invested in him. It’s hard to know for sure, since Trump won’t release his tax returns, but over the years Trump seems to have borrowed substantially from Russian investors. Trump’s son and business partner, Donald Trump Jr., said in 2008 that Russians made up a disproportionate share of their assets, adding, “We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”\nIf Trump’s businesses really are reliant on Russian oligarchs, that could easily affect negotiations between the two countries.\nIs there any way for Trump to set aside his business interests? Trump’s recently-announced plan to put his businesses in a blind trust seems to echo the approach of other wealthy candidates and presidents . Both President Bushes took this tack, as did Mitt Romney — and it was the expected path for business-moguls Ross Perot and Steve Forbes.\nThe idea behind a blind trust is relatively simple. You don’t have to give up your money, just the ability to control how it’s invested. Instead, all investment decisions are instead made by a fiduciary stranger and kept secret.\nTrouble is, these strategies work best with paper assets, like stocks and bonds, which can be secretly shuffled between different investments without the president’s knowledge. But Trump’s assets aren’t like that. If some temporary custodian started selling off Trump’s golf course or buildings, that would be nearly impossible to hide.\nNot to mention the fact that the person in charge of a blind trust is supposed to be independent, which is hard to pull off when you hand control to your own kids.\nRather than empower his children, Trump could follow the lead of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who ran for office while still overseeing his own business empire. He eventually found a compromise to keep his economic interests from overlapping with his political decisions, handing daily control over to his executive team even as he held onto a huge ownership stake.\nBloomberg’s arrangement drew its share of criticism , but it was sanctioned — and partially strengthened — by the city’s “Conflicts of Interest Board.”\nTrump could try to follow this approach, but there is no presidential “conflict of interest board” ready to vet his plans. And being president would give him economic sway that Bloomberg never had as mayor.\nWhat happens if Trump becomes the first president-businessman? There is no law preventing Donald Trump from trying to have it all: serving as president of the United States while still keeping the Trump Organization in the hands of his immediate family. But this approach comes with real risks.\nPerhaps the most appropriate — and troubling — parallel would be with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a business giant turned national leader who was not shy about using his television networks to help boost his brand and sell his policies. More than that, Berlusconi’s willingness to mix business and politics spawned a whole new genre of lobbying. Companies eager to curry favor with the Italian government would do sweetheart deals with Berlusconi’s companies, adding up to over $1 billion in extra revenue .\nTo be clear, Trump isn’t Berlusconi. His plan to step away from the boardroom and hand control to his kids may be weak in many ways, but it counts as a nod towards the importance of financial disinterest.\nMore than that, Trump also ran on a “drain the swamp” platform that included a host of new lobbying restrictions designed to cut back on perceived conflicts of interest. In the end, his actions in office may salve all concerns about political self-dealing. We’ll see.\nEvan Horowitz digs through data to find information that illuminates the policy issues facing Massachusetts and the U.S. He can be reached at evan.horowitz@globe.com .

      "title": "Harvard janitors authorize strike",
      "text": " Google+\nBy Katheleen Conti Globe Staff November 10, 2016\nHaving just come off its first labor strike in more than 30 years, Harvard University could have another one in its hands—this time by its janitors.\nThe university’s janitors voted Thursday to authorize a strike if their union cannot reach a new contract agreement by end of the day Nov. 15, when their current contract expires. Negotiations began on Oct. 7.\nAdvertisement\nThe janitors are asking for a cost of living wage increase, affordable health care benefits, and the creation of more full-time jobs, according to a spokesman for 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 700 custodians who maintain buildings in Harvard campuses in Cambridge and Boston.\nCurrently about 70 percent of the janitors work full time and most of them make $21.87 an hour, according to the union, which did not specify how much of a wage increase it is seeking.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here “The janitors who help to keep Harvard at the top are ready to do what it takes to protect their families and their communities,” said Roxana Rivera, vice president of 32BJ SEIU.\nHarvard administrators said in a statement negotiations with the union are ongoing. The school said the janitors’ average tenure is 10 years and counting long time workers, their hourly wages average $22.07. The school added their benefits “remain highly competitive in the local markets,” including paid time off, paid winter break, subsidies for childcare and commuting expenses, and health care reimbursements. Administrators also pointed out that at 16 hours per week, Harvard has the lowest threshold for health care eligibility, and that custodial employees who work more than 20 hours per week are eligible for pension and retiree health insurance.\n“Our custodial colleagues play an important role in support of Harvard’s teaching and research mission,” Harvard said.\nAdvertisement\nAbout 750 Harvard dining hall workers walked off the job for three weeks last month after negotiations with the school fell apart over the issues of wages and health care. The high-profile strike came to an end two weeks ago , with the school agreeing to a minimum annual salary of $35,000 and to absorb health care cost increases.\nThe same SEIU local just reached an agreement on a four-year contract for janitors working for the maintenance contractor for Tufts University that guarantees an hourly wage of $21.55 by Jan. 1, 2020. The union threatened an even bigger strike in September of 13,000 commercial janitors who clean several thousand office buildings in the Boston area. That strike was averted at the 11th hour with a deal that will pay janitors $20 an hour by the end of the four-year contract.\nKatheleen Conti can be reached at kconti@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nCraig F. Walker/Globe Staff\nNewton Mayor Setti Warren in his office at City Hall.\nBy Allison Pohle Globe Correspondent November 10, 2016\nNEWTON — Mayor Setti Warren, who has worked to shore up the city’s finances and rebuild Newton’s infrastructure since taking office seven years ago, announced Thursday that he will not seek reelection next year.\nWarren said he will finish out the remainder of his second term as he decides what he will do next.\nAdvertisement\n“I wanted to allow enough time for the residents and the community to select the next mayor,” Warren said in an interview in his office before the announcement.\nWarren said he is not seeking reelection after making the decision with his wife, Tassy, and because he felt he had accomplished what he set out to do when he began his term in 2009. He has not made any decisions about what’s to come, but said he is passionate about public service.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Warren was elected in 2008 to replace longtime mayor David B. Cohen, who decided not to run again amidst widespread rancor over the cost of the new Newton North High School, which at nearly $200 million was the most expensive school building project in state history.\n“When I ran in 2008, I knew we needed to fix the financial crisis, rebuild infrastructure, work on maintaining our excellent public schools, and we did,” Warren said. “There are always more challenges, and we want to be forward facing, but we built a strong foundation for Newton moving forward, and that’s what I’m basing my decision on.”\nWarren also pointed to investments in the school system and infrastructure, including his long-term capital improvement plan that outlines improvements to transportation, village centers, and streets over the next 25 years. He also said he’s proud of the recently launched Income Inequality partnership with Boston College, which aims to make Newton more affordable.\nAdvertisement\n“We’ve been focused on making sure Newton has a strong foundation to continue into the future,” he said.\nWarren, who grew up in Newton, announced his candidacy for for mayor in 2008 after returning from a tour as a Naval Intelligence specialist in Iraq. He then introduced himself to voters by knocking on more than 11,000 doors.\nWarren said he didn’t have any firm plans for what’s next, including whether he’ll seek higher office. Not quite 18 months into his first term, Warren announced a run for US Senate, angering many residents. He ended his campaign less than five months later, and was reelected to another mayoral term in 2013.\n“In the next phase, I’ll be thinking about what I want to do next,” Warren said. “I’m passionate about public service, but that takes many forms.”\nAllison Pohle can be reached at allisonpohle@gmail.com .",

Sign up for more newsletters here The group said in a statement that they blocked the entrance to the TD Bank branch because the bank is helping to finance the pipleline, which has drawn fierce opposition from Native Americans and environmental groups who see it as a threat to safe drinking water supplies.\nWatch: Protesters chain themselves A group calling itself The FANG Collective is broadcasting the protest over Facebook.\nThe four people in the blockade used bicycle locks and PVC piping to block the entrance, forcing first responders to move slowly as they worked to move them away from the entryway.\nLast week, some two dozen Massachusetts pastors joined more than 500 clergy from around the country to protest the pipeline at its proposed crossing point on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota.\nAdvertisement\nNative Americans from across the country have joined the tribe in its fight against the 1,170-mile, $3.7 billion pipeline, which would send crude oil through North Dakota, South Dakota, and Iowa to Illinois for shipment to refineries elsewhere.\nThe FANG Collective said TD Bank has drawn their attention because the company is a key lender for the private company working to get local, state and federal regulatory approval to build the pipeline.\nJohn R.

      "text": " Google+\nBy Laura Crimaldi Globe Staff November 10, 2016\nResidents in Boston neighborhoods of color are incarcerated at a higher rate than their counterparts in less diverse areas, including the Franklin Field section of Dorchester where more than one in five men between age 25 and 29 were locked up between 2009 and 2015, according to a report released Thursday.\nThe findings of the report entitled “The Geography of Incarceration” were unveiled Thusday morning during an event at The Boston Foundation.\nAdvertisement\nThe report authors tracked incarceration rates in Boston by mapping the home addresses of people who were released from the Suffolk County House of Correction between 2009 and 2015. They also mapped the home addresses of people who were committed to that facility and the Nashua Street Jail in 2013.\nThe analysis from 2013 found the Franklin Field section of Dorchester had the highest concentration of incarcerated residents, followed by the Grove Hall area.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here “In the communities of color in our city, nearly every other home, at least every other street has been affected by incarceration,” said Ben Forman, research director at the independent think tank MassINC and one of the report’s authors.\n“You have to look at the maps and appreciate that each of those dots is an individual who came from a family, who was maybe a breadwinner, who was most likely a parent, and has now had [an experience] with incarceration that’s going to change their earnings potential and their future indefinitely,” Forman said.\nPaul S. Grogan, president and chief executive of the Boston Foundation, said he hopes lawmakers and others take notice of the report as they prepare to file legislation next year to reform the state’s criminal justice system.\nAdvertisement\nThe Council of State Governments, a nonprofit, is currently examining the state’s criminal justice system and plans to draft recommendations for potential reforms, Forman said.\n“We’ve just got to take on this issue of the over incarceration, particularly of young black men,” Grogan said. “Other states are taking meaningful action to reduce prison populations.”",

      "text": " Google+\nEPA/MICHAEL REYNOLDS\nPresident Barack Obama shakes hands with President-elect Donald Trump.\nBy Scot Lehigh Globe Columnist November 10, 2016\nD emocracy has its civic obligations, and in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s upset victory, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama fulfilled theirs. Now it’s time for Trump to rise above the tawdry tone of his campaign and show some similar grace.\nAt mid-morning Wednesday, Clinton delivered a concession speech that exemplified class. Celebrating the American tradition of peacefully transferring power, she urged Americans to greet their president-elect with an open mind and to give him a chance to lead. This, about a man who derisively labeled her “crooked Hillary” and declared that, if elected, he would try to put her in prison.\nAdvertisement\nObama has been similarly gracious. On Thursday, after his meeting with Trump at the White House, the president offered warm words about making the Trumps feel welcome, and pledged to do everything he could to help his successor succeed. That followed upon the remarks Obama offered early Wednesday, after it became apparent that Trump had won. “We are now all rooting for his success,” Obama said, recalling how helpful George W. Bush had been to him.\nNo matter how hard it may have been to offer those words, these are roles that a democracy requires its leaders to play, words it needs them to voice.\nBut what of the obligations that sit on Donald Trump’s shoulders?\nGet Todays Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here He first emerged politically, in 2011, by riding the racially-tinged birther nonsense to prominence, repeatedly questioning whether Barack Obama was really born in this country. In this election cycle, much of his political approach was about running down Clinton and riling up resentments. In a Manchester rally on Monday night, I watched (yet again) as his frenzied supporters screamed “lock her up, lock her up,” while Trump stood there smirking. It was a dismaying spectacle, at least for anyone concerned about the erosion of restraint and responsibility that a healthy democracy needs in both its leaders and its citizens.\nView Story The day after, a creeping sense of angst Here in the Bay State, where Hillary Clinton won a higher percentage than all but three states, the distance from the American heartland has rarely seemed so long.​\nFor thousands, it’s #nevermypresident when it comes to Donald Trump\nNo one should harbor any illusion that Trump will apologize for either his birtherism or his banana republic rhetoric. That would take a bigger man. Still, he needs to make a real and significant gesture here. That means finding a way to offer some appropriately appreciative words about Obama and his legitimate accomplishments, something that goes well beyond his Thursday description of the president as a “very good man.”\nHe owes Clinton even more, having labeled her “the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency” and talked, absurdly, of appointing a special prosecutor to investigate her. Those remarks were not just invidious, they were deeply corrosive to the important tradition Clinton and Obama underscored on Wednesday: our democracy’s peaceful transfer of power.\nAdvertisement\nNor is it enough for Trump now to say, as he did in his victory speech, that “we owe her a tremendous debt of gratitude for her service to our country.” He needs to acknowledge that his comments about Clinton went way beyond the pale.\nIt’s relatively easy for supporters of the losing candidate to embrace the winner as their president if he has campaigned in a high-minded manner. There, one thinks of the affection and admiration most Americans had for President Ronald Reagan, even though many disagreed with his policies. But it is quite another for disappointed voters to accept a winner who treated their champions as shabbily as did Trump. Most voters did not support him; nationally, a plurality backed Hillary Clinton. He has amends to make if he hopes to win their acceptance.\nScot Lehigh can be reached at lehigh@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nAndrew Harnik/Associated Press/File\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called on her fellow Democrats not to tolerate attacks on other Americans.\nBy Akilah Johnson Globe Staff November 10, 2016\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Thursday pledged to work with President-elect Donald Trump to build an economy that works for everyone while vowing to fight him if the vitriol of his candidacy takes root in his presidency.\n“There are many millions of people who voted for Donald Trump not because of the bigotry and hate that fueled his campaign rallies,” Warren said in her first major address since the New York businessman was elected president of the United States. “They voted for him out of frustration and anger and out of hope that he would make real change in this country.”\nAdvertisement\nShe spoke before the AFL-CIO Executive Council in an address that was broadcast via Facebook live and watched by more than 16,000 people.\n“I believe the outcome of this election is an indictment on politics as usual,” Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, said while introducing Warren. “The type of indictment that Senator Warren has spent her career fighting against.”\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Warren, a progressive Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, have both argued that Wall Street has harmed the working class. And while they agree on the problem, their worldviews could not be further apart.\nView Story Read: Warren’s speech Senator Elizabeth Warren of Mass. spoke before the AFL-CIO Executive Council in Washington Thursday.\nThursday’s speech was an attempt to chart a path forward for dispirited liberals after Trump’s stunning victory on Tuesday. Warren also tried to explain and validate aspects of Trump’s appeal to workers who have been hammered by Wall Street.\nShe vowed to put aside their differences if Trump makes good on his promises to increase government spending on infrastructure to create jobs, oppose trade deals, and increase Social Security benefits.\nAdvertisement\n“When President-elect Trump wants to take on these issues, when his goal is to increase the economic security of middle-class families, then count me in,” Warren said. “I will work as hard as I can and pull as many people as I can into this effort.”\nBut Warren was clear: There would be no compromise if President-elect Trump insults women, minorities, or immigrants the way candidate Trump did.\n“Whether Donald Trump sits in a glass tower or sits in the White House, we will not give an inch on this, not now, not ever,” she said pounding the podium for emphasis. “We will stand up to bigotry.”\nThe election wasn’t pretty, she said, calling the campaign a “toxic stew of hatred and fear.”\n“Millions of people are worried, and they are right to be worried,” she said.\nTrump’s candidacy started with a speech in which he disparaged Mexican immigrants as “rapists.” He proposed a temporary ban on allowing Muslims into the country. He mocked a disabled journalists and was accused of sexually assaulting women.\nWarren became one of Trump’s biggest foes, engaging with him in a fierce war of words that often played out in 140-character exchanges on Twitter. He called her “Pocahontas” in reference to the controversy about her Native American heritage that emerged during the race for her Senate seat. She called Trump a “bully.”\nBut their common ground appears to be making the country a better for those angry that government seems to work only for the rich and powerful.\nAnd while Trump might have won the White House, Warren noted that he lost the popular vote.\n“The time for ignoring the American people is over,” Warren said. “It is time for us to come together to work on America’s agenda.”\n“Are we ready to be in this fight?” she asked to rousing applause. “You bet!”\nMichael Levenson of Globe staff contributed to this report.

      "text": " Google+\nBy Nicole Hernandez Globe Staff November 10, 2016\nThe day after the election, a keynote address at this year’s INBOUND conference in Boston meant to be about education became instead an off-the-cuff look at the presidential results, resulting in some controversy for the Boston marketing conference.\nIn the speech Wednesday, award-winning writer Ta-Nehisi Coates called the election of Donald Trump “a mortal threat, not just to black people, not just to the country, but the whole world.”\nAdvertisement\nCoates, who has written extensively about race relations and the disenfranchisement of black people, said it was a mistake for Americans to think President Barack Obama’s 2008 victory killed those issues.\n“We had deeply, deeply underestimated ourselves.

(AP) — Donald Trump’s election as president is giving a big social-media boost to an unlikely effort in the nation’s most populous state: a plan to vote on seceding from the union.\nThe Yes California Independence Campaign hopes to put a question on the November 2018 ballot that would authorize a statewide independence vote for the spring of 2019.\nAdvertisement\nThe effort drew little attention until Tuesday’s election, which also kept Trump’s fellow Republicans in charge of Congress and raised the possibility of a conservative shift on the U.S. Supreme Court.\nAny effort to get an issue on the ballot requires the gathering of hundreds of thousands of signatures.\nIn Portland, Oregon, two residents filed a separate petition for a 2018 ballot initiative for Oregon to secede.",

      "text": " Google+\nDavid L Ryan/Globe Staff\nMehdi Ghadyanloo’s mural “Spaces of Hope” on the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway.\nBy Sebastian Smee Globe Staff November 10, 2016\nYou can see it as you emerge from South Station. You can see it from certain city office windows. You can see it from a deck chair on the lawn at Dewey Square Park.\nBut perhaps the most dramatic vantage point from which to see the brilliant new Dewey Square mural by Iran’s Mehdi Ghadyanloo is your car as you come out of the tunnel at the South Station exit off I-93 South.\nAdvertisement\nYou have to crane your neck, and a concrete wall blocks part of the view. But the mural, which shows a crowd of gray office types ascending a spiral staircase toward a circular opening in a ceiling, somehow echoes your own emergence from the tunnel. There’s something about coming out of darkness into a sunlit realm and glimpsing those other figures, in the mural, doing the same that shifts gears in your soul.\nDavid L Ryan/Globe Staff\nA detail of the mural on in Dewey Square.\nThis latest mural — the fifth in a sequence of temporary murals commissioned by the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway Conservancy — is unlike any of its predecessors.\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Ghadyanloo’s work is not abstract. It’s not text-based. It’s not inspired by graffiti art. Rather, it’s a giant tromp l’oeil image — part Rene Magritte, part Banksy — that’s open-ended, richly meditative, and cunningly keyed to its context.\nView Story Sign up for The Weekender Want the Globe’s top picks for what to see and do each weekend e-mailed directly to you? Sign up now for The Weekender.\nGhadyanloo grew up on a farm in Iran during that country’s devastating, drawn-out conflict with Iraq. His mother was a carpet weaver, his father a farmer. The war, which left profound scars on his entire country, imprinted itself on his psyche.\nTehran, a teeming city of well over 10 million, has vast numbers of blank walls on boxy, modernist buildings. Many still carry anti-American propaganda. But times are changing. Tehran’s contemporary art scene, which is far livelier than in most big American cities, is flourishing. And there’s a hunger for public art that reflects some of the changing attitudes of the city’s inhabitants.\nAdvertisement\nSo when, in 2006, the Municipality of Tehran’s Beautification Bureau launched a call for more murals, Ghadyanloo answered it. He and his team of Blue Sky Painters have since painted more than 100 murals in the Iranian capital. More recently, they have accepted prestigious commissions in London and, now, Boston.\nGhadyanloo has been called “the Banksy of Tehran.” But that’s not quite right: Banksy influenced him, but his paintings, in Tehran and elsewhere, are not guerilla operations — they’re officially approved commissions — and he’s not anonymous.\nBut, like the works of Banksy, his murals have wound their way into the imaginations of millions.\nIn a society that still exerts strict control over images, it’s presumably not easy to make powerful public murals that will also be palatable to the authorities. Ghadyanloo has had as many proposed murals rejected as accepted.\nMany of his paintings appear whimsical (a giraffe in an apartment block, flying cars). But they also have a bewildered, mournful edge, a base note of dismay.\nDavid L Ryan, Globe Staff\nA detail of the mural by Mehdi Ghadyanloo.\nThe new Dewey Square mural, wanly titled “Spaces of Hope,” seems a triumph to me. A crowd of men and women, many holding red helium balloons (a recurring motif in Ghadyanloo’s work) waits in line at the base of a cavernous interior space, which we see in cutaway.\nThe line disappears out a door to the right, only to reappear again in a narrow passage open to the sky. The waiting figures then cross another threshold back inside and continue along a raised platform that leads to the spiral staircase.\nUp they parade toward a circular opening in the dome, pursuing a giant red balloon that has already half-escaped. They are chasing something bright and hopeful. But they seem suspended, too, in a kind of limbo, practicing patience.\nThe whole thing appears simple. But Ghadyanloo’s control of spatial illusion is masterful. He transforms the flat windowless wall into the cutaway interior of a dome with effortless aplomb, cleverly matching the design of his image to the unusual shape of the wall, with its off-kilter, semi-circular top.\nNote the light source at bottom left. You may not register it at first, because the eye is drawn up to the opening and the balloon. But the way it spreads across the interior helps carve out the illusion of three-dimensional space.\nNote, too, the brilliant interplay between inside and outside, activated by the movement of people between one and the other. And marvel, most of all, at Ghadyanloo’s use of blue, both in the opening in the dome and in the patch of sky to the right. It makes the whole image, and the building itself, appear at once real and porous.\nThese are all optical tricks you can learn. They’re not magic. But Ghadyanloo, who has evidently had lots of practice, is very good at making them interact with the urban landscape around him. In doing so, he makes surprise, mystery, and an excruciating strain of melancholy available to all of us. If, that is, we want a piece of it.\nSpaces of Hope\nBy Mehdi Ghadyanloo. At Dewey Square Park, Boston.\nSebastian Smee can be reached at ssmee@globe.com .",

      "text": "\nMany owners of Google’s older Nexus phones were not happy when Android 7.0 Nougat was released, as it removed the popular Night Mode feature from those phones. There have been a number of third-party mods to bring it back, but now it appears that Google maybe (just maybe) is preparing for its official return.\nSee also: Best Nexus 6P cases September 15, 2016 For those of you who are coming into this debate late, Night Mode is supposed to offer smartphone owners a way to use them more easily in the dark by applying a blue-light filter toggle. Google made the decision to ditch Night Mode from the first Android 7.0 release, due to what the company said were performance issues with the feature. It is available on Android 7.1.1. for the new Pixel and Pixel XL phones, under the term Night Light.\nMany fans have since posted “bug reports” on Google’s developer forums, requesting the return of Night Mode on Nexus phones with Nougat. Now, one such forum request has been closed by Google, and its status has been changed to “FutureRelease”. Obviously, this doesn’t mean the company is definitely going to bring this feature back, but it is an encouraging little sign. Hopefully we will get more information on this development in the very near future.",

Look no further than his sold-out iPhone cases shaped like Windex bottles and French fries packages for proof. So it comes as no surprise that the L.A. designer has partnered with Google to create a collection of custom Live Cases for the tech giant's new Pixel phone. \nThe cases, priced at $40 each and designed by Scott, come in six different cartoon designs, from playful champagne bottle patterns to a popcorn-and-drink combo. What makes the Live Case particularly unique is its built-in Near-field communication (NFC) technology. which communicates with your phone After the case snaps on, a wallpaper app appears on your screen for downloading. \nThe app also gives users the J'emoji keyboard, which features custom emoji animations designed by Scott. New characters will be added daily. \nCompatible with the Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P phones, the Jeremy Scott x Google Live Case is sold exclusively at Google stores in the U.S., Canada, Australia, UK and Germany. It's available now until the end of January 2017.",

      "text": "Darin Fisher, vice president of Chrome engineering, speaks at Google's Chrome Dev Summit. Photo by Stephen Shankland/CNET \nThis year, the Opera browser added an option to block online ads . The newer Brave browser goes farther, blocking them by default. But Google would rather fix the problems with ads than strip them off websites. \n\"We feel like there are a lot of challenges in advertising . There are a lot of wrong ways,\" Darin Fisher, vice president of Chrome engineering, said in an interview. However, he said, \"If publishers and advertisers do ads the right way, it can be great for the users and for the ecosystem.\" \nAds are a sticky problem for the web. They give people free access to popular websites like Google search and Facebook 's social network, but they also can make websites load slowly, waste battery power, increase mobile network data costs, infringe privacy and even deliver malware. And they can be intrusive or distracting, so it's no surprise millions of users install ad-blocking plug-ins for their browsers. \nAds can be bad for the publishers who show them, Fisher said. \"A lot of the advertising we see is unfortunate in that it probably hurts engagement,\" actually deterring people from using the website, he said. \nTo help deal with the problem, Google helped found an effort called the Coalition for Better Ads that's working on standards to curtail problem advertising. The effort also includes publishers like Facebook, News Corp. and The Washington Post, advertisers like Unilever and Proctor & Gamble, and industry groups like the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and the Association of National Advertisers (ANA). \nBut Google also is taking some actions to rein in ads, even if it's not blocking them. One example: For some users on slow 2G networks, Chrome will intervene so websites can't use a web programming feature called document.write . The feature lets websites run instructions that can analyze ad performance -- but that also can slow websites from loading by tens of seconds. \nAlex Komoroske, a Chrome group product manager, likened the move to pop-up blockers that have become standard in browsers even though they broke some websites. \"The web is an ecosystem,\" he said, and there must be a balance between website priorities and user priorities for the ecosystem to work.",

      "text": "Daydream VR is Google Cardboard for Grown-Ups \nGrown-ups with Google's Pixel phone, anyway. By Xavier Harding posted Nov 10th, 2016 at 5:50am \nXavier Harding \nOne of these headsets is not like the other. \nMore than two years after releasing the $15 Google Cardboard —a rudimentary VR headset made with plastic lenses, magnets, and a corrugated cardboard shell—Google is unleashing its next act. Cardboard was Google splashing around in the kiddie pool of virtual reality, but Daydream is slicing through the lap lane in a swim cap. It may not have the scrappy appeal (or sweet price tag) of its forebear, but it's slick, unobtrusive, and expensive-looking. (It's also only available to Google Pixel users, but more on that later.) \nThe first thing you notice about Google's Daydream VR is that it just doesn't look like the headsets produced by heavy hitters like Sony or Samsung. Just as Google Home mimics items already around your house, Daydream VR looks like it could go incognito in your wardrobe. It's wrapped in cloth, which looks great and makes it washable. Much appreciated for the germ conscious who let sweaty friends use the VR headsets. \nWhile the material makes the headset comfortable to wear, it can feel heavy after extended play. Like many virtual reality headsets, Google's Daydream VR headset uses a single strap to keep the device in place, which simply isn't as comfortable as something like the Playstation VR. Even Samsung Gear VR (which is cheaper) has a second strap to better support the device. \nXavier Harding \nThis comfy VR headset is the sequel to Google Cardboard. No wires and no plugging things in \nGoogle Daydream VR works with your smartphone, which means, unlike Playstation VR , HTC Vive or other more powerful headsets, users won't be attached to a PC or game console. There's no Matrix-esque tethering of your head to the gaming rig, and no need to worry about tripping over a cord. \nGoogle's headset has this in common with other virtual reality solutions like Samsung's Gear VR. Where the two differ however is pairing. Samsung's solution requires you plug one of their ( hopefully not-on-fire ) smartphones into the headset and then lock into place. Google's Daydream VR lets you simply place the phone onto a pad and uses NFC to pair the two. \nXavier Harding \nThe Pixel and Pixel XL will pair with the Daydream VR headset wirelessly, using NFC \nThat means that you won't have to worry about the Pixel only offering a USB-C plug when your phone has a micro-USB charging port, or vice versa. Though if you're wondering how this might work with your phone, that brings us to our next point... \nXavier Harding \nDaydream will only work with the Pixel phone. For now. Daydream VR Only Works With The Google Pixel Phone (Sorry iPhone Users) \nOne of the many strengths of Google Cardboard was interoperability. The low-budget VR device let users plug in iPhones, Nexus devices, and Samsung phones. Google's Daydream VR will only work with Google's Pixel phone. For now, at least. \nGoogle's goal is to make Daydream a VR standard for phone makers to rally behind. The company has promised that third-party hardware makers like Samsung and LG have Daydream-supporting headsets and phones on the way. For now Daydream VR seems very proprietary, but eventually the supported headsets and phones could allow the same diversity as Cardboard. \nXavier Harding \nThe remote is convenient. Until you lose it. Don't Lose The Remote! \nGoogle's Daydream VR makes use of a remote control that can be strapped to the inside of the headset when not in use—which you'll want to make sure to do! Because if you lose the remote you won't be able to navigate the Daydream menus. Competitors like Samsung's Gear VR use a trackpad on the side. Even Google Cardboard had one button that users could press to select. The Daydream VR headset has no external buttons on its body. Google hasn't made mention of replacement remotes, but we've reached out to find out more. \nThe remote itself, while irritating by nature of its very existence, isn't too bad. The face has a clickable trackpad and two buttons. On the side is a volume rocker and toward the bottom is a charging port. While inconvenient if lost, the remote is a comfortable experience when compared to raising one's hands and feeling around the side of a VR unit. Plus the remote offers motion tracking and tilt detection. The difference is similar to what separates Nintendo's Wii Remote controller from the Wii Remote Plus. And it can lead to some fun uses, like letting you wave a wand in the Harry Potter Fantastic Beasts game. Just make sure to use that included lanyard. But What About My Wallet? \nIf you already own a Google Pixel phone, ( which is a hefty investment ), then you'll be happy. Google's Daydream VR is $79, which is more affordable than the $99 Gear VR. If you already own a Pixel phone, the extra money is worth it. If you don't, well, we wouldn't suggest switching your entire tech platform just to get a Daydream VR. After all, there are plenty of other VR options and more are on the way. Tags:",

It stated:\nEvery single video on the platform becomes an immersive VR experience, from 360-degree videos that let you step inside the content to standard videos shown on a virtual movie screen in the new theater mode. The app even includes some familiar features like voice search and a signed in experience so you can follow the channels you subscribe to, check out your playlists and more.\nGoogle has already been working with a number of YouTube creators to launch a bunch of new 360 degree videos that are optimized for the YouTube VR app. That includes a tour of the apartment owned by beauty vlogger Meredith Foster, news stories from the Huffington Post , and even an all-new “Red vs Blue” segment from the folks at Rooster Teeth.\nIf you own the Daydream View, what are your initial impressions of the YouTube VR app?\nGet it at Google Play ",

People Are Searching Google for Ways to Impeach Donald Trump \nOnly hours after Donald Trump won the election, many people were already looking for ways to impeach him. \nSearches for “how to impeach a president” saw a 4,850% increase after the president-elect’s victory, notes the Independent . Yesterday, the top states searching for this were Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington, and Colorado—all of which Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won in the election. In other news: Google searches for ‘how to impeach a president’ have gone up by almost 5000% https://t.co/yQ4wrIot9s pic.twitter.com/euv5hukdEA \n— Amarie Baker (@SimpliSpiritu) November 9, 2016 \nToday, the search term “impeach Trump” is No.8 on Trump-related queries , according to Google Trends. People in Oregon, California, Washington, and Colorado are also searching for this, as are those in Vermont. Clinton won Vermont on Tuesday night with 61% of the vote. \n\nSearches for “ how to move to Canada ” also increased in the U.S. the night of Trump’s win, according to the Independent . So much so, the country’s immigration and citizenship website crashed. The same search also surged 350% after Trump’s victory on Super Tuesday , leading the immigration and citizenship site to display a warning that said users “may experience delays while using the website.”",

      "text": "Chrome Is Now Installed on Over 2 Billion Active Devices, Says Google The figure includes all Chrome versions including mobile and desktop Company says large figure is beneficial for developers Figure shared by the company at Chrome Dev Summit \nThere are some achievements that can even make a company like Google proud. Google's Internet browser has now achieved one such feat, as the search giant has announced that there are over two billion active Chrome browsers in the world. \nAt the Chrome Dev Summit in San Francisco on Thursday Chrome Engineering VP Darin Fisher announced that there are currently two billion Chrome browsers in active use across platforms. Interestingly, this makes Chrome the first Google product to hit the two billion installs mark. \n\"I wanted to make this point that there are a lot of Chrome browsers out there.... What's exciting about this to you all is that when you think about building for the Web, there' a lot of browsers out there that implement the latest web standards - that implement the latest and greatest Web features,\" Fisher reportedly said. Even though the figure is impressive, it should be noted that it just because the browser is installed on an active device, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is being used on a day-to-day basis. Many people may have Chrome installed as their secondary browser, or it may be a browser that shipped with their device but they might prefer something else.\nOther Google products that have one billion users include Google Maps, Android, Google Play Store, Google Search, and Gmail. \nRecent reports have suggested that Google is working to make the Chrome browser easier to use on large screen devices. In the latest Dev and Canary builds of the browser on Android, a feature named 'Chrome Home' was discovered, which shifts the address bar to the bottom of the screen.",

      "text": "COMMENTS \nThe Hilltop Hoods ’ exploration of a traumatic -- but ultimately life-affirming -- experience was the catalyst for a world-first collaboration with Google Play Music. \nThe popular Australian hip-hop trio on Friday (Nov. 11) shared an immersive music video for \"Through The Dark,\" a personal song penned by founding member MC Pressure (real name Dan Smith) on the journey he faced after his son Liam’s cancer diagnosis. \nThe Hoods joined forces with Google to shed light on Pressure’s tale and help find a way out of the darkness for others facing similar challenges. \n“We received literally thousands of emails and interactions from people telling us their story of similar things. And how much the song meant to them and how it connected,” Pressure tells Billboard . “'Through The Dark' has “become a theme as part of their therapy of getting through their journey, and because of that we wanted to do more than just a single. We wanted it to be bigger. And this gave us that window of opportunity to create an amazing immersive experience for all of those people and to have a type of legacy to give back to other kids suffering a chronic illness.” \nThe interactive film has been created for use on Android smartphones and traces a father and son’s travels through two 3D-animated worlds, a dark place representing fear, the light meaning hope. \nThe tech giant’s execs approached the band with the seed of an idea. “It felt like a fit,” explains Google Play’s product marketing manager Sophie Hirst. “If you look at the users on Google Play Music, we knew that our users really love Hilltop Hoods, they really consume a lot of music on our platform. Plus, I’ve always been a big fan of the band.” \nThe song, a fan-favorite at the Hoods' live shows, appeared on the group's 2014 album Walking Under Stars and on the rebooted Drinking From The Sun, Walking Under Stars Restrung from February 2016, both of which reached No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart (the Hilltop Hoods have landed five albums at the top of the national albums chart). \nThough Google declined to divulge its cost, both parties workshopped the video project for “many, many months,” Hirst explains. “We were breaking new ground together and that felt exciting for Google and the band. This is a genuine partnership.” \nFor every fan who listens to Hilltop Hoods’ latest album on Google Play Music via the link at the clip's conclusion, Google and the hip-hoppers have pledged to donate $1 to youth cancer organization CanTeen. The money raised will boost a new project Side of Stage , which will enable young people affected by cancer special access to live music shows across the country. \nThe video is now live and can be viewed at throughthedark.withgoogle.com through high-spec Android mobile devices and desktops. \nHirst hopes the Hilltop Hoods partnership will be the starting point for many other music campaigns. “It was really important for us to support Australian artists. The other thing is we just really love seeing how technology can push art forward. We love building things, we love playing around with technology and seeing how that can be used to innovate creative art, and in particular music. It’s something Google has done for a while and will continue to do.” \nPressure has been living in the light for some years now. His son is healthy, Liam's leukemia is a problem of the past. “He’s like any other 12-year-old. He has a crush on a girl at school, he downloads as much rap music as I do. But he’s been living cancer-free for over two years, so that’s great. It’s a really beautiful end.” \nThe Hilltop Hoods are nominated in three categories for the Nov. 23 ARIA Awards.",

      "text": "\nDetails of Project Ara , Google’s cancelled modular phone project, have emerged online, giving us a glimpse at what might have been. Phandroid recently got hold of one of the units, likely a developer model, though the project was axed in September.\nThe metal device has a comparatively large frame, at 152 x 74 x 12.5 mm when modules are set in place, making it around 60 percent thicker than most modern flagships. It also houses a Snapdragon 810 processor and 3 GB of RAM, both of which aren’t removable – and weren’t planned to be – like its other components.\n\nThe device also arrived with a 3,450 mAh battery, 2.1 MP rear camera, and 32 GB of internal storage space, all of which would likely have been swappable in the final retail version. The 5 MP front-facing camera, on the other hand, appears to be fixed in place.\nSee also: Project Ara has reportedly been axed (Update: Confirmed. She’s dead, Jim) September 2, 2016 Project Ara aimed to provide a smartphone exoskeleton which would allow users to purchase and attach individual components, or “modules”. This could have provided several benefits compared to a regular smartphone, such as offering Project Ara owners a way to improve a single device aspect, like the camera, without buying an entirely new smartphone.\n\nGoogle had discussed plans to launch a “modular marketplace” where components could be bought and sold, similar to the Play Store, before Ara ran into problems and was eventually shut down.\nLook out for more pictures of the Project Ara unit over at Phandroid.com and give us your thoughts on Google’s abandoned smartphone in the comments.",

      "title": "12 Tricks That Make You The Master Of Google Search",
      "text": "by Bill Widmer | \nThere’s a hidden side of Google that only a select few people take advantage of. When you discover the amazing things you can do with Google, you’ll become a search master. You’ll be light years ahead of the people who don’t know this stuff. \nEnough talking – let’s get right to learning the 12 Google search tricks. Are you ready to have your mind blown? 1. Use an asterisk “*” to find words or phrases you can’t remember \nGoogle sees an * as a missing word they should fill in with the most relevant result. So, if you forgot a word in a phrase or saying, you can use it to find the phrase with the word you’re missing. 2. Search within websites using “site:” \nFor example, if you search “site: lifehack.org exercises” it will bring up every page on Lifehack with the word exercises in it. 3. Find similar websites by searching “related:yourwebsitehere.com” \nIf you have a blog or website you really like and want to find similar sites, you can make a search like “related:lifehack.org”: 4. Search for exact phrases using quotations \nIf you want to find things with exact words or phrases, just put quotes around them. For example, you can search for “shining your kitchen sink”: 5. Exclude certain keywords using “-“ \nSometimes you want to find results without certain words. You can do so using the minus sign followed by the word. For example, you can search “jaguar speed -car”: 6. Find links to certain websites with “link:yourwebsitehere.com” \nIf you want to see any websites that linked to a certain website or page, you can search using the “link:” parameter. This could be useful if you’re looking for sites that linked back to your site, or even your Facebook page. 7. Search for exact images \nHave you ever wondered where an image came from or wanted to find similar images to yours? All you have to do is download the image you want to search for, go to images.google.com , click the camera icon, then upload your image (or paste the image URL). It will bring up related images, the same image in different sizes, and show the sources for the image! 8. Use “or” when you can’t remember which topic you’re thinking of \nIf you can’t remember which Jennifer acted in that one movie, for example: 9. Search within a time frame using “…” \nFor example, if you search “inventions 1900…2000”, you’ll find posts with inventions in that time frame: 10. Search for specific words in a title or URL using “intitle:” and “inurl:” \nIf you want to find a forum, you can search “inurl:forum”. If you want to find articles with exact works in the title, you can search “intitle:kittens”. 11. Use “Define:” to learn the meaning of slang words \nThis is awesome. If you ever hear or see a slang word you don’t understand, just Google “Define:slangword”. For example, when you search “define:waffle”: 12. Filter search results using Google’s “Search Tools” \nFinally, one of the most well-known ways of increasing your efficiency on Google is their search tools dropdown. This dropdown can allow you to filter results by time date, image size, color, type, etc. It’s an under-utilized way to narrow down your search results. \nThere you have it – 12 Google search tricks to make you a Google search master. If you want more cool Google tricks or a handy place to find the parameters, Google has an excellent help document that shows you the most advanced ways to use their platform. \nNow get out there and start using your newfound magical search powers to conquer the world! Or at least, to find better search results. Either way, I hope you found this article helpful. If you did, don’t forget to share it!",

      "text": "Here’s where you can buy Google’s new Daydream VR headset If you've already got a compatible Pixel phone of course share Vjeran Pavic Google now has its own Samsung Galaxy Gear: the $79 soft-touch Daydream View. Like the Gear and other phone-powered virtual reality headsets, the View connects to your smartphone for VR experiences (although it's only compatible with the Pixel and Pixel XL right now). In our review we found it was a cut above the competition — easy-to-use and comfortable. If you're curious about the View, Google has shared a bunch of retailers where it's available to buy, and hopefully some of those will also have units in store for customers to try first: Germany : Google Store , Deutsche Telekom ; €69 (EUR) Australia : Google Store , JB Hi-Fi ; $119 (AUD); Coming to Telstra on Nov 22nd As well as the headset itself, Google has also launched its own Android-only VR platform: Daydream. This includes access to VR-versions of popular Google apps including Google Photos, Google Movies, Google Arts & Culture, and — the killer app — YouTube VR . Cheaper headsets like the View are never going to compete with the likes of the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift in terms of graphics and immersive features like head-tracking, but they’re bringing VR mainstream. You can read our full review of the headset here . ",

      "title": "Reasons why Google’s Pixel 2 could be the best phone ever",
      "text": "Reddit \nAs we’re busy heaping praise on the Google Pixel, one interesting factoid has come out that suggest what Google does next might really blow the iPhone away. It’s not new camera features; many would argue that’s not necessary anyway. It’s also now a new processor, though we’re entirely sure that’s coming as well. Next time, it’ll be all about partnerships and how much time Google has to focus in on how to build what could be the best phone ever, hands down. HTC, Google and Huawei \nAfter the Pixel was announced, a bit of news surfaced about how it actually came to be. It probably wasn’t as linear as you’d think, either. \nOriginally Google tapped Huawei to make the Pixel. It had done such a bang-up job with the 6P (my favorite Nexus phone by far) that Google wanted to work with them again. Unfortunately, Huawei wasn’t into it. \nThe reason? Google didn’t want any manufacturer branding on the device. It barely has Google’s mark! \nWith that hard ‘no’ on the table, Google turned to HTC, who gleefully took the task of making the Pixel. The rest is a bit of history. HTC has no shame \nHere’s a brief snippet on the two different types of manufacturers for smartphones: OEM and ODM. \nAn OEM is an ‘original equipment manufacturer.’ Those are the Samsungs and LGs of the world; they control their own supply chain, have their own tooling equipment and basically run their own show. \nAn ODM is an ‘original design manufacturer,’ and is a bit trickier to nail down. The most notable ODM around is Foxconn, which handles a lot of Apple’s iPhone supply chain. The ODM will make phones to someone else’s specs. \nHTC started life as an ODM. Before it made waves with the HTC Evo 4G with Sprint, HTC was doing a lot of ODM work for other companies. If you ever had a Palm Treo 650 , you had an HTC. \nBetween HTC’s origin story and it’s current status as an OEM that’s falling victim to Samsung, taking on the Pixel was no problem. Google was dead set on controlling every aspect of the Pixel anyway, so it was either source its own supply chain (tedious and tenuous), or find an established entity to handle it. Google chose wisely. Nine months \nGoogle and HTC only had nine months to work on getting the Pixel manufactured. That sounds like a long time, but when you’re taking about mass production of a device that has a lot of intricate parts that will be heavily scrutinized by the press and customers who’ve plopped down hundreds of dollars for one, there’s not a lot of wiggle room. \nHuawei was undoubtedly critical to the early stages of planning the Pixel, but with it being unwilling to follow through — Google was in a tough spot. And really, nine months — even when you have a pretty good idea of what you want to do with your phone — is not a long time to work with your partner. \nBut HTC and Google got the Pixel out, and it’s easily the best Android handset available. Some even say the best phone, period; high praise indeed. \nNow that Google has found a willing dance partner in HTC, it’s reasonable to believe planning for the Pixel 2 has already begun. And with so much extra time, who knows how good the second Pixel will end up. In nine months, Google and HTC made an iPhone-beater. Given a full year, the two companies may be able to show us what the perfect piece of smartphone hardware really looks like.",

The news was made public on stage at the 2016 Chrome developer summit by Darin Fisher, Chrome’s Engineering Vice President.\nThough it’s installed on two billion devices, that’s not to say Chrome is actively in use on all of them. In April, Google stated that there were one billion active Chrome users, but it didn’t disclose what the figure stood at today.\nChrome was released in 2008 for Windows but has since been ported to most major operating systems, and comes pre-installed with Google’s apps suite on many Android handsets.\nSee also: Chrome for Android adds background media support as part of new update 3 weeks ago Google now has seven products under its belt with more than one billion users: Gmail, Maps, Search, Youtube and the Google Play Store (as well as Android and Chrome).",

      "text": "Google Pixel XL vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus Google Pixel XL vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus Posted: 7 hours ago , by Stephen S. Comments Introduction Apple's always offered its users a complete hardware-and-software smartphone experience: everybody gets iOS, and everybody gets the iPhone. With Android, that situation's a lot more complicated, with a litany of manufacturers to choose from, and little assurance their phones are running the newest, most-feature-packed software release available. But this year Google's stepping up in a way we haven't really seen before. While Nexus phones offered a pure-Google software experience, this year's new Pixel phones add that same sort of Google leadership to the hardware side of things, with a pair of handsets designed from the ground up to be 100% Google phones.We've already gone head-to-head with the smaller iPhone 7 and Google Pixel , but for as much as we enjoy a good petite phone, there's a lot to be said for the big screens, big batteries, and all-around larger-than-life experiences of a more massive phablet. Luckily for us, both Apple and Google are ready to deliver with the iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel XL , respectively.Do these two phones measure up in quite the same way as their smaller siblings, or does enough change with these bigger models that we'll look at their balance in a different light? Let's find out, with our iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel XL comparison. Design Both Google and Apple scale up some familiar looks for their larger handsets Smartphones may rely upon millions of lines of code, a dizzying array of tiny transistors, and more high-tech components than you can count, but there's little that affects our impressions of a handset more than its design and styling. Looking at both the iPhone 7 Plus and the Pixel XL, it's clear that a lot of thought went into making these handsets look and feel the way they do, all while Google and Apple made some very different decisions about how to put their phones together.The iPhone 7 Plus is sleek, sturdy, and smooth. The phone scales up the dimensions of the iPhone 7 to accommodate for the Plus model's larger 5.5-inch screen, and while it's slightly thicker than the smaller handset, we're talking a near-indiscernible amount – to the tune of a fraction of a millimeter. But not all of the phone's hardware can squeeze into that slim body, and like the iPhone 7 itself, the Plus has to live with a camera bump, but it's significantly more pronounced on the 7 Plus: it both sticks out further, and takes up more surface area to make room for the phone's dual rear cameras.While the Pixel XL is a thicker device than the iPhone, Google both manages to keep its thickness consistent from smaller to larger Pixel, as well as avoiding a camera bump altogether. This however, is at the cost of having the profile of the phone get progressively thicker towards the upper end. The handset's design is a bit unusual, taking advantage of multiple materials in a way that's unexpected but also really help the phone stand out in a busy Android market. Like the smaller Pixel, an edge design that shifts from curves, to flat surfaces, to angled bevels helps keep the handset feeling secure in your hand, which is a plus considering the phone's size.Comparing the two phones against each other, while Apple's is the thinner handset, to the tune of more than a millimeter, Google's manages to be both shorter and narrower, despite the same 5.5-inch screen size.",

      "title": "Nexus 5X & 6P to Receive Night Mode (Again) In a Future Release",
      "text": "With the introduction of the Android N Developer Preview, Google included a new feature called Night Mode which filters blue light from your screen to reduce eye strain. Many users swear by blue light filtering apps because of several studies that suggest blue light affects your circadian rhythm and makes it more difficult to go to sleep. Thus, developers have built third-party applications such as CF.lumen (by XDA Senior Recognized Developer Chainfire ) which has placated many users, however, the annoyance of screen overlays with permission dialog boxes on Android 6.0+ has led many to petition Google for a more native, integrated solution. Hence, Night Mode was born.\nThis Night Mode feature was initially included in the developer previews for Android 7.0, so all supported Nexus devices were able to use it. Many were hoping to see it included in the final release of Android 7.0, but Alan from the Android Engineering Team said the feature needed a lot of work before it could go into a public release. So when the official Android 7.0 updates for the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P were released, this feature was removed from SystemUI Tuner just as Google had said.\nFortunately, however, the Night Mode feature itself was actually still present within the final release of 7.0 Nougat, though it was hidden. An application called Night Mode Enabler was released and that restored this functionality on these Nexus devices by issuing an intent to the SystemUI Tuner activity with the extra string show_night_mode:true . So while some people were upset that Google officially removed the feature, many were relieved with how easy it was to restore the functionality. Furthermore, with the introduction of Android 7.1 on the Pixel and Pixel XL , we saw this feature come back with a new name – Night Light. Unfortunately, Google Developer Advocate stated that Night Light would not be released on the Nexus devices due to missing driver support for the necessary hardware composer .\nWith the situation looking bleak, fans of Night Mode pinned their hopes that the feature would be reintroduced in the Android 7.1 Developer Preview , even if it does not utilize the more efficient hardware composition methods employed by Night Light in the Google Pixel phones. Sadly, this didn’t happen and the update also entirely removed all references to Night Mode in SystemUI – preventing even the Night Mode Enabler app from restoring the feature. Although a mod for the Nexus 6P was released that restored Night Mode on Android 7.1.1 DP1, non-root users have been wanting the feature brought back in the official release. Thankfully, we are now aware that yesterday a Google employee marked this request status to be included in a “Future Release” on the AOSP Issue Tracker . We don’t know exactly which update will restore Night Mode, but this news should be music to the ears of anyone disappointed by the initial removal of said feature.\nSource: AOSP Issue Tracker \n",

      "text": " Google+\nBoston Garden Development Corp.\nA winter-themed shopping and recreation program is scheduled to open on City Hall Plaza December 2.\nBy Katheleen Conti Globe Staff November 11, 2016\nBoston officials provided new details about the outdoor event space that will soon transform the dull brick expanse of City Hall Plaza, with a winter-themed shopping and recreation program now scheduled to open December 2.\nSponsored by Berkshire Bank, the winter garden-like program will include an outdoor ice-skating path, a 20-foot Christmas tree with lights that will be powered by stationary bicycles and more than 40 boutique “chalets” featuring wares from local vendors such as The Grommet, LovePop, Etsy Artists of Boston, and Boston Olive Oil Company.\nAdvertisement\nThere will also be an Urban Lodge, a riff on a ski lodge where shoppers and skaters can come in from the cold and lounge with some beer, wine, or hot chocolate.\nLocal artists and community groups are also encouraged to sign up online to perform on the community stage that will be at the center of the activities.\nGet Business Headlines The holiday vendors will be at the winter garden through Dec. 31. The ice rink, which will feature skating lessons and other events, will be available through February.\nThe winter garden will be open seven days a week and entrance will be free. Some events, however, will carry a charge, with tickets going on sale Nov. 14 at the program’s website, cityhallplazaboston.com . Among the paid attractions is Vinopolis, an interactive wine exhibit from London where visitors can partake in a mini masterclass about wine production in different regions.\nBoston Garden Development Corp., a subsidiary of Delaware North Cos., which owns and operates TD Garden, signed the three-year deal with the city to manage the events. Under the contract with the city, the Delaware North will pay the city a flat fee of $50,000 a year, or a percentage of all revenues, whichever is greater. In addition the city will receive an escalating percentage of revenues associated with sponsorships.\nAdvertisement\nMayor Martin Walsh announced Friday that Berkshire Bank has signed on to be a major partner, and throughout the three-year contract the event will be branded “Boston Seasons presented by Berkshire Bank.” The winter season event will be known as “Boston Winter presented by Berkshire Bank.”\nKatheleen Conti can be reached at kconti@globe.com .

      "title": "Financial startups build momentum in Boston -",
      "text": " Google+\nJonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff\nLaurel Taylor, CEO of FutureFuel.io, at the DCU Fintech Innovation Center.\nBy Scott Kirsner Globe Columnist November 11, 2016\nEarlier this year, a Boston startup called Kensho noticed an interesting trend: major stock market indexes and exchange-traded funds ticked upward following 10 of Donald Trump’s Republican primary victories. And this week, in the days following Trump’s win, the Dow and Standard & Poor’s benchmarks have had a good run — despite widespread pre-election worries to the contrary.\nKensho, which build software that tries to understand how real-world events affect the markets, is one of the better-funded startups in Boston’s fintech sector. Fintech, which refers to new approaches to financial services, has so far been a small piece of the region’s startup scene. And our fintech activity has been markedly lower than in cities like New York, London, and Hong Kong.\nAdvertisement\nBut fledgling companies like Kensho and Quantopian , which provides tools that allow anyone to create investment algorithms that buy and sell based on pre-determined signals, seem to be gaining momentum. (In July, investor Steven A. Cohen said he’d commit up to $250 million to be managed by Quantopian’s community of algorithm-builders.) And the DCU FinTech Innovation Center, near South Station, is becoming a clear hub of activity. Run by Digital Federal Credit Union , it offers free office space to selected startups, along with mentorship and access to DCU executives.\nThere are several strong winds blowing through the world of financial services — many of which favor totally new approaches, as opposed to entrenched players.\nGet Business Headlines “Millennials want to learn,” says Sarah Biller, a former State Street executive who is now advising several fintech startups. “They have a tremendous appetite for financial literacy.” Younger consumers also want “hyper-personalized” advice about how to invest and save, and likely don’t want to get it from an adviser sitting across a desk from them. Some of the better-known fintech companies are so-called robo-advisers like Betterment, which are luring investors from big mutual fund and brokerage firms.\nThere’s also less emphasis on brand name and trust, and more on transparency, Biller says. “We’ve relied on trust for 500 or 600 years in financial services, but younger clients and millennials don’t trust the large institutions. ‘I want to verify, I want to see quite openly that you’re lending to me at the right rates, or investing my money correctly.’ They never again want to be caught up in a crisis like the buried bad loans we had in the 2008 financial crisis.”\nBiller was one of the founders of the FinTech Sandbox , a nonprofit organization started in 2014. While it is based in Boston, it provides resources like market data and cloud-based services to startups anywhere in the world. At a well-attended “demo day” earlier this month, the FinTech Sandbox invited eight companies to give a short presentation to an audience of investors and financial services execs. Only one Boston startup was among them: Finfox, which helps small businesses analyze their finances and automatically keep an appropriate amount of cash in the bank.\nAdvertisement\nThe Sandbox has now assisted about 50 startups, says Biller. And its staff of two will be moving into the DCU FinTech Center next month.\nJean Donnelly, the Sandbox’s executive director and a former Fidelity Investments exec, says she’s encouraged by an uptick in venture capital firms in Boston with an interest in fintech, including Vestigo Ventures, launched in April; Hyperplane Venture Capital; Good Growth Capital; and corporate venture capital groups at MassMutual and Liberty Mutual. Still, she says, “there can be a gap in early-stage venture capital funding” available to fintech companies that haven’t yet finished their product or service or found initial customers for it.\nEntrepreneurs, not surprisingly, agree that there’s a dearth of funders to talk to locally, as compared to places like London, New York, or the San Francisco Bay area. Havell Rodrigues, CEO of Adjoint , a three-person startup focused on using blockchain technology, a kind of secure, distributed database, to help manage contracts more effectively. “More venture firms would be good for Boston,” Rodrigues says. “Boston has a decent fintech ecosystem, but it is relatively small.” The company participated earlier this year in a startup challenge in London run by Ernst & Young, and was named “Most Investible Startup.”\nExplaining the focus of the company, Rodrigues says that in most trading relationships, “you have two counterparties, manually processing the same trade independently of each other, and spending a lot of time reconciling it. We automate all that business flow and logic,” and using blockchain technology “create an immutable record.”\nThe company is taking advantage of free office space at the DCU FinTech Center. “To a boot-strapped startup like us, that’s huge,” Rodrigues says. About 10 startups work there, but the plan is to host 16 on rotating one-year tenancies. DCU is both looking for startups whose technology it can test out for its own use, but also for insights into emerging trends, says David Araujo, a vice president at Marlborough-based DCU who oversees the center. Right now, Araujo says, DCU is collaborating with one of the startups that has been in the center on a new goal-based savings initiative.\nBiller teaches a graduate-level course at Brandeis University on “The Evolution of Technology for Financial Services,” and following Trump’s election this week, she’s adjusting the curriculum to explore the impact that the new administration may have on the fintech sector.\n“What does the future hold?” she asks. “It’s quite uncertain.” But on Thursday, Trump’s transition team posted a note on the president-elect’s website declaring their intention to “dismantle” the Dodd–Frank Act signed into law by President Obama in 2010. The legislation was passed in the wake of the financial crisis in the hopes of preventing another systemic meltdown.\nLess regulation for banks and other financial services providers may not turn out to be in the best interest of consumers, or the economy as a whole — and “dismantling” is a very different word from “refashioning” — but it could turn out to be a good thing for startups trying to sell new ideas to the industry.\n“If Dodd-Frank or Sarbanes-Oxley regulations go away, what does that mean?” asks Ty Danco, an angel investor who splits his time between Boston and Vermont. “I think the next great innovations are going to come from people outside of financial services. We need to free ourselves from the old ways of thinking and be able to give a shot to new thoughts, new startups.”\nScott Kirsner can be reached at kirsner@pobox.com .

      "text": " Google+\nCraig F. Walker/Globe Staff/File\nThe oven at Ohlin’s Bakery in Belmont exploded in March.\nBy Steve Annear Globe Staff November 11, 2016\nFirst, the Belmont doughnut shop was heavily damaged when an oven exploded , nearly injuring the owner if not for a protective stack of doughnut pans.\nThen, Paul Klemm, the owner of Ohlin’s Bakery, was told that the cost to rebuild the property as a bakery would be extremely high.\nAdvertisement\nAnd now, in the latest round of bad news for the quaint neighborhood staple, Klemm and his wife, Marybeth, have been informed that they won’t be able to move back into the space the family business had occupied for 101 years.\n“We were trying our hardest to reopen in our original location,” the Klemms wrote on Facebook this week . “We were told by our landlord that this is no longer possible.”\nGet Fast Forward Paul Klemm’s family took over the shop in the 1960s.\nThe couple are now asking their loyal customer base to help them find a new location somewhere in the Greater Boston area, close to Belmont. The Klemms said on Facebook that they’ve met with real estate agents, and explored neighborhoods in Cambridge, Watertown, and Arlington, but nothing has panned out.\nIn a telephone interview, Marybeth Klemm said the couple hopes to soon find a place that’s affordable, has adequate parking, and has enough space for the shop’s large equipment.\nAdvertisement\n“We had a huge oven the size of a van, so we need a lot of space. But a lot of places we have seen have been really small,” she said. “We are asking people to help because we have a customer fan base, and maybe they would give us some ideas.”\nThe setback is the latest in a series of unfortunate events that have kept the Klemms from providing coffee and baked goods to customers since March. It was then that the oven at the Belmont bakery exploded unexpectedly, just feet from Paul Klemm.\nA wall of doughnut pans shielded him from serious injury. But the store was not spared. The blast blew out a brick wall and partially collapsed the roof. Both the building owner and the Klemms had insurance policies, but they did not cover all the expenses. The building owner’s insurance would only pay to turn the building into a retail store , not a bakery.\nTo help offset the costs for code upgrades, a former employee of the bakery in July started a gofundme.com fund-raiser online. The goal was to raise $50,000 for the couple. In six days, fans of the bakery contributed more than $13,000. The latest tally is at roughly $23,000.\nEven if the goal is met, there’s no longer a chance for the bakery to return home.\n“We are really heartbroken,” said Klemm. “We were shocked and depressed. It’s very hard.”\nCustomers can still contribute to the fund-raiser, and the family would welcome advice on where to find a suitable location so they can bring back the doughnuts.\n“The sooner the better,” said Klemm. “But our customers have been very kind and generous in helping us. A lot of people have said, ‘We will follow you wherever you go.’”\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @steveannear .",

      "text": " Google+\nSam Horine\nThe first floor living room of Donald and Melania Trump&apos;s penthouse at Trump Tower.\nBy Nestor Ramos Globe Staff November 11, 2016\nNEW YORK — America’s next president lives on the 66th floor of a 58-story tower that bears his name.\nHe rode the support of white, rural, and suburban America all the way to Pennsylvania Avenue, but until he moves into the White House he’ll stay in a gilded penthouse high above the country’s most diverse and cosmopolitan metropolis — in the middle of a borough where he received only about 10 percent of the vote.\nAdvertisement\nNearly everything about President-elect Donald J. Trump’s anti-establishment campaign for the presidency bucked convention. But in the days after his election to the nation’s highest office, few such contradictions were as obvious as the simple fact of where he lays his head.\nUnlike his recent predecessors, whose accommodations at least loosely resemble the kinds of domiciles with which Americans are familiar, Trump Tower is flanked by the flagship store of Tiffany & Co., and the Gucci flagship store is inside. Bergdorf Goodman, perhaps the single toniest department store in the world, is one block over.\nGet Fast Forward In the days after the election, the already crowded corners nearby were overrun. Protesters held signs bearing block-letter expletives above their heads as they pushed through throngs of tourists and looky-loos and commuters who had the misfortune of stumbling upon the melee.\nPolice with bullhorns shepherded the crowds along, while the more devoted demonstrators were confined to barricaded areas in the street. Five men calling themselves Blacks for Trump gave long, semi-coherent interviews to foreign journalists camped out in a separate barricade. A few times a day, the Naked Cowboy made the trek up from his usual spot in Times Square, wading into the crowd in his underpants.\nAcross the street, a young woman tried without success to burn an American flag in the rain.\nAdvertisement\nIn the middle of this mess, surrounded by a population of local residents who probably wouldn’t have voted for Trump at gunpoint, protecting the president-elect presents some obvious challenges — both for security and livability on what were already some of the busiest blocks in the country.\n“It’s a challenge. I don’t think it’s an overwhelming challenge,” New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, said at a news conference this week. “Look, we’re talking about the next few months, and then Donald Trump is going to be living in the White House.”\nBesides, he added, the holidays are coming: “Midtown is going to be all messed up anyway.”\nSince Election Day, several massive sanitation trucks piled full of sand have lined Fifth Avenue in front of the building, arranged to prevent would-be attackers from crashing a vehicle into the building or setting off a bomb out front that would damage or even topple the tower. Nearby, 56th Street was closed entirely, and confused commuters trying to cross streets ended up jogging around several blocks only to encounter another barricade.\nThe sidewalk in front of the building is barricaded, though New York police officers politely allowed tourists and others through to have lunch at Trump Grill or shop inside. Officers with long guns stood outside, and none would say exactly how long this might continue. The airspace around the tower was off-limits per FAA order, indefinitely grounding some sightseeing flights that routinely pass too close for comfort.\nInside, the lobby was filled with more security, human and canine. Trump once threatened to organize a boycott of Starbucks over holiday cups that were insufficiently Christmasy, but there’s a Starbucks on a mezzanine high above the lobby.\nBelow, small groups gathered for lunch at Trump Grill, makers of the famous taco salad that Trump once proclaimed the best in the world in a tweet on Cinco de Mayo (“I love Hispanics!” he added.)\nTrump’s campaign office is on the fifth floor, and his business offices are on the 26th. Though records show the building is only 58 stories tall, Trump’s penthouse is on the 66th floor, the result of longstanding exaggerations of the size of several of his towers.\nOther condos are filled with residents who were at least as famous as Trump until fairly recently.\nBruce Willis reportedly lives there, as does soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo when he’s in town. The former president of the Brazilian Soccer Federation, implicated in a bribery scandal, is serving his house arrest inside after he paid a hefty bail, essentially forking over $10 million for the right to pick his own jail cell.\nThe pink marble and gold plating and roiling chaos are, like the man himself, a far cry from Trump’s immediate predecessors.\nFew details are available about the inside of President Obama’s Chicago home, in the Kenwood neighborhood. But it’s perfectly visible from the street, tucked into an upscale residential neighborhood. Before Obama’s election and during his president-elect period at the end of 2008, heightened security in the neighborhood — including road closures and checkpoints — was mildly disruptive to a nearby synagogue.\nWhen a couple bought the house next door and undertook a substantial remodeling project, contractors told The New York Times that they had to run plans by the White House, and workers all underwent background checks.\nPresident George W. Bush’s frequent presence on his ranch outside Crawford, Texas was even less disruptive during his two terms. The property was so unremarkable from the rural road that a coffee shop in town sold maps to help tourists find the place, until the Secret Service shut that down, according to USA Today.\nA 2014 photo spread in Architectural Digest depicted a serene, low-slung country estate surrounded by patches of wildflowers beyond rolling swaths of high-mowed grass. Double doors and tall windows let the Texas sunshine fall on a modern white kitchen and a carpeted breezeway in which the former president spends his time hunched over an easel, working on oil portraits of world leaders and dogs.\nThe interior of Trump’s penthouse, which a private elevator opens into directly, is considerably less rustic. A May photo gallery in House Beautiful magazine detailed the apartment’s rococo styling, marble floors and columns, and extravagant gold plating. Melania Trump, the magazine discovered, “prefers to decorate her desk with short-stemmed yellow roses.”\nBut though tourists and curiosity seekers and, occasionally, journalists can talk their way into the lobby, catching a glimpse of the next president is a challenge.\nOn Wednesday, all that could be seen were aides making their way up and down the gold-plated elevators.\nThe Blacks for Trump guys enjoyed a quiet meal in Trump Grill.\nThe Starbucks was temporarily closed.\nNestor Ramos can be reached at nestor.ramos@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nBy Dylan McGuinness and Olivia Quintana Globe Correspondents November 11, 2016\nWELLESLEY — The president of Babson College apologized to the Wellesley College community Friday after two Babson students drove through Wellesley’s campus in a pickup truck Wednesday, waving a Donald Trump flag and allegedly yelling insults and racial profanities at students.\n“We, the Babson community, were extremely upset to learn that two of our students engaged in behavior that was, at a minimum, insensitive, unacceptable, and contrary to our core values,” President Kerry Healey wrote in a letter posted on the college’s website. “Please accept our most sincere apology and know that the actions of those individuals do not in any way reflect the values of Babson College.”\nAdvertisement\nBabson administrators are investigating the incident. Federal law prohibits the college from “discussing specific disciplinary actions or outcomes,” Healey said.\nOn Thursday, Lawrence P. Ward, vice president of student affairs at Babson, said in a letter to students that the two men drove by Harambee House, Wellesley’s center for African-American students.\nGet Fast Forward “It is important to understand that our students’ behavior was experienced by many students of color and perceived by many others ... as racially offensive and gender demeaning,’’ Ward wrote.\nOn Wellesley’s campus Friday afternoon, classes were cancelled so students and faculty could walk together to “reclaim our space,” according to Charlotte Weiss, a fifth-year teaching student.\n“I think we all felt that we lost so much losing the election,” Weiss said while participating in the peace walk. “To have that loss and then feel like the space on our campus had been invalidated by the Babson students, made us want to come together as a community to show that we are fighting for justice.”\nAdvertisement\nFreshman Maya Webber, who said she saw the Babson students driving on campus, said an apology is not sufficient to fix what happened.\n“We’re definitely waiting for something more. Acts like that are not acceptable at all,” Webber said. “I never thought I would feel that uncertainty that I felt in that moment. ... I just hope something more concrete will be done.”\nAmber Walker, a Wellesley senior, was one of the students standing in front of the Harambee House when the Babson students drove by. She said told her peers after the walk that she would never have expected to experience such hatred while at Wellesley.\n“This morning when I woke up, I felt hope for the first time because this isn’t the ‘60s, this isn’t the ‘70s,” Walker said. “I look around and I have you guys here so I don’t have to go through this alone.”\nAmina Ziad, a senior, implored fellow students to continue to protect and stand up for each other.\n“Protect your siblings of color, protect your Muslim siblings, protect all of the minorities on this campus and off this campus,” Ziad said. “If you see something, say something.”\nBefore sending students off singing “We Shall Overcome,” Wellesley College president Paula Johnson told them: “I think you’ve heard it all, and it gives us the inspiration to move forward, onward.”\nIn a note sent to students Thursday, Johnson described the mood on campus as “one of anxiety and concern.”\n“This community’s well-being — and all that word encompasses — is foremost on my mind right now,” she wrote.\nIn a letter, students on Wellesley’s Honor Code Council called on Babson officials to expel the two students. The letter alleges the two Babson students parked outside the Harambee House, a campus center for African-American students, and shouted profanities at students and spit on a student who told them to leave.\n“We believe the actions of [the two men] on Wellesley’s campus on November 9th clearly constitute bullying, endangering behavior, and harassment of the Wellesley College community and the Babson College community,” the letter said, referencing specific clauses in the Babson’s Student Code of Conduct that would warrant punishment.\n“Accordingly, we call for an Honor Board Hearing to find by a preponderance of evidence that [the men] have violated Babson’s Community Standards. . . [and] we advocate immediate and permanent removal of these individuals from the Babson College community.”\nThe letter was addressed to a Babson assistant dean and the Babson College Honor Board.\nThe letter from Wellesley’s Honor Code Council, as well as other Internet postings, identifies the two men. But the Globe is not naming them because they have not been criminally charged, nor have they been identified or penalized by Babson administrators.\nOne of the Babson students involved in the incident declined to comment in a brief telephone interview Thursday; the other could not be reached.\nA video that surfaced online purportedly showed the two men laughing about the case.\n“We are officially banned from Wellesley College,” one of the men said in the brief clip. “If we’re caught there, we’ll get arrested and subject to trespassing. Make America great again!” The latter sentence was a Trump campaign slogan. Hillary Clinton is a Wellesley College graduate.\nAttorney General Maura Healey’s office, which investigates civil rights violations, said Thursday it is aware of the incident and gathering more information, but have not received a formal complaint or launched an investigation.\nHealey, Babson’s president, said she regrets the impact the incident had on Wellesley students.\n“Students should never be made to feel fearful or unsafe on their own campus. We wholeheartedly regret that members of our community impacted the Wellesley College community in such a profoundly negative way.”\nOn Thursday, the national leadership of the Babson students’ fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon, said both students had been kicked out of the organization. Fraternity officials described their actions as “abhorrent to our members, alumni, and staff, and in no way represent Sig Ep’s values and aspirations for diversity and inclusion.’’\nDylan McGuinness can be reached at dylan.mcguinness@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nREUTERS/Sandy Huffaker\nBy Thomas Farragher Globe Columnist November 11, 2016\nA few weeks before Election Day, US Representative Jim McGovern was at a neighborhood bar in Worcester. He bumped into an old pal.\nThe guy, a friend since grammar school, is struggling to get by. He works two jobs, including one as an auto mechanic.\nAdvertisement\nAt one point, he pulled his buddy the congressman aside and delivered a message that proved prophetic: “I’m going to vote for Trump. People in Washington need to get a message and this is the only way. And you’re going to be surprised how many people there are like me who are going to vote for Trump.’’\nYes, McGovern was surprised. Me, too. Amid the smoldering wreckage from Tuesday’s election, it was difficult to find a more startling statistic than Donald Trump’s margin of victory over Hillary Clinton among white voters without a college degree. He won that slice of the electorate by 39 percentage points, 67 percent to 28 percent. No one’s had numbers like that in 36 years.\nGet Fast Forward “He’s a good guy. I like him,’’ McGovern said of his old friend. “And I understood where he’s coming from. I tried to persuade him that night. I probably wasn’t successful. I think this was a big middle finger to the establishment and to Washington.’’\nPrecisely right. People are angry. They’re fed up. Trump offered fool’s gold. Voters bought it.\nLet me get this straight: A billionaire who uses accounting tricks to escape a huge tax burden is going to be the champion of the middle class? He’s going to raise the minimum wage? He’s going to find a way to make college more affordable? No, he isn’t.\nAdvertisement\nBut, let’s face it, Clinton was an imperfect messenger. Too many Democrats found it difficult to warm up to a woman who wrote books for seven-figure advances, gave speeches for $200,000 a pop, sealed herself off in the back of a sleek SUV, and then presented herself — inauthentically — as the champion of the little guy.\n“People are angry and frustrated and they don’t feel the economy is getting any better, and Trump was able to tap into that better than we were,’’ McGovern, a Democrat, told me this week. “When have Republicans ever given a [crap] about the middle class? I’m sick to my stomach.’’\nSo is his 15-year-old daughter. Molly McGovern has questions that sometimes her father now struggles to answer. Profound questions. How could voters have done this? What are we going to do now? I have a daughter like that. She’s asking those questions, too.\nAlong with economic fears that Trump exploited, he cleverly tapped unmistakable veins of racism and sexism.\nMcGovern was at Logan Airport recently when he was approached by a man who opened his sports coat to gleefully display a T-shirt with a photo of Hillary Clinton behind bars. “Jail the B----h,’’ the shirt read.\nMcGovern, whose district stretches from Worcester to Northampton, told the guy: “I’m embarrassed for you. I’d be embarrassed for you if you were a teenager. You’re a grown man.’’\nI have some sense of ugliness like that.\nThere has been much anger — actually that’s too benign a word for it – directed at people like me who believed this country could never elect someone like Trump as its president. A bigot, a misogynist, a xenophobe, a sexist, and a liar as our president? No way.\nFor staking out that position, we’ve been called out-of-touch nitwits, elitists who live in a bubble that Trump, his supporters, and his message could never penetrate.\nBut that’s wrong. Essentially half of our country voted for this man. I know what Jim McGovern knows: Trump supporters are our relatives, our friends, and our neighbors. I passionately disagree with them. But I know them.\nI have stood next to them at backyard cookouts after high school graduations. I have sat with them over well-worn Formica-topped tables inside blue-collar barrooms.\nI grew up with some of them in a small central Massachusetts mill town with a long and proud Democratic tradition. Like Jim McGovern’s old friend, they are not haters. Some are the most decent, kind, unselfish people I know. They’re juggling blue-collar jobs to support families, put kids through college, and hold on to their place in the middle class.\nThey believe – they know — Washington is broken. They feel crippled by an unfair tax burden. They’ve heard word of a freshening economic wind, but have never felt it on their sails. Throw the bums out, they said on Tuesday. Roll the dice. Shake things up.\nFlip the finger.\nHours after Trump was declared the winner on Wednesday morning, I was on my therapeutic morning run through the small South Shore town where I now live, trying unsuccessfully to clear my head.\nMy next-door neighbor, a great guy cut from the same cloth as some of my hometown buddies, drove by. He’s had it with Washington, too. He runs a small business and drives a white panel truck with his name emblazoned in green on its side.\nAs I ran past the local library, his truck slowed, and he rolled down his window.\n“We still friends?’’ he asked, smiling.\nOf course, I told him. How about a beer at the neighborhood bar?\nThe country is hurting. It’s going to take lots of time to heal. Lots of frosted mugs.\nDrain the swamp?

      "title": "How I use Google Daydream without a View headset (with Cardboard)",
      "text": "Reddit \nGoogle Pixel users are now able to work and play with Google Daydream without the official Google Daydream View headset. While Google would rather that Daydream VR users use their first Daydream View headset, for sale in their store, there’s another way to do it. Google has graciously allowed the Google Daydream environment to be fiddled with by anyone in an effort to draw developers for massive app and game creation. \nThe Google Daydream VR environment is made for the next generation of Google-approved Android smartphones. Daydream is said to require a certain set of hardware and software bits and pieces, as outlined in our big Google Daydream View Review . In reality, though, quite a few smartphones without these specs can participate in this VR environment. \nAbove you’ll see our early demo of the Daydream Controller back when we needed to keep it connected between phones with USB. The newest version of this app – for developers – only requires a Bluetooth connection. This is just like the real controller device which connects to Pixel phones with Bluetooth as well. \nA couple of requirements do seem to be absolutely required by the Daydream app. These include running Android 7.0 Nougat on our prospective Daydream smartphone. Requirements for a secondary phone – to be used as a controller – are that a gyroscope and Android 4.4+ be present. \nFirst, I needed two smartphones, one to run the Daydream app, the other to act as a controller. The Daydream app requires that a controller be present – otherwise it shows an overlay box searching for said controller. While some apps may (eventually) not require the controller, the vast majority seem to so far. \nThe Daydream smartphone will need to be running the Daydream App (here on APK mirror) and the Daydream Keyboard app (also on APK mirror) . A third app will be required, this one headed for the controller phone. \nThis third app is the Google Daydream Controller Emulator app we showed working on a Samsung Galaxy S7 back in May. Courtesy of Google’s own Developers portal, the Daydream Controller APK can be downloaded from Github. Once these three apps have been installed, follow the instructions that follow this sentence. \n1. Pair the two smartphones via Bluetooth. 2. Open the Daydream app. 3. Tap the menu button (upper right, three horizontal white lines). 4. Tap Settings. 5. Tap “Build Version” 8 times – Developer Options should appear. 6. Tap Developer Options. 7. Tap Controller Emulator Device. 8. Select your other phone from the list and press OK. 9. Tap “Skip VR entry screens” and press OK. 10. Tap back, back until you get to the first Daydream home screen. 11. Tap the blue button with the viewer icon. 12. Open the Daydream Controller app on the controller phone. 13. Place the Daydream phone into a Google Cardboard viewer of some sort – or don’t, if you want to view without VR, for whatever reason. \nThe Daydream phone should show VR in a fashion not all that unlike what Cardboard has done for the past couple of years. The secondary control phone should act the same way as the standard Daydream Controller does with the official Google Daydream View headset. Users MAY get a headache after a while, the same as they would with any other VR headset setup. I don’t have a Google Pixel! \nIt does not currently matter (for the most part) if the Google Daydream app is used outside of a Daydream-approved smartphone. We’ve tried a couple of Nexus devices to see if they work with the Google Daydream app and they do. They might not be working nearly as well as a Pixel or Pixel XL, but they work. They’re also not covered by any claims Google might make to avoid headaches – but they work. I’ve lost my Daydream View controller, now what? \nThis solution is potentially helpful for people that do not have the Google Daydream controller. While we’d originally set out to show now non-crucial the Daydream View was to the equation, we found that the controller wasn’t either. You’re still going to get the best experience with all the Google-approved pieces of hardware, but you don’t NEED them to use Daydream. \nWe’re crossing our fingers that Google allows the Daydream Controller to be sold without the headset in the future. The controller does live safely in the headset, all snug and nice, but there’s still a chance it’ll be lost. There’s always a chance of something like that happening. \nAnd again, if I really want the full Daydream experience, I’m going to need a Pixel or Pixel XL as well as the real-deal Daydream View. The Daydream View costs around $80 and includes the controller, and the controller has a rechargeable battery via USB-C. Cords that come in the box with the Pixel and/or Pixel XL also work with the Daydream Controller. Have a peek at the timeline below for more information on this VR environment. Story Timeline",

      "text": "Ashley King Nov 11th, 2016 \nThis year’s rumors surrounding Google releasing a premium device and abandoning its Nexus line turned out to be true, much to the dismay of Android fans everywhere. Nexus devices were a great way to get the stock Android experience and latest updates all without breaking the bank. The Google Pixel starts at $649 and goes up to $869 for a Pixel XL 128GB version. That’s nearly double what the base Nexus 6P cost at launch. \nBecause Google is focusing on premium devices that command a premium price, there’s a void in the $400 stock Android market right now. OnePlus and ZTE both released devices in this category this year that are going head to head with each other. The OnePlus 3 offers a near stock Android experience with a few tweaks found in OxygenOS, while ZTE offers a Stock Android skin on their ZTE Axon 7. \nBoth the OnePlus 3 and the ZTE Axon 7 are amazing devices in the $400 category, with the Axon 7’s display, battery life, and audio slightly edging out the OnePlus 3’s better camera and superior software. If ZTE can address these issues with its next phone, presumably the Axon 8, then it could definitely be poised to be a stock Android competitor in the future. \nZTE has been listening to its community this year and they’ve opened a poll on their website to ask why you prefer stock Android devices. They’re considering filling the niche that the end of the Nexus line left for people who want stock Android devices with fast updates. While ZTE traditionally hasn’t done very well in the update department with its handsets, the Axon 7 breaks that mold as ZTE has released security updates each month and plans for Nougat to be released by January. \nThe ZTE community manager in charge of the poll says these results will be presented to their R&D team to determine if a stock Android device should be in the cards for the company, based on customer support. It’s nice to see manufacturers jumping in to fill the gap Google left behind with Nexus devices and if ZTE can continue to deliver amazing hardware while shaping up their software they could quickly become a go-to brand for the $400 device category.",

      "text": " Google+\nREUTERS/Javier Galeano\nPolice officers stood guard during a protest against US President-elect Donald Trump in Miami.\nBy Mark Berman and Wesley Lowery The Washington Post November 12, 2016\nPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Spurred by fear and outrage, protesters around the country rallied and marched Friday as they have done daily since Donald Trump’s presidential election victory.\nThe spirited demonstrations on college campuses and along downtown streets were mostly peaceful following previous outbreaks of window-smashing and fire-setting.\nAdvertisement\nEvening marches disrupted traffic in Miami and Atlanta while people gathered for demonstrations in Portland, Oregon, the scene of violent protests Thursday night. Friday evening in Portland hundreds of people again marched through the streets, some spray painting graffiti as police tried to control the group and direct their movement through the city.\nTrump supporter Nicolas Quirico was traveling from South Beach to Miami. His car was among hundreds stopped when protesters blocked Interstate 395.\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here ‘‘Trump will be our president. There is no way around that, and the sooner people grasp that, the better off we will be,’’ he said. ‘‘There is a difference between a peaceful protest and standing in a major highway backing up traffic for 5 miles. This is wrong.’’\nHundreds of protesters took to the streets across California after night fell including downtown Los Angeles, where over 200 were arrested a night earlier. In Bakersfield, where Trump is far more popular than in most of the state, some held signs reading ‘‘Anti-Trump, Pro-USA.’’\nSmall protests also were held in Detroit; Minneapolis; Kansas City, Missouri; Olympia, Washington and Iowa City.\nAdvertisement\nHundreds joined an afternoon ‘‘love rally’’ in Washington Square Park in Manhattan.\nLeslie Holmes, 65, a website developer from Wilton, Connecticut, took an hour-long train ride to the demonstration — her first protest since the 1970s, when she hit the streets of San Francisco to oppose the Vietnam War.\nShe described herself as an armchair liberal but declared, ‘‘I'm not going to be armchair anymore.’’\n‘‘I don’t want to live in a country where my friends aren’t included, and my friends are fearful, and my children are going to grow up in a world that’s frightening, and my granddaughters can look forward to being excluded from jobs and politics and fulfilling their potential, so I'm here for them,’’ she said.\nMore than 200 people, carrying signs gathered on the steps of the Washington state Capitol. The group chanted ‘‘not my president’’ and ‘‘no Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.’’\nIn Tennessee, Vanderbilt University students sang civil rights songs and marched through campus across a Nashville street, temporarily blocking traffic. A protest also occurred in Minneapolis.\nIn Chicago, multiple groups planned protests through Saturday.\nNadia Gavino, 25, learned about the rallies on Twitter and protested Thursday evening. Gavino, whose father is from Peru and whose mother is of Mexican and Lithuanian heritage, said she took Trump’s harshest statements about immigrants and Latinos personally.\n‘‘I obviously agree that he’s racist, he’s sexist, he’s phobic, he’s misogynistic. He’s all these things you don’t want in a leader,’’ she said.\nAshley Lynne Nagel, 27, said she joined a Thursday night demonstration in Denver.\n‘‘I have a leader I fear for the first time in my life,’’ said Nagel, a Bernie Sanders supporter who voted for Hillary Clinton.\n‘‘It’s not that we’re sore losers,’’ she said. ‘‘It’s that we are genuinely upset, angry, terrified that a platform based off of racism, xenophobia and homophobia has become so powerful and now has complete control of our representation.’’\nDemonstrations also were planned Saturday in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and other areas.\nPrevious demonstrations drew thousands of people in New York and other large urban centers. The largely peaceful demonstrations were overshadowed by sporadic episodes of vandalism, violence and street-blocking.",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Jan Ransom Globe Staff November 12, 2016\nMARLBOROUGH — In the final month of her pregnancy, Grecia Gallegos was eager to meet her baby boy.\nThe 19-year-old told friends on Facebook that she could feel the child hiccup, and it brought her such joy.\nAdvertisement\nShe named the boy Carlos.\n“It’s been a day with my son and I feel so blessed and happy,” she wrote on Oct. 3. “I couldn’t be more in love. Words cannot describe the love I feel for my prince.”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here On Thursday, nearly a month later, Carlos was dead, and Gallegos and her boyfriend, the child’s father, were found unresponsive in her Harrison Place home. They are recovering at an area hospital. Officials have not named the parents or the infant, but Gallegos’s relatives identified her and her son on Friday.\nInfant dead, adults found unresponsive, in Marlborough Police responded to a 911 call reporting an unresponsive infant and two adults just before noon on Thursday.\nTwo of her cousins said in an interview Friday that Grecia Gallegos had tried drugs for the first time Thursday. Authorities declined to comment on that account Friday.\nAccording to the two cousins, Gallegos’s mother came home at 11:30 a.m. Thursday and walked into her bedroom, where she found her daughter on the floor, unconscious with blood trickling from her mouth. Gallegos’s boyfriend lay face down on the bed, unresponsive. The baby was on the bed next to him, face up, and was cold to the touch, said Alfredo Rojas, 28, Gallegos’s cousin.\nAdvertisement\n“She freaked out and called 911,” Rojas said. “The paramedics came and said he had been dead for a couple of hours.”\nFacebook\nGrecia Gallegos’ son Carlos. Carlos was found dead in their Marlborough home.\nGallegos is expected to remain in the hospital for several more days, Rojas said. Her 23-year-old boyfriend also remained hospitalized. The two cousins said the pair had been dating for about a year and that he had served in the Navy. They said they did not know much else about him. At family events, he kept to himself.\nRojas said Grecia Gallegos had tried drugs for the first time Thursday, but he was unsure what she had taken. She told the cousins that her boyfriend had taken drugs before, according to Rojas.\nRojas said his cousin does not recall much of what happened that day.\n“She only remembers taking something and blacking out,” he said.\nGallegos gained consciousness on Friday, and that’s when the family broke the news to her about the baby’s death. She hasn’t stopped crying since, Rojas said.\n“She was looking forward to him, and spending Thanksgiving and Christmas with him,” said the second cousin, Magaly Rojas, 30. “The holidays will be rough. It’s a tragedy, especially for her, to know that the baby and all the dreams she had for him are nonexistent.”\nThe cousins said the family has been struggling to cope as they try to support Gallegos.\nAlfredo Rojas said he believed the death was an accident and that Gallegos has been cooperating with police in their investigation.\nA spokeswoman for the Middlesex district attorney’s office said the investigation was ongoing and no additional information was being released as officials wait for more information from the medical examiner’s office.\nAlfredo Rojas said his cousin was a student at Quincy College, where she met her boyfriend. Magaly Rojas, sister of Alfredo, said she has long been interested in fashion design. But when Carlos was born, he became her focus.\nShe was excited about motherhood, they both said, and her Facebook page is filled with photos of Carlos.\n“His smile melts my heart,” she wrote above a photo of him posted on Oct. 6. Carlos was dressed in a onesie and smiling in his sleep. Roughly two weeks ago, she shared a photo of him sleeping in a car seat at church.\nNeighbor Armando Mateo, 16, described Gallegos as a quiet, respectful person. Mateo, a student at Marlborough High School, said Gallegos recently graduated from that school and that the family attends Centro Cristiano Emanuel, a church on Boston Post Road.\nJeannita Walsh, 65, who lives across the street from the family, said Gallegos’s mother holds a weekly Bible study at her home.\nWalsh also attended Gallegos’s baby shower in September, bringing the young woman Pampers and pacifiers as gifts.\n“Congratulations! You’re having a boy,” Walsh recalled saying to Gallegos, who quietly enjoyed the celebration as her mother danced around.\nWalsh told Gallegos she would be happy to baby-sit if needed.\nOn Gallegos’s Facebook page were photos from the baby shower, including that of a sheet cake with Carlos’s name on it and a stork carrying a baby from its bill.\nBut Walsh said Gallegos’s boyfriend is “not a good character.”\nTwo other neighbors said he had gotten into fights on the quiet street, including once with a resident.\nNeighbor Susan Sweeney, 35, said he would often speed in his car down the dead-end street.\n“The guy is weird,” she said. “He was not friendly.”\nWalsh, Mateo, and another neighbor, Fred Cahill, 76, said the boyfriend came and went at all hours of the night.\nBut Magaly Rojas said the boyfriend appeared to be a concerned father.\nAnd she said Carlos’s sudden death has left the family stunned.\n“This has been a shock to everybody in our family,” she said. “All we want now is to take care of him, give him a proper burial, and help my cousin through what she’s going through. We ask for prayers and support to help these young people recover.”\nJan Ransom can be reached at jan.ransom@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Derrick Z. Jackson November 11, 2016\nHulton Archive/Getty Images\nW.E.B. Du Bois\nTo understand Donald Trump’s election as president, it is useful to remember the writings of W.E.B. Du Bois and James Baldwin. Trump won on the nostalgic slogan of “Make America Great Again.” The word “great” had particular meaning for Du Bois, who wrote in 1920 that it was easy for leaders to make people believe that “every great deed the world ever did was a white man’s deed.”\nBaldwin seconded that in 1964, observing that white superiority made it so difficult for white men to share power with people of color that they instead “set up in themselves a fantastic system of evasions, denials, and justifications,” a system which destroys “their grasp of reality, which is another way of saying their moral sense.”\nAdvertisement\nThere is no better way to put it when Trump can win the White House in 2016 with a system of racist rants, misogyny, bullying, and walling off the nation from brown and Muslim immigration. The election cannot be about the economy when a majority of white Americans who claim to be economically forgotten entrust the Oval Office to a billionaire with a record of multiple bankruptcies, one who has denied the public his tax returns. Not to mention a Republican Party that bequeathed a recession to President Obama.\nOf course many economic problems remain, but somehow, angry white voters are conveniently oblivious to the fact that unemployment under Obama was cut by half. And it’s not like black people stole their jobs for eight years — black unemployment remains double that of white Americans.\nGet Todays Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here This election was really about white Americans having such cold feet about the new America represented by Obama and the possibility of the first woman president that they chose the hottest head possible to pour kerosene onto smoldering resentment.\nView Story Two days after the election, Donald Trump wins Arizona’s 11 electoral votes Trump had a solid lead over Hillary Clinton on election night, but a winner wasn’t declared because there were so many uncounted votes.\nThe red state no one saw coming\nA Pew poll last summer found that a minority of Trump supporters thought diversity made America a better place to live while a majority wanted American Muslims to be subject to higher security scrutiny. According to a PRRI survey just before the election, 72 percent of Trump voters said American society and our way of life have changed for the worse since the 1950s, an era where white privilege was protected by discrimination and segregation.\nTrue to Baldwin’s observation, Trump voters displayed little grasp of reality in the CNN election exit poll. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton made serious missteps, such as calling half of Trump supporters a “basket of deplorables.” But at the end of the day, she still scored much higher than Trump in the exit polls as being the best to handle the economy and foreign policy and in three of four categories regarding which candidate quality mattered most: experience, judgment, and “cares about me.”\nAdvertisement\nYet Trump won on “can bring change.”\nChange meant that Clinton received an even smaller percentage of the white vote — 37 percent — than Obama ever did. Clinton’s gender and Trump’s boasting about grabbing vaginas meant nothing against the sentiments whipped up by Trump. White women went for Trump 53-43 percent.\nWhite noncollege women voted for Trump by nearly a 2-to-1 margin, and Trump nearly split the vote among white female college graduates. Such graduates voted for Clinton in some battleground states such as Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, but went overwhelmingly for Trump in the battlegrounds of Ohio, North Carolina, and Florida. There was also no evidence of gender defections by Republican women — 89 percent of them voted for Trump.\nAnd any assumptions that white millennials are predisposed to vote for a diverse America are premature. In 2008, Obama beat John McCain by 10 percentage points among white voters 18-to-29 years old. Tuesday night, Trump won that segment by 5 percentage points.\nDu Bois said the identity of whiteness confers “ownership of the earth forever and ever.” No one knows what economic or foreign policy chaos we may get from a Trump presidency, but it is almost certain that white privilege will be protected for decades, since Trump will probably appoint Supreme Court justices predisposed against legal remedies for racial, gender, gay, and economic equality. It is almost as certain he will give us a Justice Department blind to injustice.\nTrump’s voters knew this. Of the respondents who told CNN that the Supreme Court was the most important factor in their vote, the majority voted for Trump. In the face of abundant videotaped evidence of police brutality, 74 percent of Trump voters think the nation’s criminal justice system is fair.\nDu Bois would not have to change a word in observing how Trump and his supporters “strut and shout and threaten, crouching as they clutch at rags of facts and fancies to hide their nakedness.” An egregious system of denial is about to occupy the White House, on the promise that white people will own America forever.\nDerrick Z.

      "text": " Google+\nCraig F. Walker / Globe Staff\nMartin T. Meehan, president of the University of Massachusetts.\nBy Travis Andersen Globe Staff November 12, 2016\nThe president of the five-campus University of Massachusetts system has purchased a $975,000 condo on the Boston waterfront, records show.\nMartin T. Meehan recently closed on a unit in the luxury Harbor Towers complex at 65 E. India Row, according to the Suffolk Registry of Deeds online database. Meehan’s purchase was first reported by the Lowell Sun.\nAdvertisement\nThe former congressman and UMass Lowell chancellor could not be reached for comment Friday night. He took out two mortgages on the property over the summer, one for $780,000 and another for $97,500, according to the registry.\nMeehan’s spokesman, Jeffrey Cournoyer, said in an email that “[h[is office is downtown and he has a work-related event more nights than not. He was renting and decided to buy.”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Meehan’s current annual salary is $525,000, according to state payroll records.\nRobert L. Caret, his predecessor at the helm of the UMass system, last year collected $1.345 million from the sale of his Boston Harbor-front condominium that he bought four years earlier for $880,000.\nCaret had drawn on his taxpayer-funded housing stipend to pay the taxes, fees, and monthly costs of the mortgage before collecting the six-figure profit.\nAdvertisement\nThe transaction was all aboveboard. His contract provided him with a $60,000-a-year housing stipend, an amount that helped cover the payments on his $704,000 mortgage, city property taxes, and condo fees.\nIt was not clear Friday night if Meehan plans to sell his condo when his UMass tenure ends.\n“I don’t think he is looking that far ahead at this point,” Cournoyer wrote. “He plans to lead UMass for a long time.”\nCondo prices in central Boston recently hit record highs, with the median price reaching $913,500, 43 percent above last year, according to data from real estate marketing firm LINK.\nFrank Phillips and Tim Logan of the Globe Staff contributed to this report.",

      "text": " Google+\nJoshua Roberts/REUTERS\nPresident-elect Donald Trump meets with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Capitol Hill.\nBy Jeff Jacoby Globe Columnist November 11, 2016\nA t a press conference Wednesday morning in his Wisconsin hometown, House Speaker Paul Ryan overflowed with praise for Donald Trump.\n“He connected in ways with people that no one else did, he turned politics on its head,” Ryan told reporters. “Now he will lead a unified Republican Party.” Only weeks earlier, appalled by Trump’s coarse remarks about grabbing women, Ryan had refused to campaign with the Republican nominee. But after Trump’s stunning election triumph, Ryan brushed off such “intra-party issues” as unimportant. “This needs to be a time of redemption, not a time of recrimination,” he said.\nAdvertisement\nGood luck with that.\nTrump has never been one for turning the other cheek. “Always hit back against critics and adversaries, even if it looks bad,” he wrote in “ The Art of the Deal .” His vindictive streak was on display throughout the presidential campaign , and prominent Trump advocates have repeatedly vowed payback for anyone who opposed them. “Mr. Trump has a long memory, and we’re keeping a list,” his surrogate Omarosa Manigault said on election night. Broadcaster Sean Hannity, accusing Trump’s conservative detractors of “sabotage,” let it be known that they would face a “ day of reckoning ” after the election. Ryan, declared Hannity , “is not going to be speaker of the House in January.”\nGet Todays Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Nov. 8 marked a stunning victory for the Republican Party, which has now won control of the White House, both houses of Congress, 34 governorships, and 68 of the nation’s 99 state legislative chambers. It was also a crushing repudiation of Barack Obama’s legacy and his leadership of the Democratic Party. Not since 1929 has the GOP so dominated political life in America.\nBut for conservatives, the new order is disturbing.\nTrump is no conservative and never has been. The classic Reaganite principles of limited government, free markets, peace through strength, robust internationalism, American exceptionalism, and traditional social values have little resonance for the president-elect. His “ vision thing ,” to the extent he has one, is of a neo-isolationist populism. “Don’t forget, this is called the Republican Party,” Trump said last May . “It’s not called the Conservative Party.”\nAdvertisement\nIt was a fair point. Conservatives don’t own the Republican Party. At best, they have been its largest and most influential faction. Yet even in Ronald Reagan’s heyday, prominent Republicans rejected Reaganite values. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, for example, Bob Dole spent much of the 1980s opposing the Gipper’s supply-side economic reforms. The federal behemoth grew more swollen , not less, during Reagan’s years in office — and swelled still more under his successor, George H.W. Bush. Even William F. Buckley Jr. famously battled Reagan over his opposition to giving up the Panama Canal.\nYet while Republicans never really marched in lockstep to a conservative drummer, most of them came to see the GOP as the natural home for Reaganite values and the most reliable defender of conservative governance.\nThat will change under Trump. He is the new head of the Republican Party, and his influence will be felt throughout the ranks. Many on the right were dismayed by the stream of conservatives, both in and out of government, who set aside their philosophical objections and embraced Trump during the campaign. Now, as he prepares to move into the White House, that stream will become a torrent. In a page 1 subheadline on Thursday, The Wall Street Journal summarized the tectonic shift now underway: “Party members across the country move toward adopting positions held by the president-elect that they previously opposed.”\nAnd for conservative Republicans who decline to cut their conscience to fit this year’s fashions? They won’t be in the wilderness, exactly, but political life for them is about to become more uncomfortable.\nSome of Trump’s potential agenda items — replacing the Affordable Care Act, repudiating the Iran nuclear deal, filling the vacant Supreme Court seat with a Scalia-caliber judge, lowering the sky-high corporate income tax rate — movement conservatives will enthusiastically support. But much of what Trump campaigned on is anathema to them. If the incoming president is serious about killing the families of suspected terrorists, deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, weakening First Amendment protections for the press, cozying up to Vladimir Putin’s Russia, and imposing ruinous trade barriers, it will be incumbent on GOP conservatives to fight him.\nThe pull of partisan loyalty has always been hard for elected officials to resist. It has grown exponentially harder in our hyperpolarized environment — and the ascent of a new president with a vengeance reflex will make it harder still. Republican conservatives will need all the backbone they can muster when the leader of their party pushes them to support his anticonservative nostrums.\nIt would be wonderful if Trump, having captured the highest office in the land, resolves to abandon the smash-mouth style for which he is known and makes a point of listening to and learning from those who disagree with him. That would be a decided improvement over the last eight years of Obama’s my-way-or-the-highway superciliousness.\nHope springs eternal, but realists must assume that Trump will remain true to form. Which means it will take courage for Republicans — especially the committed conservatives among them — to oppose him when he’s wrong. That proved hard enough to do so when Trump was merely the party’s nominee. It’s about to get a lot harder.\nJeff Jacoby can be reached at jacoby@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @jeff_jacoby .",

      "title": "New AI-Based Search Engines are a \"Game Changer\" for Science Research",
      "text": "  \nA free AI-based scholarly search engine that aims to outdo Google Scholar is expanding its corpus of papers to cover some 10 million research articles in computer science and neuroscience, its creators announced on 11 November. Since its launch last year , it has been joined by several other AI-based academic search engines, most notably a relaunched effort from computing giant Microsoft. \nSemantic Scholar , from the non-profit Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) in Seattle, Washington, unveiled its new format at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in San Diego. Some scientists who were given an early view of the site are impressed. “This is a game changer,” says Andrew Huberman, a neurobiologist at Stanford University, California. “It leads you through what is otherwise a pretty dense jungle of information.” \nThe search engine first launched in November 2015, promising to sort and rank academic papers using a more sophisticated understanding of their content and context. The popular Google Scholar has access to about 200 million documents and can scan articles that are behind paywalls, but it searches merely by keywords. By contrast, Semantic Scholar can, for example, assess which citations to a paper are most meaningful, and rank papers by how quickly citations are rising—a measure of how ‘hot’ they are. \nWhen first launched, Semantic Scholar was restricted to 3 million papers in the field of computer science. Thanks in part to a collaboration with AI2’s sister organization, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, the site has now added millions more papers and new filters catering specifically for neurology and medicine; these filters enable searches based, for example, on which part of the brain part of the brain or cell type a paper investigates, which model organisms were studied and what methodologies were used. Next year, AI2 aims to index all of PubMed and expand to all the medical sciences, says chief executive Oren Etzioni. \n“The one I still use the most is Google Scholar,” says Jose Manuel Gómez-Pérez, who works on semantic searching for the software company Expert System in Madrid. “But there is a lot of potential here.” Microsoft’s revival \nSemantic Scholar is not the only AI-based search engine around, however. Computing giant Microsoft quietly released its own AI scholarly search tool, Microsoft Academic , to the public this May, replacing its predecessor, Microsoft Academic Search, which the company stopped adding to in 2012. \nMicrosoft’s academic search algorithms and data are available for researchers through an application programming interface (API) and the Open Academic Society , a partnership between Microsoft Research, AI2 and others. “The more people working on this the better,” says Kuansan Wang, who is in charge of Microsoft's effort. He says that Semantic Scholar is going deeper into natural-language processing—that is, understanding the meaning of full sentences in papers and queries—but that Microsoft’s tool, which is powered by the semantic search capabilities of the firm's web-search engine Bing, covers more ground, with 160 million publications. \nLike Semantic Scholar, Microsoft Academic provides useful (if less extensive) filters, including by author, journal or field of study. And it compiles a leaderboard of most-influential scientists in each subdiscipline. These are the people with the most ‘important’ publications in the field, judged by a recursive algorithm (freely available) that judges papers as important if they are cited by other important papers. The top neuroscientist for the past six months, according to Microsoft Academic, is Clifford Jack of the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota. \nOther scholars say that they are impressed by Microsoft’s effort. The search engine is getting close to combining the advantages of Google Scholar’s massive scope with the more-structured results of subscription bibliometric databases such as Scopus and the Web of Science, says Anne-Wil Harzing, who studies science metrics at Middlesex University, UK, and has analysed the new product . “The Microsoft Academic phoenix is undeniably growing wings,” she says. Microsoft Research says it is working on a personalizable version—where users can sign in so that Microsoft can bring applicable new papers to their attention or notify them of citations to their own work—by early next year. \nOther companies and academic institutions are also developing AI-driven software to delve more deeply into content found online. The Max Planck Institute for Informatics, based in Saarbrücken, Germany, for example, is developing an engine called DeepLife specifically for the health and life sciences. “These are research prototypes rather than sustainable long-term efforts,” says Etzioni. \nIn the long term, AI2 aims to create a system that will answer science questions, propose new experimental designs or throw up useful hypotheses. “In 20 years’ time, AI will be able to read—and more importantly, understand—scientific text,” Etzioni says. \nThis article is reproduced with permission and was first published on November 11, 2016.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Why Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt Is a Fan of Peter Thiel \nEric Schmidt has something he wants to say to Peter Thiel following Donald Trump’s presidential win: Congrats. \nThe chairman of Google-parent Alphabet goog , speaking at the New York Times ‘ annual Dealbook conference, said that he didn’t think it was fair how much backlash venture capitalist Thiel, who supported Trump, received during the presidential election. \n“I am a Peter Thiel fan,” said Schmidt. “I think he is a brilliant entrepreneur. And I like a lot of the things he says.” \nSchmidt’s words are surprising not only because of the backlash that Thiel, one of the few Silicon Valley elite who backed Trump, got, but also because Schmidt was an outspoken support of Hillary Clinton himself. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter Here’s an overview of Schmidt’s most noteworthy comments during the Dealbook session: \nOn Trump winning the presidential election: “I completely congratulate the next president of the United States. Most people did not expect this outcome. And it is a pretty amazing story. My support was for the other side. I was surprised.” \nOn spending time with Julian Assange: “What it told me is that governments are capable of systematic evil. But that requires planning. And if you have a rule that any form of activity is leaked, then the government can’t go too far. The problem with this argument is he appoints himself the judge of that.” \nOn how Trump needs to work with Silicon Valley: The top five most valuable companies in America today are Apple aapl , Google googl , Amazon amzn , Facebook fb , and Microsoft msft . If the all R team is very focused on big business, there are five businesses right there. What do each and everyone of those companies need: high value, highly educated, high quality levels of immigration.” \nOn artificial intelligence and jobs: “Manufacturing is lot safer than it was a few decades ago because machines are doing the dangerous stuff that humans shouldn’t be doing. Repetitive jobs, the jobs we don’t want to do, will be replaced. Our biggest existential threat is nuclear war. I strongly disagree with the line of thinking [that it is artificial intelligence].” \nOn what was learned about email in the election: “I strongly recommend that you don’t use your own private server. And I strongly recommend you use Gmail.” ",

      "text": "Google Wants its Virtual Reality Effort to Focus on Video November 12, 2016 - Written By Jay Decenella \nVirtual reality is fast gaining traction, and Google is not leaving anything on the table. The increasing prominence of virtual reality is evident in the high volume of VR headsets that have been shipped over the last couple of years, with consumers receiving the product positively. That being said, virtual reality remains essentially an emerging technology, which means VR’s full potential has yet to be unlocked. At least that is what Google’s virtual reality boss Clay Bavor believes in. Google’s Daydream View headset has started shipping on November 10 for $79 and the Daydream app went live on the Google Play Store on the same day. However, that is only part of a broader plan to make Android the dominant operating system for VR. \nSpeaking with Recode’s Ina Fried at its Code Mobile conference, Bavor said the headset that Google has just launched serves as a primer for bigger things to come to virtual reality. He said 99.9 percent of what VR can actually do has yet to be discovered. At present, virtual reality headsets have yet to become mainstream. Admitting that virtual reality is still in its early days, Bavor noted that their fundamental goal is to help developers and partners create “great stuff.” He added that the full use of VR only starts to be recognized when there are enough people using the device and enough things to do with it, by which he meant Daydream’s focus on video content creation. The Daydream VR platform will offer video content with YouTube VR, games and the Google Street View service. Google Street View in particular will be an interesting tie-in with Daydream, as it will let users visit popular monuments along with dozens of museums through Google Art and Culture . Google clearly wants Daydream to be compatible with as many phones and headsets as possible, with Android as its primary OS. \nBut that is not to say Google is not likely to face tough competition in the VR race. Before it can make Android the primary OS for virtual reality, the Mountain View giant needs to take on a number of big names in the arena like Facebook’s Oculus and Samsung Gear VR, both of which have been locking horns with each other for quite some time now.

      "text": " Google+\nBob Dougherty/Associated Press/File 1986\nDonald Trump’s proposals would add up to the most significant changes in federal tax codes since the Tax Reform Act of 1986, signed (above) by President Ronald Reagan.\nBy Jon Chesto Globe Staff November 12, 2016\nBusinesses and individual taxpayers have waited a long time for the federal tax system to be overhauled. They might not have to wait much longer, with Republicans in control of Congress and an incoming president who says he can boost the economy by cutting taxes.\nThe nation’s corporate tax rate, one of the highest in the world, is a prime target. If President-elect Donald J. Trump gets his way, personal income taxes — particularly for the wealthiest earners — also would drop, the estate tax would go away, and tax rules might be simplified.\nThose and other provisions would add up to the most significant changes in federal tax codes since the Tax Reform Act of 1986 under President Ronald Reagan. Like Reagan’s reforms — and those carried out under other presidents — they would surely become part of Trump’s legacy.\nAdvertisement\n“The odds of Congress enacting serious tax reform just went up dramatically,” said Jon Traub, managing principal of the Deloitte consulting firm’s tax policy group in Washington.\nTrump is the latest Republican candidate to rise in power on the promise of lower taxes. Both Reagan and George W. Bush pushed cuts through during their first years in office, although a good portion of Bush’s later expired.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here “It’s a massive force of our economy,” said James Angelini, an accounting professor at Suffolk University. “The tax man has his finger in every pie.”\nLowering taxes as a way to grow the economy is, of course, not a novel concept. Historically, it’s a strategy that often has been favored by Republicans. Democrats have argued that such cuts mostly benefit the rich while worsening the budget deficit. Those familiar battle lines probably will be drawn this time, too. But if Wall Street’s initial reaction to Trump’s election is any indication — the Dow Jones industrial average had its best week since 2011 — Congress might be willing to go along with his economic agenda.\nTrump is returning to a playbook championed by his predecessors: Shrink federal spending, the theory goes, and government will be forced to become more efficient. Companies and consumers that don’t have to hand over as much in taxes will instead pour that money into the economy. For major corporations, that means investing in jobs, facilities, and big-ticket equipment purchases.\nAdvertisement\nThat’s the theory, anyway.\nThe reality, as shown through history, isn’t so straightforward. Trump’s aggressive tax cuts, some economic experts say, might drive up the federal deficit or prompt risky reductions in spending on crucial federal programs. The interest rate on a 10-year Treasury note last week rose to its highest level since January, an indication that bond investors fear tax cuts could drive up the deficit and lead to inflation.\nIndeed, Trump’s tax plan could shrink federal revenue by an estimated $4.4 trillion to $5.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. That’s why the Republican leaders in Congress will probably take a more conservative approach. As with tax-cutting presidents before him, Trump probably won’t get everything he wants.\nTo cover some of the anticipated budget shortfall, lawmakers will comb through the federal government’s long list of corporate and consumer deductions, credits, and loopholes, with the goal of excising or reducing some and simplifying a convoluted tax code. Some of the largest deductions are also some of the most popular in Massachusetts: offsets for mortgage interest, charitable donations, and health insurance payments.\n“The problem is we have three large deductions in the code, [and] they tend to be Massachusetts-friendly,” said US Representative Richard Neal, a Democrat from Springfield who sits on the budget-writing House Ways and Means Committee.\nNeal said he expects to begin working on a tax reform package with colleagues over the next several weeks and hopes a tax bill can be signed into law next year.\nCutting corporate taxes might be one of the easier tasks. Leaders in both parties already agree that the 35 percent rate is too high. Lowering it would make US companies more competitive globally and dissuade them from parking income overseas or moving their headquarters.\nTrump favors a 15 percent corporate rate, but Neal says a number in the mid-20s is more realistic. One possible way to help pay for it: taxing the approximately $2 trillion or more in profits that corporations have stashed overseas. Lawmakers have talked about using that money to pay for infrastructure projects. That’s Neal’s preference, but he concedes at least some of the money could be set aside for tax reform.\nTrump says his tax cuts could effectively pay for themselves by prompting a surge in economic activity. “Mr. Trump’s proposals have said we are going to create so many different jobs, and stimulate the economy so much, that’s going to pay for the cuts,” said Mary Burke Baker, government affairs adviser with the K&L Gates law firm in Washington.\nBut many experts remain skeptical. The Tax Foundation, for example, predicts a significant decline in net revenue — at least $2.6 trillion over 10 years, or much more if one key business tax is changed — even after factoring in economic expansion.\nThe think tank also has looked at what Trump’s tax plan would mean for personal income: an approximately 1 percent increase in take-home pay for all filers, while the top 1 percent of earners would gain about 10 percent. Trump would shrink the number of personal income tax brackets from seven to three, with the top earners paying 33 percent, compared with 39.6 percent today.\n“The greatest impact of his proposed legislation would be to reduce the taxes for the top,” said Harry Miller, co-chairman of the tax department at Boston law firm Burns & Levinson.\nWealthy Americans would also benefit from Trump’s push to eliminate the estate tax, which applies to individuals who transfer estates worth more than $5.45 million. “The thinking is that now that we have an entirely Republican House, Senate, and president, the political climate is positioned for a repeal of the estate tax,” said Sarah Connolly, a trust and estates lawyer at Nixon Peabody in Boston.\nSome economists say it will be difficult for Trump to push his tax cuts while increasing spending on infrastructure — without adding to the deficit.\n“It could be a political drug: Initially it makes you feel good, but then there’s a big hangover later,” said Michael Klein, an economics professor at Tufts University’s Fletcher School who served in the Obama administration . “At a very broad level, you have to pay back what you borrow, or if you borrow too much, people are going to be reluctant to lend to you or interest rates are going to have to go up.”\nThen there’s the challenge of getting the reforms through Congress, where all of the existing tax breaks, credits, and deductions have champions. Democrats remain in the minority, but they still have significant clout.\n“Both sides of the aisle agree that we need to do something,” said Roberton Williams, an analyst at the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. “The question is what can we agree on. . . . I don’t think we’re all going to sit down and sing ‘Kumbaya’ around a campfire.”\nJon Chesto can be reached at jon.chesto@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @jonchesto .",

      "title": "Hillary Clinton blames one Comey letter for stopping her momentum",
      "text": " Google+\nAP\nFBI Director James Comey.\nBy Anne Gearan The Washington Post November 12, 2016\nHillary Clinton blamed the renewed FBI inquiry into her State Department email system for blunting her momentum in the presidential election and the closure of that inquiry two days before Election Day for energizing voters for Donald Trump.\n‘‘There are lots of reasons why an election like this is not successful,’’ Clinton told top donors on a farewell conference call Saturday.\nAdvertisement\n‘‘But our analysis is that (FBI Director James B.) Comey’s letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum,’’ she said.\n‘‘We dropped, and we had to keep really pushing ahead to regain our advantage - which going into the last weekend, we had. We were once again up in all but two of the battleground states, and we were up considerably in some that we ended up losing. And we were feeling like we had put it back together,’’ she continued.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here The surprise announcement of a revival of the shuttered FBI inquiry came at a time when the campaign was riding high, Clinton said.\n‘‘After the third debate we felt so good about where we were,’’ she said.\nTrump’s performance in the Oct. 19 debate was widely panned, especially his refusal to say that he would respect the outcome of the election if he lost. Democrats called him a sore loser.\nAdvertisement\n‘‘We were up considerably in all but two of the battleground states where we were tied or one behind, according to our data,’’ Clinton said. ‘‘We were tied in Arizona. We just had a real wind at our back,’’ before the first, stunning letter from Comey.\nClinton’s campaign insisted the reopened inquiry would turn up nothing, and many Democrats accused Comey of partisan motives. He was once a registered Republican. Clinton did not make that accusation Saturday.\nBut Clinton did say that what should have been good news essentially backfired. Comey on Sunday issued another letter to Congress, concluding that the nine-day examination of newly discovered emails had turned up nothing to change his earlier conclusion that there had been no criminal conduct.\n‘‘Just as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would - saying there was no there there - was a real motivator for Trump’s voters,’’ Clinton said.\nA day earlier, Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri had told the same group of donors something similar - that the news angered Trump voters and caused a spike in turnout, while Clinton’s projected turnout fell.\n‘‘Trump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally, and the result is the result,’’ Clinton said.\nThe Democrat focused on the outside events she said affected her campaign in the last three weeks of the election. She said nothing about other, larger forces at work - Trump’s message of change in a restive time, his pledge to represent the aggrieved working class, the difficulty of any political party winning a third consecutive presidential term, her own limited attention to economic anxiety or the sexism and discomfort that surrounded her attempt to become the first female president.\nPalmieri had pointed blame at much of that one day earlier. Neither she nor Clinton herself addressed the fact that Clinton’s decision seven years ago to use a private system for her government communication had opened the door to the FBI inquiry in the midst of her second run for the White House. Clinton has said the decision was a mistake.\n‘‘I am heartbroken,’’ she said Saturday, with a sad laugh. ‘‘I’m not going to pretend otherwise. This is a very, very tough loss and especially because everyone worked so hard.’’",

Sign up for more newsletters here Popovich said Trump used race baiting and fear mongering to try to make President Barack Obama, who was born in the United States, appear to be “illegitimate.”\nOklahoma student suspended amid racist posts after Trump win A student at the University of Oklahoma has been temporarily suspended amid racially charged outbursts at schools and universities across the country following Donald Trump’s presidential election.\nPopovich said, even though disagreed with them politically, he had “great respect” for Republican Trump critics like Arizona Senator John McCain and Ohio Governor John Kasich.\nThe comments, which Popovich gave Friday, were originally published by MySA.com .\nAdvertisement\nPopovich also criticized efforts to move beyond the divisive election.\n“And now we see that he’s already backing off of immigration and Obamacare and other things, so was it a big fake, which makes you feel it’s even more disgusting and cynical that somebody would use that to get the base that fired up,” said Popovich.\nThe Spurs head coach appeared to be referring to reports that Trump was possibly walking back some of his campaign statements, including eliminating Obama’s health care law.\n“He is in charge of our country,” Popovich said of Trump. “That’s disgusting.”\nPopovich wasn’t alone among NBA coaches who decried the rhetoric of some Trump supporters and the billionaire Republican’s election day success.\nGolden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters earlier this week that he and his team were stunned by the outcome.\n“I don’t know what else to say. Just the whole process has left all of us feeling kind of disgusted and disappointed. I thought we were better than this,” Kerr said, according to a local CBS affiliate.\nDetroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy went off on a six-minute diatribe against Trump Wednesday, according to the Detroit Free Press .\n“I don’t think anybody can deny this guy is openly and brazenly racist and misogynistic,” Van Gundy said. “We have just thrown a good part of our population under the bus, and I have problems with thinking this is where we are as a country.”\nJohn Hilliard can be reached at john.hilliard@globe.com",

Moments later, Nigel Farage, the head of the ‘‘Leave’’ movement that propelled the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, also arrived and was allowed up.\nTrump frequently links his campaign to the ‘‘Brexit’’ movement. Farage would not say if he was playing a role in Trump’s transition.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

Police lined both sides, following along on foot and on motorcycle, but the group remained peaceful.\nAdvertisement\nEarlier in the day, hundreds of people including families with small children chanted ‘‘No hate. No fear. Immigrants are welcome here’’ as they marched through Millennium Park, a popular downtown tourist attraction.\nLater in the morning, protesters posted video from the scene to Twitter.\n\"Not my president\", \"Racist, sexist, fascist\", \"We reject the president-elect\", encore un #protest contre #Trump � New York! #notmypresident pic.twitter.com/xBt6dIYaJB\n— Miettes de Voyage (@MiettesdeVoyage) November 12, 2016 Twenty-nine-year-old yoga teacher Sonja Spray says she heard about the Saturday morning demonstration on Facebook and decided to join the protest over the election of Donald Trump. She carried a sign reading, ‘‘WOMEN are NO JOKE.’’\nSpray, who voted for Hillary Clinton in both the primary and general elections, says she has signed an online petition urging the Electoral College to elect Clinton.\nShe says she’s concerned Trump’s election condones a view that women are ‘‘playthings’’ and his presidency will threaten civil rights and gay marriage. She says she’s ‘‘part of the reminder that we still have a say in our own country.’’\nAbout 200 people have been arrested in Los Angeles after a mainly peaceful protest over the election of Donald Trump as president.\nPolice say about 3,000 people took to the streets Friday night, winding up near City Hall after several hours of marching. Some waved American flags or carried signs reading ‘‘Not My President.’’\nPolice began breaking up the protest at around 2 a.m. Saturday and arrested people for failure to disperse.\nPolice tell City News Service that three juveniles were arrested during the march for throwing a bottle at a police officer, vandalizing a police cruiser and curfew violation.\nThousands are expected to join protests throughout the weekend in L.A., San Francisco, Las Vegas and overseas.\nIn Los Angeles, marchers took to the streets against Trump Saturday morning and broadcast their progress on social media.\nHuge protest...thousands marching down Wilshire. @CBSLA #CBSLA pic.twitter.com/8UsrmCC5XE\n— Greg Mills (@GregMillsTVNews) November 12, 2016 In Germany, about 300 people protested Donald Trump’s election as the next American president outside the U.S. Embassy by the German capital’s landmark Brandenburg Gate.\nThe peaceful protesters Saturday waved signs with slogans like ‘‘Love Trumps Hate’’ and ‘‘Make Love, Not Trump.’’\nAhead of national elections in Germany next year, the anti-immigrant nationalist Alternative For Germany party, known as AfD, has been gaining support. One protester’s sign read ‘‘Germany: Don’t make the same mistake in 2017, AfD=Trump.’’\nAfD co-leader Frauke Petry applauded Trump’s election, saying Friday it offered ‘‘a historic opportunity to address erroneous global economic and social developments of the past decades.’’\nPresident Barack Obama meets in Berlin next week with Chancellor Angela Merkel and several other European leaders, and is expected to confront global concerns about Trump’s election.\nProtesters also marched in Chicago, according to social media posts.\nChants at Chicago protest pic.twitter.com/Qodzvr8yeS\n— Matt Joseph (@mistermattchi) November 12, 2016 Locally, protests were reported in Boston and Worcester during the day Saturday.\nAnti-Trump protesters on Boston Common.

      "title": "Trump holes up in tower as transition takes shape",
      "text": " Google+\nREUTERS\nU.S. secret service agents stand guard outside Republican president-elect Donald Trump&apos;s Trump Tower in New York Saturday.\nBy Julie Pace and Jonathan Lemire Associated Press November 12, 2016\nNEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump is embarking on the massive undertaking of creating a new administration as a circus-like atmosphere unfolds around his building in Manhattan.\nWhile he’s announced one decision — putting Vice President-elect Mike Pence in charge of the transition instead of Chris Christie — Trump must identify other people for top White House jobs and Cabinet posts. He was apparently trying to sort through names as he holed himself up in Trump Tower and protesters swarmed outside behind barricades protecting the building and ritzy stores along Fifth Avenue.\nAdvertisement\nAt one point, documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, a liberal critic of Trump who nevertheless had predicted his victory, entered the tower lobby with a camera crew in tow and asked to see Trump. ‘‘I just thought I’d see if I could get into Trump Tower and ride the famous escalator, said Moore, who did just that until he reached the fourth floor and the Secret Service told him he could go no higher.\nMoments later, Nigel Farage, the head of the ‘‘Leave’’ movement that won Britain’s vote to exit European Union, also arrived and was allowed up.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Trump frequently links his campaign to the ‘‘Brexit’’ movement. Farage would not say if he was playing a role in Trump’s transition.\nView Story Trump team is hedging on some pledges President-elect Donald Trump and key advisers in recent days have backed away from some of the most sweeping campaign pledges.\nFor Trump, who ran on a pledge to ‘‘drain the swamp’’ of Washington insiders, the transition team is strikingly heavy on those with long political resumes.\nAnother apparent contradiction emerged Friday as Trump, who repeatedly vowed to achieve the repeal of President Barack Obama’s health care law, said he would be open to maintaining portions of it.\nAdvertisement\nChristie was a loyal adviser to Trump for much of the campaign, offered a key early endorsement and came close to being the businessman’s pick for running mate. But Trump ultimately went with Pence, Indiana’s governor and a former congressman with Washington experience and deep ties to conservatives, to take the transition forward.\nChristie will still be involved in the transition, joining a cluster of other steadfast Trump supporters serving as vice chairmen: former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions.\nIn addition, three of Trump’s adult children — Don Jr., Eric and Ivanka — are on the transition executive committee, along with Jared Kushner, Ivanka’s husband. Kushner was an influential adviser in Trump’s campaign.\nThe children’s inclusion raised questions Trump’s ability to sever ties between the administration and the sprawling family business — after the billionaire repeatedly said during the campaign that his grown children would not follow him to Washington and instead run the Trump Organization.\nTrump told The Wall Street Journal that after speaking with Obama at the White House, he was considering keeping the provision of the health law that allows children to stay on their parents’ insurance policies until they turn 26. He said previously he may also keep the prohibition against insurers denying coverage because of patients’ existing conditions.\nPresidents-elect don’t often appoint their running mates to lead their transition team. Trump and Christie grew apart through the last stretch of the campaign.\nAmong the first decisions facing the president-elect is whom to choose as chief of staff, a key post that will set the tone for Trump’s White House and be a main conduit to Capitol Hill and Cabinet agencies.\nTrump is said to be considering Steve Bannon, his campaign chairman and a conservative media executive, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus for the job. Neither has significant policy experience, though Priebus is well-liked in Washington and has ties with lawmakers.\nKellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager, is also said to be in the mix for a senior job. Conway is a veteran Republican pollster who formed a strong rapport with the candidate after taking the helm of his campaign in the general election.\nGiuliani, who emerged as Trump’s frequent travel partner and close aide, is on the short list for several positions, including attorney general.\n___\nLemire reported from New York.

      "text": "Google Slams Proprietary Fast Charging on Android Devices Google Slams Proprietary Fast Charging on Android Devices 10 Comments Google is discouraging phone makers from using third-party fast charging solutions like Qualcomm Quick Charge. \nA recent update to Google's Android documentation attempts to discourage handset makers from using proprietary charging methods like Qualcomm's Quick Charge . \nInstead, Google \"strongly recommends\" that, alongside the increasingly common Type-C standard, manufacturers adopt USB Power Delivery—which Google implemented in its recent Nexus and Pixel devices for fast charging. \n\"Type-C devices are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not support proprietary charging methods that modify Vbus voltage beyond default levels, or alter sink/source roles as such may result in interoperability issues with the chargers or devices that support the standard USB Power Delivery methods,\" the Android doc explains. \nFor now, this is voluntary, but \"in future Android versions we might REQUIRE all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers,\" according to the document. \nThis is not the first time Google has addressed this issue. Google engineer Benson Leung , a USB evangelist of sorts, first discussed his concerns in a late November 2015 blog post about whether Qualcomm QC and USB Type-C can coexist on the same connector. In a nutshell, he said, \"Type-C Spec forbids it.\" // Related Articles Oppo Wows With Fast-Charging Super VOOC, Image Stabilization Tech \nAs Android Authority outlined earlier this year , the USB Type-C specification requires that a port's Vbus line sits between 4.45 and 5.25 volts. Qualcomm Quick Charge, however pushes that to 9 or 12 volts. \nIn April, Qualcomm said \"Quick Charge is designed to be connector-independent. It can be implemented in a device that supports a variety of connectors, including USB Type-A, USB micro, USB Type-C, and others. \nAt least two flagship smartphones, the HTC 10 and LG G5 , include Quick Charge and USB-C.

      "text": "\nIt's time to start thinking of presents for the loved ones in your life. Google Play won't be much help for it, though.\nGoogle Play has been around for a few years, and while it's caught up to iTunes and the App Store in several areas, there's one feature that is noticeably, and sometimes painfully absent. Ever find an app you want to buy a friend? Want to send an album to a special someone? Welp, you'll just have to send them Google Play credit and hope that's what they use it on. While iTunes has had content gifting for well over a decade, Google Play still won't let me buy someone a song.\n\nWe already have so much of the groundwork laid for gifting content, too. The Redeem function already accepts 16-digit codes for digital copies of films and for app codes that developers give out. Allowing the gifting of content on Google Play means that families can gift desired content to their kids rather than having a payment option enabled on the account — or shelling out for gift cards every few weeks/months, like I did as a kid. It allows for more personal gifting than a $10 gift card.\nAllowing gifting of content could also help breathe life into a Google Play feature that's all but forgotten in its current form: the Wishlist . You can't share your Wishlist and no one can buy you anything off it, which basically relegates it to a 'waiting for a sale/project' list. Allowing people to see your Wishlist and buy you apps from it encourages users to make lists and buy off them.\nGift-giving is a mutli-billion business, and gift cards aren't enough. I'd love to buy Nova Launcher Prime for a few non-believers, or buy The Little Mermaid for a friend that wasn't lucky enough to see it as a kid. But I can't. And that's a shame for Google, too, because that's money it's missing out on.\n",

      "text": "Facebook and Google Are Spreading Way Too Many Lies Kevin Drum Nov. 13, 2016 2:34 PM Email \nWas the presidential election this year a close call? Of course not! \nKellyanne Conway, a key adviser to Donald Trump’s transistion team, says the general election “was not close” and the president-elect has a “mandate” to carry out the will of the people on issues ranging from Obamacare to national security. “This election was not close. It was not a squeaker,” Mrs. Conway said on “Fox News Sunday.”“There is a mandate there, and there is a mandate for his 100-day agenda, as well.” \nReally? It sure seemed close to me. So close, in fact, that Donald Trump actually lost the popular vote. Let's google \"2016 popular vote\" to find out: \nIt looks like Facebook isn't the only one with a fake news problem. Surely one of the top three results on Google News shouldn't be a nutbar blog dedicated to spreading false information about Hillary Clinton? How about giving a little higher weighting to actual news sources so this kind of stuff doesn't happen? \nTrump's team is dedicated to telling us that the election was a landslide, and there are plenty of doofus sites out there who are happy to spread whatever lies will help that along. There's nothing that will stop that from happening, but at least big players like Facebook and Google should try not to help them along. Get the scoop, straight from Mother Jones.",

      "text": "\nHow many of you use Google Play Newsstand? This app tends to be ignored, mostly because it is not one of those usually pre-installed applications, but it is a very convenient way to consume news and magazine content. The app hasn’t changed much in a while, but it seems that’s because they were buttering up a significant upgrade, which is now rolling out.\nWhat’s new in update version 4.0? The changes are mostly in the design. The app looks different and sections are organized somewhat differently, so it will definitely require some getting used to. Let’s take a look at some of the changes.\nFor starters, the new center of attention is turned to the “briefing” section, which pretty much shows the most popular news stories around. Think of it as a news hub.\n4 new main sections have been placed at the bottom of the screen. These are labeled “For you”, “Library”, “Explore” and “Read Later”. Then you can access each of these sections to consume content in different manners.\nThe search bar has also been updated to look and work like the now-standard Google search bar you see everywhere. It covers the whole top of the screen, while offering suggestions, a menu section, voice commands and more.\nExtra features and menus have also been included to the settings. Overall, it feels like a good direction to take. The interface looks modern, sleek and is very interactive. Would you like to see this design language coming to other apps?\nDownload Google Play Newsstand now ",

      "text": "How Google changed itself for India in a mission to connect the world Sunny Sen, Hindustan Times, New Delhi | Updated: Nov 14, 2016 08:30 IST Rajan Anandan, Google’s vice-president and managing director for Southeast Asia and India. (Mint file photo) \nAlphabet Inc’s Google is ready to spend billions to get millions of Indians online– through a slew of India-specific products and initiatives – to stay relevant in the world’s fastest-growing internet economy. \nWith 350-million internet users, India has already surpassed the US, and the number is expected to double by 2020. Around 15,000 new Indians log onto the internet every day, fitting perfectly in Google’s scheme of the “next billion internet users” gambit to acquire new customers. \nBut this wasn’t the case three years ago, not until smartphones burgeoned and a large number of people started accessing the Net through their phones. \nAll that makes India more important for Google, especially after China, which has the maximum number of internet users globally, closed its doors the American internet firm. \n“There are very few countries in the world where there are a billion people... If you have a mission to connect the world, you have to go where the people are,” says Rajan Anandan, Google’s vice-president and managing director for Southeast Asia and India. \nVery few know that Anandan was born in Sri Lanka, and is the son of Guinness World Records holder (in swimming) VS Kumar Anandan, who died while crossing the English Channel on August 6, 1984. \nAnandan knows India well. He was responsible for building Microsoft’s internet and cloud business in the country before joining Google. \nIndia is different from every other country Google operates in – it has different languages, a large non-English speaking population, low-income groups, patchy mobile network and a diverse culture. \nAnandan decided to take up one problem at a time. “We identified the barriers and systematically went after each one of them,” he says. \nIn villages, only one out of every 10 women uses the internet. Also, only 35% of internet users in India are women. \nSo Anandan launched “Internet Saathi”, a programme to train women in 300,000 villages –almost half of India’s total number of villages – on how to use the internet to improve their lives, in partnership with Tata Trusts. \nGoogle has 9,000 women Saathis (friends), who have already trained a million women, who now use the internet to see weather forecasts, agri-product prices, farm practices, and news about healthcare and child education. \nAccess was another hurdle, Internet being a novelty still for most. So Google introduced Railtel -- an initiative to provide free Wifi at 400 railway stations by 2020. The programme has already been implemented in 53 stations, and already 3.5-million people have used the network. \nThe search giant then launched Station, wifi for any venue – bus station, hotel, or café– as long as the place has wired internet connectivity. Google will provide the wifi equipment, and work out a shared-revenue model. \nBut the masterstroke was probably its adoption of the Hindi language. The recent advertisements, in Hindi, based on the lives of middle-class Indians and their requirements are a huge change from what the Google did a couple of years ago. \nOne ad shows a 50-year-old lady talking to her phone in Hindi, to search the internet. “The biggest problem was language search,” says Anandan. \nTwo years ago, the Hindi keyboard on Android didn’t work properly. Anandan had to fix the problem; after all, only 200 users could use the internet in English. The result: Now the Google keyboard has 11 languages. \nSo now, even Google Assistant, the artificial intelligence software that can take voice commands, is available in Hindi. It will soon come integrated with the Allo instant messaging app. The Assistant is being trained, like humans, to understand and respond to queries raised in Hindi. \n“It is important for them to localise, else they will lose to local competition, especially since Facebook is right there… They cannot win in India without their operating system supporting Indian languages,” says Neil Shah, research director at Honk Kong-headquartered Counterpoint Research. \nBut Google did not stop at localising. Anandan realised that networks were patchy, people didn’t spend much on browsing, and smartphones did not have enough space for apps. So he re-engineered some apps to make them work offline. For example, Youtube allows you to download videos in wifi networks and watch those unlimited times; maps can be accessed without the web; you can bookmark your entire search on the Chrome browser, and even take them taken offline to browse. \nThere is also Search Lite, which detects the quality of network, adjusts the size of the pages, and removes pictures and videos if needed. There is also Youtube Go, a separate app that works offline. Google also re-engineered the apps to make them smaller, since cheaper smartphones usually don’t have much storage. “It is driven by these needs… These are emerging market products,” says Anandan. \nBut there’s also a flipside to all these. \nIndia does not have privacy regulations, which makes it a great testing ground for products. Companies can collect tons of data and target ads – incidentally, Google’s main business. \n“While Google has done some good stuff, its main interest is to collect data,” says Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO and chief analyst of Greyhound Research. “Earlier, they were reading your emails, now they have started seeing where you go (Maps). With Google Home, the microphone is always on, they can even listen you all the time.” \nOthers, too, echo Gogia’s thoughts. \n“The lack of a policy is helpful (to collect data) but mobile adoption has helped it more,” says Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst at Silicon Valley-based advisory firm Constellation Research. \nMeanwhile, Anandan has set himself an ambitious goal – to get 20-million small and medium businesses online. Three years ago, only 100,000 businesses in India had web presence in some form or the other. “There is no point getting one or two million businesses online... In 10 minutes you can have a web presence. It is completely free, and there is no hosting cost unlike a website,” he says. \nAll this requires a lot of money. \n“It does… We are not focussed on the near term, but 10 years from now India is going to be massive… What we are doing has nothing to do with advertising revenue… But eventually, of course… so that is why it is not a one or two-year thing,” says Anandan as he signs off.

      "text": "87 \nThe Pixel is Google’s first phone, and it ended up as not just the best Android device ever made, but the best smartphone currently on the market (and that includes the iPhone). It’s not a perfect device – the design is not a head-turner, and it lacks water resistance – however most key areas impress and outperform the competition. \nThe camera is the Pixel’s best feature . It’s extremely fast to focus and capture, it produces outstanding images in all conditions, and it packs unique features like jaw-dropping 4K video stabilization. When you buy the Pixel, you can boast to your mates how you have the best smartphone camera you can currently get. \nOther aspects of the Pixel are equally impressive. The Snapdragon 821 SoC doesn’t crush benchmarks, but when combined with optimized software you’re left with a snappy experience that’s noticeably faster than its Android competitors. The display is vibrant in its standard mode and accurate in its sRGB mode, plus you get crisp 1440p on the Pixel XL. And battery life is very good overall, with fast charging an added bonus. \nThe Pixel includes the latest version of Android, unmodified, with Google’s promise to provide quick updates and security patches. It includes Google Assistant, which is surprisingly good and not available on other Android phones (for now), plus support for Google’s excellent Daydream VR platform. \nWe recommend the Pixel XL, the 5.5-inch variant, purely because of the extra screen real estate and slightly better battery life. Its smaller brother, the 5.0-inch Pixel, includes basically the same set of hardware and is also worth considering. The main downside? You’ll have to fork out a lot of money to get the best phone on the market, as Google has priced the Pixel to match the iPhone. Also a Fantastic Option \nRated the best smartphone of the first half of 2016, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge remains a fantastic piece of hardware. It’s a bit cheaper than the Pixel phones ( $600 ), and the design is waterproof and far more attractive. You’re still getting excellent performance, battery life, and camera, but Samsung’s TouchWiz skin lacks the quality of stock Android. It also doesn’t explode, unlike the arguably better but now discontinued Galaxy Note 7. Best from Apple",

      "text": "Guys might rib women for bringing their girlfriends with them to the bathroom (\"Why do two of you have to go??\"), but as many of us know, there&apos;s a certain kind of female solidarity that exists only in the ladies room. You bring your friend with you for a pep talk when her ex and his new girlfriend show up at the bar. You tell coworkers how much you love their new shoes at the sink. It&apos;s a place, where, in desperation, you can ask a perfect stranger for a tampon (and receive one!). On bad days, it&apos;s a space to just take a deep breath before going back out to an anxiety-inducing situation—or a private spot to shed a tear or two. And employees Google &apos;s San Francisco offices late last week were capitalizing on the idea of this specific space for solidarity in a really unique way.\nOn Friday, Post-It notes that encouraged women to support each other appeared on the bathroom mirrors of women&apos;s restrooms on the office campus. No one knows who started it, but the messages are affirming, uplifting and supportive: \"Be brave. You got this.\" \"I&apos;m with you.\" \"Use your voice. It matters.\" \"Be your best self today.\" \"Everything about you is beautiful.\" Another note invites women to contribute: \"Please leave a note. This is a safe space.\"\nLoading View on Instagram\nLoading View on Instagram\nLoading View on Instagram\nLoading View on Instagram\nLoading View on Instagram\nLoading View on Instagram\nThe messages obviously come in the wake of the elections (many Instagram posts are captioned with pro-Hillary sentiments), but these little pep talks can make a huge impact on someone—election or no. (After all, how many of us have our own little Post-It mantras on our mirrors at home?) We love that Google&apos;s women are choosing to support and empower each other—and if this is just so happens to become a thing in offices, well, we wouldn&apos;t hate it.",

      "title": "Frederick Banting: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know | Heavy.com",
      "text": "Share Tweet Follow (Google) \nNovember 14 marks World Diabetes Day because it is also the birth date of Canadian scientist Sir Frederick Banting, who is the subject of today’s Google Doodle. He was the first to use insulin on humans to treat diabetes. He was awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in Medicine with John James Richard Macleod and is still the youngest recipient of the award in his field. \nBanting was also a painter and military veteran, serving in World War I. He was knighted by King George V in 1934 and died in 1941 at age 49. Banting was married twice, to Marion Robertson from 1924 to 1932 and to Henreitta Ball from 1937 until his death. He had a son, William, with Robertson, in 1928. \nHere is a look at Banting’s life and career. 1. At Age 32, Banting Became the Youngest Nobel Prize Winner in Medicine Frederick Banting. (Getty) \nWhen Banting won the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , he was only 32 years old. Banting shared his portion of the award money with his colleague, Dr. Charles H. Best. However, the Nobel committee decided to also honor John James Richard Macleod. \nA few years before receiving the award, Banting became interested in diabetes and read papers by other scientists on the subject. They theorized that diabetes was caused by the lack of a particular protein hormone secreted by the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Sir Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer dubbed this protein “insulin,” and it was believed that insulin controls sugar metabolism. To treat diabetes, scientists had to figure out how to provide insulin from the pancreas without it being destroyed first. \nWhile Banting was trying to solve this problem, he read another paper by Moses Baron from 1920. Baron wrote about closing the pancreatic duct by ligature, which would leave the islets of Langerhans intact and destroy trypsin-secreting cells , while not destroying the insulin. Insulin could then be extracted from the islets of Langerhans. \nMacleod provided Best and Banting the facilities for their research, although Banting didn’t think Macleod’s contribution was enough to warrant him being cited by the Nobel Committee. Macleod split his part of the prize money with James Collip, a biochemist who also worked with Bunting. \nInitially, Bunting and Best extracted insulin from living dogs, but Banding realized in 1921 that you could get insulin from the fetal pancreas. He then decided to use the pancreases from fetal calves and found that the insulin extracted from them was just as potent. 2. Banting Also Had an Interest in Painting & Was Friends With Members of Canada’s Group of Seven \nWhile working in London, Ontario, Bunting developed an interest in painting. He became friends with A.Y. Jackson and Lawren Harris, two members of the famed Group of Seven , a collection of Canadian artists who painted the country’s landscape. Many of Banting’s early works were done on pieces of cardboard his shirts came on from the dry cleaners. \nMany of Banting’s works are on display throughout Canada. \nBanting began painting in 1920 and used his hobby as an escape from being a famous doctor. He had hoped to retire from medicine at age 50 and become a painter full-time, but his life was cut short in 1941 at age 49. \nTwo years after his death, his work was put on display at Hart House, University of Toronto. The Art Gallery of Ontario, Queen’s University, and the Art Gallery of Alberta also hosted retrospectives of his work. As The Globe and Mail notes , one of his paintings sold for CAN$76,000 in 2008. 3. Banting Was a War Hero, Earning the Military Cross for Saving Men Even After Being Injured \nBanting was also a war hero for his actions in World War I, notes the Canadian Diabetes Association . He first tried to enlist a day after war was declared on Germany in August 1914, but he was denied because of his poor eyesight. The following year, he was allowed to enlist as a member of the Canadian Army Medical Service as he finished his medical studies. \nDuring the war, he first served in England and then in Paris. He later received the Military Cross for his heroic actions on September 28, 1918. On that day, his right arm was seriously injured, but he sacrificed himself to save the lives of other men. It’s been said that he spent 17 hours dressing the wounds of other men, ignoring his own. 4. After His Work on Insulin, Banting Became Interested in Aviation Medicine & Worked With the RCAF \nAlthough Banting is best known for his work with insulin, he also had an interest in aviation medicine and how being at high-altitude affected pilots. He began working with the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1938 and, during the early days of World War II, looked into the blackouts experienced by pilots. \nAs the Canadian Space Agency notes , Banting predicted that a second World War was coming and believed that aviation would play a major role. He worked tirelessly to make sure pilots could fly at high altitudes during the war to give them an advantage over Germany. \n“He realized the inevitability of war,” a 1946 article in the Journal of the Canadian Medical Services read. “Without delay, he…called upon his staff of brilliant research scientists to familiarize themselves with some problems in the field of war aviation medicine. Thus, in the event of hostilities, Canadian scientists would not be caught napping but would be prepared to come immediately to the aid of their country.” 5. Banting Died From Injuries Sustained in a Plane Crash in Newfoundland Best and Banting with one of the first diabetic dogs to receive insulin. (Getty) \nThe research into aviation Banting was working on at the start of World War II came to a sudden halt in February 1941. He was injured during a plane crash in Newfoundland that instantly killed the navigator and co-pilot. Banting and the pilot survived the crash, but Banting died the day after the crash. He was on his way to England to test flight suits. \nSince Banting’s death, his contribution to science and medicine has not been forgotten, especially in Canada. His alma mater, the University of Toronto, is home to the Banting & Best Crentre for Innovation & Entrepreneurship . He’s also a member of the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame and has a crater on the moon named after him. There are also several schools and programs named after him throughout Canada. \nIn 1989, Queen Elizabeth II visited London, Ontario to light the Flame of Hope at the Banting House and Sir Frederick G. Banting Square . It’s a flame that will keep burning until a cure for diabetes is found. There is also a life-size statue of Banting at Banting Square. ",

      "text": "Reddit \nGoogle has announced a big update to Google Play Music. The update brings machine learning to the table in an effort to figure out what music you like based on what you are doing. The machine learning algorithm takes into account your location, activity, weather and playlists to personalize the music for where you are and what you are doing. The new updates roll out this week on Android, iOS, and the web. \nThe rollout will be global with 62 countries eventually getting the new music features. The update also brings improved music recommendations with contextual tools available that power other Google products. These features are opt-in and those that sign up will get personalized music for where you are and why you are listening. That means if you are relaxing at home, you will get an optimized playlist and if you are at work you will get a playlist customized for that location. \nThe update also makes it easier to get motivational music for your workout at the gym. Play Music has a new home screen that puts your favorite music at the top of the screen. Google says the more the new machine learning algorithms get to know you, the better the music selections will be. The updated app also keeps a playlist for offline listening ready to go. The tunes you listened to recently are packed into an offline playlist ready to go when you lose signal. \nGoogle says that it wants the perfect music to find you with this update. The exact time frame for the rollout of the new features is unknown. The rollout is starting this week, but Google isn’t clear on if the rollout is going on with all 62 countries at the same time.",

      "text": "Hoping to beat rivals, Google Play Music starts using your location & activity to recommend tunes Posted Survive on Mars in VR on HTC Vive and PSVR starting November 15 \nGoogle today announced the launch of a new version of its Google Play Music service, in an effort to better compete with rivals like Spotify and Apple Music in terms of personalization. Like the other top streaming services, Google Play Music will now cater to its audience’s unique tastes and interests in order to suggest songs you want to hear, as well as match you with the right music for your mood or current activity. \nHow Google goes about doing this, however, differs from its competition. \nPersonalized music is something Spotify has already mastered through its well-liked Discovery Weekly playlist, and its newer Daily Mix , which combines music you like with Spotify’s suggestions. The latter was launched in response to Apple Music’s own My Favorites Mix, a playlist that mixes favorite tracks with other tunes you might like, too. \nAs all the services all try to one-up each other with their own takes on how suggestions should work, Google has tapped into machine learning and its (sometimes creepy) ability to know exactly what you’re doing, where and when. \nThe company explains that it will figure out what sort of music you like based on your behavior – much like the others do today. That generally means it takes into account things like what you’re listening to, which artists you listen to more than others, and other learnings from watching how you use the service. But Google says it will also mix in signals like location, activity and the weather to offer hand-picked playlists to personalize music for “wherever you are.” \nFor example, the service may know if you’re at home, at work, flying, exploring a new city, entering the gym to start your workout, and more. \nGoogle hopes that suggesting the right music at the right time will make the service seem smarter and more useful, but it will also highlight just how much Google is tracking you as you move about your world. It’s unclear if or how users will be able to disable this feature, or if in the race to offer the next level of personalization, they have to be willing to share this kind of data with their music provider. \nRemember that this music provider is Google , a company that has been working to increase its stockpiles of data on its users – most recently, by a privacy policy change that allows it to combine your personal info collected by Google services with DoubleClick cookie information for increasingly targeted, highly personalized ads. \nIn addition to the above changes, Google Music is also getting a revamp which includes a new home screen where these suggested playlists will appear. Here, you may find recommendations from your recents, new releases, music for fans of your favorite artist, and the suggested playlists Google is recommending based on what you’re doing. Which items appear and when will be based on Google’s understanding of your behavior, location, and other factors. \nFor instance, if you tend to always launch a certain playlist after work, it will soon start appearing at that time here on this screen. If you’re about to hop on a plane, a playlist of music for flying might pop up instead. \nThe new version of Google Play Music is coming to Android, iOS and the web starting this week, and will roll out globally to 62 countries. 0",

      "text": "Share this Story Google Play Music Gets a Big Update With New Home Screen, Smarter Recommendations \nGoogle announced a major update to Google Play Music this morning, one that will show you smarter and timelier recommendations with a new home screen layout and always-available offline playback. This is a big one, and it starts arriving today. \nUp front, when you open the new app after updating, Google is showing you a new layout that they are calling the “ultimate personal DJ.” That means bigger cards of playlists and stations of “what you like, but also when you like it.” The images above give you a good feel for how this will look, including a “Recents” button, that we’re assuming gets you into recently played tracks. The update isn’t live yet, but my gut tells me that there is more to this new interface than just a fancy new home screen. \nOutside of the UI changes, Google is applying its machine learning secrets to music now. Those secrets should get you proper music and mixes based on location, activity, and even the weather, according to Google. This is an opt-in feature, so none of it will happen out of the box. Should you opt-in, your musical choices could change at work, while flying, when in new cities, or as you hit the gym. \nFinally, a new offline playlist will be automatically stored for you, of songs that you listened to recently (probably that “Recents” button). Assuming you charge your phone regularly, songs will be stored and available even if you lose a data connection. \nGoogle says the update arrives today, but we aren’t seeing it quite yet. Let us know if you do!",

      "title": "Huawei pulled out of the running for Google’s latest products due to branding conflicts",
      "text": "Andrew Myrick Nov 14th, 2016 \nBefore the release of the Nexus 6P , Huawei was far from a household name with the company only being well known in certain parts of the world. However, Huawei wanted to expand its horizons and look to make a statement in the US market. A partnership with Google would allow that to happen, and after the agreements were taken care, Huawei began producing the 2015 Nexus flagship. \nGoogle has never gone with the same manufacturer for back to back Nexus devices, so it was extremely unlikely that Huawei would take over the reigns of the 2016 Nexus devices. However, it was revealed that Google was going to sign Huawei up for the 2016 Nexus devices until Huawei backed out of the deal, leaving Google to pursue the Pixel and Pixel XL . \nNow, it seems we know the real reason why Google backed out of the deal. According to a report from WinFuture.de , Huawei wanted to receive brand recognition as the Nexus 6P featured both the Nexus and Huawei logos. Since Google wanted to go a different route and was looking for a contractor, Huawei pulled the plug on the project and left Google hanging. \nDespite Huawei pulling out of the competition, the company continued to use the original design of the Nexus 6P for some of its devices in 2016 as we saw with the Huawei Nova and Nova Plus . There have still been some rumblings that Huawei would be tapped to manufacture Google’s newest tablet , which would be a welcome addition to the tablet market. \nUnfortunately, the new Nexus tablet has yet to be unveiled, but we’re still holding out hope. In the meantime, we’ll ask you what you think about this revelation? Would you have preferred to see the Pixel and Pixel XL manufactured by Huawei, or are you content with HTC winning the contract?",

      "text": "Quentyn Kennemer Nov 14th, 2016 \nGoogle today announced some significant changes to the Google Play Music app. The changes are all about making sure you’re finding the best music for any situation, mood, or location. \nGoogle says they’re putting their machine learning efforts to task by using their vast knowledge base to figure out what you want to listen to. The company will offer up playlist and track suggestions based on your environment, so if you’re going to the gym it’ll show you some workout tunes, while a night life playlist could be loaded up if you’re going out for a night on the town. Google says there are many factors which can be used to determine the playlists to show you, including weather. \nAll of it is served up on a brand new homescreen that’ll make it easy to start playing those playlists with just a couple of taps. Beyond all this, Google has also added a dynamic offline listening experience that will automatically cache recently played tracks for offline viewing, so you’ll have some of your favorite tunes available offline even if you forget to download them before heading into a dead zone. \nGoogle says the rollout will begin at some point this week, with all 62 of the current Google Play Music markets being hooked up at the same time. Be on the lookout at Google Play and on the web .",

      "text": "Instead of choosing the tight line to turn around, Google's car takes a wider arc that's more natural to humans. Photo by Google \nEvery month, Google releases a report on its self-driving cars and gives us some insight into how the learning process works. This month , it's talking about three-point turns. \nThree-point turns are an art, especially in tight spaces that may turn three points into seven or eight. Google's autonomous tech can best humans in this regard, thanks to its 360-degree vision and constant calculation. The cars were taught to recognize everything from parked cars to trash bins when making three-point turns. Google claims its cars practice about 1,000 turns of this nature every week. \nSince a computer might calculate that the most efficient turn is some weird menagerie of adjustments, Google also programmed its cars to try and mimic the natural feeling of how a human might execute a similar turn. As a result, the cars prefer wider arcs with more forward motion, which may be slower, but is more comfortable for passengers. \nGoogle currently operates 24 Lexus RX crossovers and 34 of its own gumdrop-style cars across four states -- Washington, California, Arizona and Texas. To date, the cars have driven 2.2 million miles in autonomous mode, averaging about 25,000 miles per week. \nGoogle also uses its monthly report to chart collisions. This past month, there was one. While at a stop sign, yielding to traffic, one of Google's gumdrop cars was rear-ended by a human driver at a net velocity of 3 miles per hour. The gumdrop had a bit of damage on the hatch, but everything was fine otherwise.",

      "text": "— Michael (@Koxinga8) November 12, 2016 Michael, on the other hand, is sourcing an article from the ultra-conservative tabloid USA Supreme , which argues that Clinton might win the number of votes “counted” but will not win the number of votes “cast” because of ignored Republican absentee ballots. (Michael also believes that Trump has been singled out by God to be president of the United States , a conspiracy theory popular with 4chan users who believe that Pepe the Frog is a reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian deity.) And yet Michael — by way of 70 News , by way of Google — has become the sole source for a story squatting at the top of Google’s search results. 70 News has since updated its post with a single line admitting that CNN is showing different numbers — the headline and the body of the post remains the same. This is not the first time misleading articles have appeared inside Google’s News box. In 2014, the search engine began pulling news from all over the internet, inside of just Google-approved publications. This is why popular Reddit posts also show up in Google News from time to time . Some combination of SEO , timing, and traffic seems to play a role in Google’s search algorithm, but the company has always been vague about what factors determine a story’s position in its results. In most instances, the algorithm does surface legitimate sources — possibly because more people are reading legitimate news sources than fringe websites. But that doesn’t change the fact that Google is a massive platform — bigger than Facebook — and it presents its News box as a place for real news, and not fabricated conspiracy theories on a personal blog. People hunting for election results might find their way to 70 News , and despite the fact that the website looks like it was created by a man who types with two fingers, it would be hard to blame an incautious reader for assuming it was a factual publication. After all, one of its articles is currently living in the internet’s most coveted piece of real estate. The Verge has reached out to Google for comment, and will update when and if it provides a response. More From The Verge",

      "text": "Apple Pay now lets non-profits take donations Posted Google’s self-driving cars are naturals when it comes to three-point turns \nApple announced this morning that its payments service Apple Pay will now support the ability to make donations to non-profits, starting today in the U.S. This includes both Apple Pay on the web, where it can be integrated into websites’ checkout flow, as well as within mobile applications. The changes are rolling out just ahead of the holidays, something participating non-profits hope will have a big impact on their ability to raise funds during this time of increased charitable giving. \nApple previously had a rule that banned iOS apps from collecting funds for charities or fundraisers via Apple Pay. That means means if they collected funds, it would have to take place outside the app, such as through Safari or SMS. Now, they’ll be able to integrate “donate” buttons right in their app and process the transactions through the payments service. \nOn mobile, that means users can use TouchID. Meanwhile, on the web, users click the Apple Pay donate button in Safari, then can confirm their payment via their iPhone or Apple Watch. \nAlready, online stores supporting Apple Pay on the web have seen an increase in checkout conversion rate of up to 2x on mobile, and customers are able to checkout up to 60% faster with Apple Pay, according to figures from Shopify . \nThe reason that the payments system works well is because it allows customers to use their contact and billing information they already have on file, which saves time over having to manually fill out forms at checkout. \nApple Pay today has tens of millions of customers, and is adding one million more per week. The technology is integrated in thousands of iOS apps, and has more recently arrived on the web in Safari. In addition, TouchID support has been added to Apple’s new MacBook Pro, so you can checkout on the web with just a press of your finger. \nApple Pay transactions have also increased by nearly 500% year-over-year, for the September quarter. And more transactions were made in September 2016, than across off of fiscal 2015, the company said. \nIn other words, there are now enough customers on Apple Pay for this launch to have a measurable impact on giving programs. \nA large number of non-profits are launching with Apple Pay, including the following: American Red Cross, American Heart Association, charity: water, Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals, COPD Foundation, Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA), Doctors without Borders, Feeding America, GlobalGiving, International Rescue Committee, Red, St.Jude Children’s Research Hospital, The Nature Conservancy, The Water Project, UNICEF, United Way, WNET, World Vision, and WWF (World Wildlife Federation). \nA few others have plans in the works for supporting Apple Pay in the near future, including American Cancer Society, CARE, DonorsChoose.org, Save the Children, and PBS along with its local stations. \nOne non-profit that’s supporting the new technology, charity:water, explained to us how the increase in mobile traffic played into its interest in mobile giving. \n“Currently, nearly 25% of our donations come from mobile. We’ve seen steady growth in mobile traffic to our site over the past few years, so it’s important we make giving through mobile as easy as possible,” explained Scott Harrison, charity: water founder and CEO. \n“So many people want to give, but complicated and clunky donation systems discourage them. Integrating Apple Pay makes the giving experience incredibly simple and convenient, and we hope it will encourage more people to join our mission and enable us to transform lives within seconds,” he added. \nCharity:water will be integrating Apple Pay across all its giving platforms on desktop and mobile, and will also allow donors to use it when joining the monthly giving program. \nTo help vet non-profits ahead of their integrations with Apple Pay, Apple is working with Benevity , a platform that helps enable workplace and corporate charitable giving programs. The company will launch an online application form for any non-profits that want to integrate Apple Pay in their apps. \nApple Pay’s move to support non-profits is a big challenge to rival digital payment services, like PayPal , which already has close to half a million charities using its platform to take donations. However, Apple Pay support for non-profits is not as broadly available at present, as it’s limited to the Apple ecosystem and the U.S. for the time being.",

      "text": "Getty Images \nGoogle has released a \"smarter\" and \"much more assistive\" version of its Google Play Music streaming service. The new GPM leans heavily on machine learning to get a read on your musical likes, and then \"mixes in signals like location, activity, and the weather\" along with hand-curated playlists. \nContextual tools that power and individualize other Google products are being utilized to help provide \"richer\" recommendations. \"When you opt in, we’ll deliver personalized music based on where you are and why you are listening,\" said lead product manager Elias Roman on the Google blog. \nThe new Google Play Music also creates offline playlists for you, based on your listening history, meaning there will always be tracks on your phone even if you lose cell service. \nA new home screen reflects on your listening habits as well, so if you’re someone who hits the gym most mornings, a workout playlist may appear. Ditto for users who religiously visit the app on Fridays for new music or who rock out on drives home from work. \"Powered by Google's machine learning systems and honed by our team of expert music curators, your experience will keep evolving (and improving) as we get to know you better.\" Introducing a fresher take on music streaming —one that's smarter, easier to use, and much more assistive. https://t.co/CUODx4ZIMa pic.twitter.com/JHgCkp40Tb",

      "title": "ASUS could reveal its Tango-based ZenFone AR phone at CES 2017",
      "text": "\nAnother smartphone that will use Google’s Tango 3D mapping technology maybe revealed in the near future. A new report claims that ASUS CEO Jerry Shen could reveal that phone, the ZenFone AR, as part of the company’s announcements in early January during the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.\nSee also: Lenovo Phab 2 Pro with Google’s Tango 3D camera now on sale 2 weeks ago This new report comes from Digitimes , who claims this info came directly from Shen. With that said, it’s best if we take this information with a grain of salt.\nTango, which Google has been developing for years, uses its technology to map out the outside world with its camera. The smartphone can then use that map for AR-based games and apps. Earlier this month, Lenovo launched the first commercial smartphone with a Tango-based camera, the 6.4-inch Phab 2 Pro .\nToday’s report said that the ASUS ZenFone AR will come with “advanced functionality and performance at a competitive price”, according to Shen. However, that’s all we know about the device at the moment. Hopefully we will learn much more at CES 2017.\nThe same report also stated that the ASUS ZenFone 4 smartphones will begin shipping in the second quarter of 2017. Once again Shen provided little to no details about the phones, other than they will have “enhanced cameras”. Finally, an all-in-one VR device from ASUS could be launched in the third quarter of 2017.",

      "text": "If you’re still looking for a good laugh after the election, Google’s new Cheeseburger extension is it.\nOn Google Chrome, users can download the “ Make Trump Burger Again ” extension to replace almost any picture of the president-elect with a burger. Daragh Kan, the co-founder of an Australian burger chain called Mr. Burger , created the extension.\nThe inspiration for the extension, Kan first told Mashable , comes from wanting to “brighten people's days, and after Trump’s win we thought we’d create something small to make the internet fun again.”\nToday we tried to make the Internet great again! https://t.co/eiqb6mBNZg \n— Mr Burger (@mrburgertruck) November 11, 2016 \n\nHowever, the extension isn’t foolproof: To work properly, the image must have the word “Trump” in its alternative text, notes Mashable.\n \nHowever, if users would prefer to remove the president-elect from their Internet browsing altogether, there are Chrome extensions for that, too. Technologist Rob Spectre created “ Trump Filter ” to completely eliminate Trump, or minimize how often Trump-related content is seen based on the user’s preference, from any webpage the extension-user is visiting. Similarly, there's “ Trump Blocker “: A Trump filter that not only removes Donald Trump from webpages, but it also filters and removes Trump from Facebook and YouTube. ",

      "text": "Google Highlighting Inaccurate Story About Election Results By The Associated Press SAN FRANCISCO  Nov 14, 2016, 2:07 PM ET 0 Shares Email Google's search engine is highlighting an inaccurate story claiming that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet's gatekeepers. The incorrect results are shown in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump \"70 News\" site. On Monday, a link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google's influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results. Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election by promoting fake news stories on its social network, an increasingly important source of information for many Americans. Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College's decisive count, but is losing the popular vote. Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 0 Shares",

      "text": "November 14, 2016 Reince Priebus says he and Stephen Bannon make effective Trump team \nThat’s not true, either. \nIn light gray text above the link to 70 News, Google relays the actual current tally of counted votes: Clinton has a lead of about 700,000. That lead has grown since Election Day and will almost certainly continue to grow, since millions of the votes being counted are from California, and the plurality of those votes are from very-Clinton-friendly Los Angeles County. \nThe source behind the “USA Supreme” website isn’t clear. It looks an awful lot like Prntly, a made-up news website we looked at earlier this year. Founded by a former convict named Alex Portelli, Prntly is part of the broad diaspora of websites that takes news about American politics, frames it in a pro-Trump way (often at the expense of accuracy) and then peppers the page with ads. In an email, Portelli denied involvement in USA Supreme, suggesting that it was the work of a group of young people in Macedonia first reported by BuzzFeed. These sites leverage the inability of Facebook and other social media sites to weed out nonsense in order to get clicks and make money from advertising — a remarkably lucrative endeavor, particularly in a country where the U.S. dollar stretches a lot further. \nWhy Google includes 70 News as a news source isn’t clear. Among the main categories of news stories the site lists in its header is “Hillary’s Health,” which links to a number of rumors about the health of the Democratic nominee. Under “Politics” is a story that, among other things, links the Council on American-Islamic Relations to Al Qaeda. Another story suggests that protestors against Trump in California were being paid to do so. \n70 News has added a header to its post about the election results. \n“Anyone asking where I got the figures, it was from twitter posts. Knowing the Democrat media have been dragging their liberal feet giving Michigan to Trump – finally they did, with Arizona finally declared two days ago – Trump now has the 309. Except for the twitter posts, the popular vote number still need to be updated in Wikipedia or MSM media – which may take another few days because the liberals are still reeling and recovering from Trump-shock victory. If I’m wrong, I won’t hesitate to change the numbers. It’s the job of the establishment media to tell the people the final numbers when it’s out there already.” \nNone of that is true, either. \nThe “establishment media” has regularly updated election results, showing Clinton with a wide popular vote lead. The reason that Michigan hasn’t been called is that Trump’s lead is 12,000 votes, and the results haven’t been finalized. New Hampshire also hasn’t been called for Clinton; her lead there is under 3,000 votes. “Alex” is wrong; he’s hesitating to change the numbers. \nIf you’re interested in tracking the final vote tallies in the presidential race, you can simply search Google and keep an eye out for the small print under the electoral college totals. If you also see an article from a random site you’ve never heard of? I might recommend you take its numbers with a grain of salt. Tags:",

      "text": "Reddit \nThe Google Pixel launcher for Android is now available for more phones than just Google’s own. Google doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with the working abilities of the launcher beyond Pixel and Pixel XL – but it is what it is. At the same time, Microsoft has updated its own Arrow Launcher to take on what Google has with their Pixel phones. \nWe previously went over a small number of phones Pixel launcher works on. Now, in addition to the Pixel and Pixel XL and CyanogenMod 14, we’ve confirmed that some phones with CyanogenMod 13 work, too. Our original report has been updated, and users of most phones from the past two years (new phones) should be able to use the launcher. They should, that is, just so long as they’re using CyanogenMod 13 or 14 when they make the attempt. \nFor those users that cannot access the app through Google Play, there’s an APK Mirror listing. The most recent update to the app via APK Mirror is Pixel Launcher 7.1.1-3359438 from October 19th, 2016 as of press time for this article. This is the same version we’ve tested with both most recent versions of CyanogenMod. \nMicrosoft’s update to Arrow Launcher comes just as the Google Pixel and Pixel XL hit stores – and the latter device is re-stocked online. This update to Arrow Launcher adds memory efficiency, bug fixes, and the return of the widgets pack from a previous iteration of the app. This version also adds icon size customization – though we stress that modifying the size of Android icons may very well make pages look quite crazy. \nMicrosoft added several features that were likely inspired by the Pixel launcher from Google. The most prevalent of these features is the ability to add shortcuts to app icons. Users could also potentially have all of Google’s newest icons by downloading the Pixel icon pack from Google Play by Saurabh Gupta. \nMicrosoft’s Arrow Launcher is also available through Google Play and is, as always, delivered without cost. This app was updated on the 8th of November, 2016 to version number 2.6.0.27593. Users will find that they’ll need Android version 4.0.3 and up if they want to make use of the app. Story Timeline",

      "text": "Google's self-driving cars master tricky three-point turns And it only took several thousand tries per week. Save REUTERS/Alexandria Sage/File Photo \nWith supercomputers for brains and perfect 360-degree vision, one would imagine it would be fairly simple for an autonomous vehicle to pass the time-honored driver's ed test of performing a three-point turn. But according to Google's self-driving car project October report , that is one of the many things that's easier said than done for a robot vehicle. \nWhile a human driver can estimate the best angle and distance, the amount of data and information the autonomous vehicle has can actually be a drawback. \"Our challenge is to teach our self-driving cars to choose the option that's not only the quickest , but one that feels natural to passengers,\" the report says. So, even though some turns would be easier done in reverse, for example, people prefer to travel moving forward, where they can see what's happening. \"So we've taught our cars to mimic these human patterns, favoring wider forward arcs, rather than a series of short movements back and forth.\" \nIn order to get all these turns right, Google's vehicles are doing a lot more turns than most drivers will probably ever practice before hitting the road – about 1,000 every week. And, despite some hang ups with California's autonomous vehicle regulations , Google's vehicles have driven over 2.2 million autonomous miles in Washington State, California, Arizona and Texas to date.",

It's the latest in the internet's battle with fake news. Google admits it messed up with fake election story 0 Share: \nGoogle News prominently listed a fake news story. Photo by CNET \nYou really can't believe everything you read on the internet. \nGoogle on Monday acknowledged its algorithms screwed up and that it placed a fake news story about Donald Trump winning the popular vote in last week's election prominently in the search engine's widely-read news section. \n\"The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users,\" a Google spokeswoman said. \"We clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms.\" \nThe fumble comes almost a week after the US presidential election, in which Trump, the Republican nominee, pulled off a stunning upset victory. In the aftermath, commenters have argued fake news circulating on social networks helped get him elected. Facebook so far has taken the brunt of the blame. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last week that the notion fake news swayed the election is a \"pretty crazy idea.\" He later admitted though , that the social network needs to \"continue to work\" on eliminating fake news and hoaxes. \nIf you Googled \"final election results\" this morning, you would have seen the headline in a top slot on Google News. The thing is, it's not true. The AP reports Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, won more votes overall. \nThat's a problem because Google, for many people, is the internet. When you want to know a piece of info, or you're arguing with a friend over something, the first reflex is to Google it. \nGoogle, though, reiterated that it always lists several stories, and not just one result. The company also doesn't remove search results, except if the result contains things like illegal content or malware. \n\"Google is an important source of news for people who tend to fall toward the middle of the ideological spectrum,\" Jesse Holcomb, associate director of research for the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C. \"It is a generally trusted source of news.\" \nWell, not so much today.",

The policy would include sites that distribute false news, a Google spokeswoman said.\nFalse news stories, particularly those that spread widely on Facebook Inc.’s FB, -3.31% social network, became an issue during the recent presidential election. Google experienced its own mishap on Sunday when a false story on a right-wing blog erroneously stating Donald Trump won the popular vote appeared atop some Google search results.\nSome media commentators have urged tech companies to try to prevent the spread of such misinformation. Google’s move to block some of such sites’ revenue could prove a significant step in response to the controversy.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nRNC Chair Reince Priebus is named Donald Trump’s chief of staff.\nCalifornia, as Clinton territory, finds itself a political outlier.\nMore from MarketWatch Clinton, Obama, Ryan, McConnell React to Trump Win Donald Trump Wins U.S. Presidency Trump critic Warren Buffett says stocks will continue to rise",

      "text": "Google Is Introducing Native Video Ads for Mobile Publishers Also expanding its Exchange Bidding format to mobile apps By Marty Swant November 14, 2016, 6:17 PM EST Technology Google is working to boost publishers' mobile capabilities. Shutterstock If Google's research is correct, more than half of all smartphone users give up trying to load mobile websites if it takes longer than three seconds. Because of that, Google is moving forward with several beta offerings to help publishers and advertisers make their mobile formats more efficient. Today, the search and video giant introduced native video ads for publishers, an offering through its DoubleClick platform that the company says could speed up video on publishers' mobile websites while also driving more revenue. \"It is in everyone's interest to work together to deliver a faster mobile experience,\" Jonathan Bellack, Google's director of product management for publisher platforms, told Adweek. \"We feel the data is very clear that mobile users expect speed and that they will not wait around if things are slow. And therefore, if the industry together cannot deliver speed, nobody will succeed.\" Google says its video ads business is growing quickly, with monthly video ad impressions served across platforms doubling since January. When the company reported it's third-quarter earnings last month, Ruth Porat, chief financial officer for Google parent company Alphabet, said mobile search and video continue to power the company's advertising business. Native ad impressions served through DoubleClick also have doubled overall since May for a group of publishers that includes The New York Times, Vogue, Slate and eBay. (For The New York Times, for example, native ads have had clickthrough rates six times higher than average and viewable impressions four times higher than standard display formats.) Google isn't the only tech company working to speed up the mobile web. In September, Facebook started putting more pressure on brands to decrease load times by preloading ads even before a user click on them. The Google rival also said it planned to begin factoring load times into determining which users see which ads. Along with launching native video ads, Google also announced today that it's bringing its Exchange Bidding offering out of alpha and into beta. The platform, which lets publishers put multiple exchanges in competition with each other, is also moving into mobile apps. Exchange Bidding launched earlier this year and reportedly now has a waiting of more than 100 publishers since Google unveiled its First Look for DoubleClick. That offering, which was unveiled in 2011, allowed publishers to hold certain areas of advertising space at a certain price before it moved to an ad exchange. Based on a November survey of DoubleClick data, Google says there are four times as many publishers using Exchange Bidding now as there were in April. The number of exchanges has also doubled, with new additions like Sovern and Gamut. \"There's an avalanche of data,\" Bellack said, \"both by Google and others in the industry, that says speed is phenomenally important in the mobile realm.\" Get the Technology Today newsletter: \nCheck out our other newsletters: Daily Digest",

Post to Facebook More fake news on social media -- this time, Google Facebook isn't the only source of fake news on the Web.  //usat.ly/2fshtkc   More fake news on social media -- this time, Google Jon Swartz , USA TODAY 6:35 p.m. EST November 14, 2016 Google says it rejects European Union antitrust charges. (Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) \nSAN FRANCISCO — Facebook isn't the only source of fake news on the Web. \nAlphabet's Google was dragged into the muck Monday, when its search engine prominently displayed an obscure right-wing blog, 70news.wordpress.com, that falsely claimed President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election. (Hillary Clinton leads Trump by nearly 700,000 votes, but Trump won in the Electoral College.) FINAL ELECTION 2016 NUMBERS: TRUMP WON BOTH POPULAR ( 62.9 M -62.2 M ) AND ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES ( 306-232)...HEY CHANGE.ORG, SCRAP YOUR LOONY PETITION NOW! \nGoogle was not immediately available for comment. \nThe dust-up, on the heels of criticism that Facebook was a breeding ground for misinformation during the run-up to the presidential election, is more fodder for a national debate on the responsibility of social media and other types of technology that broadly disseminate information to billions of people worldwide. \nMost news carried on Google's search engine comes from established media sources such as the New York Times and CNN , according to data analysis from journalists at the University of Maryland. \nThe erroneous blog post is sure to give technology another black eye in what has been mounting criticism about its propensity to amplify misleading information across broad digital platforms. \nFacebook has been assailed for prominently featuring fake news on its site, prompting CEO Mark Zuckerberg to deny it unwittingly helped Trump become president-elect. He said 99% of news on the social network is \"authentic,\" and has vowed to weed out fake news. \nA group of Facebook employees have formed an unofficial task force to refute Zuckerberg's claim that the company bears no responsibility for the spread of fake news, according to a BuzzFeed News report. \nFacebook was not immediately available for comment.",

Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has denied that the site influenced the outcome of the election.\nGoogle’s goog AdSense advertising network is a key financial driver for many publishers. The company places various restrictions on where its ads may be placed, including bans on pornographic and violent content. Work on the policy update began before the election, Faville said",

      "text": "Google's search engine highlighted an inaccurate story claiming that President-elect Donald Trump won the popular vote in last week's election, the latest example of bogus information spread by the internet's gatekeepers.\nThe incorrect results were shown Monday in a two-day-old story posted on the pro-Trump \"70 News\" site. A link to the site appeared at or near the top of Google's influential rankings of relevant news stories for searches on the final election results.\nGoogle acknowledged the problem, although as of mid-afternoon Monday, the link to \"70 News\" remained prominent in its results.\nFAKE NEWS ON STEROIDS\nFalse information is nothing new on the internet, where debunkers have been batting down unfounded claims and urban legends for more than two decades.\nBut the problem has gained more attention in the post-mortem of a bitterly contested presidential election in which Trump, a Republican billionaire and former reality TV star, defeated Hillary Clinton , a Democrat and former U.S. secretary of state who had been leading in the polls.\nFacebook's Zuckerberg says fake news didn't drive election Sarah Frier Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea that fake news on the social network influenced the U.S. presidential election and said echo chambers aren't a problem on the site.\nThe company co-founder was responding to criticism following Donald Trump 's victory in the elections,...\nFacebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea that fake news on the social network influenced the U.S. presidential election and said echo chambers aren't a problem on the site.\nThe company co-founder was responding to criticism following Donald Trump 's victory in the elections,...\n(Sarah Frier) Trump wound up prevailing in enough key states to win the Electoral College's decisive vote, but is trailing Clinton in the overall popular vote with some ballots still being counted. Clinton's lead in the popular vote has become one of the flashpoints in the protests against Trump's election being staged in cities across the country.\nGoogle is just the latest company in the crosshairs. Fake news stories uncritically circulated during and after the election on Facebook have sparked a debate over the role of social media companies, which are key sources of news for large numbers of people. Critics suggest that these companies should be more careful to ensure they aren't passing along misleading information.\nSOCIAL MEDIA AND THE NEWS\nGoogle's dominant search engine is the leading source of traffic to media sites, according to the online analytics firm Chartbeat. Meanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center found about 60 percent of Americans get at least some of their news from social media sites such as Facebook, which now has 178 million users in the U.S. and Canada.\nReports of buried news raise questions about Facebook's political influence Philip Bump The great irony of the tech blog Gizmodo's revelation that Facebook's trending-topic curators weeded out stories about Facebook or about issues popular with conservatives is that Gizmodo's story therefore won't end up on Facebook's list of trending topics.

After all, the report, which suggests...\n(Philip Bump) In the election's aftermath, Facebook has been accused of possibly swaying the election's outcome by promoting fake news stories on its social network. Last summer, the company fired a handful of journalists who oversaw its \"trending\" news list and replaced them with an algorithm; fake news stories quickly began to trend.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off that criticism as \"crazy \" in an appearance last week. He elaborated in a Saturday post on Facebook in which he asserted that \"more than 99 percent of what people see\" on Facebook is authentic. Zuckerberg conceded more needs to be done to block bogus information, but said that determining what's blatantly wrong isn't always an easy task.\n\"Identifying the 'truth' is complicated,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted.\"\nThe stories featured in the feeds of Facebook users are primarily selected by automated formulas known as algorithms. Google's search results are also powered by algorithms that the company regularly revises to thwart sites that attempt to artificially boost their prominence.\nMORE, BETTER ALGORITHMS?\nGoogle conceded its search engine misfired with the 70 News story that falsely declared Trump the popular vote winner in both its headline and the body of the text. \"In this case we clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,\" the company said in a statement.\nBad information in an online headline or at the top of a story can be particularly damaging. Roughly 53 percent of the people who land on a web page stay for 15 seconds or less, according to Chartbeat's findings.\nIncorrect information is bound to ripple across the internet as more people rely on their phones, computers and other digital devices to read news that is picked out for them by automated programs, said media analyst Ken Doctor of Newsonomics.\n\"What we are seeing is the failure of the algorithm,\" Doctor said. \"These algorithms bring a lot of things into our lives that humans cannot do. But when algorithms fail, it highlights the fact that they are not just some kind of neutral technology. They are programmed by human beings and they have all the failings of human beings.\"\nIt's difficult to know what happened when an algorithm goes awry because Google, Facebook and other internet companies closely guard how they work, much the way Coca-Cola protects the recipe for its soda.\nBut the growing power that Google and Facebook hold over the flow of information could increase the political pressure for them to be held more accountable, Doctor said.\nIn the meantime, most people remain skeptical about what they read online. Only 4 percent of Americans have a lot of confidence in what they read on social media sites, according to Pew. Local news organizations fared better in Pew Research's survey earlier this year, with 22 percent of Americans saying they trusted the information there.\nAssociated Press \nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Google Inc.
