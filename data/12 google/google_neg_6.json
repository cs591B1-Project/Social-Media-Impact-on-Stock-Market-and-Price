      "text": "Photo via Google Users are already calling it a life-changing experience. \nGoogle on Tuesday released on Steam Google Earth VR, a powerful app that allows users to explore the Earth in virtual reality. You walk or fly across the landscape or even zoom up into space, all from the ultimate first-person perspective—provided you have the necessary HTC Vive, of course. \nThe idea of being able to instantly teleport to any major location in the world is exciting enough, but when you add in the ability to fly, it’s downright spellbinding. Reviewers are understandably losing their minds. \nOne reviewer dream of destroying Tokyo. “This is the penultimate VR experience. A whole Earth to explore. Perfect use of scaling as you zoom in and out. Comfort mode is optional. Google, Thank you for this experience. This is a MUST GET. Once StreetView/Oceans are added in, it will make this product even better. But as it stands its AMAZING. So download, head to Tokyo and pretend to be Godzilla!” \nThis reviewer was forced to question whether we are all living in a simulation. Thankfully, they were having too much fun to be haunted. “About a year ago I was still a bit skeptical about the whole \"we are living in a simulation\" thing.Then I started with VR- I lost my skepticism.But then - Google Earth VR. This is the definitive proof for the Matrix and that one day not to long from now we will build our own.EVERYONE owning an HTC Vive MUST download it.Worth every single byte!” \nAnother user left the experience inspired, with a new appreciation for the Earth. “I spent just 45 minutes flying around discovering places, I was able to actually fly to all the spots I've been to on vacations. There is so much to discover...Completely zooming in on the Grand Canyon, where I stood just a few months ago gave me almost the same feeling in VR as in RL. This program makes you realize we are so small and earth is beautiful.” \nTo experience Google Earth VR for yourself, you'll need to buy an HTC Vive. But those of us who don't already have one—or have no plan to buy one—can watch this trailer for the app to get an idea of what wer're missing.",

      "text": "Smarter bots are coming to Facebook, Google and Amazon assistants MindMeld's tech gives assistants a \"deep understanding\" of products and services. Share Save \nWe keep hearing that robots are going to take our jobs , but a company called MindMeld is giving us an idea how with its \"Deep-Domain Conversational AI Platform.\" It'll allow bots that can essentially replace customer service agents and even baristas by answering complicated voice or text queries over Google Assistant, Amazon Echo, Facebook Messenger and other popular platforms. Uniqlo, for one, will offer a Facebook bot that can answer questions about its products, services and retail locations with more detail than ever. \nThe \"MindMeld Language Parser\" helps it understand and answer questions with \"human-like accuracy,\" whether by talk or text, the company says. It adds that while current AI toolkits from Google, Facebook and others are great, they provide \"little data suitable for production-quality applications\" -- in other words, they can do deep learning, but don't give companies anything to teach them. It reckons that customers have been \"disappointed and underwhelmed\" with first-gen bots -- something Facebook pretty much said not long ago. \nIn a video (below) the company showed some (simulated) scenarios of the bot in action. It understands relatively complicated searches, like a coffee order for a \"venti, hot Pike Place Roast with room,\" (I have no idea myself what that actually is). The bot can then process the order and give you a pickup time and price, or else auto-suggest more options via buttons at the bottom of the screen. \nOther features include question responses across \"any dynamic knowledge graph,\" dialogue management and state tracking, large-scale training data generation and cloud-based or on-premise deployment. Basically, all of those buzzwords mean that companies can put together a bot without needing to do a lot of extra work (for a price, of course). \nThe company thinks bots will be able to do tasks like \"placing a take-out order at a local restaurant, booking a flight or hotel reservation, creating a service appointment at an auto repair shop or doctor's office, or finding retail store and production information.\" It'll eventually work across \"Amazon Alexa, Facebook Messenger, Google Assistant, Skype, Slack, Google Home and more,\" says MindMeld CEO Tim Tuttle. \nThe platform is available starting today, and MindMeld customers and investors already include Google, Samsung, Intel, Uniqlo, Spotify, Telefonica and others. Suffice to say, if you work in customer service or other areas, you may want to start buffing up your resume.",

      "text": "Google Is Telling More Transgender Stories at a Critical Time for LGBT Rights Lonelyleap produces #transvoices documentary series By Gabriel Beltrone November 17, 2016, 11:07 AM EST Google is back to celebrate more transgender stories. Three new documentary-style videos offer a glimpse into the lives of transgender people who are making a difference in their communities, with help from Google's tools. Trans director Rhys Ernst helms the camera, as it focuses on Evan Young, Jasmine Morrell and Mara Kiesling—covering subjects like their work, their clients and their families. Young, for example, discusses his history of military service, and how he came to his role as president of the Transgender American Veterans Association. Morrell, meanwhile, explains becoming a tattoo artist, and eventually opening the Spirited Tattoo Coalition, as a safe space to practice the craft. Kiesling, a longtime activist, shares perspective on transgender activism in Washington, D.C., in her role as the executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equity, and the ongoing importance of educating policymakers and the public about what it means to be transgender. The ads, taken together, are a powerful tool to that end—humanizing diverse individuals as representatives of a marginalized and often misunderstood population. That kind of visibility is particularly important in light of last week's election results, as the incoming administration of Donald Trump seems poised to roll back substantial federal protections for LGBT populations, and shape a Supreme Court that could still have substantial influence on their legal rights. The timing is important even more broadly, as well. \"In 2016, we saw over 100 federal policy changes to provide equal and fair treatment of transgender people,\" says Arjan Dijk, vp of marketing, executive sponsor LGBT, at Google. \"Sadly, at the exact same time, state legislatures were passing bathroom bills and there was a steady increase in violence against the trans community. The suicide rate among transgender people is nine times higher than the national average. They experience discrimination and violence, and extreme poverty and homelessness. They struggle not only for their human rights, but to survive at all. I therefore encourage everyone to follow the #transvoices initiative and to think of ways we can bring more justice to trans communities.\" Google launched the ads to coincide with Transgender Awareness Week, which runs Nov. 14-20. Ernst, the director, is also a co-producer on Amazon's popular series Transparent, as is Zackary Drucker, who also produced the new spots. In a company blog post announcing the campaign, Tea Uglow, a trans creative director at Google Creative Labs, acknowledges it has been a banner year for trans people in media. But \"2016 is also the most deadly year on record for transgender people with 23 reported murders in the USA and counting,\" the post reads. Agency and production company Lonelyleap shot the ads for Google, after also producing last year's heartwarming ad by Venables Bell & Partners about a trans man finding home at a Kansas City gym.

      "text": " Google+\nDavid L. Ryan/Globe staff\nHarvard student Nada Attia, a 17-year-old from North Dakota, said it’s important for students to begin a dialogue now before Donald Trump begins his presidency.\nBy Laura Krantz Globe Staff November 17, 2016\nUndocumented college students fear a president who has threatened to deport millions of illegal immigrants. University administrators worry about possible reductions in federal research money, particularly for climate change studies.\nAdvocates dread that painstaking efforts to curb sexual assault on campus could be reversed and predatory for-profit colleges will flourish.\nAdvertisement\nDonald Trump’s election has rattled colleges around the country. Interviews with Boston-area college students, professors, and administrators reflect unease about a president-elect who has so far offered vague or conflicting statements on his plans for higher education.\n“The big challenge is that the Trump campaign didn’t lay out an extensive agenda on higher education, so we’re piecing together things that were said in debates and excerpts in speeches,” said Michael Armini, Northeastern’s senior vice president for external affairs.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Yet Trump has been more explicit about immigrants and minorities, whom he and his supporters have repeatedly disparaged. That has created palpable fear among foreign students, Muslims, blacks, and people who identify as LGBTQ.\nAlso cause for concern on campuses, Trump has called the Black Lives Matter movement divisive and offered support for “stop and frisk” police tactics.\n“A lot of people kind of don’t know how to feel or how to go forward,” said Harvard College junior Emma Keteku, 20, who is African American. Another Harvard student described a “very palpable atmosphere of gloom” on campus.\nAdvertisement\n“The black community at Boston University in general is very scared,” said Rachel Edwards, 18, a freshman at BU. “The next four years will be very hard. Everything is unpredictable.”\nA Muslim student said he is scared less by Trump’s disparaging comments about Muslims — whom he has portrayed as security threats — and more because so many people voted for a person who said such things.\n“It’s solidified my belief that as a person, as an American, as a Muslim American, that I need to make my mark,” said Farhan Hoodbhoy, a BU freshman from Atlanta who said he wants to run for office one day.\nYet despite the uncertainty, many students want to get to know classmates who voted for Trump. They wonder whether they unknowingly discouraged them people from sharing their opinions before the election.\nDavid L. Ryan/Globe staff\nStudents wrote messages on paper posted to columns at MIT’s Lobby 7.\n“It’s important to create a dialogue now,” said Nada Attia, 17, a Harvard freshman from Fargo, N.D. She said students should be “starting conversations with those people, instead of sort of shutting them down.”\nTrump’s impact on higher education could be greater in Boston because so many international students study here. Massachusetts ranks fourth among states in the number of foreign students, with 60,000. Most are from China.\nUniversities routinely welcome visiting scholars from abroad and pride themselves for attracting faculty from around the world. A quarter of MIT professors are permanent US residents but not citizens, and 16 percent of assistant professors are international, according to university data .\nForty-three percent of MIT graduate students are from other countries.\nAlthough those students and professors live here legally, Trump has reiterated his plan to toughen immigration laws that could cut off the international flow.\nNortheastern operates student internship programs in more than 100 countries including Cuba, where Trump could reverse Obama’s recent work to normalize relations. The university also has 11,700 international students on its Huntington Avenue campus.\nJing Wen, a sophomore at BU from China studying politics, said she doesn’t like Trump but doesn’t feel as threatened as some of her international classmates.\n“I believe my worry is not that much as people from the Middle East or Mexico,” Wen said last week as she studied in a hallway of the College of Arts and Sciences building on Commonwealth Avenue.\nHer parents worry, but she plans to finish her degree here.\nClimate change funding\nColleges in Boston, particularly MIT, lead the nation in climate change research.\nKerry Emanuel, an MIT professor who studies atmospheric science, said Republicans have already cut funding for this sector in recent years.\n“I fear that that’s just going to get worse now,” he said last week in a phone interview.\nTrump has called man-made climate change a hoax and said he plans to quit a global plan to fight global warming. He chose a man to lead his transition team on the environment who denies that it’s happening.\n“If there’s a belief that climate change is a hoax, then there’s a real concern that that funding could go down,” said Armini, at Northeastern, which runs a center in Nahant that studies climate change and sustainability.\nEmanuel said older scientists might retire early, students might re-think a career in the field, and researchers might get fewer federal grants.\nBoston University undergraduate Erica Broderhausen spent the summer studying edge erosion in marshes and hopes to become an ecology researcher. She’s listening closely to Trump.\n“It’s discouraging for somebody like me because that’s something I want to go into,” she said.\nOn the other hand, the new president’s promises to fight terrorist groups like ISIS could lead to more money for cybersecurity research and other Department of Defense research, college officials said.\nDavid L. Ryan/globe staff\n“A lot of people kind of don’t know how to feel or how to go forward,” Harvard College junior Emma Keteku said.\nConcerns on sexual assault policies\nColleges’ response to campus sexual assault is another matter that could change under Trump.\nThe Obama administration in particular strengthened campus sexual assault policies, said Alison Kiss, executive director of the Clery Center, which works with schools to prevent and address sexual assault.\nSchools have been forced to report sexual assault incidents with more transparency and bolster resources available to victims. Many have improved their policies for handling allegations, and students have become more confident filing complaints against schools that don’t.\nBut with a president who has been accused of groping women without their consent, advocates say they are worried. The national Republican Party platform calls for law enforcement authorities, rather than colleges, to investigate allegations of sexual assault, which would mean a scaling-back of regulations that Obama officials worked to strengthen.\n“This is a very uncertain time in the anti-sexual-assault world. There are obvious concerns and his comments are disturbing,” said Anna Voremberg, managing director at End Rape on Campus, a national anti-sexual-assault organization.\nPredatory for-profit colleges\nThe Obama administration cracked down on for-profit schools, such as the Corinthian Colleges , accusing them of preying on low-income students and profiting off federal student loans. Trump, however, founded the for-profit Trump University, and experts worry the industry could surge again during his presidency.\n“We absolutely have concerns,” said Abby Shafroth, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center in Boston which helps victims of predatory for-profit schools.\nA class-action fraud lawsuit was filed in 2013 against Trump University claiming it defrauded students out of $40 million in course fees. The president-elect is due to appear in court, although his lawyers have moved to settle the suit or delay it until after Trump’s inauguration.\nTrump has also talked about repealing the Dodd-Frank law that established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency that helps students who are victims of for-profit colleges get relief, according to Shafroth.\nOn the other hand, she said, Republicans could decide to crack down further on the schools because they are heavily subsidized by tax dollars, in the form of federal student loans.\n“That’s a straight government subsidy issue,” Shafroth said.\nColleges offer wisdom, comfort\nIn the face of so much uncertainty, local college presidents sent out heartening messages of comfort.\n“This election feels different to me,” David P. Nelson, president at MassArt in Boston, wrote in an e-mail to students last week. “I saw fear, distress, and trepidation about our nation’s future. This was so striking that I carved out time during the afternoon to walk the campus and check in on students, staff, and faculty.”\nSchools offered counselors, cookies, and mindfulness activities.\nAt MIT, students shared their hopes and fears on giant sheets of paper wrapped around the giant columns in Lobby 7. President L. Rafael Reif visited the columns and later wrote that nearly every message expressed some kind of pain.\n“MIT is a quintessential expression of America at its best,” he wrote in an e-mail to students. “Bold, optimistic and focused on inventing the future. Delighted and energized by our diversity, with a meritocratic openness to talent, culture and ideas from anywhere.”\nDavid L. Ryan/Globe staff\nRobert Onidi wrote a note on one of the posters placed on columns in MIT’s Lobby 7.\nLaura Krantz can be reached at laura.krantz@globe.com . Follow her on Twitter @laurakrantz",

      "text": " Google+\nLane Turner/Globe staff\nLynda DeBiccari waded in the rising waters during the king tides Tuesday at the Long Wharf in Boston.\nBy Matt Rocheleau Globe Staff November 17, 2016\nDid the king tides give us a glimpse into the future?\nThe flooding caused recently by the tides in coastal communities around the world, including here in Massachusetts , may be far more normal in just a few decades, thanks to climate change.\nAdvertisement\nExperts warn that eventually sea levels will have risen to the point where such flooding will be routine.\n“King tides preview how sea level rise will affect coastal places,” the Environmental Protection Agency says . “As time goes by, the water level reached now during a king tide will be the water level reached at high tide on an average day.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here “Sea level rise will make today’s king tides become the future’s everyday tides,” the agency says.\nView Story 2015: The Big Unchill The Arctic ice is melting fast, the warmth tied to the emissions of modern life. But it is the ancient ways that are most at risk.\nKing tides are caused by gravity that pulls oceans to their highest levels when the earth, moon, and sun are in a particular alignment.\nResearchers have already found a sharp increase in coastal high tide flooding, also known as “nuisance” or “sunny-day” flooding, around the United States over the last century, particularly since the 1980s. They say climate change is to blame.\nAdvertisement\nThe EPA says that tides “are reaching higher and extending further inland than in the past.”\n“As sea level is rising, it requires less of a high tide or less of a storm to cause flooding,” said Rutgers University climate scientist Robert E. Kopp.\nScientists, including Kopp, have studied how the world’s oceans have risen significantly in recent decades, and at a far faster pace than in preceding centuries, as the planet has warmed to record levels.\nResearchers have said they expect sea level rises in our region to continue to outpace other parts of the world. And a report earlier this year said the impact of climate change on Boston will be far more calamitous than previous studies have suggested.\nScientists say that harmful greenhouse gas emissions by humans have fueled the rising temperatures and sea level rise.\nWilliam Sweet, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in a study published in late 2014, projected that a majority of coastal areas in the United States can expect to experience 30 or more days of nuisance flooding annually by 2050.\nThat analysis featured projections for specific cities, including Boston.\nSweet said Wednesday that even if humans are able to curb greenhouse gas emissions moderately, his analysis estimates that Boston can expect to endure about 50 days of nuisance flooding each year by 2050.\nUnder a scenario where humans fail to curb emissions in any significant way, Boston could expect as many as 120 days of nuisance flooding annually.\nSome initiatives have been launched to document the impact of king tides, including through photographs of the flooding they cause, as a way to raise awareness for the predicted effect of climate change.\nKopp said that along with more minor cases of flooding, major flooding will also become more common.\nFor example, he said, research shows that floods that were considered one-in-100-year events as of 2000 will be about two and a half times more likely by 2030 and nearly nine times more likely by 2050, under a scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions are at relatively moderate levels.\nIf emissions are at high levels, such major floods would be even more frequent, he said.\nRelated Climate change could be even worse for Boston than previously thought The seas are rising fast — and even faster in Mass. 2015: The Big Unchill 2015: For protection from the rising sea, look to Europe’s example 2014: How Boston is — and should be — preparing for rising seas\nMatt Rocheleau can be reached at matthew.rocheleau@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nJohn Blanding/Globe staff/file\nSouth Boston High School student Gabriela Pereira spoke during a rally against a ballot question to lift the charter school cap on Nov. 1.\nBy Frank Phillips Globe Staff November 16, 2016\nMoody’s Investors Service said Massachusetts voters’ decision to reject Governor Charlie Baker’s charter school expansion plan is “credit positive” for the state’s urban governments, freeing them from potential financial pressures had the proposal been approved.\nIn an announcement this week, the bond rating agency said the history of charter schools shows they drain money from city governments’ education budgets, citing Boston, Fall River, Lawrence, and Springfield in particular.\nAdvertisement\n“A city that begins to lose students to a charter school can be forced to weaken educational programs because funding is tighter, which then begins to encourage more students to leave which then results in additional losses,’’ the Moody’s report said.\nCharter school advocates, who backed Question 2 on the Nov. 8 ballot, firmly rejected Moody’s assessment, citing two studies by nonpartisan groups that came to an opposite conclusion, namely that urban school districts do not suffer financially by the exodus of students to charter schools.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here “The overwhelming evidence is to the contrary, as documented by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation and the Boston Municipal Research Bureau,” said Marc Kenen, executive director of the Massachusetts Charter Public School Association.\nThe release of the report, a week after the election, followed an e-mail sent by Moody’s to the mayors of the four cities in the final week of the campaign. The e-mail warned that passage of the ballot question would be “credit negative” and its defeat “credit positive” but gave no further details. It said Moody’s would not publish its final report until after the election.\nThe analysis from Moody’s is important because the agency rates municipalities’ credit worthiness. A downgrade from Moody’s or other credit-rating agencies can make it more difficult for cities and towns to borrow money at good rates.\nAdvertisement\nA Globe story reporting the content of the e-mails drew harsh criticism from Question 2 backers who balked at Moody’s timing and lack of specificity.\nDays later, voters soundly rejected the Baker-backed charter school initiative, despite supporters having spent a record $24 million to promote it. Teachers’ unions spent over $14.5 million to defeat the measure.\nThe Moody’s report, released Tuesday, said that because of increased enrollments in recent years, charter school spending grew by 83 percent. “In comparison, total municipal education expenditures increased by about 15% from 2011 to 2016,” Moody’s said.\nThe bond rating agency said charter schools “tend to proliferate in urban areas where school districts already reflect a degree of underlying economic and fiscal stress that can detract from a city’s ability to deliver competitive services and can prompt students to move to charter schools; this growing competition can sometimes create a ‘downward spiral’.”\n“While reports have shown that per-pupil spending pre- and post-charter school enrollment remains favorable to the city school districts, the ability to redirect spending, institute program changes and reduce full-time positions is difficult,’’ Moody’s said. “In Boston, school department employees increased by 2.8% from 2002 to 2016 during which time no other department increased its staff.”\nFrank Phillips can be reached at frank.phillips@globe.com .",

      "text": "The first rule of a conversation: listen. Bio and disclosures: http://dangillmor.com/about 17 hrs ago Facebook, Google, Twitter et al need to be champions for media literacy Sorry, but I don’t want Facebook to be the arbiter of what’s true. Nor do I want Google — or Twitter or any other hyper-centralized technology platform — to be the arbiter of what’s true. But I’m glad to see platform companies at least acknowledging their role in helping spread a colossal amount of misinformation and lying propaganda. Facebook and Google have intervened in small ways, including a vow not let fake news sites make money using their advertising systems. While I strongly believe Facebook should hire some human editors to downgrade deceit — the algorithm-only approach has visibly failed — I’m leery of pushing them a lot further down a path we may all regret. But there are specific, positive steps they can take that don’t put them in the dangerous — for us as well as them — position of being the editors of the Internet, which too many people seem to be demanding right now. What are those positive steps? In a nutshell, help their users upgrade themselves. They can help their users develop skills that are absolutely essential: namely how to be critical thinkers in an age of nearly infinite information sources — how to evaluate and act on information when so much of what we see is wrong, deceitful, or even dangerous. Critical thinking means, in this context, media literacy. W hat is media literacy? From my perspective, it’s the idea that people should not be passive consumers of media, but active users who understand and rely on key principles and tactics. Among them: When we are reading (in the broadest sense of the work, to include listening, watching, etc.) we have to be relentlessly skeptical of everything. But not equally skeptical of everything; we have to use judgment. We have to ask our own questions, and range widely in our reading — especially to places where are biases will be challenged. We have to understand how media work, and how others use media to persuade and manipulate us. And we have to learn to adopt what I call a “slow news” approach to everything — to wait before we believe any so-called “breaking news” that crosses our screens. But even active consumption is not enough in a world of democratized media. We aren’t literate unless we’re also creators. And when we’re doing that — whether it’s by sharing a post on Facebook, writing in a blog, or starting a website or podcast or video series — we have to bring the consumer principles to the table and add some more. They add up to being honorable. The flood of fake online news — augmenting the long-established river of fake news from outlets like Fox — has some of its roots in people sharing not what they know to be false, but what they believe to be true. Or, more often and perniciously, what they want to be true. If everyone did as CNN’s Brian Stelter advises, “triple-check before you share,” that would be a big help. Why don’t Facebook and Google and Twitter and LinkedIn, among others, offer this advice themselves, and prominently? This is an opportunity the platform companies should seize. They could do more than almost anyone else to help us escape the new-media traps we’ve laid for ourselves. The people working hardest on media literacy (and “news literacy” among other variants on the topic) are academics, activists, and ex-journalists. They’ve amply demonstrated that it makes a difference. For example, one study showed , logically enough, that exposure to media-literacy training increased students’ “ability to comprehend, evaluate, and analyze media messages in print, video, and audio formats.” Another associated it with increased “civic participation. ” I could cite a long list of other studies that show media literacy’s genuine value. I have a horse in this race; I’ve written a book about digital media literacy, and have been teaching it at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism & Mass Communication . In the summer of 2015 I led a “massive open online course” (MOOC) called “Overcoming Information Overload.” A colleague in that project, Kristy Roschke, has analyzed the MOOC data and says it conforms with published research. (Note: my book is published under a Creative Commons license, and so are the MOOC course materials, which means they’re available for download, re-use, and remixing.) For all its obvious value, media literacy hasn’t penetrated nearly as deeply as it should, and isn’t being taught enough where it matters most: in our K-12 schools. In most districts it’s an afterthought, at best. And let’s be clear: In many parts of the United States, teaching real critical thinking would be considered by reality-denying ideologues to be dangerously radical act. Another vital cultural institution could, and should, have taken this on decades ago. I’m talking about the journalism trade. Brian Stelter’s recent CNN commentaries have been a heartening demonstration of what media organizations could be doing. But it’s tragic and damaging — to journalists themselves as well as society — that they haven’t made this a core mission. Since they haven’t, what’s the next useful point of leverage? The tech platforms are leverage to the nth power. That worries me. It is deeply unhealthy that a few giant companies — Facebook in particular — have become the epicenter of national and even global conversation. Their dominance is part of a re-centralization of communications that is already having dangerous consequences for freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and much more. I’d much rather see a combination of broad media literacy and a re-decentralized Internet. But their dominance exists, today. So I’m asking them to become the champions for a culture that values truth over lies; can tell the difference; and can act to help assure that truth has a fighting chance against the manipulators who are so efficiently poisoning our public discourse. W hat specifically can they do? Among other things: They can put media literacy front and center on their services. They can draw on the best work in the field — and ask for advice from super-experts like Renee Hobbs and Howard Rheingold (compared with them, I’m barely a dilettante in the field). The goal should be to help the rest of us understand why this matters so much and, more importantly, what we can do about it, individually and as members of communities. They can give third parties ways to help users manage the information flow, not just to avoid bogus information but, crucially also ensure that they see competing ideas challenging their own biases. They can offer better tools to users who a) don’t want to see fake news and other lies; b) want to help online communities police themselves; c) be better organized in their own consumption of media. Those are just a few of the many useful ways the platforms could bring media literacy to a vastly broader public. Will this solve the problem that’s been getting worse for a long time? Of course not. But it will help. That’s a lot better than giving up and sinking further into a swamp that at some point becomes impossible to escape. This is an emergency. Truth and context need powerful allies, and need them right now.",

      "text": "So Google has updated its Photos app , and one of the most peculiar new features is a slider called \"Deep blue.\" It’s one small part of a vastly expanded suite of color adjustments added to Google’s built-in photo editor, and at first I couldn’t understand what it was for. It did nothing when I swung it back and forth on my indoor shots of avocados and headphones. But then I tried it on a photo with some sky in it and wow! \nWhat Google’s put together is essentially a vibrance slider dedicated to the color blue. If you have a daytime sky, even a wintry one like in my photo below, this thing will saturate the blue to a rich, summery shade in a hurry. Same goes for any waterscapes or other blue-rich pictures in your collection that could do with a boost.\nI’ve messed around with the \"Deep blue\" setting on most of my outdoor shots, and it frankly works too well . There’s no real cost to using it, the image quality isn’t degraded and the rest of my colors are left untouched (obviously there’s some fringing and imperfections in the sample photo I provide, but that’s why it’s a slider and not a binary toggle). The temptation is to just give each image a perfect sky, but then what’s the point of taking a photo if I’m going to turn it into some idealized simulacrum through Google’s infinitely powerful tools?\nWith so many filters available from so many sources — Google Photos, VSCO, Instagram, Twitter, Flickr, and practically every other photo app in existence — it takes real discipline for me to just leave an image alone. When I do, it’s unsatisfying at the moment when I have cravings to tinker, but it always ends up more rewarding in hindsight, giving me the most realistic recreation of what was actually happening. You appreciate and value memories more once they start fading.\nRealism takes a backseat to prettiness in most people’s imaging preferences, and Google is serving that demand This is what troubles me about where Google’s going: perfect photos result in imperfect memories. Ever since the launch of Google+ and its \"auto awesome\" photo functions, Google has been pursuing all sorts of software-based ways to optimize and prettify mobile photographs. I think the company’s made amazing strides toward that goal, and I’m now in geeky love with the Pixel XL because of its sophisticated computational camera system that lets me take sharper and more detailed photos with the help of a ton of complex mathematics .\nBut realism isn’t Google’s priority. Google knows most of us would rather have things looking pretty than realistic, and it’s producing tools to achieve that. This \"Deep blue\" slider is just another incremental step to really lovely and cheery pictures coming out of every phone. That’s fine, that’s cool, but I think I’ll exercise my discipline and leave at least a few of my photos looking as bleak as the real world is .",

A rapid response vehicle, two ambulances and a paramedic attended the scene but were unable to save the man.

Sadly, it was almost immediately obvious that there was nothing that could be done to save him and he was confirmed dead at the scene.

      "text": "By Sean O'Connell 15 minutes ago \nWhen Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson reunited on the campus of Google for the 2013 comedy The Internship , most of us figured that's the closest we'd get to Wedding Crashers 2 (especially since that comedy didn't light the world on fire, seemingly extinguishing any hope of rekindling the Wedding Crashers fun). Lo and behold, though, original Wedding Crashers co-star Isla Fisher just appeared on the Today show to plug Nocturnal Animals , and she let it slip that a sequel is coming together. Sort of. When asked about Wedding Crashers 2 , Isla Fisher exclaimed: \nI bumped into Vince Vaughn at a party and he said apparently we are going to be making a sequel.I'm excited to see what happened to Gloria. \nWedding Crashers 2 is happening! Buy your tickets! Stand in line. Lock it up! \nOK, wait. Pump the brakes. When you keep watching the Today show clip, Isla Fisher immediately starts to tap dance, saying she doesn't know about a done deal, and that she \"probably shouldn't announce it on morning television,\" but she ends by confirming there has been \"some talk of it, which is fun.\" \nWedding Crashers came out in 2005, and paired Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as likable jerks who make it a habit to show up, uninvited, to various wedding receptions, where they charm strange family members and try to pick up girls. With no real story to speak of, it coasted on the chemistry between the leads, and allowed for breakout performances by a meaty Bradley Cooper, an unpredictable Christopher Walken, a sexy Isla Fisher and a beautiful Rachel McAdams. Oh, and Will Ferrell demanded some meatloaf. \nWedding Crashers 2 could work, though I'm not sure anyone outside of Vince Vaughn's circle of friends is clamoring for it. Vaughn, himself, has moved on to more dramatic roles, like Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge (in theaters as we speak). And like I mentioned, audiences didn't necessarily flock when Vaughn and Owen Wilson tried to rekindle the comedic magic in The Internship . \nSo, what do we think happened here? Isla Fisher bumped into Vince Vaughn, who has an idea for Wedding Crashers 2 ? Or are we farther along on a Wedding Crashers 2 script than any of us realized? Stay tuned for more details from an official source, but Isla Fisher seems convinced. What about you?  ",

      "text": "Courtesy of Google  17AM PT \nGoogle ’s Spotlight Stories team is back with yet another mobile storytelling gem: “Rain or Shine” is a cute and smart animated short that follows a little girl called Ella who wants to try out her brand-new sunglasses outside — only to find that she is being followed by a singular cloud that unloads buckets of water on her, but leaves the rest of the world dry and sunny. \nBut “Rain or Shine” isn’t just your regular animated short film. Optimized for mobile screens, it invites viewers to look around on a 360-degree stage that plays out across a typical London square. Viewers can simply tilt their phones to look up, down, left or right, as if they were to use the phone as a window into an invisible world. It’s the same technology that Google has been using for all of its Spotlight Stories, including “Duet” from Disney legend Glenn Keane and “Help” from Fast and Furious director Justin Lin. \n“Rain or Shine” takes this idea of giving viewers agency over the story further, and allows them to unlock a number of subplots as they explore the square. “We really wanted to reward looking around,” said Google Spotlight Stories executive producer Karen Dufilho. \nViewers can even influence the story by paying more or less attention to certain things. For instance, there’s a couple drinking in front of a pub. Look at them for a long time, and they’re bound to get quite tipsy. “You have to misbehave” and not just stay with the main plot, Dufhilo advises viewers. \nThe story was produced by London-based Nexus Studios in conjunction with the Spotlight Stories team from Google’s Advanced Technologies and Projects (ATAP) unit, and directed by Nexus’ animation director Felix Massie. Nexus Studios and Google folks started talking about a collaboration about two years ago. Nexus Studios co-founder and executive creative director Chris O’Reilly explained that the company wanted to focus on the story first, despite the possibilities of the medium. “Don’t pitch us gimmicks based on the technology,” the team was being told, he recalled. \n“Rain or Shine” nonetheless ended up being the most interactive Spotlight Story yet. “It has a complex narrative tree to it,” said Spotlight Stories Creative Director Jan Pinkava, who previously wrote and co-directed Pixar’s “Ratatouille.” That made the production of the piece challenging at times. The storyboard was “a spaghetti ball” of ideas and subplots, said Rosen. The goal was to have all those little pieces and ideas fit nicely together. “It’s this sort of a Swiss clock.” Related Google Shows Off First Spotlight Story on HTC Vive at Tribeca (EXCLUSIVE) \n“Rain or Shine” is being released on YouTube as well as through the Spotlight Stories app on iOS and Android, and viewers can also enjoy the experience in VR via Google’s Cardboard and Daydream VR viewers. Getting an interactive experience like this to work on the web, and as part of the regular YouTube player, represented another challenge. “‘Rain or Shine’ also pushed out streaming technology,” said Spotlight Stories Technical Project Lead Rachid El Guerrab. \nATAP first started to work on Spotlight Stories when it was still owned by Motorola, with a mandate to push the boundaries of mobile storytelling. One of the key ideas since the beginning has been a balance between giving viewers the freedom to explore sceneries and cues and plotlines that make them come back to the main story. \nIn “Buggy Nights,” ATAP’s very first Spotlight Story, this vehicle was literally a spotlight. In a way, “Rain or Shine” goes full circle on this idea by having Ella followed by a sinister cloud. “It’s the spotlight you never want to be under,” O’Reilly joked. Filed Under:",

      "text": "Google bans hundreds of accounts of people reselling Pixel phones Google bans hundreds of accounts of people reselling Pixel phones Posted: Tags : Android - Android + Google - Google + More than 200 people have reportedly had their Google accounts suspended for allegedly reselling Pixel phones, the Guardian reported. Hundreds of members of the forum of U.S.-based website Dan's Deals, primarily known for offering credit card deals, have reported their Google profiles, as well as associated backup and recovery accounts, blocked from all Google services on grounds of violating the search giant's phone resale policy.All affected users had bought Pixel phones from Google's Project Fi virtual network operator, and shipped them to a reseller in New Hapmshire, one of the U.S. states without sales tax. The N.H.-based dealer intended to resell the devices, splitting his profit with those who had sent them the phones, but their plans are currently on hold after the mass bans.According Daniel Eleff, owner of Dan's Deals, “some of those people opened multiple Google accounts in order to place orders for more than five phones and they are locked out of all the accounts,” adding that he has located and contacted the dealer, and that “the dealer is more than happy to return all the phones to Google if it will clarify the situation.” The bans are service-wide and the affected users have been denied access to all Google services, including Photos and Gmail. Even recovery accounts not used to purchase Pixel phones, but merely associated with such accounts as backup options, have also been restricted from using all Google services. “I’m not defending those who violated the terms of the sale, but I do think it is heavy-handed for Google to block access to all of their services for doing so,” wrote Eleff in a blog post on his site. “Was violating Google’s phone resale policy really worthy of an effective digital death penalty?” Google's terms of service state that customers “may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not resell any Device, but you may give the Device as a gift.” Interestingly, the N.H.-based dealer has been doing this for years with Nexus phones with no action from Google. According to him and affected members from the forums, “a few thousand” Pixel phones were ordered, which is “fewer than the amounts ordered in the past.” The affected customers are reporting that emails sent to their Gmail accounts are being returned to the sender as “undeliverable,” which would suggest that their Google identities have been wiped completely. This would mean that their photos in Google Photos, files in Google Drive, as well as all correspondence via Gmail may have been deleted.Google has not responded to any requests for comment on the ordeal yet and it is currently unknown whether the company would reinstate the affected parties' privileges.",

      "text": "print Sam Ramji Screenshot/YouTube \nGoogle has hired Sam Ramji, the CEO of the Cloud Foundry Foundation, to serve as a senior executive under Google Cloud boss Diane Greene, Business Insider has learned. \nCloud Foundry is an increasingly popular technology in programmer circles, providing developers with a set of tools that help them deliver code at the same breakneck pace and tremendous scale as Google or Facebook . As CEO of the non-profit foundation that oversees the project, Ramji is a very visible figure in that community. \nPrior to the Cloud Foundry Foundation, Ramji served as Chief Strategy Officer of Apigee, a publicly-traded company that Google recently snapped up for $625 million. Even after stepping down from his executive role, Ramji remained as advisor to Apigee. \nAnd before Apigee, Ramji spent 5 years as a Microsoft executive, from 2004 to 2009, helping refine their outreach to software developers. At Microsoft, Ramji's job was to oversee the company's efforts around open source technologies like the free Linux operating system — during a period when the company was still wary of any non-Microsoft tech. \nAll of which to say that Ramji has been around the block a few times when it comes to building technologies that appeal to developers. \nGiven that Google Cloud has been looking to win a lot of support from those same developers as it works to compete in the cloud with the leading Amazon Web Services , Ramji is a smart hire that can talk the talk and walk the walk with customers. \nIndeed, Google has been on something of a roll with its cloud hires: Earlier this week, the search giant announced that it had hired away one of Snapchat's top artificial intelligence experts to bolster Google Cloud. \nGoogle and Ramji did not respond to a request for comment at the time of publication.",

      "text": "ALERT: If You See Someone Wearing a Safety Pin, You Need to Make a Quick Decision \n“Eric Schmidt … was an enthusiastic supporter of both of Obama’s presidential campaigns and has been a major Democratic donor,” the publication added. \nPlus, Schmidt reportedly sought to be the “ head outside adviser ” to the Clinton campaign and offered advice and assistance on multiple occasions, emails from two years ago showed. \nAllegations have also been made that Google allegedly altered search recommendations in favor of Clinton’s campaign. \nTo say that Google as a corporate entity was completely in the tank for Hillary Clinton might be a bit of a stretch. But to assert that at least a large portion of it had been corrupted by Schmidt’s devotion to the former Democrat nominee would certainly be appropriate. \nH/T Washington Free Beacon \nPlease share this story on Facebook and Twitter and let us know what you think about Eric Schmidt’s close and shady connections to Hillary Clinton!

Not only is it easy, but it's also extremely intuitive. We tested it on some of our beloved pictures from the past, and can't wait to tackle the many old photo albums that preserve our family history. Here's how it works: Julie Pennell This beloved Christmas photo from 1985 was quickly and easily transformed into a jpeg with Google Photoscan. Easy as 1-2-3! 1. Download the app \nDownload the free app on your phone via the Google Play or the Apple app store. Then, grab that box of photos and get ready to bring some new life into old memories. 2. Scan away \nPlace the photo on a flat surface where direct light isn’t shining on it, and position it within the frame on the app. Julie Pennell \nRELATED: Awkward holiday photos \nOnce you click the camera button, you’ll see a round white circle and some dots will appear on the screen. Slowly move the circle so it covers each dot one at a time — this is the scanning process that essentially stitches multiple snapshots together to remove glare and improve the overall quality. \nIf you want to edit or enhance the picture, the app offers easy-to-use tools to balance levels of exposure and saturation. Or, apply any one of the 12 great filters if you want to give a specific stylized look to your image. And finally, it's easy to play with the highlights, shadows, and warm tones of pictures to get the optimal picture you're seeking. \nOn average, it takes less than 15 seconds to scan each picture. If you love the way the picture comes out, just save it directly to your camera roll! Julie Pennell 3. Share the love! \nNow that your good-as-new photo is captured on your phone's camera roll, go ahead and share the love! With just a few taps of the screen, you can share photos on Facebook, Instagram or in an email to friends and family. Happy snapping! More Organizing videos",

      "text": "IFixit Teardown of Google Home Reveals Chromecast Guts and a Little House \nIn translation, it’s almost always true that the sum is greater than its parts. Translating word-by-word often leads to hilarious gaffes like this sign, but there’s a better way. \nThat better way is all about context, which is the focus of a major update that Google just delivered to Google Translate . To deliver translations that better maintain their meaning after Google does its thing, they tapped the power of their neural network. \nGoogle has been investing heavily in machine learning for a number of years. In September, they announced that they were almost ready to deliver Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to the masses. English and Chinese were the first pairings offered up, and now they’ve expanded to include French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Turkish. \nThat’s enough to cover roughly 35% of all the queries that are submitted to Google Translate right now. That also means that if you’re looking to have some fun by forcing Translate to cook up some badly-mangled conversions that you’ll need to stick to the non-NMT languages. \nThe big difference between NMT and the old method (phrase-based) is that NMT processes whole sentences. That results in much more natural translations. Google Translate’s machine-assisted translations are actually getting quite close to what a skilled human translator would suggest. \nThey’re particularly good at handling English/Spanish and French/Spanish. Chinese is a close third, which is impressive. Chinese/English is generally considered to be “a notoriously difficult language pair,” according to Google’s NMT research team. Just take a quick look at the sign again for confirmation on that one.",

      "text": "Google DeepMind Gives Computer ‘Dreams’ to Improve Learning Jeremy Kahn November 17, 2016 — 1:53 PM EST November 17, 2016 — 1:53 PM EST Big leap seen in speed of learning, performance in games Details of processing improvement published in academic paper \nAndroids may not, as science fiction writer Philip Dick once posited, dream of electric sheep. But the newest artificial intelligence system from Google’s DeepMind division does indeed dream, metaphorically at least, about finding apples in a maze. \nResearchers at DeepMind wrote in a paper published online Thursday that they had achieved a leap in the speed and performance of a machine learning system. It was accomplished by, among other things, imbuing technology with attributes that function in a way similar to how animals are thought to dream. \nThe paper explains how DeepMind’s new system -- named Unsupervised Reinforcement and Auxiliary Learning agent, or Unreal -- learned to master a three-dimensional maze game called Labyrinth 10 times faster than the existing best AI software. It can now play the game at 87 percent the performance of expert human players, the DeepMind researchers said. \nQuickTake Artificial Intelligence \n\"Our agent is far quicker to train, and requires a lot less experience from the world to train, making it much more data efficient,\" DeepMind researchers Max Jaderberg and Volodymyr Mnih jointly wrote via e-mail. They said Unreal would allow DeepMind’s researchers to experiment with new ideas much faster because of the reduced time it takes to train the system. DeepMind has already seen its AI products achieve highly respected results teaching itself to play video games, notably the retro Atari title Breakout. Apple Maze \nLabyrinth is a game environment that DeepMind developed, loosely based on the design style used by the popular video game series Quake. It involves a machine having to navigate routes through a maze, scoring points by collecting apples. \nThis style of game is an important area for artificial intelligence research because the chance to score points in the game, and thus reinforce \"positive\" behaviors, occurs less frequently than in some other games. Additionally, the software has only partial knowledge of the maze’s layout at any one time. \nOne way the researchers achieved their results was by having Unreal replay its own past attempts at the game, focusing especially on situations in which it had scored points before. The researchers equated this in their paper to the way \"animals dream about positively or negatively rewarding events more frequently.\" \nThe researchers also helped the system learn faster by asking it to maximize several different criteria at once, not simply its overall score in the game. One of these criterion had to do with how much it could make its visual environment change by performing various actions. \"The emphasis is on learning how your actions affect what you will see,\" Jaderberg and Mnih said. They said this was also similar to the way newborn babies learn to control their environment to gain rewards -- like increased exposure to visual stimuli, such as a shiny or colorful object, they find pleasurable or interesting. \nJaderberg and Mnih, who are among seven scientists who worked on the paper, said it was \"too early to talk about real-world applications\" of Unreal or similar systems. Gaming Champions \nMastering games, from Chess to trivia contests like the U.S. gameshow Jeopardy!, have long served as important milestones in artificial intelligence research. DeepMind achieved what is considered a major breakthrough in the field earlier this year when its AlphaGo software beat one of the world’s reigning champions in the ancient strategy game Go.

Starcraft is considered one of the next milestones for AI researchers to conquer because many aspects of the game approximate \"the messiness of the real world,\" according to DeepMind researcher Oriol Vinyals. Unreal is expected to help DeepMind master the mechanics of that game. Improved Performance \nDeepMind’s Unreal system also mastered 57 vintage Atari games, such as Breakout, much faster -- and achieved higher scores -- than the company’s existing software. The researchers said Unreal could play these games on average 880 percent better than top human players, compared to 853 percent for DeepMind’s older AI agent. \nBut on the most complex Atari games, such as Montezuma’s Revenge, Jaderberg and Mnih said the new system made bigger leaps in performance. On this game, they said, the prior AI system scored zero points, while Unreal achieved 3,000 -- greater than 50 percent of an expert human’s best effort.

      "text": "A.I. beating humans? Not in my lifetime, says Google's cloud chief The so-called singularity is still some ways away, says Diane Greene Senior U.S. Correspondent,   3:35   Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google, speaks at the Code Enterprise conference in San Francisco on November 15, 2016. Credit: Martyn Williams   \nThe head of Google's cloud business says she doesn't expect machine intelligence to exceed that of humans during her lifetime, despite recent rapid progress that has surprised many. \nDiane Greene, who turns 61 this year, said that while researchers are making strides in programming intelligence into computers, there's still a long way to go. \n\"There is a lot that machine learning doesn’t do that humans can do really, really well,\" she said on Tuesday at the Code Enterprise conference in San Francisco. \nHer remarks came hours after Google said Greene's division had hired two leading machine learning and artificial intelligence experts: Fei-Fei Li, who was director of A.I. at Stanford University, and Jia Li, who headed up research at Snap, the operator of SnapChat. \n\"Nobody expected some of the advances we are seeing as quickly as we’re seeing them,\" she said, \"but, the singularity, I don’t see it in my sentient lifetime.\" \nGreene had been asked to evaluate, on a scale from one to 10, how close the industry was to \"the singularity\" -- the moment, forecast by technologist Ray Kurzweil, when machine intelligence would go beyond that of humans. \nGreene never got around to putting a number on the current state of research. But she did acknowledge that some people would lose their jobs as machine learning became more useful. \n\"I think it’s really incumbent on us to get the education out there to make sure everyone is digitally literate, because that’s where the divide is, and because if you’re digitally literate, you’re going to have jobs,\" she said. \nAt least for now, there aren't enough qualified people in the job market for the number of research jobs available, but that situation is unlikely to last, so Silicon Valley is being asked tough questions about where this push into machine intelligence will take the world. \nGreene said the industry was taking the matter seriously but offered only small efforts to solve it, like supplying Chromebooks to schools.

      "title": "Four more Chromebooks can use Android apps on Chrome OS Developer channel",
      "text": "\nGoogle is very slowly adding more Chromebooks to the list that can run Android apps and download them from the Google Play Store. This week, the company quietly added support for four more Chromebooks to run Android apps from the Chrome OS developer channel.\nRelated Articles According to 9to5Google , the four new Chromebook additions to the Android app family are the Dell Chromebook 13, the HP 13, the Samsung Chromebook 3, and the ASUS C301SA. They join the Acer R13, the Chromebook Pixel 2015, the Acer Chromebook R11 and the Asus Chromebook Flip as Chromebooks that can run Android apps and have access to the Google Play Store.\nAgain this support is only for people who install the Chrome OS build on the developer channel. In order to access that, you have to go into Settings > About Chrome OS > More Info > Change Channel and then pick the developer channel. The build should automatically begin to download on the Chromebook. Keep in mind that the developer channel build will likely have more than the usual share of bugs and issues so if that’s a problem, you might want to wait a few weeks. It’s likely that the new Android-ready Chromebooks will get support in the near future from the Chrome OS stable channel.",

      "text": "Google goes after Pixel resellers by locking their accounts Folks who profited from a tax loophole lost access to emails, photos and documents. Share Save \nGoogle has taken severe measures against Pixel buyers who violated its terms of service. Around 200 people purchased the phones via Project Fi and shipped them directly to a reseller in sales tax-free state New Hampshire, according to bargain-hunting site Dan's Deals . The phones were then resold to others, and the small profit split with the buyers. However, Google's terms dictate that buyers may not \"commercially resell\" any device and it locked their accounts, denying access to photos, emails and other personal data. \nThe dealer in question has been doing similar transactions since the original Nexus phone without any blowback from Google, according to Dan Eleff, the owner of Dan's Deals. This time, however, Mountain View effectively gave users a \"digital death penalty,\" by issuing a straight-up ban with zero warning, he says. \"I'm not defending those who violated the terms of the sale, but I do think it is heavy-handed for Google to block access to all of their services for doing so.\" \nMany users on Dan's Deals' forums weren't very sympathetic to buyers, arguing that Google was within its rights to ban them. However, the move might put a chill down Google users' spines when they realize how easily they could be cut off from their data. As Eleff points out, buyers could lose access to things like \"gift cards, bills, travel confirmations and work documents,\" throwing their lives into disarray. \nI'm not defending those who violated the terms of the sale, but I do think it is heavy-handed for Google to block access to all of their services for doing so. \nOther companies, including Amazon and Ubisoft have also banned users (for returning too many items and exploiting shoddy code), but most aren't as big a part of people's lives as Google. Mountain View has reportedly cancelled around 500 orders, but as yet, hasn't restored the functionality of any users' accounts. The dealer in question (who hasn't been named) says he's willing to return all the phones if Google agrees to give buyers their data back. \nThe lesson here, says Eleff, is \"don't mess with Google,\" but another teaching moment might be about backups. As many forum users point out, you can use Google's Takeout service to get a local backup of all your data, in case, God forbid, it shuts the door on you. We've reached out to Google for more information about the matter.",

      "text": "Business   6:32pm EST Google, an Obama ally, may face policy setbacks under Trump A Google search page is seen through a magnifying glass in this photo illustration taken in Berlin, August 11, 2015. REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski/File Photo - By David Shepardson , Malathi Nayak and Julia Love | WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO \nWASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO Alphabet Inc's Google faces a tougher regulatory landscape as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration looks poised to reverse Obama administration policies that often favored the internet giant in the company's battles with telecoms and cable heavyweights, analysts say. \nGoogle had close ties with outgoing Democratic President Barack Obama's administration, and its employees donated much more to defeated Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton than to the Republican Trump. \nIn the most concrete sign yet that the tech policy balance may be tipping in favor of telecom firms ahead of Trump's presidency, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday halted action on contentious regulatory reform measures opposed by companies such as AT&T Inc and CenturyLink Inc. \nIn addition, the commission is now expected to reject FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's high-profile proposal to open up the $20 billion market for rented pay-TV set-top boxes, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That measure would have dealt a big blow to cable companies and created an opening for firms such as Google and Apple Inc. \nObama had thrown his support behind the initiative, a move AT&T decried as an improper intervention on behalf of what it called a \"Google proposal.\" \n\"Google has been much more actively involved in this than Apple has,\" said Jan Dawson, analyst at Jackdaw Research. \"I'm not sure it's critical to Google's business at all that it be allowed to provide these next generation set-top boxes, but there was a business opportunity there.\" \nCable companies have expressed concerns that rivals like Google or Apple could create devices or apps and insert their own content or advertising in cable content. \nThe FCC's moves came a day after Republican lawmakers urged Wheeler, a Democrat, to avoid any contested regulations in the waning days of the Obama administration, saying new rules would be subject to review by the incoming Republican-led Congress and Trump's administration and \"could create confusion if reversed.\" \n\"The question is how far will the pendulum swing back\" in favor of telecom companies, said Hal Singer, senior fellow at the George Washington Institute of Public Policy. \"It has swung in Google's direction under the FCC and Chairman Wheeler.\" Among other regulations, Trump's Nov. 8 election has increased the chances that Obama's net neutrality rules, adopted by the FCC in early 2015, could be rolled back, analysts said. \nMost Republicans strongly oppose net neutrality, which requires internet service providers to treat all data equally and bars them from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content. The rules were a victory for internet firms like Google and Netflix Inc that have advocated an open internet. \nJimmy Schaeffler, telecom industry consultant at the Carmel Group, said that \"the bottom line is that things will change and there will be less optimism among and fewer opportunities\" for companies like Google that do not own the internet networks. \n\"That's going to impede their success and those that rely on what they do,\" Schaeffler added. \nRepublicans in Congress or at a Republican-controlled FCC under a Trump administration could also pare back new privacy rules adopted in October that subject internet service providers to stricter rules than those faced by Google and other websites. \nSince Trump's victory, Alphabet shares have fallen 2.4 percent, Netflix shares have dropped 5.9 percent and Amazon shares are down 2 percent. AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc shares have been relatively unchanged, while Comcast Corp shares have soared 7.7 percent. \nGoogle did not respond to requests for comment. \nEXTENSIVE TIES \nDuring Obama's presidency, more than 250 people moved between jobs at Google or related firms and the federal government, national political campaigns and Congress, according to a report this year by the Campaign for Accountability watchdog group's Google Transparency Project. \nEric Schmidt, Alphabet's executive chairman, was seen at Clinton's Election Night party wearing a staff badge in a widely circulated photo. \nIn the stolen and leaked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta disclosed by WikiLeaks, an adviser wrote a memo to Clinton in 2014 that said \"working relationships with Google, Facebook, Apple, and other technology companies were important to us in 2012 and should be even more important to you in 2016, given their still-ascendent positions in the culture.\" \n\"We have begun having discreet conversations with some of these companies to get a sense of their priorities for the coming cycle,\" the adviser wrote. \nTelecoms and cable companies have accused Wheeler of favoring Google at the expense of cable companies. Responding to the criticism, Wheeler said in May: \"I hear that allegation, and I scratch my head. I don't get that charge.\" \n\"Certainly the sort of cozy relationship that Google enjoyed with the Obama administration is not going to continue with Trump,\" Jackdaw Research's Dawson added. \nSome analysts and former Google lobbyists noted that the company similarly faced a set of challenging regulatory dynamics when it opened its Washington office in 2005, with Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress and the young tech firm widely perceived to have a liberal bent. \n\"They have a tailwind (in the Obama administration), and that does end now,\" a former Google employee at the company's Washington office said. \"But I think in the long run Google is going to be just fine in Washington. In many ways, its whole operation was built just for moments like this.\" \n(Reporting by David Shepardson and Malathi Nayak in Washington and Julia Love in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Diane Bartz, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Will Dunham) Next In Business News",

SpaceX's bold plan to deliver worldwide internet with 4,425 satellites Tech Miriam Kramer / 4 minutes ago SpaceX founder Elon Musk. Image: (AP Photo/Refugio Ruiz) \nSpaceX has big plans for bringing internet to locations around the world, and it all starts in space. \nThe Elon Musk-founded company just filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission that lays out its vision for using thousands of satellites in orbit to beam internet down to the world. \n\"The system is designed to provide a wide range of broadband and communications services for residential, commercial, institutional, governmental and professional users worldwide,\" SpaceX wrote in a supplement to the filing. SEE ALSO: Elon Musk says we're going to Mars, and we're bringing tunneling droids \nIn total, the constellation would be composed of 4,425 satellites in varying orbits, and would cost about $10 billion, according to estimates made by Musk in 2015 . \nThe constellation would begin with 800 satellites initially, the filing states, though it is unclear when they will launch. \n\"Once fully deployed, the SpaceX System will pass over virtually all parts of the Earth’s surface and therefore, in principle, have the ability to provide ubiquitous global service,\" SpaceX said in the filing. \nThis isn't the first time SpaceX has made its internet plan clear. \nElon Musk in 2015. \nImage: AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu \nMusk has spoken about the satellite system multiple times, even saying that he would want to use it to help fund a city on Mars, according to the Seattle Times . \nSpaceX also isn't alone in its ambitions for space-delivered internet. The company OneWeb hopes to launch a constellation of 648 satellites to deliver internet globally. \nBoeing also hopes to create a satellite internet system at some point. \nFacebook aspires to the same goal, but the social network experienced a setback due to a SpaceX rocket explosion . The mishap destroyed a satellite Facebook was going to use to deliver internet to parts of sub-Saharan Africa. \nSince that explosion in September, SpaceX launches have been on hold. Engineers working with the company are still hunting for the exact root cause of the rocket failure, but the company is getting closer to figuring it out. \nSpaceX estimates that they should be flying to space again before the end of the year.

      "text": "Share View photos A Google search page is seen through a magnifying glass in this photo illustration taken in Berlin, August 11, 2015. REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski/File Photo - More By David Shepardson, Malathi Nayak and Julia Love WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google faces a tougher regulatory landscape as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration looks poised to reverse Obama administration policies that often favored the internet giant in the company's battles with telecoms and cable heavyweights, analysts say. Google had close ties with outgoing Democratic President Barack Obama's administration, and its employees donated much more to defeated Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton than to the Republican Trump. In the most concrete sign yet that the tech policy balance may be tipping in favor of telecom firms ahead of Trump's presidency, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday halted action on contentious regulatory reform measures opposed by companies such as AT&T Inc and CenturyLink Inc. In addition, the commission is now expected to reject FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's high-profile proposal to open up the $20 billion market for rented pay-TV set-top boxes, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That measure would have dealt a big blow to cable companies and created an opening for firms such as Google and Apple Inc. Obama had thrown his support behind the initiative, a move AT&T decried as an improper intervention on behalf of what it called a \"Google proposal.\" \"Google has been much more actively involved in this than Apple has,\" said Jan Dawson, analyst at Jackdaw Research. \"I'm not sure it's critical to Google's business at all that it be allowed to provide these next generation set-top boxes, but there was a business opportunity there.\" Cable companies have expressed concerns that rivals like Google or Apple could create devices or apps and insert their own content or advertising in cable content. The FCC's moves came a day after Republican lawmakers urged Wheeler, a Democrat, to avoid any contested regulations in the waning days of the Obama administration, saying new rules would be subject to review by the incoming Republican-led Congress and Trump's administration and \"could create confusion if reversed.\" \"The question is how far will the pendulum swing back\" in favor of telecom companies, said Hal Singer, senior fellow at the George Washington Institute of Public Policy. \"It has swung in Google's direction under the FCC and Chairman Wheeler.\" Among other regulations, Trump's Nov. 8 election has increased the chances that Obama's net neutrality rules, adopted by the FCC in early 2015, could be rolled back, analysts said. Most Republicans strongly oppose net neutrality, which requires internet service providers to treat all data equally and bars them from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content. The rules were a victory for internet firms like Google and Netflix Inc that have advocated an open internet. Jimmy Schaeffler, telecom industry consultant at the Carmel Group, said that \"the bottom line is that things will change and there will be less optimism among and fewer opportunities\" for companies like Google that do not own the internet networks. \"That's going to impede their success and those that rely on what they do,\" Schaeffler added. Republicans in Congress or at a Republican-controlled FCC under a Trump administration could also pare back new privacy rules adopted in October that subject internet service providers to stricter rules than those faced by Google and other websites. Since Trump's victory, Alphabet shares have fallen 2.4 percent, Netflix shares have dropped 5.9 percent and Amazon shares are down 2 percent. AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc shares have been relatively unchanged, while Comcast Corp shares have soared 7.7 percent. Google did not respond to requests for comment. EXTENSIVE TIES During Obama's presidency, more than 250 people moved between jobs at Google or related firms and the federal government, national political campaigns and Congress, according to a report this year by the Campaign for Accountability watchdog group's Google Transparency Project. Eric Schmidt, Alphabet's executive chairman, was seen at Clinton's Election Night party wearing a staff badge in a widely circulated photo. In the stolen and leaked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta disclosed by WikiLeaks, an adviser wrote a memo to Clinton in 2014 that said \"working relationships with Google, Facebook, Apple, and other technology companies were important to us in 2012 and should be even more important to you in 2016, given their still-ascendent positions in the culture.\" Read More \"We have begun having discreet conversations with some of these companies to get a sense of their priorities for the coming cycle,\" the adviser wrote. Telecoms and cable companies have accused Wheeler of favoring Google at the expense of cable companies. Responding to the criticism, Wheeler said in May: \"I hear that allegation, and I scratch my head. I don't get that charge.\" \"Certainly the sort of cozy relationship that Google enjoyed with the Obama administration is not going to continue with Trump,\" Jackdaw Research's Dawson added. Some analysts and former Google lobbyists noted that the company similarly faced a set of challenging regulatory dynamics when it opened its Washington office in 2005, with Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress and the young tech firm widely perceived to have a liberal bent. \"They have a tailwind (in the Obama administration), and that does end now,\" a former Google employee at the company's Washington office said. \"But I think in the long run Google is going to be just fine in Washington. In many ways, its whole operation was built just for moments like this.\" (Reporting by David Shepardson and Malathi Nayak in Washington and Julia Love in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Diane Bartz, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Will Dunham) Reblog",

      "text": "Don’t mess with Google.\nThat’s the message that more than 200 people have learned the hard way, after the arm of Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.88% GOOGL, +0.79% imposed digital death sentences on them for reselling their new Pixel smartphones in violation of the terms of service .\nBargain-hunting blog Dan’s Deals first reported the crackdown , which started Sunday and affected people who bought Pixel smartphones from Google’s online store and sent them to a reseller in New Hampshire, who marked up the prices and paid them a part of the profits.\nLooking to make a quick buck turned out to have a stiff price — once Google figured out the scheme, they disabled the Google accounts of the original buyers, blocking them from Gmail, Google Photos, Google Drive, the Google Store and other services. Users were told their data would be deleted unless they successfully appealed their punishment.\nGoogle Pixel vs. iPhone 7: A Day in the Life (3:24) What happens when you replace your iPhone with the Android iPhone? WSJ's Joanna Stern compares the iPhone 7 and its lookalike, the Google Pixel, during a day of fun-filled adventures. Photo: Joanna Stern/The Wall Street Journal.\nThose locked out from their accounts were stunned. “There isn’t an hour that doesn’t go by that I don’t think about the enormity of what Google has done to me,” reseller Shmuel Super of Brooklyn told the Associated Press . “Google’s slogan is ‘Don’t be evil,’ but to me, there is nothing more evil that what Google has done here.”\n“It’s the 21st century version of losing priceless mementos in a house fire,” wrote Daniel Eloff of Dan’s Deals. “I’m not defending those who violated the terms of the sale, but I do think it is heavy-handed for Google to block access to all of their services for doing so. Was violating Google’s phone resale policy really worthy of an effective digital death penalty?”\nGoogle responded with some mercy Thursday, saying that while “we prohibit the commercial resale of devices . . . so everyone has an equal opportunity to purchase devices at a fair price,” it would restore access to “genuine” accounts, as opposed to accounts opened just to buy the phone for the scheme, Dan’s Deals reported.\nBut none of the accounts had been unlocked as of Thursday night, and Google didn’t say when access would be restored.\nGoogle isn’t alone in lowering the hammer on those trying to game the system. Earlier this year, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.33% said it would impose lifetime bans on people who abuse their returns policy.\nApple also bans the resale of its phones, though its terms of service only mentions it can cancel the order — nothing about disabling its services.\nMore from MarketWatch How Trump Won the Presidency Opinion Journal: Electoral College Under Threat Kellyanne Conway Discusses How to ‘Drain the Swamp’",

      "text": "Reddit \nOne of the biggest criticisms of Google’s open mobile platform is security. For some, especially those looking from the iOS camp, Android’s security framework is a joke. That’s not to say that Google hasn’t been working on improving the situation significantly. Especially in its first ever “by Google” smartphone, the Pixel . Now Google briefly explains some of the added security measures implemented for the device, specifically on the rather contentious topic of encryption. \nWhile smartphones, both iPhone and Android, have been capable of encrypting their storage for quite a while now, the matter really came to a head this year when Apple was ordered by a court on the FBI’s behalf to unlock the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone. Since then, encrypting mobile devices has been become a common recommendation to protect one’s self from spying or hacking. \nIn the Pixel, Google implemented file-based encryption or FBE, as opposed to full disk encryption (FDE) that is the most common method used on smartphones. In a nutshell, this means that different files get encrypted and later decrypted with different keys. There are some benefits to this system, as it allows Android to have handle different types of encrypted data at different times. For example, during boot, you can immediately get access to important functionality, like alarms and phones, immediately, without having to wait for the device to be decrypted. \nBut encryption’s promise of security does come at the price of performance. On beefier desktop computers and SSDs, that might be negligible. Not so for smartphones with more meager resources. That is why for the Pixel, Google ditched the industry-standard eCryptFS for a slightly newer encryption feature baked right inside the Linux ext4 filesystem. With this, Google was able to implement file-based encryption with the same speed as full disk encryption. \nFor those not using Pixel smartphones, the new FBE encryption is also available as long as they are running on Android Nougat. The new ext4-based encryption, however, is still too new and is currently only for Pixel owners.",

      "text": "Full Fact wants to automate fact checking to fight fake news And it's doing so with help from Google. Save Kagenmi via Getty Images \n\"If we can't discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda, then we have problems.\" That's President Obama speaking to the threat of outright fake and inaccurate news. In an effort to combat this, and ensure that people are well-informed, UK charity Full Fact is trying to make fact checking fully automated. So far it's working on UK-focused stuff like what members of Parliament say during addresses, and claims made by trade groups in addition to print, online and broadcast media organizations, according to TechCrunch . But in the future, it plans to cross the Atlantic. \nFull Fact staffers will keep checking a claim even after their initial report publishes, too, will address corrections and retractions from sources as well. The human touch is key, because sometimes analyzing what's available requires context and judgment, according to project director Will Moy. \n\"Some types of claims can be handled as easily as spellcheck, including claims that were fact checked by human beings before,\" he told TechCrunch . \"But some claims will always require human judgment, for example, about what's a fair and balanced way of expressing things, or what methods of analysis should be applied to answer a question about crime.\" The primary aim is giving journalists the tools needed to see if a statement made on out of date statistics, or patently wrong, but Full Fact wants its tools to help inform the people who read news in addition to writing it as well. The current plan is for mobile and web apps, and to help get there, Google's Digital News Initiative (GDNI) has contributed some EURO 50,000 ($53,113) to help make that happen. Full Fact says that to guard against conflicts of interest, it's limiting a single entity from donating more than 15 percent of its total funding.\nFrom GDNI's donation overview : \n\"FACTS will be the first fully automated factchecking tool: our original technology will recognise claims in political debates and online media and immediately alert journalists if they are inaccurate. FACTS will give journalists the killer question the moment they need it. It will save time, when journalists have never had less. \nIt will help stop misinformation spreading through the news. It will help journalism maintain the credibility that audiences demand. Our tool has two modes. One identifies claims we have factchecked before and provides a verdict. \nThe most innovative mode factchecks claims automatically using statistical analysis—something never done before.\"",

      "text": "Some of Google's unwitting users are learning a harsh lesson: If you violate the company's policies, it can abruptly cut you off from your Gmail account, online photos and other vital digital services.\nSeveral people who recently bought Google's new Pixel phone on behalf of a New Hampshire dealer are now suffering that punishment after the company detected their online purchases and judged they violated its terms of service. Those rules, outlined in a document that few people read closely , forbid the purchase of the Pixel for \"commercial\" resale.\n\"There isn't an hour that doesn't go by that I don't think about the enormity of what Google has done to me,\" said one of the affected resellers, Shmuel Super of Brooklyn, New York. \"This is like a digital death sentence.\"\nSELL YOUR PHONE, LOSE YOUR ACCOUNT\nSuper and his fellow resellers got into trouble for buying up to five Pixel phones from Google's online store and having them delivered to New Hampshire for resale. They received $5 for each phone. As of Sunday, some started finding themselves locked out of their Google accounts.\nIn a Thursday statement, Google described the resale arrangement as a \"scheme\" devised by a dealer looking to sell the Pixels at marked-up prices in violation of its policies.\nGoogle declined to say how many people were affected by the account lockdown. DansDeals , a consumer-focused website that first reported Google's crackdown, concluded that more than 200 people had been blocked from their Google accounts after talking to the New Hampshire dealer behind the Pixel buying spree. The Associated Press was unsuccessful in its efforts to identify and interview the dealer.\nThe crackdown may come as a surprise to the hundreds of millions of people who now routinely rely on Google, Facebook, Apple and other tech companies as the caretakers of their digital lives. Few of the people involved in this situation appear to have backed up their data outside of Google.\nGoogle said it plans to restore the accounts of customers who it believes were unaware of the rules, although the company didn't specify how long that might take.\nLIVING WITHOUT GOOGLE\nOnce they figured out why they were being locked out, the exiled consumers realized how dependent they had become on Google as the custodian of their digital communications, records and other mementoes.\nSome said they couldn't retrieve confirmation numbers for upcoming flights or notices about an upcoming credit-card payment. Others couldn't fetch work documents or medical records. Some started getting phone calls from friends, family and colleagues wondering why they weren't responding to emails.\nLike other two other people interviewed by the AP, Super said he had no idea that he was violating Google's policies when he bought the Pixels for the New Hampshire dealer. He can't believe Google would do something as extreme as locking him out of his account without warning, rather than just banning him from buying its phones in the future.\n\"Google's slogan is 'Don't be evil,' but to me, there is nothing more evil that what Google has done here,\" Super said.\nCRIME AND PUNISHMENT\nSome of the Pixels purchased for resale were delivered before Google recognized the violations and meted out a punishment spelled out in a separate terms-of-service document . \"We may suspend or stop providing our services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct,\" Google warns in one section.\nGoogle doesn't give any advance notice before it shuts down an account, and doesn't make distinctions between minor and major violations. Affected users can appeal for reinstatement, though it's unclear how long that might take or what criteria Google uses in such cases.\nApple also forbids online purchases of iPhones for resale, although its terms of service say only that the company reserves the right to cancel any order suspected of breaking the rule.\nDaniel Levy, who has been locked out from his Google account since Monday, said he has learned a hard lesson, though not necessarily the one the company intended.\n\"They confiscated my property and shouldn't be trusted,\" said Levy, who lives in Lakewood, New Jersey . \"I will never use their services again.\"\n  Google Hits Pixel Resellers With 'Digital Death Sentence' Facebook Boosts Efforts to 'Do Good' With New Tools \" \nRocket Carrying Crew of 3 Blasts off for Int'l Space Station US Solar Panel Maker to Cut 1,600 Jobs, 450 at Plant in Ohio Tesla, SolarCity Get Shareholder Approval for Merger The Latest: Ohio Solar Panel Plant Will Lose 450 Jobs Message to Trump?

Google handles its maps service at data centers outside South Korea and the restrictions have left Google Maps unable to offer driving or walking directions in the country. \nSouth Korea is divided over the issue. Opponents argue that giving Google a license would be unfair to local companies. Supporters said South Korea needs to promote innovation and new services.",

      "text": "Google Pixel Resellers See Their Google Accounts Locked for Violating Terms of Service Reddit \nSome of Google's unwitting users are learning a harsh lesson: If you violate the company's policies, it can abruptly cut you off from your Gmail account, online photos and other vital digital services. \nSeveral people who recently bought Google's new Pixel phone on behalf of a New Hampshire dealer are now suffering that punishment after the company detected their online purchases and judged they violated its terms of service. Those rules, outlined in a document that few people read closely , forbid the purchase of the Pixel for \"commercial\" resale. \n\"There isn't an hour that doesn't go by that I don't think about the enormity of what Google has done to me,\" said one of the affected resellers, Shmuel Super of Brooklyn, New York. \"This is like a digital death sentence.\" \nSell your phone, lose your account Super and his fellow resellers got into trouble for buying up to five Pixel phones from Google's online store and having them delivered to New Hampshire for resale. They received $5 for each phone. As of Sunday, some started finding themselves locked out of their Google accounts. In a Thursday statement, Google described the resale arrangement as a \"scheme\" devised by a dealer looking to sell the Pixels at marked-up prices in violation of its policies.\n( Also see: Google Pixel Allegedly Hacked in Under a Minute at PwnFest ) \nGoogle declined to say how many people were affected by the account lockdown. DansDeals , a consumer-focused website that first reported Google's crackdown, concluded that more than 200 people had been blocked from their Google accounts after talking to the New Hampshire dealer behind the Pixel buying spree. The Associated Press was unsuccessful in its efforts to identify and interview the dealer. \nThe crackdown may come as a surprise to the hundreds of millions of people who now routinely rely on Google , Facebook , Apple and other tech companies as the caretakers of their digital lives. Few of the people involved in this situation appear to have backed up their data outside of Google. \nGoogle said it plans to restore the accounts of customers who it believes were unaware of the rules, although the company didn't specify how long that might take. \nLiving without Google Once they figured out why they were being locked out, the exiled consumers realized how dependent they had become on Google as the custodian of their digital communications, records and other mementoes. \nSome said they couldn't retrieve confirmation numbers for upcoming flights or notices about an upcoming credit-card payment. Others couldn't fetch work documents or medical records. Some started getting phone calls from friends, family and colleagues wondering why they weren't responding to emails. \nLike other two other people interviewed by the AP, Super said he had no idea that he was violating Google's policies when he bought the Pixels for the New Hampshire dealer. He can't believe Google would do something as extreme as locking him out of his account without warning, rather than just banning him from buying its phones in the future. \n\"Google's slogan is 'Don't be evil,' but to me, there is nothing more evil that what Google has done here,\" Super said. \nCrime and punishment Some of the Pixels purchased for resale were delivered before Google recognized the violations and meted out a punishment spelled out in a separate terms-of-service document . \"We may suspend or stop providing our services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct,\" Google warns in one section. \nGoogle doesn't give any advance notice before it shuts down an account, and doesn't make distinctions between minor and major violations. Affected users can appeal for reinstatement, though it's unclear how long that might take or what criteria Google uses in such cases. \nApple also forbids online purchases of iPhones for resale, although its terms of service say only that the company reserves the right to cancel any order suspected of breaking the rule. \nDaniel Levy, who has been locked out from his Google account since Monday, said he has learned a hard lesson, though not necessarily the one the company intended. \n\"They confiscated my property and shouldn't be trusted,\" said Levy, who lives in Lakewood, New Jersey. \"I will never use their services again.\"",

      "text": "Google has suspended hundreds of accounts owned by people who took part in a smartphone resale scheme designed to exploit a loophole in sales tax law.\nThe banned accounts had apparently all ordered Google Pixel phones to be shipped to a single address in New Hampshire, a state with no sales tax. From there, a vendor resold the phones and then split the tax-free profits with participating users.\nSEE ALSO: Millennials wearing Snapchat Spectacles could be a privacy disaster\nGoogle said the coordinated operation was a violation of its purchase terms, which ban any commercial resale of its hardware.\nThe company's crackdown was first reported by the cost-cutting tips blog Dan's Deals , after site owner Daniel Eleff heard from many of the users affected.\nMore than 200 people were reportedly locked out of their accounts when his initial article was published.\nInstead of just banning the users from Google's online store, the company shut them out of all of the services under the search engine's umbrella, including saved photos, documents and email.\n\"I’m not defending those who violated the terms of the sale,\" Eleff wrote, \"but I do think it is heavy-handed for Google to block access to all of their services for doing so.\"\n\"Was violating Google’s phone resale policy really worthy of an effective digital death penalty?\"\nA Google spokesperson said in a statement Thursday afternoon that the company took action after it noticed an unusual number of phones being directed to a single address.\nThe company claims that many people seemed to be creating fake shell accounts for the sole purpose of the scheme, and it is now in the process of unlocking those that it deems to be legitimate.\n\"We prohibit the commercial resale of devices purchased through Project Fi or the Google Store so everyone has an equal opportunity to purchase devices at a fair price,\" the company said in a statement. \" After investigating the situation, we are restoring access to genuine accounts for customers who are locked out of many Google services they rely on.\"\nThe New Hampshire reseller responsible for setting up the deal has organized similar arrangements involving Google products in the past without any penalty, Eleff said.\nEleff told Mashable in an email that he has yet to hear from any users who've had their account restored.\nHe still thinks the punishment was unnecessarily harsh.\n\"Shutting off all Google Services seems draconian to me and blocking access to past data, which is supposed to be owned by the user, is just beyond the pale,\" Eleff said. \"The punishment doesn't seem to fit the crime.\"\nAs a growing portion of people's online lives are consolidated onto a handful of platforms owned by major corporations, wielding this kind of power over users can have far-reaching implications. Oftentimes, users entrust Google with storing priceless family photos, valuable documents and critical emails.\nAmazon customers who've run afoul of the e-commerce giant have faced similarly devastating consequences — losing out on pre-paid memberships and media they supposedly owned.\n\"It’s the 21st century version of losing priceless mementos in a house fire,\" Eleff said.",

Picture taken July 11, 2016. Photo: Reuters/Morris Mac Matzen Reuters, Washington/San Francisco \nAlphabet Inc's Google faces a tougher regulatory landscape as US President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration looks poised to reverse Obama administration policies that often favored the internet giant in the company's battles with telecoms and cable heavyweights, analysts say. \nGoogle had close ties with outgoing Democratic President Barack Obama's administration, and its employees donated much more to defeated Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton than to the Republican Trump. \nIn the most concrete sign yet that the tech policy balance may be tipping in favor of telecom firms ahead of Trump's presidency, the US Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday halted action on contentious regulatory reform measures opposed by companies such as AT&T Inc and CenturyLink Inc. \nIn addition, the commission is now expected to reject FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's high-profile proposal to open up the $20 billion market for rented pay-TV set-top boxes, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That measure would have dealt a big blow to cable companies and created an opening for firms such as Google and Apple Inc. \nObama had thrown his support behind the initiative, a move AT&T decried as an improper intervention on behalf of what it called a \"Google proposal.\" \n\"Google has been much more actively involved in this than Apple has,\" said Jan Dawson, analyst at Jackdaw Research. \"I'm not sure it's critical to Google's business at all that it be allowed to provide these next generation set-top boxes, but there was a business opportunity there.\" \nCable companies have expressed concerns that rivals like Google or Apple could create devices or apps and insert their own content or advertising in cable content. \nThe FCC's moves came a day after Republican lawmakers urged Wheeler, a Democrat, to avoid any contested regulations in the waning days of the Obama administration, saying new rules would be subject to review by the incoming Republican-led Congress and Trump's administration and \"could create confusion if reversed.\" \n\"The question is how far will the pendulum swing back\" in favor of telecom companies, said Hal Singer, senior fellow at the George Washington Institute of Public Policy. \"It has swung in Google's direction under the FCC and Chairman Wheeler.\" \nAmong other regulations, Trump's November 8 election has increased the chances that Obama's net neutrality rules, adopted by the FCC in early 2015, could be rolled back, analysts said. \nMost Republicans strongly oppose net neutrality, which requires internet service providers to treat all data equally and bars them from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content. The rules were a victory for internet firms like Google and Netflix Inc that have advocated an open internet. \nJimmy Schaeffler, telecom industry consultant at the Carmel Group, said that \"the bottom line is that things will change and there will be less optimism among and fewer opportunities\" for companies like Google that do not own the internet networks. \n\"That's going to impede their success and those that rely on what they do,\" Schaeffler added. \nRepublicans in Congress or at a Republican-controlled FCC under a Trump administration could also pare back new privacy rules adopted in October that subject internet service providers to stricter rules than those faced by Google and other websites. \nSince Trump's victory, Alphabet shares have fallen 2.4 percent, Netflix shares have dropped 5.9 percent and Amazon shares are down 2 percent. AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc shares have been relatively unchanged, while Comcast Corp shares have soared 7.7 percent. \nGoogle did not respond to requests for comment. EXTENSIVE TIES \nDuring Obama's presidency, more than 250 people moved between jobs at Google or related firms and the federal government, national political campaigns and Congress, according to a report this year by the Campaign for Accountability watchdog group's Google Transparency Project. \nEric Schmidt, Alphabet's executive chairman, was seen at Clinton's Election Night party wearing a staff badge in a widely circulated photo. \nIn the stolen and leaked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta disclosed by WikiLeaks, an adviser wrote a memo to Clinton in 2014 that said \"working relationships with Google, Facebook, Apple, and other technology companies were important to us in 2012 and should be even more important to you in 2016, given their still-ascendent positions in the culture.\" \n\"We have begun having discreet conversations with some of these companies to get a sense of their priorities for the coming cycle,\" the adviser wrote. \nTelecoms and cable companies have accused Wheeler of favoring Google at the expense of cable companies. Responding to the criticism, Wheeler said in May: \"I hear that allegation, and I scratch my head. I don't get that charge.\" \n\"Certainly the sort of cozy relationship that Google enjoyed with the Obama administration is not going to continue with Trump,\" Jackdaw Research's Dawson added. \nSome analysts and former Google lobbyists noted that the company similarly faced a set of challenging regulatory dynamics when it opened its Washington office in 2005, with Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress and the young tech firm widely perceived to have a liberal bent. \n\"They have a tailwind (in the Obama administration), and that does end now,\" a former Google employee at the company's Washington office said. \"But I think in the long run Google is going to be just fine in Washington. In many ways, its whole operation was built just for moments like this.\"  ",

      "text": " Google+\nAP Photo/ Evan Vucci, File\nPresident-elect Donald Trump spoke during a rally in New York on Nov. 9.\nBy Beth Healy Globe Staff November 17, 2016\nBradford Malt, the Boston lawyer who served as trustee for Mitt Romney’s blind trusts while he was governor and twice ran for president, has some advice for Donald Trump: You don’t get to be the leader of the free world and cling to all your business interests.\n“It’s a basic tenet of democracy, that public servants owe their undivided loyalty to the government, and the decisions they make are in the public interest,’’ Malt said. “It’s about integrity.”\nAdvertisement\nThe trouble is, there’s no law requiring Trump to turn over his assets to a blind trust. In fact, presidents are exempt from the conflict-of-interest rules that apply to others in the Executive branch.\nNonetheless, presidents are expected to divest themselves of businesses or assets that create the appearance of conflicts while holding office. Malt says it comes down to this — presidents must appoint a trustee to sell off any such holdings and allow their money to be reinvested, out of their sight.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. Sign If Trump fails to do this, Malt said, “It’s going to undermine confidence in the government. It’s going to undermine his campaign promise to `drain the swamp.’’’\nMost other presidents have followed this unwritten rule, Malt said. One exception is Barack Obama, who owns plain vanilla securities like Treasury bonds and index mutual funds, which are not considered a conflict.\nTrump has a particularly complex array of business assets, including hotels, golf courses, and large residential towers. But he is hardly the first wealthy person to run for higher office.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Romney was Massachusetts governor from 2003 to 2007, he was able to retain, in a blind trust, holdings worth hundreds of millions of dollars in Bain Capital, the Boston private equity firm he helped start.\nBut had Romney, a Republican, won the presidential election in 2012, Malt would have sold those stakes, he said. He would have sought to ensure that Romney could not be seen as profiting from policies related to private equity investments and the buying and selling of large companies both in the United States and abroad.\nIn Trump’s case, the billionaire businessman so far has said he will transfer management of his operations to his children. Critics say that falls far short of the standard.\n“We are in the process of vetting various structures with the goal of the immediate transfer of management of the Trump Organization and its portfolio of businesses to Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric Trump as well as a team of highly skilled executives,’’ Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement on behalf of the “Trump Organization.” The statement continued, “This is a top priority at the organization and the structure that is ultimately selected will comply with all applicable rules and regulations.’’\nHowever, under the scenario presented by Trump, Americans could reasonably question whether his policies to cut corporate taxes or push pro-business measures or get along with China were aimed at helping America or intended to boost his children’s portfolios.\n“It’s human nature to have that in the back of your mind, what your own self interests are,’’ said Christine Fletcher, a partner at the Boston firm Burns & Levinson. She said she believes there should be a law requiring presidents to divest of their business assets.\n“There should be a lot of continued political pressure” for Trump to give up his business interests, Fletcher said. “His holdings are so extensive. We don’t even know what they all are; they’re global and throughout the world.’’ Transferring the business to his children would mean he’d no longer have to list those assets on his annual financial disclosure form, lawyers said. But it would not relieve the conflict-of-interest problem.\nMalt said Trump should step back and ask himself, “What’s good government? What avoids the appearance of impropriety?”\nSelling such a large pool of assets all at once may not be ideal, Malt acknowledged. But, “Nobody asked him to be president. He made his choice.”\nBeth Healy can be reached at beth.healy@globe.com . Follow her on Twitter @HealyBeth .",

      "text": " Google+\nTobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty Images\nPresident Obama held a press conference in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nBy David Rising and Josh Lederman Associated Press November 17, 2016\nBERLIN — Offering pointed foreign policy advice to his successor, President Barack Obama expressed hope Thursday that President-elect Donald Trump will stand up to Russia when it deviates from U.S. ‘‘values and international norms’’ and not simply ‘‘cut some deals’’ with Vladimir Putin when convenient.\nObama, in a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during his final presidential visit to Germany, said that while he does not expect Trump to ‘‘follow exactly our blueprint or our approach’’ he is hopeful that Trump will pursue constructive policies that defend democratic values and the rule of law.\nAdvertisement\nHe said Trump shouldn’t ‘‘simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest that if we just cut some deals with Russia, even if it hurts people or even if it violates international norms or even if it leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long-term problems in regions like Syria, that we just do whatever’s convenient at the time.’’\nObama began his presidency with a goal to ‘‘reset’’ ties with Russia, but they eventually plunged to the lowest point since the Cold War over conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break Sign Trump has spoken favorably of Putin but has outlined few specifics as to how he would go about recalibrating ties with the counry.\nView Story In Berlin, Obama says he won’t tell anti-Trump protesters to be silent At a joint press conference with the German leader, President Obama said a healthy democracy requires an engaged people.\nMerkel, for her part, said she was approaching the incoming Trump administration with ‘‘an open mind’’ and was encouraged that the presidential process in the U.S. was ‘‘working smoothly’’ so far.\nIt was the final meeting of Obama and Merkel as peers on the world stage, and both leaders spoke glowingly of each other’s leadership. Merkel was matter of fact about the coming transition in power in the U.S., saying, ‘‘We all know that democracy lives off change.’’ As for the limit on U.S. presidents serving two terms, Merkel said simply, ‘‘It’s a tough rule: Eight years and that’s it.’’\nAdvertisement\nObama, speaking broadly about the incoming president, said he was ‘‘cautiously optimistic’’ because ‘‘there is something about the solemn responsibilities of that office, the extraordinary demands that are placed on the United States,’’ that demand seriousness from a president.\n‘‘If you’re not serious about the job, then you probably won’t be there very long because it will expose problems,’’ Obama said.\nObama said he had cautioned Trump that the skills that got him elected may be different from those needed to unify the country and to gain the trust of those who didn’t support him. People will be watching ‘‘what he says’’ and ‘‘how he fills out his administration,’’ Obama added.\nObama had some advice for the American people, as well, advising them not to be complacent about democracy, noting that only 43 percent of eligible voters went to the polls.\n‘‘Do not take for granted our systems of government and our way of life,’’ he said. ‘‘Democracy is hard work.’’\nHe said he wouldn’t advise those protesting Trump’s election to keep silent.\nIn Germany, officials hope the change in presidents will not bring about a significant shift in relations between the two nations or the NATO alliance.\nMerkel worked well with President George W. Bush before Obama’s election. She talked with Trump by phone after his election, offering him Germany’s ‘‘close cooperation,’’ but emphasizing it would be on the basis of what she said were shared values of ‘‘democracy, freedom, respect for the law and for the dignity of human beings, independently of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views.’’\nA joint opinion piece by Obama and Merkel published Thursday in Germany’s weekly business magazine WirtschaftsWoche seemed directed as much at the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. as at European nations. In it, the two leaders stressed that the ‘‘underlying bedrock of our shared values is strong’’ even if the pursuit of common goals is sometimes gone about differently.\nObama and Merkel noted that European Union-U.S. trade was the largest between any two partners worldwide, and emphasized that the trans-Atlantic friendship has helped forge a climate accord, provide help for refugees worldwide, form a collective defense under NATO, and strengthen the global fight against the Islamic State extremist group.\nTrump, in contrast, has called climate change a ‘‘hoax’’ and said the climate accord should be renegotiated. He promised to tighten rules for accepting refugees, complained the U.S. was paying more than its share to support NATO and has sharply criticized the U.S. strategy for fighting IS.\nMerkel and Obama have enjoyed a close relationship over the years, and Obama seems to be counting on the German leader’s strength to help counter the isolationist tone voiced by Trump during the election campaign.\nThe mood for Obama’s latest visit was significantly tamped down compared with his first visit to the German capital in 2008, when some 200,000 exuberant fans packed the road between the landmark Brandenburg Gate and Victory Column to hear the then-candidate, in a speech that solidified his place on the world stage.\nObama told Berliners then that progress requires sacrifice and shared burdens among allies.\n‘‘That is why America cannot turn inward,’’ Obama told the cheering crowd. ‘‘That is why Europe cannot turn inward.’’\nEight years later, his words seem to have foreshadowed the nationalist, isolationist forces gaining traction in some parts of Europe and punctuated by Trump’s victory in the U.S. election.\nIn Berlin, Obama will also meet Friday with the leaders of France, Italy, Spain and Britain. Obama’s last stop on his final foreign tour will be Peru over the weekend.\nRelated In Berlin, Obama says he won’t tell anti-Trump protesters to be silent",

      "text": " Google+\nChandler Burgess/Killington\nThere may not be much snow elsewhere in New England, but Killington has plenty on its Superstar trail.\nBy Matt Pepin Globe Staff November 17, 2016\nThe World Cup ski races planned for Vermont’s Killington Resort Nov. 26-27 are officially a go.\nThe International Ski Federation on Thursday confirmed the event after inspecting the conditions on the Superstar trail. Killington has been making and stockpiling snow since October for the women’s slalom and giant slalom races. At one point there was 20 feet of snow at the top of Superstar, according to Killington spokesman Michael Joseph.\nAdvertisement\n“This positive snow control news from FIS reinforces what we already knew — that Killington has ample snow on Superstar to host the world’s fastest female ski racers,” said Mike Solimano, Killington’s general manager, “and our mountain operations team has the knowledge and horsepower to make more snow in the early season than any other ski area in the country.”\nKillington will host the first World Cup skiing event in New England since 1991, when Waterville Valley in New Hampshire hosted the World Cup finals.\nGrandstand and VIP tickets for the World Cup are sold out, but general admission is free. The event will also include a World Cup expo and free concert by the music group O.A.R. on Nov 26.\nCourtesy of Killington\nSki racer Mikaela Shiffrin checked out the conditions at Killington this week.\nFollow Matt Pepin on Twitter at @mattpep15 .",

      "text": " Google+\nWin McNamee/Getty Images\nNancy Pelosi\nBy Scot Lehigh Globe Columnist November 17, 2016\nI t’s time f or Nancy Pelosi to go. Past time, really.\nIt would have been appropriate for her to say goodbye after the Republicans took control of the House — ending her speakership — with their big 2010 midterm victory.\nAdvertisement\nInstead, Pelosi stuck around as minority leader, hoping for a return to power. It didn’t come in 2012, despite President Obama’s solid reelection victory. Nor did it come in 2014.\nThis year was another disappointment. Despite early talk of possibly retaking the House — or short of that, making a big bounce back — the Democrats have seemingly gained only six seats, leaving them far from power.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign It’s now time to give someone else a chance.\nView Story After a big loss, Democrats need reform Whether or not Nancy Pelosi wins reelection as minority leader, Congressional Democrats clearly need to take a hard look at reforming their party.\nThat’s happened in the Senate. Minority leader Harry Reid, 76, opted not to run for reelection this year. But in the House, Pelosi, also 76, wants to hang on.\nShe hoped to force a quick election for the Democratic leadership post, a tactic she’s used in the past. That hurry-up offense helps her, because it leaves potential opponents little opportunity to organize. But House Democrats balked, insisting they need more time to mull matters. As a result, the vote won’t be held until the end of November.\nAdvertisement\nPelosi has tried to scare off any competition, claiming in a Wednesday letter that she had the support “of more than two-thirds” of the House Democratic Caucus. But on Thursday, Ohio Representative Tim Ryan announced he was making the plunge. Certainly displacing Pelosi will be an uphill battle. Leadership struggles generally are, because the bulk of the membership waits to see if a challenger is viable before abandoning their current leader.\nStill, Democratic congressfolk, who have given heavily from their campaign committees to boost Team Pelosi’s take-back-the-House efforts, only to see those prospects recede like a mirage in the electoral desert, are stewing with frustration.\nThe issue of leadership has become more urgent as members consider how to reconnect with the white working-class voters who powered Donald Trump to victory. That’s a problem\nRyan has highlighted. And it’s certainly hard to see Pelosi as the answer to that puzzle.\n“She is likely to win this again, but there’s a lot of heartburn in the caucus,” says one congressman. “There’s broad agreement we need a strategic shift.”\nAnd that gives Ryan a fighting chance. But there’s a better solution here: Rather than have her party engage in a bitter intramural battle, Pelosi should recognize that, after 14 years helming House Democrats, it’s time to let new leaders emerge.\nSimply put, she should step aside.\nShe has much to be proud of. She made history as the first woman to lead a party in Congress and as the first female speaker. She played a key role during the Obama era.\nBut no one in public life is indispensable. In parliamentary systems, party leaders often resign their positions after their governments fall or their electioneering efforts come up short. That’s a healthy custom. It lets parties recalibrate in a way that’s otherwise difficult to do. And congressional Democrats need to do just that.\nAs for Pelosi, opportunities abound for someone with her skills, knowledge, connections, and fund-raising ability. Who knows, she could even run for governor of California. After all, the Golden State seems to value leadership from liberals in their golden years.\nScot Lehigh can be reached at lehigh@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nStan Grossfeld/Globe staff\nGabriel Duluc works out at Grealish Boxing with assistant trainer Gerry Grealish.\nBy Stan Grossfeld Globe Staff November 18, 2016\nWhen Gabriel Duluc was just a young, skinny, Dominican kid, he lived in fear in a Dorchester project.\n“Yeah, it was violent,” said the 26-year-old Boston super lightweight boxer. “I remember one month I was scared to go outside. Some kids were picking on me . . . they were always picking on me.’’\nAdvertisement\nHe also hated boxing.\n“I thought it was stupid,” he said, sitting on a worn couch at the Grealish Boxing Club in Dorchester. “I said, ‘Why do people punch each other for money? Go get a job. Do something else.’ ”\nGet Sports Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's most recent sports headlines delivered to your inbox every morning. Sign Boy, things have changed.\nDuluc (11-1, 2 KO’s) steps into the ring Saturday against Sonny “Pretty Boi” Fredrickson (14-0, 9 KO’s) as part of the undercard of the Andre Ward vs. Sergey Kovalev light heavyweight showdown in Las Vegas.\nThe 5-foot-8-inch, 140-pound Duluc hopes it is a fast track to a shot at the super lightweight crown. The bout, scheduled for eight rounds, will be available for free prior to the pay-per-view event beginning at 7 p.m.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s welcome exposure. Duluc won the New England Golden Gloves in 2010 but he wasn’t allowed to fight in the national Golden Gloves because he wasn’t a United States citizen yet. His trainer, Martin Grealish, believes he could have made the Olympic team.\n“He beat everyone,” said Grealish. “He beat the Nos. 1, 2, and 3 in the country in the amateurs.”\nIn a disturbing sidenote, the team photo of the New England Golden Glove winners shows Duluc in the front row making a fist. Directly behind his right shoulder is Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the Boston Marathon bomber. “I remember him being really fancy, shiny shoes, tight jeans,’’ Duluc said. “Fancy clothes.’’\nGrealish and Duluc form an odd couple; Grealish the gray-haired, 70-year-old Irishman from Galway and Dulac the skinny, wiry Santo Domingo kid who grew up in the Franklin Hill projects.\nGrealish, who has been in boxing since he was 15, says this is his last hurrah. “I’d like Gabby to be a world champion, then I could retire,” he said.\nDuluc has a 55-5 record as an amateur. The gym has eight championship belts hanging from the ceiling from his various tournaments wins.\n“We fought all over the country,” said Grealish. “Florida, Vegas, Kansas City. You name it, we’ve been there.’’\nIt didn’t start that way.\nDuluc came to the US at age 10 with his family. When he was 13, one of his middle school friends wanted to learn to box. Duluc knew about the Grealish Boxing Club, then in Uphams Corner.\nHe took his friend there on one condition. “I’m not going to fight, I’m not going to box, I’m going to just take you there and leave you.’’\nThat was half a lifetime ago.\nAll the other kids were bigger, Grealish remembered. “When I seen him first I didn’t think he was going to be a fighter, he was small and skinny, 106 pounds with very quick hands.”\nAt first Duluc felt he was ignored by the bigger kids, so he would outperform everybody else. It started with jumping jacks. “If they did 100, I did 101,” he said.\nThe mean streets claimed some friends from back then, like Jovany Eason, 20, shot in the back in Uphams Corner in 2009. Others got sent to jail, but Duluc kept coming to the gym. He was no punk, Grealish said. “That’s the last thing you’d think,” said Duluc’s trainer. “He had so much heart.”\nWhen he moved to Charlestown, Duluc commuted by bicycle through the ice and snow, even when the headwinds felt like a punch to the windpipe.\n“You name it, he was here every day of the week,” said Grealish. “I’d be worried about him going home. So I’d take him home.”\nGrealish let Duluc live with him and his family whenever a big tournament was coming up so he could concentrate on school and gym work.\n“Gabby is like a little brother and family member,’’ said Gerry Grealish, who assists his father in training and won numerous titles as a member of the US Marine Corps boxing team. “He’s a hard worker that still finds time to train for the chance to lift that title belt we all dream about.”\nDuluc’s pro career began in 2011. His only loss since then came in a controversial first-round TKO against Jonathan Perez at Boston’s Royale nightclub in 2013. Duluc battered his opponent early, got too cocky, and got hit on the chin.\nEven though he got up before the end of the mandatory eight count, the referee stopped the fight. “I was really mad about that,” said Duluc.\nLocal fights don’t have big purses so Duluc also works as a waiter at the Lennox Hotel. But he’s also had a taste of the bright lights of the Vegas strip. He won two pay-per-view bouts for BKB (Big Knockout Boxing) at Mandalay Bay. Fighters compete in a 17-foot diameter circular pit, with no ropes or corners for two-minute rounds.\n“It was different,” Duluc said. “You don’t have a lot of room to move. I’m not a big puncher, but I’m strong enough. I think I can box pretty well.”\nIn one 2014 bout, Kendo Castaneda knocked Duluc down, but lost a majority decision. After the final bell, Castaneda hugged Duluc and muttered, “You’re a bad dude.”\nBack in Dorchester, with Saturday’s fight looming, Duluc and Grealish work the mitts during a morning workout like a father and son. Duluc even knows the combination instructions in Grealish’s native Gaelic.\nAfter his workout, sweat pours off the muscle-bound Duluc. He’s looking forward to the big fight.\n“What I feel in life, things happen for a reason, you don’t have control of everything,’’ he said. “You just have to be a good human and do your best . . . so 12 years later here we are.”\nAnd these days, Duluc says he’s not afraid of anything, or anyone. Even Fredrickson, who is 6 inches taller and undefeated.\n“He’s got more to defend,” Duluc said with a smile.\nStan Grossfeld can be reached at stanley.grossfeld@globe.",

      "text": " Google+\nCarolyn Kaster/Associated Press\nRetired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn walked through the lobby at Trump Tower on Thursday.\nBy Ken Thomas, Catherine Lucey and Julie Pace Associated Press November 18, 2016\nNEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump offered former military intelligence chief Michael Flynn the job of national security adviser as he began to build out his national security team Thursday, according to a senior Trump official. The move came as Trump made his most direct foray into foreign policy since the election, meeting with Japan’s prime minister.\nFlynn, who served as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, has advised Trump on national security issues for months. As national security adviser, he would work in the White House and have frequent access to the president. The post does not require Senate confirmation.\nAdvertisement\nThe official wouldn’t say whether Flynn had accepted the job, which left open the possibility that the arrangement was not finalized. The official was not authorized to discuss the offer publicly and insisted on anonymity.\nFlynn, who turns 58 in December, built a reputation in the Army as an astute intelligence professional and a straight talker. He retired in 2014 and has been a fierce critic of President Barack Obama’s White House and Pentagon, taking issue with the administration’s approach to global affairs and fighting Islamic State militants.\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break Sign Trump is a foreign policy novice and his early moves on national security are being closely watched by U.S allies and adversaries alike. He’s said to be considering a range of officials with varying degrees of experience to lead the State Department and Pentagon.\nView Story Flynn’s reputation: Astute intelligence pro What set retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn apart was the blistering public criticism he quickly leveled at the White House and Pentagon.\nAbe says he has confidence in Trump Kushner explores joining administration\nThe president-elect held his first face-to-face meeting with a world leader since winning the presidential election, huddling privately with Japan’s Shinzo Abe. While Trump made no comments following the meeting, Abe said the president-elect was ‘‘a leader in whom I can have great confidence.’’\nTrump also consulted with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and sat down with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a potential contender to lead the State Department.\nAdvertisement\nIn Washington, Vice President-elect Mike Pence huddled with Republican leaders in Congress. He then met with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the newly elected leader of the Senate Democrats, seeking to convey respect as Democrats prepare for Republican rule of both chambers and the White House for the first time in a decade.\n‘‘We look forward to finding ways that we can find common ground and move the country forward,’’ Pence said outside Schumer’s Senate office.\nIn a separate gesture of reconciliation with establishment Republicans, Trump planned to meet with 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who lambasted Trump as a ‘‘con man’’ and a ‘‘fraud’’ in a stinging speech last March. Trump responded by repeatedly referring to Romney as a ‘‘loser.’’\nThe two began mending fences after Trump’s victory when Romney called with congratulations. They are to meet this weekend, a transition official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss Trump’s schedule publicly. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said they were still ‘‘working on’’ the meeting.\nTrump’s actions Thursday aimed to show leaders both in the U.S. and overseas that he could soften his rhetoric, offer pragmatism in the White House and reaffirm longstanding American alliances. Since his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton last week, Trump has spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin, British Prime Minister Theresa May and nearly three dozen other world leaders by telephone.\nRon Dermer, Israel’s ambassador to the United States, also visited the skyscraper and called Trump ‘‘a true friend of Israel.’’ He specifically cited as another ‘‘friend’’ Trump campaign CEO Steve Bannon, whose selection as a top White House adviser has created a backlash among Democrats. Bannon’s news website has peddled conspiracy theories, white nationalism and anti-Semitism.\n‘‘We look forward to working with the Trump administration, with all the members of the Trump administration, including Steve Bannon, in making the U.S.-Israel alliance stronger than ever,’’ Dermer said.\nTrump, a reality television star, business mogul and political newcomer, also rolled out new teams that will interact with the State Department, Pentagon, Justice Department and other national security agencies. The move is part of the government transition before Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration.\nCoordination had been on hold until Trump’s team submitted documents including a list of transition team members who will coordinate with specific federal agencies, plus certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest.\nWhite House spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said the minimum paperwork was finished Thursday, meaning agencies could start providing briefings and written materials to Trump’s team. Indeed, the departments of State, Defense and Justice say meetings are being set up.\nConway said she expected initial announcements of Cabinet choices to come ‘‘before or right after Thanksgiving,’’ telling reporters Trump he was ‘‘loving’’ the transition. ‘‘He’s a transactional guy. He’s somebody who’s used to delivering results and producing.’’\nOne potential Cabinet member, Eva Moskowitz, said had taken herself out of the running to become education secretary. Moskowitz, a Democrat and advocate for charter schools, met with Trump this week, stoking speculation that she might inject a bit of bipartisanship in the new administration.\nMoskowitz, who voted for Clinton, suggested there were ‘‘positive signs’’ that Trump might govern differently than he campaigned, but she wrote in a letter to parents that many of her students, who are overwhelmingly black and Latino, would feel that ‘‘they are the target of the hatred that drove Trump’s campaign.’’\nRelated Japan’s Abe says he has confidence in Trump Trump’s son-in-law explores joining administration Are Romney and Trump burying the hatchet?",

Photo: Mike Segar/Reuters\nBy Annie Linskey Globe Staff November 18, 2016\nWASHINGTON — Members of the conservative foreign policy intelligentsia, who spent the eight long years of the Obama administration biding their time at think tanks and universities, finally have a shot at upper level administration jobs.\nBut now that those coveted Washington positions as deputy secretaries, assistant secretaries, and the like are finally open, many are racked with new anxiety: Is it a good idea to serve in a Trump administration if you disagree deeply with Donald Trump?\nAdvertisement\nHow the country’s top foreign policy minds navigate that question will determine whether the layers of government just below cabinet secretaries — i.e. the folks who do the actual work of government — are filled or shunned by the right’s best and the brightest.\nMany would-be aspirants for Department of Defense, Department of State, and other national security posts must decide whether to steer clear of a president-elect who might push what the foreign policy establishment considers extreme policies or take a Trump administration job and pushing for moderation from within.\nGet Breaking News in your inbox: Find out about important news stories as soon as they break Sign “Everyone is having this exact same conversation,” said Daniel Twining, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. “Everyone is saying, ‘What are you going to do?’ ”\nView Story Trump offers Flynn national security adviser job President-elect Donald Trump has offered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn job as national security adviser.\nThe foreign policy and national security positions are the most significant and most urgent jobs for the new administration to fill, given that the most basic job of a government is to protect its people. But Trump’s erratic and unorthodox campaign positions, including a willingness to target the family members of terror suspects, support for torture, and a disregard for key American alliances, is troubling to the very cadre of officials who would be called on to carry out his policies.\nDuring the campaign, senior Republican national security officials signed a letter saying Trump “lacks the character, values, and experience’’ to be president and that would “put at risk our country’s national security and well-being.’’\nAdvertisement\nTrump will need to quickly hire at least 4,000 staffers throughout the federal government, not just in foreign policy agencies. It’s a task that Hillary Clinton’s team — expecting she would win — was already deep into, with committees formed, meetings on the books, briefing papers, and rafts of resumes from the country’s top foreign policy shops already under consideration.\nWhether Trump can attract such talent will make a significant difference in his ability to shape the massive federal government bureaucracy to his will.\nTwining, who was a foreign policy advisor to Senator John McCain, said that many are taking a “wait-and-see” approach and want to see who Trump announces for cabinet level positions before making a determination about joining the administration.\nHe also made an observation familiar to anyone who has closely watched Trump go through the Republican primary and general election: Donald Trump might change his campaign views in his new role as the actual commander in chief.\n“The world looks different from the Oval,” Twining said.\nInitial signs have not been reassuring to the mainstream Republican foreign policy establishment. Mike Rogers, a former US representative and former chairman of the House Committee on Intelligence, who is a well-respected mind in national security circles, was booted from the transition team this week.\nNames floated for key national security positions include people with potentially messy financial connections to foreign governments such as Rudolph Giuliani. Another possible name is John Bolton, the former ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush.\nOn Thursday, Trump offered retired Lieutenant General Mike Flynn the job of national security adviser, the Associated Press reported.\nGiuliani and Flynn have been spotted going in and out of Trump Tower in New York City in recent days. On Thursday morning Giuliani declined to answer questions about his prospects and his foreign policy views as he left the tower’s marble lobby, saying only: “I’m going to get some rest.”\nTrump could surprise the national security world, too. He’s set to meet with former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney this weekend — a development that set off speculation that Romney could be in line to run the State Department.\nREUTERS/Mike Segar/File\nDonald Trump spoke along side retired US Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn during a Virginia campaign stop in September.\nThe staff-level debate over whether to serve a Trump administration became unusually public Tuesday when Johns Hopkins international studies professor Eliot Cohen, part of the “Never Trump” movement during the campaign , who had offered assistance to the transition team, took to Twitter to warn his colleagues about Trump.\n“Stay away,” Cohen wrote. “They’re angry, arrogant, screaming ‘you LOST!’ Will be ugly.”\nCohen expanded those thoughts with an op-ed published by The Washington Post on Wednesday, writing “service in the early phase of the administration would carry a high risk of compromising one’s integrity and reputation.”\nHe added: “The president-elect is surrounding himself with mediocrities whose chief qualification seems to be unquestioning loyalty.”\nThe problem is — if the most qualified people take a pass on Trump — then who is left guiding the ship of state?\n“Somebody’s got to staff the government,” said Larry Diamond, senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. “I’d rather have it staffed by reasonable and decent people than lunatics.”\nDiamond said career foreign service officials have discussed whether they should quit their jobs — and he’s telling them “no.”\n“I think that would simply be a disaster,” said Diamond.\nBut even he acknowledged the uncertainty these officials face. “There could be a time when what is being done is so beyond the pale that they don’t want to be a part of it anymore,” he said.\nThe kind of hand-wringing about a government career has some precedent in American history, thought it’s typically occurred amid a controversy involving a sitting president — not before the oath of office has been taken.\nCivil servants worried about working under a Nixon administration, Diamond said. There was another round of angst as President George W. Bush took the country to war in Iraq.\nFor some who have tried to change an administration from the inside, the advice to fellow conservatives is far bleaker and their sense of the dilemma their colleagues are facing is dire.\n“It’s not good,” said Alberto Mora, a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. “Trump’s policies, positions, and character and behavior are such that it just pushed away individuals who would otherwise be eager to participate in a Republican administration.”\nMora, who worked in both Bush administrations, has a unique insight into the limits of what one civil servant can do: As general counsel of the Navy he led an effort to prevent legal codification of George W. Bush’s policies on enhanced interrogation procedures.\n“You need to be comfortable that the president won’t willfully order you to do something unlawful,” said Mora, who is the recipient of a Profile in Courage Award for his efforts combatting torture. “All these things are in play because given Trump’s evident racism and misogyny.”\nAnnie Linskey can be reached at annie.linskey@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nAssociated Press file\nMitt Romney.\nBy Matt Viser and Astead W. Herndon Globe Staff November 17, 2016\nWASHINGTON — In a possible thaw that would have seemed inconceivable during the presidential campaign, Mitt Romney is scheduled to meet this weekend with Donald Trump, triggering a wave of speculation that the 2012 Republican nominee could serve in the new administration.\nIf Romney and Trump come to terms while meeting at Trump’s golf course in Bedminster, N.J. — where the president-elect is spending the weekend — it would mark a stunning turnabout for two men whose rhetoric grew exceptionally hostile over the course of the last year.\nAdvertisement\nTrump ran against the GOP status quo in the primaries, frequently citing Romney’s failed 2012 presidential bid. And Romney lambasted Trump as a “phony’’ in a speech opposing his nomination.\nSeveral news organizations, citing sources close to Trump, reported that Romney was being considered for secretary of state, making him the latest trial balloon floated for the top role in the Cabinet. But Romney and his longtime aides remained mum — on both the meeting and the secretary of state possibility.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Sign Speculation about such a position is not without cause. In the nearly two years since Romney decided not to again pursue the presidency, those close to him have thought of the former Massachusetts governor as a future secretary of state. And in recent weeks, before Trump’s upset victory Nov. 8, some aides have suggested privately that Romney wanted to have a more prominent role in public life.\nView Story Romney trustee: Trump should sell his business interests “It’s a basic tenet of democracy that public servants owe their undivided loyalty to the government,’’ says Boston lawyer Bradford Malt.\nBut during the campaign Romney excoriated Trump in terms that were more pointed than almost any other Republican. Romney attacked Trump on moral grounds, decried his mistreatment of women, and ridiculed him for not releasing his taxes.\nTrump, while known to harbor grudges against those who attack him, could benefit from bringing Romney into his administration. The former Republican nominee would bring a level of seriousness and calm to a Trump transition that so far has been rocky and could provide a measure of stability in international capitals where leaders are unsure of, and in some cases even afraid of, policies Trump will enact.\nAdvertisement\n“I think it’s good that the president-elect is meeting with people like Mr. Romney,” Senator Jeff Sessions, the Alabama Republican and top Trump adviser, told reporters at Trump Tower in New York. “He’s meeting with a lot of talented people that he needs good relationships with. I think Mr. Romney would be quite capable of doing a number of things, but he’ll be one of those I’m sure that’s reviewed, and Mr. Trump will make that decision.”\nOne of Trump’s top advisers, Kellyanne Conway, said of the Romney meeting: “We’re working on it.”\nDuring the Republican primaries, Romney was outraged by Trump’s rhetoric and behavior, and a comment from one of his sons — “What will you tell the grandkids?” — caused him to speak out.\nIn a well-publicized speech in March, he denounced Trump’s bid for the White House, in which he declared that “dishonesty is Donald Trump’s hallmark.”\n“Here’s what I know: Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud,” Romney said at the time. “His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He’s playing members of the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat.”\nEven after Trump secured enough support to become the Republican standard-bearer in the summer, Romney — who prides himself on remaining true to his principles and faith — refused to support Trump’s candidacy.\n“I don’t want to see a president of the United State saying things which change the character of the generations of Americans that are following,” Romney said in June. “Presidents have an impact on the nature of our nation, and trickle down racism and trickle down bigotry and trickle down misogyny — all of these things are extraordinarily dangerous to the heart and character of America.”\nTrump was equally pointed, calling Romney’s 2012 campaign a disaster.\n“Mitt Romney had his chance to beat a failed president but he choked like a dog,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Now he calls me racist — but I am least racist person there is.”\nTrump also used colorful terms to refer to Romney’s efforts to gain Trump’s support during his 2012 bid.\n“He was begging for my endorsement,” Trump said. “I could have said, ‘Mitt, drop to your knees.’ And he would have.”\nAfter Trump’s win on Nov. 8, the president-elect made a point to publicly announce that Romney had offered his congratulations.\n“Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win,” Trump tweeted. “Very nice!”\nWord of a meeting with Romney — and even appointing him as secretary of state — bounced quickly around national security circles.\n“That would be kind of extraordinary,” said John Douglass, a retired general who was at the Pentagon dealing with transition issues during the transition from Ronald Reagan to George H.W. Bush. “It would clearly send the signal that Trump has the capability to forgive and forget.”\nIt also seemed to soothe some of Trump’s biggest critics.\n“Mitt is a patriot. Period,” said Katie Packer, who was Romney’s deputy campaign manager and helped lead the Never Trump movement.\nRomney was often ridiculed during his 2012 campaign for his lack of foreign policy credentials. Although he speaks fluent French — partly thanks to a Mormon mission served in France — he did not have a large foreign policy portfolio. A foreign trip during his campaign, meant to bolster his credentials, was marked by controversy and gaffes.\nBut while some of his positions were lampooned at the time, he turned out to be correct. He called Russia the “number one geopolitical foe,” which turned out to be prescient.\nAnd after the campaign, he continued making arguments about foreign policy. During a 2015 retreat in Deer Valley — which came four days before Trump announced his candidacy — Romney delivered a power point presentation titled, “The Most Consequential Obama Foreign Policy Mistakes.”\nLike so many things in his life, Romney in some ways would be following in his father’s footsteps: After losing his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968, George Romney served as secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Nixon — which was, at the time, a shocking appointment.\nBut George Romney was not in the inner circle and often clashed with Nixon.\n“I don’t know what the president believes in,” he said at one point. “Maybe he doesn’t believe in anything.”\nGeorge Romney eventually resigned, complaining to Nixon in his resignation letter that politicians don’t focus enough “on real issues.” Instead, he wrote, candidates “tend to avoid specific positions concerning, and discussion of, ‘life and death’ issues in their formative and controversial stage for fear of offending uninformed voters and thus losing votes.”\nAnnie Linskey of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

      "text": " Google+\nLisa Poole/Associated Press\nHarvard’s Cambridge campus.\nBy Steve Annear Globe Staff November 17, 2016\nJacob Russell’s message is clear and concise: Hillary Clinton lost. Move on. And, hey, universities — please stop coddling your students.\nRussell, a Harvard University sophomore, said in a letter posted to FoxNews.com on Thursday that enough is enough — Republican president-elect Donald Trump won the election by securing more than the required 270 Electoral College votes.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s OK to be dismayed or angry. But by all means, be respectful, he argued in the letter, which was addressed to the “delicate flowers of the Ivy League.”\n“Trump won, and he did not overthrow the government or kill people to silence them. He won in the standard fashion,” Russell wrote. “You have a right to be upset, but what we have on our hands now is an embarrassment.”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign The Globe reached out to Russell to confirm the letter’s authenticity. He declined to say anything further.\nIn the letter, Russell also asked students to imagine what it would be like if people of different races were treated the way people with different ideas are being treated.\n“There would be a tremendous outcry! But somehow it is fine to discriminate against those with different views,” he said. “Did it ever occur to you that this may be why people voted for Trump? That it might not have been the ‘racist proclivities’ of the U.S. or the ‘dangerous nationalism’ of the people, but that it was people who tell them not to think or speak the way they do.”\nAdvertisement\nAccording to Russell, the outrage about an election upset could be traced back to a generation of students who, growing up, were told everyone deserves a trophy.\n“Many never learned how to be graceful in defeat, much less handle it,” he wrote.\nIn his letter, Russell, who is originally from Cooperstown, N.Y., spares no punches, and also takes universities to task — including the one he attends.\nHe said universities are coddling students who have been “traumatized by the will of the American people.”\nHe said a Harvard midterm that fell the day after the election was made optional because the results came in so late. “But we all know it would have been mandatory if Clinton had won by 10 p.m., as expected,” he argued.\nIn Russell’s opinion, the faculty should have planned ahead, and either cancelled the midterm altogether, or followed through as planned.\n“A note to all faculty: If you did not know, the election is the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November,” he quipped.\nRussell also railed against protesters, questioning their message.\nEarlier this week, a petition signed by 4,300 members of the Harvard community was delivered to the university administration, calling for more resources for undocumented students in the wake of Trump’s election.\nBut Russell pointed to those decrying the Electoral College and calling for a popular vote to determine a presidential candidate’s victory moving forward.\n“If Hillary had won the electoral vote and lost the popular vote, you would be reprimanding those who called it an injustice,” he said.\nIn 2012, Trump himself criticized the Electoral College. He said it was bad for democracy. After Trump won, however, he tweeted that it was “genius” because it brings all states into play.\nWhile Russell’s letter took a somewhat combative tone, it ended on an upbeat note.\n“Move on and do what it takes to better our nation, because we are all on this ship together,” he wrote.\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nBy Christina Prignano Globe staff November 17, 2016\nSilent through much of the 2016 election except for some notable appearances on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” Jon Stewart offered extensive thoughts on the election of Donald Trump, and the left’s reaction to it, in an interview that aired Thursday on “CBS This Morning.”\nThe comedian, famous for dressing down hypocritical politicians and pundits during his 16 years as host of the “Daily Show,” zeroed in on commentary about Trump voters by some liberals.\nAdvertisement\n“I thought Donald Trump disqualified himself at numerous points. But there is now this idea that anyone who voted for him has to be defined by the worst of his rhetoric. In the liberal community, you hate this idea of creating people as a monolith. Don’t look at Muslims as a monolith, they are individuals, and it would be ignorance,” Stewart said. “But everybody who voted for Donald Trump is a monolith, is a racist. That hypocrisy is also real in our country.”\nStewart told CBS’s Charlie Rose that he didn’t believe the country had changed fundamentally between 2008 and today, but he feared for marginalized communities as a result of Trump’s victory.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Sign “The same country that elected Donald Trump elected Barack Obama,” he said. “I feel badly for the people for whom this election will mean more uncertainty and insecurity. But I also feel like this fight has never been easy.”\nBut Stewart didn’t let the GOP off the hook. He had harsh words for Republican members of Congress in particular, arguing that they pushed the idea that government was broken after their own policies stopped it from working.\n“Donald Trump is a reaction not just to Democrats, but to Republicans. He’s not a Republican. He’s a repudiation of Republicans. But they will reap the benefit of his victory,” he said. “I will guarantee you now that Republicans are going to come to Jesus now about the power of government.”\nChristina Prignano can be reached at christina.prignano@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nScreen capture/Bovada\nBy Jaclyn Reiss Globe Staff November 18, 2016\nIf Tom Brady was hoping to get into politics, 2020 might be the time to jump into the fray.\nOnline gambling site Bovada has posted a wager that allows users to bet on who will win the 2020 presidential election.\nAdvertisement\nPresident-elect Donald Trump tops the list, with House Speaker Paul Ryan, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, and Michelle Obama following behind him.\nElizabeth Warren, the progressive US senator from Massachusetts, is also listed to have a better chance than 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton or Senator Bernie Sanders.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Your afternoon shot of politics, sent straight from the desk of Joshua Miller. Sign Patriots quarterback Tom Brady also made the list, albeit with a 1 percent chance, according to Bovada’s odds. Brady is also listed to have the same chance as Leonardo DiCaprio, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, George Clooney, and, of course, Kanye West. (Basically, if you bet $1 on any of those names and that person won the presidency, you would win $100.)\nAnnouncers during the Thursday Night Football game between the Saints and the Panthers also talked about Tom Brady being on the list. One even commented, “What the heck, that wouldn’t be bad.”\nAl & Cris talking about the things we care about like Tom Brady possibly being Pres. in 2020. #TNF #NOvsCAR https://t.co/yLCymCPqwl\n— Nick Ramos (@NickR83) November 18, 2016 To be fair, Brady has managed to muster some write-in votes recently.\nAdvertisement\nKim Kardashian also has the same odds of holding the Oval Office as former Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson — 500 to 1, according to the site.\nThis isn’t the first time people have placed bets on politics — they also wagered on the presidential debate between Trump and Clinton earlier this fall.\n(Disclaimer: It’s not clear whether it’s legal to make these kind of bets in Massachusetts. Among other things, there is a state law against betting on the outcome of a political election.)\nMatt Rocheleau of the Globe staff contributed to this report.",

      "text": " Google+\nEdward Jenner/Globe Staff\nBoston Mayor Kevin White announced the new “Committee for Boston,” which was established by the recommendation of the “Committee Against Violence.”\nBy Meghan E. Irons Globe Staff November 18, 2016\nWith racial tensions in the neighborhoods, Boston’s embattled mayor attempted to get to the root of the problem.\nHe convened a dialogue on racism, instructing a 13-member committee to examine the sources of violent unrest and serve as a “neutral listening device” for opposing points of view.\nAdvertisement\nThe exploration, which unfolded 40 years ago during Kevin White’s tenure, could serve as a backdrop for Mayor Martin J. Walsh, as he launches on Saturday the first in a year-long series of citywide talks on racism in his administration.\nWhite’s short-lived committee huddled for meetings at the central branch at Boston Public Library in the spring of 1976. But after the group released its findings, most of its recommendations collected dust — and the work of the committee faded in the record books.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Boston, where people of color now make up the majority, still struggles with the same issues the committee tackled back then: gaping income and political disparities that fall along racial lines. A recent study found Boston tops the list of major US cities with the most income inequality.\nView Story Walker: Walsh prepares to lead a citywide conversation about race Going where few white politicians dare, the mayor believes the city needs to have an open discussion.\nMayor’s city race dialogue to start next Saturday\n“The first thing Walsh has to do is to study failure,’’ said state Representative Byron Rushing.\nTo succeed, Rushing said, Walsh must heed lessons from the past. He must have an unwavering commitment to closing the racial divide, even when fervent supporters fade.\nAdvertisement\nWayne Budd, a lawyer who like Rushing has been active in Boston’s civil rights efforts, said the good intentions aimed at resolving racial matters did not survive the test of time.\n“We didn’t have the staying power in the ’70s,’’ Budd said. “Maybe there was good will, but not the resolve for everyone concerned. We just didn’t stay with it.”\nWalsh said he was inspired to launch the talks after a stop during his 2013 mayoral campaign. A Jamaica Plain woman had pressed him about whether he thought Boston was a racist city.\nHis reply: Boston is not a perfect city, but it’s better than it was.\n“I stumbled on the answer. She pushed me,” Walsh recalled in a Thursday interview to discuss the upcoming dialogue series. “I was upset with the question because I knew I didn’t answer the question right. But I also thought I had understated the issue of racism completely.”\nLater, Walsh and his campaign policy team decided to pursue conversations on race if he became mayor. In his first year in office, he received a grant to hold the dialogues and appointed Atyia Martin to lead the effort. Recently, he made a pitch to business leaders to commit to diversifying their workforce.\nTo some, the scars from Boston’s legacy of school busing remain, decades later, and those divisions have been exposed anew by the presidential campaign.\n“This can’t be a one-and-done situation where we have a round of race dialogues and say ‘OK. We did our jobs,’ check off the box, and go to the next issue,’’ Walsh said. “This has [to be done] in a consistent manner.”\nOver time, he added, the conversations will become embedded in everyday society, encouraging better understanding across races.\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff\nBoston Mayor Martin J. Walsh.\nThe dialogue kicks off Saturday at the Cutler Majestic Theater, where the city plans to outline its plans for future talks. The city will hold more talks next year and work with individuals throughout the neighborhoods to facilitate other dialogues, officials said.\nMartin, the city’s chief resiliency officer who has already been leading private talks with local leaders, said the discussions allowed people to freely express their thoughts and feelings. Now is the crucial time for these conversations, she said.\n“The rhetoric from the political campaign . . . tapped into the fact that there are people who felt they weren’t heard, their struggles weren’t clearly acknowledged, and a lot of that were along racial lines,’’ she said.\nTheir struggles, she said, should all be heard.\nForty years ago, White was leading a city rocked by violence. Two years after a judge ordered the schools to be desegregated, angry residents were still throwing rocks at yellow buses in South Boston and at cars in Roxbury.\nJack O’Connell\nTed Landsmark.\nIn April 1976, a group of white youth attacked Ted Landsmark, an attorney who is black, on City Hall Plaza. One of the teenagers used a pole carrying a US flag, in a scene captured in one of the most memorable photos of the era. After the incident, White convened the Mayor’s Committee on Violence, telling reporters that he needed to find some avenues for better dialogue.\nBut with so many of the city’s policies — in the police, school, and fire departments — requiring federal action to force desegregation, Landsmark said he wasn’t sure if White’s committee would work.\n“There was some skepticism as to whether such a conversation would have any positive effect,’’ said Landsmark, who is now on the board of the Boston Planning and Development Agency. “But there was optimism that at least the mayor was willing to be the convener of this.”\nThe Rev. Walter J. Waldron, then a 36-year-old priest at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, said White was a “take charge” mayor who wanted to address the issue.\nTed Dully\nState Senator William Owens (center) addressed the press conference the day after the assault on Ted Landsmark in 1976.\n“This was his city and he had to take responsibility to make things the way they should be,’’ said Waldron, who now leads St. Patrick’s Parish in Roxbury.\nThe committee interviewed top and controversial figures in the city, including Louise Day Hicks, the contentious City Council president, and Mel King, then a state representative in the South End.\nIt produced a report, published June 25, 1976, in the Globe, that described a School Committee that didn’t fully represent the community and a “them-against-us” attitude in some neighborhoods. And it urged more diversity in the Police Department and stricter law enforcement in the neighborhoods.\n“The people of Boston are tired and angry,’’ the report said.\nHubie Jones, who was on the committee, recalled meeting with the mayor in the Copley library and making it clear that he needed to take a more forceful public posture about easing racial tensions.\n“We told him straight out what needed to be done, and he blew a fuse,’’ said Jones, who at 82 is writing a book about that era. “He saw it as criticism. He thought we were piling on.”\nJones said he left the group feeling disillusioned.\n“What I learned was that Mayor White put this together as a fig leaf to make people believe he was doing something,’’ he said. “We were being taken. He wasn’t about to really listen to any recommendations that came out of it. . . . It was not serious.”\nUnder fire for not moving fast enough on the committee’s recommendations, White created the “Committee for Boston” to serve as a forum for neighborhoods with racial tensions in August 1976. That group had been recommended by the Mayor’s Committee on Violence.\nMore than 40 years later, Walsh said the city is still trying to turn a corner.\n“Kevin White started the process,’’ Walsh said. “This is the next day. This is the aftermath of all the racial tension in the city of Boston. . . . If you don’t talk about it and you don’t put it out there, you don’t get the healing. And clearly Boston hasn’t healed yet.”\nDonald Preston/Globe Staff\nBoston Mayor Kevin White and Boston Police superintendent Joseph Jordan spoke at a press conference on racial violence in 1976.\nMeghan E.

      "text": "Donald Trump Presidency: Obama-Ally Google May Face Tough Times Reddit \nAlphabet Inc's Google faces a tougher regulatory landscape as US President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration looks poised to reverse Obama administration policies that often favoured the Internet giant in the company's battles with telecoms and cable heavyweights, analysts say. \nGoogle had close ties with outgoing Democratic President Barack Obama's administration, and its employees donated much more to defeated Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton than to the Republican Trump. \nIn the most concrete sign yet that the tech policy balance may be tipping in favour of telecom firms ahead of Trump's presidency, the US Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday halted action on contentious regulatory reform measures opposed by companies such as AT&T Inc and CenturyLink Inc. \nIn addition, the commission is now expected to reject FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's high-profile proposal to open up the $20 billion market for rented pay-TV set-top boxes, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. That measure would have dealt a big blow to cable companies and created an opening for firms such as Google and Apple . ( Also see: With Trump in Power, Apple Said to Be Considering Making iPhones in US ) \nObama had thrown his support behind the initiative, a move AT&T decried as an improper intervention on behalf of what it called a \"Google proposal.\" \n\"Google has been much more actively involved in this than Apple has,\" said Jan Dawson, analyst at Jackdaw Research. \"I'm not sure it's critical to Google's business at all that it be allowed to provide these next generation set-top boxes, but there was a business opportunity there.\" \nCable companies have expressed concerns that rivals like Google or Apple could create devices or apps and insert their own content or advertising in cable content. \nThe FCC's moves came a day after Republican lawmakers urged Wheeler, a Democrat, to avoid any contested regulations in the waning days of the Obama administration, saying new rules would be subject to review by the incoming Republican-led Congress and Trump's administration and \"could create confusion if reversed.\" \n\"The question is how far will the pendulum swing back\" in favour of telecom companies, said Hal Singer, senior fellow at the George Washington Institute of Public Policy. \"It has swung in Google's direction under the FCC and Chairman Wheeler.\" Among other regulations, Trump's November 8 election has increased the chances that Obama's net neutrality rules, adopted by the FCC in early 2015, could be rolled back, analysts said. \nMost Republicans strongly oppose net neutrality, which requires Internet service providers to treat all data equally and bars them from obstructing or slowing down consumer access to web content. The rules were a victory for Internet firms like Google and Netflix that have advocated an open Internet. \nJimmy Schaeffler, telecom industry consultant at the Carmel Group, said that \"the bottom line is that things will change and there will be less optimism among and fewer opportunities\" for companies like Google that do not own the Internet networks. \n\"That's going to impede their success and those that rely on what they do,\" Schaeffler added. \nRepublicans in Congress or at a Republican-controlled FCC under a Trump administration could also pare back new privacy rules adopted in October that subject Internet service providers to stricter rules than those faced by Google and other websites. \nSince Trump's victory, Alphabet shares have fallen 2.4 percent, Netflix shares have dropped 5.9 percent and Amazon shares are down 2 percent. AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc shares have been relatively unchanged, while Comcast Corp shares have soared 7.7 percent. \nGoogle did not respond to requests for comment. \nExtensive ties During Obama's presidency, more than 250 people moved between jobs at Google or related firms and the federal government, national political campaigns and Congress, according to a report this year by the Campaign for Accountability watchdog group's Google Transparency Project. \nEric Schmidt, Alphabet's executive chairman, was seen at Clinton's Election Night party wearing a staff badge in a widely circulated photo. \nIn the stolen and leaked emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta disclosed by WikiLeaks, an adviser wrote a memo to Clinton in 2014 that said \"working relationships with Google, Facebook, Apple, and other technology companies were important to us in 2012 and should be even more important to you in 2016, given their still-ascendent positions in the culture.\" \n\"We have begun having discreet conversations with some of these companies to get a sense of their priorities for the coming cycle,\" the adviser wrote. \nTelecom and cable companies have accused Wheeler of favouring Google at the expense of cable companies. Responding to the criticism, Wheeler said in May: \"I hear that allegation, and I scratch my head. I don't get that charge.\" \n\"Certainly the sort of cosy relationship that Google enjoyed with the Obama administration is not going to continue with Trump,\" Jackdaw Research's Dawson added. \nSome analysts and former Google lobbyists noted that the company similarly faced a set of challenging regulatory dynamics when it opened its Washington office in 2005, with Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress and the young tech firm widely perceived to have a liberal bent. \n\"They have a tailwind (in the Obama administration), and that does end now,\" a former Google employee at the company's Washington office said. \"But I think in the long run Google is going to be just fine in Washington. In many ways, its whole operation was built just for moments like this.\" \n© Thomson Reuters 2016",

Fantastic Beasts: Cases From the Wizarding World is a new mystery game based on cues that allows players to be part of the wizarding world developed by J.K Rowling. \nThe object of the game is for the players to explore several areas and search for objects that are hidden in plain sight. The players have to uncover the hidden mysterious as new recruits of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. \n\"From nifflers to unicorns, centaurs to dragons, you protect them all. Use your training to investigate beastly happenings and prove yourself as the smartest, sharpest wizard,\" says the game's listing. Players are required to cast spells, brew potions, and solve the cases following the cues. The mobile hidden-object game is currently available on both the App Store and Google Play for download.\nFans of the Harry Potter series won't be disappointed as the areas that you explore in the mobile game while solving cases are from the original series as well. \"Join the magical community and unravel the secrets of your wizarding world together. See how you stack up against your fellow recruits, and lend your friends a helping hand,\" Warner Bros. says in the game's description. \nConsidering the current hype around both the original Harry Potter series and the new spin-off movie franchise, don't be surprised if you see the game rising charts in the upcoming weeks. However, it will be interesting to see if it will be supported by the developers once the nostalgia factor goes away.",

      "text": "Google Disappointed by South Korean Refusal on Mapping Data By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Continue reading the main story SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea rejected a request by Google to use local mapping data in the company's global maps service in a long-awaited ruling Friday that had divided the country for months. The company said it was disappointed by the decision, which the land ministry said was based on concerns over national security. \"We're disappointed by this decision. We've always taken security concerns very seriously and will continue to provide useful map services in compliance with Korea's current map data export regulation,\" Taj Meadows, a Google spokesperson, said in a statement. The South Korean government said the risks outweighed benefits from exporting the country's mapping data to Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc. South Korea, facing the overt threat of rival North Korea, bars exporting local mapping data to foreign companies that do not operate domestic data servers. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., handles its maps service at data centers outside South Korea. The restrictions have limited the usefulness of Google Maps within South Korea, since the app cannot offer driving or walking directions. The government had proposed granting permission to Google to use local mapping data for Google Maps if the company would blur sensitive information on South Korean military facilities on its satellite map. \"Our position from the start was that if it deletes security facilities, we would allow exporting (the local mapping data),\" said Kim Tong-il, an official at the land ministry. \"Google's position is that it won't delete those. The question was whether we would allow that regardless.\" South Korea has been divided over the issue since Google filed its request in June. The government extended an August deadline to this month, highlighting disagreements between government ministries. The long-time deliberation reflects growing support for Google within some government ministries that are trying to promote tourism and local firms' overseas businesses. One of the biggest inconveniences that foreign tourists run into in South Korea, which has some of the fastest and cheapest internet access in the world, is the lack of an online mapping service with navigation and directions in foreign languages. Some local businesses and consumers opposed giving Google full access to the local mapping data, saying it would be unfair to local companies that operate local data servers to support their map services. They said Google should build data centers in South Korea instead of seeking an exemption from the rules. Google said earlier that restricting Google Maps in South Korea would be an inconvenience for foreigners visiting the host country of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics in 2018. It also argued that restrictions on exporting the local mapping data could hinder efforts of companies to roll out global services using locations data and will deprive local consumers of cutting-edge services.",

The rise in searches for 'indelible ink removal' started on November 15, the day banks started using the ink on customers, shows Google Trends data. Delhi, Karnataka, West Bengal, and Maharashtra are the states leading the country in looking up indelible ink removal methods. Almost the same amount of searches originate from Mumbai and Delhi, followed by Bengaluru, according to the data.\nBanks have been advised to apply the indelible ink of the right hand to mark customers who have made their transactions, since the ink is used on the left hand of voters to prevent impersonation and voter fraud. As should be obvious, the fraud prevention method has been used for this purpose in the past as indelible ink removal is not a simple task. \nThe Election Commission has raised concerns about the use of indelible ink as elections are about to begin in several states, including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. It has said that use of indelible ink should not affect the \"election process in any manner.\"",

      "text": "\nGoogle has outlined the security features of its latest smartphone, the Pixel , via the Google Security Blog . In a post titled ‘Google Pixel: better, faster, stronger’, two of Google’s senior software engineers describe how the Pixels’ encryption implementation improves the “user experience, performance, and security” of the smartphones.\nUnlike the more common smartphone encryption method known as full disk encryption, or FDE, the Pixels make use of a type of encryption known as file-based encryption, or FBE. FBE means that different files are encrypted with different keys that can be unlocked independently.\nUsing this method, Google says it has combined a smartphone’s unlock and decrypt screen, meaning that users can access applications such as “alarm clocks, accessibility settings, and phone calls” immediately after booting.\nSee also: Google Pixel successfully hacked during PwnFest, exploit will be patched 7 days ago Google also discussed its use of ARM’s TrustZone software, which provides two benefits. Firstly, TrustZone enforces the Verified Boot process, which means that it won’t decrypt disk encryption keys if it detects that the OS has been modified/compromised. Secondly, TrustZone enforces “a waiting period between guesses at the user credential, which gets longer after a sequence of wrong guesses.” With this in place, Google says that trying all of a smartphone’s four-point lock screen patterns would take more than four years.\nFinally, Google talked about how it dropped industry-standard eCryptFS encryption – which Google said didn’t meet its performance requirements – for an encryption method created directly inside Android’s ext4 filesystem. Google said that the ext4 encryption performance is “similar to full-disk encryption, which is as performant as a software-only solution can be.”\nFind out everything Google had to say about its Pixels security in the blog post here .",

      "text": "Google, HTC and Oculus are all betting on mobile VR Your first VR rig might fit in a pocket share \nThe future of virtual reality can be found in the fiction of Snow Crash , Oculus’ Max Cohen believes — but probably not in the way you’re thinking. In Snow Crash , Neal Stephenson's seminal book based on a future world driven by consumerism and warped by privatization, people seek escape through a game-like metaverse using a variety of virtual reality rigs. The sophistication and cost of the VR gear impacts the way a person appears in the virtual universe and how they perceive things. Cohen’s view of Snow Crash as a predictor of VR things to come isn’t about the fictional world’s hyperinflation, cybernetic pitbulls or the growing social importance of massively multiplayer online games. It's about the broad variety of VR devices used in that fiction. He sees the future of VR as being not experiences delivered to a singular sort of device, but something more akin to television, where a wide variety of devices will all be able to access the same sorts of content. And as with television, that diversity of devices will bring with it something we’re already starting to see: low-end virtual reality. While mobile phones can deliver a VR experience, it’s not even close in quality or immersion to what you’d find in high-end VR headsets powered by computers. Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash | Bantam Books Despite that, the creators of today’s current VR gear — whether it’s made of cardboard or runs on a top-of-the-line computer — believe that VR’s success will ride almost entirely in these early days on the ubiquity and low cost of smartphones. That’s because virtual reality needs scale to succeed, and according to VR experts with Google, Oculus, Samsung, Vive and others, the mobile phone is key to achieving that scale. \"Mobile phones aren’t only relevant; they’re critical to the growth of VR,\" said Tom Harding, director of VR and immersive products at Samsung, in a recent interview with Polygon. \"Gear VR has been critical to the growth of the awareness of VR and its appeal to the mainstream. \"There’s no cable and, in many cases, no risk because it is bundled with the phone. Even at $9,9 it provides a really low-risk point of entry. So it remains absolutely vital to the growth of awareness of VR.\" That’s why Samsung teamed up with Oculus for the Gear VR, why Google just released the Daydream View headset, and why Vive maker HTC recently announced its own plans for mobile VR. \"The vast majority of people who have experienced virtual reality have done so on a mobile device,\" said Mike Jazayeri, product director for Daydream. \"We believe that will be the case for years to come. \"Our goal is to bring quality VR to everyone. For us, the mobile phone is the way to do that.\" Daydream Believer Sitting next to the Vive or Rift or PlayStation VR headsets, Google’s Daydream View looks like something designed for children: a boxy oddity wrapped in someone’s old sweatshirt. The three current kings of high-end VR — Oculus, Sony and HTC — have created gear that lives up to the fantasy aesthetic of virtual reality rigs. Their futuristic shapes are bedazzled with lights and sensors. Arrays of straps and dials fasten them firmly to the face. Clusters of wires spill from their sides to slither away into expensive computers. This is the future and it’s confusing and it’s expensive and you better not even look at it or you might break something, they seem to say to the uninitiated. Then there is the Daydream View. It has a floppy elastic band that you slip over your head and a loop of bungee to hold a phone in place. It’s gray. It’s squishy. It’s very inviting. Currently it only supports Google’s Pixel phones, but that is set to change in the near future. Once you drop the phone in place, latch the lid closed and slide it on, the View drops you inside a colorful cartoon cave. It’s peaceful there with the sounds of a nearby stream, crickets and the occasional frog. Vines creep along the rocky ceiling and motes of dust drift down through a spotlight of sun shining through a hole. It’s the sort of soft landing perfect for someone who has never experienced the sometimes disorienting experience of being suddenly transported to a different place. Daydream View | Google Inside the cave, or outside in a serene meadow, you can use an included controller — a slip of plastic that has three buttons and works as a laser pointer and remote control — to select virtual reality experiences and peruse the Google Play store. At first glance, the entire experience and the device may seem like an odd thing for Google to create. Google is a search engine, the search engine, and the purveyor of the world’s information. But Jazayeri says Google’s decision to get into not just virtual reality experiences, but devices, fits into the company’s mission. \"It all goes back to the company mission statement: to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful,\" he said. \"The definition of what information is has grown over time. That includes images and text and has grown to cover video-based content, mobile, and it just kind of keeps growing. Daydream View's controller | Google \"Experiences are another form of information. Whether experiencing something in the real world or a completely virtual thing.\" Google’s original dalliance with VR started with Google Cardboard, a simple sort of headset made of cardboard that uses a basic program Google created to deliver simple VR experiences: often things like 360-degree videos or images. That interest grew to include something a bit more complex: the Daydream. But, Jazayeri said, the company’s take on VR has always been mobile-first. \"Our goal with Daydream was to bring high-quality VR to everyone,\" he said. \"We can’t change the physics of mobile computing versus desktop computing. But within those constraints of mobile computing we want to crush the boundaries.\" Daydream View really isn’t meant to be the core experience of Google and VR; it’s just an early example of sorts, the prototype that other phone makers can look at and design around. Google’s big play is the software that runs VR on Android: Daydream. Already, a number of phone makers and developers have committed to supporting the Android-powered VR platform. \"We are definitely pleased that there has been so much broad commitment,\" Jazayeri said. He believes the support is driven by the fact that creating a platform that can deliver high-quality, low-latency experiences is \"just plain hard.\" \"And I think in general that the Android ecosystem is ready to say, ‘Please, let’s do this in a standardized way,’\" he said. \"It’s not effective if everyone does these one-offs. \"So we’re focused on creating the plumbing. The View is just our version of a headset; all headsets that use Daydream will be compatible with each other.\" It’s likely that the Daydream headsets that come after the View will follow in its footsteps to some degree. Daydream View and controller | Google That means creating devices designed for everyone, not necessarily the hardcore user. \"Every time you add a level of complexity, you reduce the likelihood that a certain group of people will use it,\" Jazayeri said. So in creating the View, Google made sure to keep everything as simple as possible, including the controller. \"It’s very natural,\" he said. \"You just point at things. \"It opens the door to all of these things where the controller could be a bat or a golf club. It maps very well to what we do in the real world. We had to do a lot of things with sensors to get it to work.\" While Jazayeri says he’s certain that over time, the device and its input methods will evolve, right now the key focus is on making VR accessible and attractive to as many people as possible. \"At this early stage everyone is trying to get critical mass,\" he said. \"Consistency will trump different form factors and controllers. Platforms have to reach a certain level of audience first.\" Gearing up for success While the design for Samsung’s Gear VR headset, now on its fourth iteration, may not look quite as lo-fi as Google Daydream’s View, it is courting much of the same entry-level market. The Gear VR is a slick piece of kit that has a touchpad, focus dial, volume buttons and action buttons all built into its body. The front of the thing pops off to reveal a cradle for a Samsung phone. Once it’s plugged in and snapped into place, the phone and headset become a single mobile VR machine. Where the View drops you into a calming cartoon world, the Gear VR’s home looks like just that, someone’s home, albeit a pricey, very modern one. From the Home, users can browser their library, check out which of their friends are in VR and purchase apps. Once inside an experience, users can — depending on what the app was developed to do — use the touchpad located on their Gear’s temple to peruse an experience or use a wireless controller to play games. Where the View’s early VR content seems more geared toward experiential software and casual games, the Gear VR headset is packed with a broader variety of play. Some experiences drop you into a turret fending off invading aliens in a VR take on a game like Space Invaders ; others have you facing your fears in a title created by the studio behind Left 4 Dead . There are also some great nongaming experiences. I find myself most drawn to the Gear VR’s take on Netflix, which allows you to select and watch movies and TV shows on a massive screen inside a posh alpine home that looks like it’s set in Aspen, Colorado. Samsung VR | Samsung Samsung’s Tom Harding says the Gear VR has been a big success for Samsung, and that it isn’t just relevant to the success of the broader field of VR, but critical to its growth. Like Google’s Jazayeri, Harding believes that mobile VR headsets and experiences will be what fuels the growth of awareness needed for VR to succeed. And that, in turn, will stimulate the number of developers creating content, he said. Samsung got into the business of VR because for the company, which thrives on innovation and deals in technologies like screens and processors, it seemed like the perfect intersection of its experiences. \"We are very excited about VR and remain 100 percent committed to the medium,\" Harding said. Where Google is just starting to push out its headsets, Samsung has already seen relatively wide adoption of the Gear headset, and not just by consumers. For instance, theme parks in Belgium, England and the U.S. have started using Gear VR headsets on specific roller coaster rides to enhance the effect of the rides’ themes. This spring, Six Flags Magic Mountain started using the headset on its New Revolution coaster, allowing customers to experience a futuristic battle to save the planet from an alien invasion while riding the coaster. Six Flags' New Revolution ride | Six Flags \"You would never imagine that roller coasters and VR was a good idea, but when you sync users with the view, it can really take you to other worlds,\" Harding said. \"It unlocked a lot of interest across a lot of different areas about what you can do at an experimental level. \"We continue to work closely with third-party developers and our partner Oculus on trying to push that innovation.\" While Samsung developed the hardware for the Gear VR headset, it was Oculus — makers of the PC-tethered Rift headset — that created the software. When Max Cohen joined Oculus back in 2014, he knew immediately what he wanted to work on at the company: mobile VR. \"I instantly knew that was where we were going to get a lot of scale,\" said Cohen, Oculus’ head of mobile. In his view, there are two classes of VR headsets: the high end, like the Oculus Rift, and the mobile side, which is casual, easier to get into and far more affordable. And he knew that you can’t really advertise VR — not in a way that sells it. \"The thing about VR is that until you try it, it’s really hard to understand how great it is,\" he said. \"And it’s much easier to try Gear VR than Rift, or Vive or anything else.\" Currently, he said, you can demo the Gear VR at more than 15,000 stations in the U.S. alone. Once the Gear VR started shipping last year, Cohen’s take on the importance of Gear and its ability to evangelize virtual reality turned out to be correct. \"We were seeing that for every Gear sold, 10, 15, 40 people were introduced to the magic of VR,\" he said. \"Every person who tries it wanted to show it to their friends.\" While both companies’ belief in the Gear VR headset was proved out, there were still some surprises. \"I was surprised Gear VR and phone (top), Gear VR's touchpad (bottom left), Gear VR (bottom right) | Samsung \nat how many people liked long-form content,\" Cohen said. \"We knew there would be people who wanted to use it for Netflix or Oculus video. But it’s been much more popular than we expected. \"On the game side, there was a lot of discussion about what kind of games would do well. [Former id Software developer and current Oculus chief technology officer John] Carmack said Minecraft would be the holy grail. But we weren’t sure if it would be comfortable or uncomfortable to play.\" After cutting a deal with Microsoft and getting Minecraft on the Gear VR, Oculus found that despite it needing a controller that didn’t come with the system, it was still the highest-selling game on the platform. While Cohen too believes in the power of mobile VR to achieve the sort of scale needed for success, he doesn’t see mobile as a stopgap. He believes mobile VR, like mobile gaming, has a long, broad life ahead of it. \"It’s going to be really good, maybe even better, at casual gaming and watching movies,\" he said. And he believes that inevitably, the full variety of VR headsets — from the Rift, PlayStation VR and Vive to the Daydream View and Gear VR — will one day share the same virtual experiences and spaces. That people with all sorts of VR gear will be able to interact with one another. \"In the same way that we now have the phone, the laptop and the desktop, I think you will have these separate VR devices,\" he said. \"The holodeck is going to come with external sensors, there will be headsets with ‘inside-out’ that can only track what it sees, and mobile is going to go down to costing zero. \"And whatever you pay, you will get VR that’s compelling.\" Each of those markets will thrive, he said. \"Gear VR isn’t a sub-product in service of getting adoption for the Rift,\" he said. \"Gear in and of itself is a very, very successful ecosystem which we will continue to invest in heavily and evolve and innovate on.\" 10 million Cardboards Google’s investment in mobile VR hit last week with the Daydream View. Oculus and Samsung’s hit two years ago with the Gear VR. And now HTC seems to be testing the waters in China with Viveport M. Where Google, Samsung and Oculus all invested in their own hardware, HTC is focusing on building out a storefront for VR on mobile phones. \"We are building Viveport to be the platform and device-agnostic VR app store, and so on the mobile side we’re ready to support apps from a variety of platforms, said Rikard Steiber, senior vice president of VR content at HTC and president of Viveport. \"Right now Viveport M, our mobile VR platform that launched in China last month, is supporting Android and Daydream apps. \"I believe mobile will play an important part in speeding up the growth of the VR ecosystem by exposing consumers around the world to the potential of VR. As consumers become aware of the many use cases of VR, we believe that they will want to have more immersive and interactive experiences than mobile can offer today, thus accelerating adoption of high-end VR like the Vive.\" Viveport mobile app | Vive HTC Patrick O’Luanaigh, CEO and founder of developer nDreams, calls mobile VR massive. \"We as a company are focused on both mobile VR and high-end VR, and it’s hard to tell which is going to be a bigger part of the VR world moving forward,\" he said. \"But we are really excited about what’s going on with Gear VR and the Daydream.\" Tom Gillo, nDreams’ vice president of development, doesn’t see Gear VR and the Daydream View as competitors, mostly because he thinks both offer very different sorts of experiences. \"Each has its own idiosyncrasies,\" he said. \"Gear has a joystick or the touchpad on the headset as a controller. I really like the Daydream controller, which is aiming for the same audience as the Wii Remote. \"It’s nice and simple to use. Certainly more comfortable than a touchpad.\" And while Gillo sees mobile expanding the market for VR, he thinks it is Google’s Daydream platform, with its lower cost, simpler controller and comfy headset that will really have an impact. \"I think it’s going to expand the market more than anything,\" he said. \"I think you’re going to see lots and lots and lots of phones that support Daydream.\" \"I think you’re going to see lots and lots and lots of phones that support Daydream.\" nDream's Danger Goat | nDream Once Facebook starts to release social apps for devices like the Gear VR through Oculus, which it owns, Gillo says he thinks things will really take off there as well. Despite the support mobile virtual reality is getting from the chief companies behind today’s consumer VR efforts. and from a number of the innovators and researchers in the decades-old field of virtual reality, there are some obvious issues with this form of the technology. It simply doesn’t look as good, and the current mobile headsets don’t offer the same sort of interactions. There is no phone-powered VR headset that can track hand movement or the movement of your body in a larger space. Currently, controls for mobile VR can strip down the experience to something more akin to a 360-degree movie that an interactive piece of virtual reality. What if someone’s first experience with virtual reality becomes their only experience with the technology because it was on a phone and they simply weren’t impressed? \"There is no question that some people will have that reaction,\" said Oculus’ Cohen. \"That’s completely OK. The product isn’t ready for everyone today. \"But we’re working to close that gap.\" Google’s Jazayeri points to the company’s Google Cardboard effort as a sign that there is a real desire from people to check out VR, no matter how lo-fi it might be. \"We designed Cardboard to be about a couple of minutelong experiences,\" he said. \"Given that nearly 10 million Google Cardboards have shipped, I think it has been good for VR.\" Mobile VR, like much of the rest of today’s VR, is in its relative infancy, bound to change and evolve. Daydream View, controller and Pixel phone | Google \"Mobile VR is at the brick-phone stage of its evolution,\" O’Luanaigh said. \"We are going to see it evolve so rapidly with new GPUs and CPUs. Position tracking will be coming to mobile VR; they’ll get smaller and lighter. Then augmented reality and virtual reality will combine.\" It’s not surprising to find platform-agnostic game developers, but in this embryonic stage of modern consumer VR, the platform holders themselves seem to be pretty agnostic too. \"We are at this stage where we all need to help each other and help this ecosystem grow,\" Google’s Jazayeri said. \"You want the app developers to make money. A lot of the content is being subsidized right now, but at some point you have to reach the level of scale that doesn’t need that.\" \"I’m very grateful for all of the early investment Samsung has done with VR because we all benefit from it.\"",

      "text": "filed under: technology Like us on Facebook \nRecently, Google released a group of new online artificial-intelligence experiments powered by its cloud services, but one stands out more than the others. Quick, Draw! is a new game that guesses your drawings, no matter how crude, within a 20-second time limit, CNET reports. \nHere’s how it works: Once you start the challenge, Google will tell you to draw something using your mouse on desktop or finger on mobile. Similar to charades or Pictionary, you have 20 seconds to draw it, and Google's A.I. will try its best to figure it out while tossing out possible answers using its advanced neural network technology. In fact, it uses the same handwriting technology as Google Translate . The game learns from its mistakes and tries to improve its recognition skills with each round. Items drawn can be simple like a paperclip or more intricate like a hospital, police car, or fireplace. \nAfter playing for one round, I drew four correct items out of six, as Google’s A.I. had trouble figuring out my shovel and fireplace (or I just need to do a better job drawing them). When my drawings were incomprehensible, it chimed in with \"I have no clue what you're drawing. Sorry I couldn't guess it.\" before it moved on to the next item to draw. \nQuick, Draw! is similar to Draw Something , but you’re playing with a computer instead of a friend. It’s very addicting and a good way to kill your work productivity. ",

      "title": "Google Pixel vs. Galaxy S7 video stabilization test: Does OIS make a difference?",
      "text": "How does the Pixel's crazy gyro-based stabilization compare to the Galaxy S7's OIS?\nThe Samsung Galaxy S7 and Google Pixel take radically different approaches to stabilizing your videos. On the GS7, you've got traditional optical image stabilization — a hardware feature that cushions the camera module to make video more stable, while also helping out with still shots in darker conditions. In addition, there's traditional software-based video stabilization available in the Settings menu.\nOn the Pixel, there's no physical stabilization — instead, Google's digital stabilization works with the phone's gyroscope to stabilize footage, with surprisingly great results.\nSo how do these differing approaches compare? Let's take a look.\nNote: We tested both phones at Full HD (1080p) resolution at 30 frames per second, since that's the default setting for both the GS7 and Pixel.\nWalking For our first test, we took the Pixel and Galaxy S7 out for a stroll. Both phones were held one-handed at a moderate walking pace at mid-day on an overcast day.\nWith stabilization turned off (the default for the GS7), Samsung's phone shows the telltale \"wobbling\" of an OIS-equipped camera. It's actually not too nauseating, but without any software stabilization going on more susceptible to sudden movements. That said, we're getting a full 1080p image here with plenty of detail, unlike the two stabilized clips.\nWith stabilization enabled, the footage from the GS7 becomes smoother, but with a cropped-in frame and less fine detail. Sudden movements are still visible in places, but the footage is noticeably smoother.\nThe Pixel produces a less saturated video than the GS7, with dynamic range taking a small hit too (notice the washed-out sky), however footage is almost unnaturally smooth. Google's phone even handles the motion of turning around halfway through the shot relatively well.\nPanning For our next test, we moved each phone through a figure-of-eight motion to see how well they handled smooth movement.\nThe Galaxy S7 without stabilization captured more fine detail than the other tests, but motion is noticeably jerky throughout. It's pretty unpleasant to watch.\nBring software stabilization into the mix on the GS7 and there's some noticeable ghosting and blurring, but otherwise the movement is smooth.\nIn this instance, the Pixel offers the best of both worlds — a wider viewport and smooth motion throughout, and nowhere near as much ghosting as the Galaxy S7.\nFaster movement For a more challenging test, we took the phones for a faster walk with dusk approaching. This time around, the Galaxy S7 (without stabilization) probably produced the best-looking footage, although with plenty of OIS-induced wobble.\nWith software stabilization enabled, the GS7 admirably evens out the jarring motion you see in the first clip, but there's a ton of ghosting, which is probably even more distracting. On top of that, fine detail gets obliterated, leaving you with a very soft image.\nThe Pixel does slightly better, with more fine detail and less ghosting, but the overall image has a distracting shimmer to it.\nSide-by-side comparison Galaxy S7 and Pixel side-by-side, both with stabilization enabled. Check out the difference.\nLow light Here's where things get interesting. As before, the GS7 without stabilization captures way more fine detail, and in this time around it's easily the best-looking of the three videos, even with lots of motion.\nEnabling stabilization on the GS7 in these conditions produces a soft, ghosty, unwatchable mess. (Notice the blurring around the streetlights and headlights.)\nThe video from the Pixel is still very soft, with not much fine detail at all, but it's easier on the eyes than the stabilized GS7 footage. Colors are also more accurate, a hallmark of the Pixel when shooting in low light.\nWrapping things up The Google Pixel manages to pull off some pretty impressive stabilization tricks, thanks to its use of data from the phone's gyroscope. By contrast, the Galaxy S7's stabilization mode (disabled by default) degrades image quality much more aggressively. That said, footage from the GS7 without stabilization enabled readily captures more fine detail than the Pixel, with slightly wider dynamic range.\nA few conclusions based on our testing:\nAny kind of software stabilization, even as good as the Pixel's, comes with some trade-off in terms of image quality. The Pixel's digital stabilization is generally better than the Galaxy S7's, thanks to its use of gyroscope data from the phone. Even with OIS, you'll get smoother pans with some kind of software stabilization. The impact of digital stabilization becomes more noticeable in lower-light conditions. At night, you'll lose a lot of fine detail. If you're shooting on a Galaxy S7, you probably want to leave the \"video stabilization\" option turned off. On the Pixel, video stabilization is enabled by default, and you should probably leave it that way.",

The affected people were, in fact, in violation of Google’s Terms of Service which prohibits you from commercially reselling any device. \nHowever, Google’s disproportionate response to the violation has been described as the “21st century version of losing priceless mementos in a house fire,” according to Daniel Eleff, the owner of the website Dan’s Deals , which initially spotted the bans following the complaints from forum members. \nThe violation, in a nutshell, involved consumers who bought their phones from Google’s Project Fi mobile operator, then shipped them to a reseller in New Hampshire, a state with no sale tax. The reseller agreed to split the profit from the resale of the devices, which were marked up, with those who shipped in their phones. \nObviously, this is a pretty shady arrangement on all the participants’ parts, and it does warrant a response of some kind from Google. But wiping out a user’s Google identity was a bit too much. \nAt the very least, it was argued, Google could have allowed those whose accounts were terminated to export their data. \nThe news of the bans was picked up by a number of media outlets this week, including T he Guardian , Consumerist , PCMag , Engadget , The AP and others. The AP also characterized Google’s actions as “a digital death sentence” – repeating Eleff’s sentiments – after interviewing those who lost access to their data following the Google ban. \nEleff, who has been tracking the issue on his Dan’s Deals site, posted a statement Google sent to him which explained that many of the Google accounts that were suspended were created “for the sole purpose of this scheme” – referring to the customers’ plans to resell their devices. \nBut that wasn’t universally true, which is why Google is now switching back on access to those with “genuine accounts.” \nIt was estimated that over 200 people were blocked from their accounts by Google. \nThe Guardian this morning spotted the update to Dan’s Deals website , which details Google’s change of heart. \n“After investigating the situation, we are restoring access to genuine accounts for customers who are locked out of many Google services they rely on,” the Google statement reads. \nWhile it’s good to hear that the punishment no longer exceeds the crime for those involved, the larger takeaway from this situation is a stark reminder of how much of our digital lives are out of our control. With one false move, people lost access to a significant part of their digital identity and trove of personal data. \nAs the AP report found by speaking with those affect, these people’s lives were immediately impacted in non-trivial ways – they missed emails with confirmation numbers for their flights, couldn’t access work files or medical records, didn’t spot messages about upcoming credit card payments, and so on. \nGoogle may be within its right to take an action – perhaps, ban violators from buying more phones? ask them to export their data and move to another provider? – but it shouldn’t have the right to completely shut off someone’s digital life instantly, with no warning. \n(image credits, email and screenshot: Dan’s Deals )",

      "title": "Google Suspends Hundreds of Accounts Involved in a Pixel Reseller Scheme",
      "text": "This week, hundreds of people found out their account was suspended for violating Google’s terms of service agreement. It wasn’t clear exactly what these people did at the time, but this was revealed as more comments came in through various forums on the internet. It turns out they were involved in a reseller scheme that took advantage of a loophole of the United States sales tax laws.\nAs it turns out, these people ended up buying Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones through Google’s Project Fi website and the Google Store. They had these smartphones shipped to New Hampshire, which is important because this state does not charge their residents any sales tax. Sales tax varies from state to state and can range anywhere between 0% to 9.5% on average. So along with out much the Pixel phones usually cost, sales tax can add another $50 – $80 on top of the purchase price.\nThis additional cost adds up if you’re a reseller who ships dozens of devices to customers around the country. The thing is, Google’s terms of service for buying a Pixel phone states the customer “may only purchase Devices for your personal use [and] may not commercially resell any Device”. Interestingly enough though, the New Hampshire reseller says they have been taking advantage of this loophole for years with Nexus phones.\nSo Google either didn’t care before, or this was a new rule added specifically for their new Pixel phones. Also, the people involved in this scheme not only had their access to the Google Store restricted, but Google also prevented them from accessing or using any of their services (like Gmail). This can be a big deal if you rely on Google services for work, or your own personal needs.\nThankfully though, this suspension short and these people have been allowed to use their accounts again . However, they were sent a warning that repeated violations of their terms of service would get their account banned permanently. For anyone else worried about this, head over to Google’s takeout system where you can archive and download lots of things associated with your account.\nSource: The Guardian \n",

      "text": "Google Live cases show trending topics on your Pixels' screens Each case will cost you $50. Share Save \nGoogle has launched two new Live case lines for its Pixel phones that come with their own live wallpapers, and one of them's a lot more relaxing than the other. The Google Earth Live cases feature beaches, ice formations and other beautiful photos of our planet taken from the company's satellite imagery. While each case matches a specific Google Earth photo, their live wallpaper changes everyday using a rotation of curated images from the program. You'll also find a shortcut button on the home screen that you can tap to explore the specific location currently shown on your screen. \nThe Google Trends Live case's wallpaper, on the other hand, might not always be as enjoyable to look at. Instead of satellite imagery, it displays the top trending Google Searches... which aren't always pleasant. If reading current events, no matter how unsavory, doesn't negatively affect you, you can double tap the screen to bring up more trending topics or tap on the wallpaper's button to load the Search results for each particular topic. \nBoth Live case lines are now available in the US. You can get them from Best Buy and Verizon or directly from Google's online store . \n*Verizon has acquired AOL, Engadget's parent company. However, Engadget maintains full editorial control, and Verizon will have to pry it from our cold, dead hands.",

      "text": "As reality slowly sinks in that Trump will become president of the United States of America, many of us are turning to other things — anything — for comfort.\nFor us at Mashable , it was Snapchat's Spectacles , the $130 camera glasses it started selling last week, the new MacBook Pros with Touch Bar and pointing fingers at Facebook's fake news problem for influencing election results.\nBecause next week is Thanksgiving in the U.S. and we'll be off spending times with our families, we've got an extra long MashTalk for you guys this week.\nSEE ALSO: Snapchat Spectacles review: Wearables have never been this cool\nJoining me on this week's podcast is Mashable chief correspondent Lance Ulanoff and tech editor Pete Pachal.\nAfter getting the Spectacles overnighted from LA (thanks Saba!), I spent last weekend using them in New York City. If you haven't read it, you can read my Spectacles review here .\nI snapped videos of myself eating pizza, flying a drone, taking photos with my phone — all hands-free.\nThough the camera-equipped sunglasses are only being sold through a \"Snapbot\" vending machine, which appears to be making its way across the country , and most people have yet to try them, I was really wowed by its simplicity. While not perfect (importing snaps to your phone is a slow process), Spectacles are shaping up to be one of the hottest \"toys\" of the year (along with the NES Classic Edition , of course).\nCircle videos are SO cool:\nThose who aren't understanding @Spectacles videos. Here's the only GIF you need. pic.twitter.com/CDXfCpM2PM\n— Raymond Wong 💾📼🍕 (@raywongy) November 14, 2016\nLook, Trump's win has been hard to accept for a lot of people. Hillary Clinton blamed her loss on FBI director James Comey for re-opening an investigation into her controversial emails just three days before Election Day.\nBut this week, as upset Americans tried to cope, Facebook emerged as another bearer of blame. Specifically, all the fake news published through the News Feed.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said he didn't think Facebook's fake news problem influenced the election and helped Trump win. But even Facebook's own employees disagree with him.\nEven if Zuckerberg refuses to believe it, many people would agree there is a rampant fake news issue. Following reports of Google News also being susceptible to fake news , Google's gone out to ban sites with fake news from its ad service.\nIs it time for the News Feed to die and for human news editors to return in place of algorithms?\nThe new 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar.\nImage: lili sams/mashable\nThe other big gadget to distract us from political news was Apple's new MacBook Pros with Touch Bar. You can read Lance's review on them here .\nBottom line: they're pretty — really pretty. It's too early to declare the Touch Bar revolutionary or a gimmick, but they're damn expensive and dongle hell is a very real thing .\nBuying a MacBook Pro has never been so hard, that's for sure.\nAgain, there won't be a MashTalk next week. We'll be back in two weeks. Thanks for your support and don't forget to leave your questions and comments by tweeting @Mash_Talk with the #MashTalk hashtag.\nBONUS: How Spotify made waves across the music universe",

      "text": "A cautionary tale for those wanting to make a profit on their Google Pixel.\nBe careful where you buy your Google Pixel . That's the message coming out of a series of banned accounts from people who bought Pixels in order to resell them, as first reported by Dan's Deals .\nTurns out that a few hundred people in New Hampshire purchased Pixels on behalf of a reseller, who then turned around and sold them at a profit to others. New Hampshire has no sales tax, which means the people buying them could sell them to the reseller at a profit, and the reseller could do the same. Oh, industry. That, according to the Google Store terms of service, is not allowed, and ended in the unceremonious ban and blocking of those accounts, some legitimate and some not. This lead to many people unable to access their Gmail or Google Drive content, with no immediate explanation.\nThere is good news, though: Google has restored the accounts of those who didn't realize they were doing anything wrong. In a statement sent to Android Central, Google explains:\nWe identified a scheme in which consumers were asked to purchase Pixel devices on behalf of a reseller, who then marked-up the cost of those devices in order to resell them to other customers. We prohibit the commercial resale of devices purchased through Project Fi or the Google Store so everyone has an equal opportunity to purchase devices at a fair price. Many of the accounts suspended were created for the sole purpose of this scheme, but since some customers were not aware of these Terms of Sale and are now locked out of many Google services they rely on, we're restoring access to these customers' accounts.\nA happy ending to a strange story, one that emphasizes how Google is trying to take more control over its product distribution as it inches more towards being a hardware vendor.\nGoogle Pixel + Pixel XL Google Pixel and Pixel XL review Google Pixel XL review: A U.S. perspective Google Pixel FAQ: Should you upgrade?

      "text": "print \nTrue confession: I thought about quitting Google Play Music. \nAfter declaring it better than Spotify last spring, I found myself disappointed with some features. Play Music's Concierge, which suggested music through a flow-chart of prompts it thought were relevant, wasn't adapting as much as I'd hoped, and its suggestions were getting old. Meanwhile, the app's personalized recommendations weren't as varied as I wanted. I knew I wasn’t alone when a friend, who'd taken my suggestion to use Play, said she was thinking about switching back to Pandora. \nPlay Music erased my complaints this week with a major update . \nGoogle has torn down the wall between contextual recommendations and personalized recommendations, introducing one simple interface that takes into account everything the service knows about you. \nThe new Play Music. Google Play Music \nIt is not only simpler than the old Play Music but also apparently a lot smarter. \nI’ve had the opportunity to compare and contrast versions because my Sonos app still uses the old Play Music interface. The difference is so stark that I tend to look up suggestions on the new Play Music and then search for them on Sonos. \nOne night this week OLD PLAY offered a set of underwhelming activity-based suggestions. Some were boring: \"focusing\" and \"working to a beat\" tend to lead to the same suggested stations I’ve heard dozens of times. Some weren’t relevant: I rarely spend my evening \"watching the sunset\" and I never listen to the comedy stations associated with \"laughing out loud.\" As for the non-contextual recommendations, there was some good stuff but little variety and, annoyingly, \"Simply Christmas\" from Leslie Odom Jr. kept appearing on top despite my having no interest in Christmas music in November. \nMeanwhile, NEW PLAY offered six great suggestions in one place. There was \"Falsettoland,\" a musical I’ve been listening to all month, which the old app never thought to recommend. \"Focusing\" with \"Lisztomania\" was a good activity-based suggestion and an option I don’t remember landing on in the old app. \"Similar to head-nodding beats\" got my attention, and the suggested station, featuring Tribe, Roots, Mos Def, and Pete Rock sounded good and was a station I never saw on the old app. Count Bass D radio was a great option, which might show up on the old app but wasn't then. \"More like the Bamboos\" referred to a band I hadn't heard of but which I must have thumbed up on a another station. Finally, a recommended new release in \"Slum Village, Vol. 0.\" \nIf none of those suggestions worked, of course, the app has other ways to browse or search for music. \nInside Play Music? Daft Punk in \"Tron\" \nThe new Play Music is not only simple and smart but deep. While the app has nowhere near as many playlists as Spotify , Play Music’s team puts a lot of work into building curated stations (stations that are now easier to find than ever). With those curated stations, top-level custom radio, and a huge library that is very similar to the competition, aside from a few weeks of Kanye exclusivity here and there , packaged in an unmatched interface, Play Music is a great choice. \nFree users can listen to radio with occasional ads. $9.99/month subscribers get on-demand, ad-free listening as well as a subscription to YouTube Red, letting them watch YouTube videos without ads and some exclusive content. \nSpotify, Apple Music, and others are striving for the same thing: a smart interface that quickly surfaces what you want at any given moment. So for that matter are Netflix , Amazon, Apple , and almost any online service company. When it comes to music streaming, though, I think Google does it best.",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — Some of Google’s unwitting users are learning a harsh lesson: If you violate the company’s policies, it can abruptly cut you off from your Gmail account, online photos and other vital digital services.\nSeveral people who recently bought Google’s new Pixel phone on behalf of a New Hampshire dealer are now suffering that punishment after the company detected their online purchases and judged they violated its terms of service. Those rules, outlined in a document that few people read closely, forbid the purchase of the Pixel for “commercial” resale.\n“There isn’t an hour that doesn’t go by that I don’t think about the enormity of what Google has done to me,” said one of the affected resellers, Shmuel Super of Brooklyn, New York. “This is like a digital death sentence .”\nSell your phone, lose your account Super and his fellow resellers got into trouble for buying up to five Pixel phones from Google’s online store and having them delivered to New Hampshire for resale. They received $5 for each phone. As of Sunday, some started finding themselves locked out of their Google accounts.\nPlay Video CBSN What to expect from Google's new Pixel phone Google is gearing up for a big event in San Francisco Tuesday, where it expected to announce several new products. The product getting the most h... \nIn a Thursday statement, Google described the resale arrangement as a “scheme” devised by a dealer looking to sell the Pixels at marked-up prices in violation of its policies.\nGoogle declined to say how many people were affected by the account lockdown. DansDeals, a consumer-focused website that first reported Google’s crackdown, concluded that more than 200 people had been blocked from their Google accounts after talking to the New Hampshire dealer behind the Pixel buying spree. The Associated Press was unsuccessful in its efforts to identify and interview the dealer.\nThe crackdown may come as a surprise to the hundreds of millions of people who now routinely rely on Google, Facebook , Apple and other tech companies as the caretakers of their digital lives. Few of the people involved in this situation appear to have backed up their data outside of Google.\nGoogle said it plans to restore the accounts of customers who it believes were unaware of the rules, although the company didn’t specify how long that might take.\nLiving without Google Once they figured out why they were being locked out, the exiled consumers realized how dependent they had become on Google as the custodian of their digital communications, records and other mementoes.\nPlay Video CBS This Morning Facebook, Google trying to stop spread of fake news People who got election news on Facebook might have been looking at more fake stories than real ones. BuzzFeed reached that surprising conclusion... \nSome said they couldn’t retrieve confirmation numbers for upcoming flights or notices about an upcoming credit-card payment. Others couldn’t fetch work documents or medical records. Some started getting phone calls from friends, family and colleagues wondering why they weren’t responding to emails.\nLike other two other people interviewed by the AP, Super said he had no idea that he was violating Google’s policies when he bought the Pixels for the New Hampshire dealer. He can’t believe Google would do something as extreme as locking him out of his account without warning, rather than just banning him from buying its phones in the future.\n“Google’s slogan is ‘Don’t be evil,’ but to me, there is nothing more evil that what Google has done here,” Super said.\nCrime and punishment Some of the Pixels purchased for resale were delivered before Google recognized the violations and meted out a punishment spelled out in a separate terms-of-service document . “We may suspend or stop providing our services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct,” Google warns in one section.\nGoogle doesn’t give any advance notice before it shuts down an account, and doesn’t make distinctions between minor and major violations. Affected users can appeal for reinstatement, though it’s unclear how long that might take or what criteria Google uses in such cases.\nApple also forbids online purchases of iPhones for resale, although its terms of service say only that the company reserves the right to cancel any order suspected of breaking the rule.\nDaniel Levy, who has been locked out from his Google account since Monday, said he has learned a hard lesson, though not necessarily the one the company intended.\n“They confiscated my property and shouldn’t be trusted,” said Levy, who lives in Lakewood, New Jersey. “I will never use their services again.”",

      "text": "An odd story popped up this week on the deal site DansDeals . There was some kind of \"deal\" that involved making money through the resale of Google's Pixel phones, and once Google caught wind of it, a lot of people had their Google accounts banned.\nApparently a phone reseller in New Hampshire was running some kind of crowd-sourced inventory acquisition program using the consumer Google site. It instructed people to buy phones from the Project Fi site and list the dealer's NH address as their \"home address\" so phones would be shipped directly to the dealer. The buyers were then paid enough to make a profit on the transaction (probably helped by the fact that NH has no sales tax), and the New Hampshire dealer would later resell the phone at a markup.\nWhen Google caught wind of the shipping shenanigans, it \"suspended\" the Google Accounts of everyone that shipped a phone to the dealer. That means these users were banned from every Google service—Gmail, all their pictures on Google Photos, their documents on Google Drive, and every other piece of Google data was taken away. Something like this wouldn't only affect Google services; think about how many sites do authentication or send critical information over e-mail.\nAccording to DansDeals, the dealer ended up buying \"a few thousand phones\" through this scheme—with a purchase limit of five phones per account. That's a lot of people who were banned.\nThere's no arguing the facts: these users broke the Google Store terms of sale . This document clearly states, \"You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device.\" Google's response—to take away what amounts to some users' entire digital lives with no way to recover their data—seems like a disproportionate punishment, however. And after being poked by a couple of news organizations (Ars included), Google relented and sent out the following statement:\nWe identified a scheme in which consumers were asked to purchase Pixel devices on behalf of a reseller, who then marked-up the cost of those devices in order to resell them to other customers. We prohibit the commercial resale of devices purchased through Project Fi or the Google Store so everyone has an equal opportunity to purchase devices at a fair price. Many of the accounts suspended were created for the sole purpose of this scheme, but since some customers were not aware of these Terms of Sale and are now locked out of many Google services they rely on, we’re restoring access to these customers’ accounts.\nThose who were banned should be getting their accounts restored soon. The moral of the story is probably to read the terms of service, have backups for your data, and maybe don't mess with companies that you store your entire digital life with. Provided your account isn't banned, you can always download all your Google data via Google Takeout .",

      "title": "Google will bring ‘custom’ Intel Skylake Xeon chips to Compute Engine in early 2017",
      "text": "Google today announced that it will bring new “Custom Cloud” Intel Skylake Xeon chips to its Google Compute Engine public cloud infrastructure service in early 2017. Those chips form the basis of the virtual machines (VMs) and containers in which third developers can run the code for their applications and pay by the minute.\nIntel recently said new Skylake Xeon server chips would be coming. But Intel likes to work closely with cloud providers. Yesterday Google and Intel announced a strategic alliance around cloud, and now Google is committing to bringing this new generation of chips to customers. \n“The upcoming Xeon processor is an excellent choice for graphics rendering, simulations and any CPU intensive workload,” Google Cloud Platform product manager Hanan Youssef wrote in a blog post . “At launch, Compute Engine customers will be able to utilize the processor’s AVX-512 extensions to optimize their enterprise-class and HPC workloads.”\nJust as people want to buy computers and phones with newer generations of chips, cloud providers want to provide servers packing the latest chips with the best performance and power efficiency. So that part makes sense. But the chips being talked about today are described as Custom Cloud, which is a distinction Intel started making in 2014 that represents a higher degree of collaboration. \nPublic cloud market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced the M4 VM instance type last year that relies on “custom” Xeon Haswell chips. But for years AWS has talked up its partnership with Intel, often executives onstage at its annual re:Invent conference. That event is coming up in a couple of weeks. The timing of today’s announcement could be motivated by a desire at Google to get out in front of another announcement about collaboration between AWS and Intel. \nIn any case, Google is letting customers sign up to be informed about beta testing opportunities for the Skylake-based VMs.\n",

      "text": "Google's DeepMind AI gets a few new tricks to learn faster It can now achieve 87 percent of \"expert human performance\" in one game. Save AP Photo/Lee Jin-man \nWhen it comes to machine learning, every performance gain is worth a bit of celebration. That's particularly true for Google's DeepMind division, which has already proven itself by beating a Go world champion , mimicking human speech and cutting down their server power bills . Now, the team has unveiled new \"reinforcement learning\" methods to speed up how the AI platform trains itself without being directly taught. \nFirst off, DeepMind's learning agent has a better grasp of controlling pixels on the screen. Google notes it's \"similar to how a baby might learn to control their hands by moving them and observing the movements.\" By doing this, it can figure out the best way to get high scores and play games more efficiently. Additionally, the agent can now figure out rewards from a game based on past performance. \"By learning on rewarding histories much more frequently, the agent can discover visual features predictive of reward much faster,\" Google says. The company laid out the entire concept for the abilities in a paper, \" Reinforcement Learning with Unsupervised Auxiliary Tasks .\" \nThese skills, along with DeepMind's previous Deep Reinforcement Learning methods , make up the group's new UNREAL (UNsupervised REinforcement and Auxiliary Learning) agent. That's a mouthful, but the big takeaway is that DeepMind is beginning to teach itself much like humans. The group describes the methods as being similar to the way animals dream about positive and negative events (though I wouldn't really say DeepMind has learned how to \"dream\"). \nIn a 3D maze environment called Labryinth , Google says the UNREAL agent was able to learn stages around ten times faster. It has managed to achieve 87 percent of \"expert human performance\" in that game, and around nine times typical human performance in a bevy of Atari titles. \nOn the face of it, UNREAL should help DeepMind's agents significantly. But we'll have to wait and see if those performance gains can actually be used in scenarios beyond games. ",

In addition, it comes with a live wallpaper that can display even more images from Google Earth on your Pixel smartphone.\nGet it at the Google Store \nThe Google Trends case is even more interesting. It comes in two colors (Sunset and Asphalt) but the live wallpaper that is included actually shows what’s currently trending online via the Google Trends system. Trending topics can be viewed from that wallpaper and you can see what’s hot on the net in the last 24 hours.\nGet it from the Google Store As with any of the Live Cases for the Pixel phones, all of the new designs for the Google Earth and Google Trends cases can be moved or rotated before you buy them in the Google Store interface to get a more customized look to the case.

      "text": "Google released a developer update to Chrome OS today that brings Android app support to four new Chromebook models. The laptops include the Dell Chromebook 13, HP 13, Samsung Chromebook 3, and ASUS C301SA. If you’d like to get access to the Google Play Store on any one of these machines, you have to run the most recent developer version of Chrome OS, which may contain bugs and other rough edges when it comes to full Android app support. \nRunning Android apps in a laptop environment was first announced back at the Google I/O developer conference in May. Since then, Google has slowly built out the feature and pushed beta versions of it through its Chrome OS developer channel. To try it out, check to see that you have one of these supported Chromebooks . And then make sure you’re running the most up-to-date version of Chrome OS available . While some models have access to Android apps running stable versions of the software, it looks like for now the models mentioned above require you to be running the developer version. \n- Via: Phandroid - Source: The Chromoum Projects",

      "text": " Google+ LinkedIn Comments Print The Boston Globe Tweet Share\nAram Boghosian for The Boston Globe\nPam Shanley of Medford holds a \"Peace\" sign during a Love Trumps Hate gathering at Powder House Park in Somerville.\nBy Beverly Beckham November 18, 2016\n“It’s raining, but it’s still the beach!”\nMy cousin, Terry, posted these words on Facebook last week along with a photo of her and a friend smiling under a gray sky with a darker gray Atlantic Ocean in the background.\nAdvertisement\nBoth women are wearing scarves and jackets. Their hair is wind blown. They are getting wet. It’s not the kind of day either had hoped for.\nAnd I thought, looking at her photo and reading her words, isn’t this true for America, too? It’s raining, but this is still the USA. Despite all that’s been dredged up by the election. Despite so much nastiness and name calling and negativity. Despite the sudden sea change, isn’t this still the land of the free? A country that’s better than what it seems to be right now?\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Terry could have sat in her car and cursed her bad luck. She could have Facebooked, “I came 3,000 miles for this?” But she didn’t let the weather defeat her. She zipped up her jacket, got out of the car, breathed in the cool, fresh air, smiled as the seagulls cawed and appreciated what the rain couldn’t take away.\nCome Thanksgiving, the annual day of giving thanks, maybe we should do the same. Count our blessings. Appreciate what we have.\nAnd then think of ways to protect what we have.\nAdvertisement\nI don’t believe that every person who voted for Donald Trump is a bigot. I believe that many Trump supporters voted simply for change. And change won.\nBut so did the bigots.\nAmericans have disagreed before. We have been on different sides of history and presidents and social issues many times. This is how democracy works. It’s messy and it’s loud and it’s frustrating and confrontational and divisive.\nBut democracy has never before been so rife with disrespect and meanness and hate.\nI blame Donald Trump for this. He set the tone. He gave all the haters not just a green light, but a wink, too. And they’ve come out of the shadows en masse.\nBut Donald Trump did not create the hate that is pouring down on us now. This hate has been around for a long, long time. Only it’s been camouflaged and hidden and denied.\nAnd that’s been a problem because it is impossible to fight what people insist does not exist. And so it seems that the silver lining in these most fractured of times is this: The hate is out there, on tongues, on walls, in words and in actions, for every one to see.\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center is a nonprofit organization that tracks hate groups and hate crimes. Usually in a six-month period there are some 300 reported hate crimes. Last week it posted that in the six days following the election, there were more than 315. These numbers were corroborated by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. One can only imagine the number of unreported “incidents.”\nHere’s one. A friend was walking in the South End on the Thursday night after the election. A car drove past him and the four young men inside screamed, “Faggot!” “This is certainly not the first time,” he wrote on his Facebook page. “Nor, I’m sure, will it be the last. But it was the first time I was honestly scared.”\nHere’s two. Xavier, a first-grader, whose father is black, was talking with a classmate. The classmate said he was voting for Trump. Xavier asked, “Why?” “Because he will send all the black people away because they are killing the white people.”\nHere’s three. A 40-year-old woman, who has been riding the New York subway for years, was called a “white bitch” for the first time last Monday.\nTrump’s words have done this. They’ve fanned the flames. But they have also illuminated the problem. Now the underbelly is visible. Now there is no denying the hate.\nDonald Trump may well be the worst thing that’s ever happened to our country, or he may be the best.\nThis is up to us. We can add to all the hate by hating back. We can sit around and just complain. Or we can work together not just to change people’s minds but to change people’s hearts.\nIt’s in this way, and it is the only way, that we will make America great again.\nBeverly Beckham’s column appears every two weeks.

      "text": " Google+ Renée Graham Globe Staff November 20, 2016\nBrendan Smialowski/Getty Images\nLongtime PBS journalist Gwen Ifill died at the age of 61 after battling cancer.\nD uring the 2004 vice presidential debate between Dick Cheney and John Edwards, moderator Gwen Ifill posed a question that, in modern parlance, amounted to a mic drop.\n“I want to talk to you about AIDS,” she said. “And not about AIDS in China or Africa, but AIDS right here in this country, where black women between the ages of 25 and 44 are 13 times more likely to die of the disease than their counterparts. What should the government’s role be in helping to end the growth of this epidemic?”\nAdvertisement\nAt the time, AIDS was the leading cause of death for black women between the ages of 25 and 44, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but neither candidate was prepared for the question. “I was not aware that it was that severe an epidemic there,” admitted Cheney, then vice president in the Bush administration. Even Cheney’s use of “there” was telling, as if African-American women lived in some distant, forgotten land.\nLike much of the country, the candidates weren’t wrestling with issues affecting the African-American community, let alone specifically black women. That night, in the spotlight with two men vying to be a heartbeat from the presidency, only Ifill was doing that work.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Since her death last week, Ifill has been hailed as one of the greatest journalists of her generation. From her days as a Washington Post and New York Times reporter to her move to television on NBC News, then PBS as moderator and managing editor of “Washington Week” and, with Judy Woodruff, co-anchor and co-managing editor of “NewsHour,” she distinguished herself as tough, fair, and always meticulously prepared. Woodruff called Ifill “a supernova in a profession loaded with smart and talented people.”\nView Story Simmons College mourns for journalist Gwen Ifill, an alumna “She was very encouraging to young women journalists,” said Helen Drinan, the school’s president.\nIn an industry still overwhelmingly white and male, Ifill was also a beacon for African-American journalists, especially black women. With Ifill, one could see long-barred doors pried open through tenacity and talent. During a “NewsHour” tribute to Ifill, journalist Kevin Merida said when he met Ifill “she felt a little like a unicorn.” That was more than 30 years ago when Merida was a Boston University student and editor of the school’s black student newspaper, and Ifill, a Simmons College graduate, was working at the Boston Herald-American.\n“For many young black journalists or aspiring black journalists, we didn’t know many people like Gwen,” said Merida, editor of ESPN’s sports and culture website, The Undefeated. Today, journalists of color are more visible. NBC’s Lester Holt anchors the network’s Nightly News. Dean Baquet is executive editor of The New York Times. MSNBC’s Joy Reid and Tamron Hall, and (for better or worse) CNN’s Don Lemon host news shows on their respective networks.\nAdvertisement\nStill, newsroom diversity remains an insistent issue. As the nation becomes more multicultural, figures for working journalists of color have stagnated over the past decade. While minorities now make up 37 percent of this country’s population, newsroom representation is stuck between 12 to 14 percent. According to a 2015 survey by the American Society of Newspaper Editors, there were 32,900 daily working journalists; 12.7 percent, or 4,200, were people of color. (At The Boston Globe, people of color make up about 15 percent of the more than 350 full-time and part-time editorial employees.)\nFor the past decade, shrinking newsrooms have been forced to do more with less. Yet the mission for trained, competent journalists has never been more essential. Reporters of color bring varied experiences, opinions, and observations overlooked in predominantly white newsrooms — that’s how Ifill forced the AIDS deaths of black women on a national debate stage. Whether in digital or traditional media, journalists of color must occupy an integral role in disseminating the news, and in greater numbers than ever before.\nIfill was always attuned to this. While moderating a debate between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, she asked a question about race, but not in a way anyone expected from a black woman: “I want to talk to you about white people.”\n“White people?” said Sanders incredulously, as the audience tittered. She asked, “Don’t [working-class whites] have a reason to be resentful?” As with Cheney and Edwards, the candidates were caught off guard; Ifill had considered the issues more broadly than they did. Perhaps if the Democrats had been better prepared to answer her question, Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump, would be making plans to move into the White House.\nAs Ifill did throughout her career, reporters of color understand and embrace their unique role. Faced with an incoming administration led by man who loves nothing more than threatening press freedoms and tweet-storming newspapers and individual reporters, racial stagnation in newsrooms not only hurts the media, but the citizens the media is designed to inform. Journalists of color may no longer be unicorns, but they are still too rare at a time when their voices will be needed most.\nRenée Graham writes regularly for the Globe.

They switched to Clinton this year.\nBy Jacob Carozza and Vanessa Nason Globe Correspondents November 18, 2016\nAs citizens across the country watched the electoral map turn red the night of Nov. 8, a small town north of Boston turned unexpectedly blue.\nBoxford, the only municipality in Greater Boston that had voted Republican in every presidential election since Richard M. Nixon’s 1972 campaign, went for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.\nAdvertisement\n“I have no idea where it came from,” said Elaine Spiro, secretary of the Boxford Council on Aging. She said everyone she spoke to in town was shocked.\nBut Boxford was far from the only town in Greater Boston to switch party allegiances this presidential election. Twenty-five communities that had backed Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 voted for Clinton on Nov. 8. Only four towns in the region — Bellingham, Freetown, Salisbury, and Saugus — flipped in the other direction to support Trump.\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: The day's top stories delivered every morning Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here While a Globe analysis of statewide election results showed a reddening of Massachusetts’ western counties, the cities and suburbs to the east turned a deeper shade of blue. Clinton was backed by 130 of about 160 Greater Boston communities, compared with 109 that voted for President Obama four years ago.\nTowns that flipped from Republican to Democrat More than two dozen Greater Boston communities voted for Hillary Clinton in this election after backing Mitt Romney in 2012.\nThe towns that flipped from the Republican to Democratic column this year share two major characteristics: Their residents in general have high incomes and are highly educated. In each town, the median household income and the share of the population 25 years or older with a bachelor’s degree or higher is well above the statewide average.\nThe communities include a string of South Shore towns stretching from Hingham to Duxbury; affluent western suburbs like Dover, Medfield, and Norfolk; and small but wealthy towns north of Boston, such as Topsfield and Hamilton.\nAdvertisement\nMichael Kryzanek, professor emeritus of political science at Bridgewater State University, said Clinton’s relative strength in those places may be explained by some voters’ distaste for Trump, coupled with the existence of liberal Republicans in the Charlie Baker mold.\n“I think a number of those liberal Republicans in the coastal area would have no difficulty crossing party lines, because of their likely disgust of Donald Trump,” Kryzanek said.\nDuxbury, where the median household income is over $120,000, saw a dramatic swing between 2012 and 2016. Romney defeated Obama there by more than 11 percentage points, but this year, Clinton beat Trump by more than 12 percentage points.\nThe town’s Republican committee endorsed Trump, and its chairman, David Uitti, said he did not personally know of any registered Republicans in Duxbury who voted for Clinton. But, he added, “I suspect there are some who either voted third party, or who followed the lead of the governor and didn’t vote for anyone for president.”\nUitti doesn’t see Clinton’s win in Duxbury as a sign that its residents’ political leanings have changed.\n“I don’t see any kind of shift happening in Duxbury,” Uitti said, “or on the South Shore, which has traditionally been a pretty big Republican stronghold in Massachusetts. I think the function of how things occurred in this election are simply because of the candidate that was running.”\nIn affluent Hopkinton, where Romney won by a mere 128 votes in 2012, the contest this year wasn’t even close. Clinton won 60 percent of the vote, with Trump netting under a third.\nClinton was backed by 130 of 160 Greater Boston communities, compared with 109 that voted for Obama in 2012.\nDarlene Hayes, chairwoman of the town’s Democratic committee, chalked up part of Clinton’s strength to her committee’s robust effort to knock on doors and make phone calls.\n“We even had Joe Kennedy come up,” Hayes said.\nWhile she knew Republicans who crossed party lines to vote for Clinton, she doesn’t believe a political realignment is happening in Hopkinton. In fact, she said, the town’s Republicans and Democrats have a lot in common: The “fiscally conservative, socially liberal” label applies to both.\n“There’s less people we’d refer to as ‘Birkenstock Democrats’ in Hopkinton,” she said. That has an effect on elections: “Normally, we’re very, very close,” Hayes said.\nDespite Clinton’s strength in many of Boston’s most affluent suburbs, a cluster of reliably Republican towns south of the city — including Middleborough, Carver, and Halifax — backed Trump more strongly than they did Romney, according to an earlier Globe analysis.\nKryzanek says that area, where incomes and education levels are not quite as high as they are on the coast, has attracted many working-class families in recent decades.\n“Housing is relatively cheaper here,” Kryzanek explained. “The highway system is such that people can get around; the train is here; the schools are not Weston or Wellesley, but they’re pretty good school systems.”\n“These aren’t very diverse towns at all,” said Peter Ubertaccio, a political science professor at Stonehill College, “but there are going to be more blue-collar workers who have been more susceptible to change in the economy.”\nSalisbury, tucked in the state’s northeastern corner, gave President Obama a win of almost eight percentage points in 2012. This year, Trump edged out Clinton by more than 3 points.\nWhile Salisbury’s median household income is more than $8,000 higher than the statewide average, the share of the population with a college education is more than 10 percentage points lower than the statewide average.\n“We’re working class up here,” said Marshall Maguire, chairman of the town’s Republican committee. “We have a lot of union people here.”\nLike many communities in Massachusetts and across the country where Trump outperformed Romney, Salisbury is sparsely populated — about 8,500 people live there.\n“Trump’s message is resonating in rural areas,” Ubertaccio said. “It may be that Mitt Romney just wasn’t able to speak to those folks four years ago.”\nAnd in Boxford?\nMike Cosco, owner of West Village Provisions in town, attributes it to a sense of discontentment he thinks many Republicans across the country had been feeling since Trump’s nomination in July.\n“It’s got to be that Trump isn’t a traditional Republican candidate,” he said. “I think a lot of people were voting against Trump and not for Clinton.”\nJacob Carozza can be reached at jacob.carozza@globe.com .

It’s set to open in 2019 and will include two hotels in one building—a Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites. The hotels expect to draw from business travelers, conventioneers and vacationers boarding cruise ships at the nearby Black Falcon terminal.\nAdvertisement\nTourism officials have identified a shortage of hotel rooms near the Convention Center as an obstacle to booking bigger shows. The developer, Eamon O’Marah of Harbinger Development LLC, said he hopes this project will help address that need.\n“We are thrilled to move our Marine Wharf project forward to the next phase and to construction,” said O’Marah. “Marine Wharf will create a dynamic gateway development that complements the area.”\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday.

Harbinger has also agreed to manage of a city-owned park next door.\nAlso thursday, the BPDA Thursday approved a 177-unit apartment complex at Hood Park in Charlestown, a 73-unit apartment building and adjacent synagogue in Brighton Center, 64 condominiums on Border Street in East Boston and smaller residential projects in Dorchester, Jamaica Plain, the South End and West Roxbury.\nTim Logan can be reached at tim.logan@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+ LinkedIn Comments Print The Boston Globe Tweet Share\nAram Boghosian for The Boston Globe\nA Green Line train pulled into the Lechmere Station in 2014.\nBy Nicole Dungca Globe Staff November 18, 2016\nWhat will a President Trump mean for the long-awaited Green Line extension into Somerville and Medford?\nAs political watchers in Washington and beyond try to guess what kind of administration President-elect Donald Trump will run, state transportation officials are also watching how the new administration could affect local funds.\nAdvertisement\nTrump campaigned on a platform that called for heavy infrastructure spending, a sign that could potentially bode well for transportation projects. That appeared to be good news for the embattled Green Line extension that the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is moving forward on — and which is banking on $1 billion from the federal government.\nBut Trump’s controversial — and sometimes contradictory — statements on the campaign trail could cause some uncertainty.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Somerville and Cambridge, both involved in the Green Line extension, are so-called “sanctuary cities,” which generally do not cooperate with immigration officials to detain undocumented immigrants. A strong critic of undocumented immigrants during his campaign, Trump made headlines promising an end to federal funding to such cities.\nWould moving on those promises cut funding to Green Line extension project, which is counting on that massive federal grant?\nIf local and national transportation funding watchers are worried, they’re not letting on. University of Minnesota’s David M. Levinson, a transportation analyst and professor, said that defunding sanctuary cities could affect so many communities that it’s essentially a non-starter. And several leaders of sanctuary cities have already said they plan to be defiant if Trump does make good on his promise.\nAdvertisement\nUS Representative Michael Capuano, a Democrat from Somerville, said he doesn’t see a problem quite yet, adding that officials must see “which part of the rhetoric comes to fruition.” Capuano pointed to Trump’s promises about rebuilding infrastructure, which the President-elect referenced again in a recent “60 Minutes” interview.\n“He’s a New Yorker,” said Capuano. “He knows how good the subway is, and he has seen how bad New York is when the subway shuts down.”\nTransportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack, who hasn’t commented on the sanctuary city speculation, said recently on WGBH-FM’s Boston Public Radio program that big projects tend to survive changes in administration.\nIn an interview after an MBTA fiscal control board meeting, she has also pointed out that Congress already passed a bipartisan transportation funding deal, referring to a $305 billion highway and transit bill signed by President Barack Obama last December.\n“It happened after Paul Ryan was the House speaker, and we’re assuming that bill will continue to control our federal funding levels,” she said, referring to the Republican from Wisconsin known for his support of austere federal spending. “For right now, we’re just going ahead and doing our work as if our federal funding is going to continue at levels that Congress has authorized.”\nLevinson said it would be unlikely for a new president to try to walk back transportation money that Congress had fought over for years.\n“In terms of spending priorities, most money has been allocated from the previous transportation bill,” Levinson said. “The question is whether there’s new money coming up in anything.”\nTrump has touted a $3 trillion spending plan that relies mostly on giving incentives to convince private firms to invest in building roads, bridges, and other big transportation projects — but Levinson said that it would likely only apply to select projects with very high returns. And that description doesn’t generally apply to the money-losing public transit projects that urban centers need to battle decades of underinvestment.\nWhat if Trump actually wants to make extending transit lines or spending big federal dollars on transportation a priority?\nHe’ll face a skeptical Congress. With Republicans capturing the majority in both chambers, any ambitions for substantially increasing federal funding for transit would likely face a lot of pushback unless it relies on substantial private sector help.\nMany transportation watchers are taking a “wait and see” attitude. Pollack said she’ll keep talking with the national American Public Transportation Association, and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to keep updated on whether there will be any changes in funding.\nAnd as news trickles out about Trump’s new administration in the coming weeks, transportation is likely to take a back seat to talks about higher-profile appointments, such as secretary of state and attorney general.\n“There’s a lot of uncertainty about this administration,” said Levinson. “But transportation spending doesn’t seem to be the thing they should be worried about in this administration.”\nNicole Dungca can be reached at nicole.dungca@globe.com .

In exchange, the curators get credit toward long-term leases.\nThe program dates to 1994 and has led to the reuse of buildings including Bascom Lodge at Mount Greylock State Reservation, which is now a mountaintop restaurant; Crosby Mansion in Nickerson State Park, which is now a museum; and the Walter Baker Administration Building in Dorchester, which now hosts artist lofts.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

      "text": " Google+ LinkedIn Comments Print The Boston Globe Tweet Share\nJohn Tlumacki/Globe Staff\nGene Williams, Amesbury: “I take pride in how Wampanoags welcomed the settlers. They played an important part in the history of this country.”\nBy Linda Greenstein Globe Correspondent November 18, 2016\nThere is no “thanks” in Thanksgiving for most Native Americans, no turkey with all the fixings around a table filled with family and friends.\nFor many indigenous people in Greater Boston, the holiday is a day of mourning as they reflect on centuries of racism, genocide, and attempts to destroy their culture.\nAdvertisement\nJust as there is no one Native American nation, there is no one way to mark the holiday. What to do on Thanksgiving is an individual decision often based on tribal history, personal experience, and family traditions.\nMahtowin Munro, who lives in Boston and is coleader of the United American Indians of New England , and Northeastern University student Thalia Carroll-Cachimuel of Watertown will join hundreds at the 47th National Day of Mourning in Plymouth on Thanksgiving Day.\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\nJoyce Rain Anderson, Brockton: “It is concerning that the myth of the first Thanksgiving is still being perpetuated in schools across the state.”\nGet Todays Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Joyce Rain Anderson of Brockton has attended the gathering in previous years. This Thanksgiving, she will take a walk and reflect on the past but also look to the future.\nClaudia Fox Tree, who raised her family in Bedford and recently moved to Billerica, will fast and reflect on the struggles of her people.\nDespite his Narragansett and Apache lineage, Gene Williams of Amesbury grew up with a conventional Thanksgiving feast and will continue that family tradition.\nAdvertisement\nAs he has been for most of the past two decades, Darius Coombs will be at the Wampanoag Homesite in Plimoth Plantation , sharing the history and culture of his people with guests.\n“We have an obligation to help people understand and respect our history and culture,” said Coombs, who lives in Falmouth. “All the staff at the Wampanoag Homesite are Native Americans. On Thanksgiving, some will wear black face paint as a sign of mourning to remember those that died so that we would be here.”\nFox Tree, who is part of the Arawak Nation, is a public school teacher. She also gives lectures on Native American identity, culture, and history.\n“That first Thanksgiving was a myth that has been perpetuated through the years.” she said. “There was not just one Thanksgiving celebration. There were many and the real history is that Thanksgiving was a celebration of massacring the indigenous people.\n“Our people have always been thankful for the Earth and our natural resources. My family hosts a dinner of thanks on the September equinox, where we give thanks for the seasons.”\nWilliams, 70, is a volunteer with the Mass. Center for Native American Awareness, based in Danvers. He speaks about Native American history and cultures at schools and for community groups.\n“I take pride in how Wampanoags welcomed the settlers,” he said. “They played an important part in the history of this country. If they had not helped the Pilgrims, the next ship would not have come.\n“I do not look at the history as one of racism. For me, it was one period of time versus another. Native Americans and indigenous people around the world could not stem the tide of Europeans.”\nOthers, such as Munro, have a different perspective.\n“Did the history of this land begin in 1620? Were there no people here before the English came?” she asked. “Plymouth Rock is a monument to racism. At the National Day of Mourning, we gather on Cole’s Hill and tell the history of the Wampanoag people and challenge the myth of why the Pilgrims came and that everyone lived happily ever after.”\nAccording to US Census figures from 2015, about 33,972 — or 0.5 percent — of Massachusetts residents are Native Americans. There may be more.\n“Historically, we were not encouraged to identify ourselves,” said Ramona Peters, tribal historic preservation officer for the Mashpee Wampanoag.\nAnderson, of Brockton, is an associate professor of English and the Ethnic and Indigenous Studies coordinator at Bridgewater State University.\n“It is concerning that the myth of the first Thanksgiving is still being perpetuated in schools across the state,” she said. “Unfortunately, there are schools out there where some children still wear Pilgrim hats and others wear feathered headdresses. The time leading up to Thanksgiving is fraught with tension for many Native Americans.”\nKieran Kesner for The Boston Globe\nThalia Carroll-Cachimuel, Watertown: “Every year it is inspiring to be part of the rally and to show support for indigenous people around the world as we reflect on the history of our ancestors and address current and future issues.”\nCarroll-Cachimuel of Watertown, who is 21 and studying social justice at Northeastern, represents the future.\n“I have been attending the Day of Mourning for as long as I can remember,” she said. “My father is Kichwa. My mother is white. She grew up celebrating the traditional American Thanksgiving, but after marrying my father and understanding what has happened to the indigenous people, our family participates in the Day of Mourning.”\nDuring a recent co-op placement at the United Nations, she applied 21st century social media skills to raise awareness of social justice issues. Politically active, she focuses on environmental issues impacting indigenous people, such as the Dakota oil pipeline , which could endanger the water that supplies an estimated 15,000 who live on Standing Rock Sioux Reservation land in North Dakota. The pipeline also would cut through sacred land.\n“I am sure some of the speakers in Plymouth this year will address the Dakota pipeline. The Dakota pipeline is a huge issue for me,” Carroll-Cachimuel said. “Every year it is inspiring to be part of the rally and to show support for indigenous people around the world as we reflect on the history of our ancestors and address current and future issues.”\nThe National Day of Mourning gathering on Thanksgiving last year in Plymouth.\nLinda Greenstein can be reached at greensteinlm@gmail.com .",

      "title": "Report of person barricaded at BU turns out to be hoax",
      "text": " Google+ LinkedIn Comments Print The Boston Globe Tweet Share\nDavid L Ryan/Globe staff\nLaw enforcement officials were at the scene of what turned out to be a hoax at Boston University.\nBy Sarah Roberts, John R. Ellement and Laura Crimaldi Globe Correspondent and Globe Staff November 18, 2016\nPolice descended on the campus of Boston University Friday after a person called the school’s police, claiming that he had barricaded himself inside the Mugar Memorial Library and shot someone.\n“We thought it was the real deal,’’ Boston Police Commissioner William B. Evans said. “This one was so genuine.”\nAdvertisement\nAbout an hour later, after heavily-armed Boston, State and university police searched the library and the George Sherman Union, the call was declared to be a hoax, one that was markedly different from other false threats because it was made by a person who spent 10 minutes talking to a BU Police dispatcher, officials said.\n“I thought we had an active shooter situation,’’ acting BU Police Chief Scott Pare told reporters Friday. “It was not a robocall. It was an actual person on the other end of the line, answering questions. He said he had guns and explosives.’’\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

Sign up for more newsletters here He said the person spoke with an accent that police could not immediately identify. Pare also said that the caller’s number was blocked. The caller may have come from overseas, officials said. Evans said the person did not raise any political issues during the conversation.\nPolice are now trying to trace the call.\nThe caller provided accurate details about the interior of the Mugar during the conversation, leading police to fear that the situation was real. Evans said the person, in a second call, reported that he had shot someone.\nAdvertisement\n“We were on the line with the individual ... so we treated this very much like it was the real deal,” he said. “We’ve had unfortunate real incidents across the county involving students. That’s why we take it so serious.’’\nEvans noted that in recent years, local school systems and universities have received so-called robocalls where a recorded voice announces a threat against a building or a school system. All the robocalls have been determined to be hoaxes, officials have said.\n“It’s unnerving,’’ he said.\nThe drama began around 8:30 a.m. Boston police spokesman Lieutenant Detective Michael McCarthy said around 9:32 a.m. that police had concluded the call was a hoax.\nIn an official tweet, Boston police said the bomb squad was dispatched as part of the response. “BPD Bomb Unit on scene for report of a suspicious device in area of 771 Comm Ave.,’’ police wrote in the tweet. “Nothing found. Street being re-opened.’’\nIn a second tweet around 9:43 a.m., Boston police wrote, “Area in and around 771 Comm Ave has been re-opened.’’\nDuring the search, Commonwealth Avenue was closed to pedestrians and vehicles, and State Police were not allowing pedestrians to walk on to the campus from the Esplanade.\nEvans apologized to students and the public at large for any inconvenience during the intense investigation. But, he said, law enforcement acted out of an abundance of caution.\n“I always hate when we get these because you always worry about a copycat,” Evans said.\nAround 10:30 a.m., all of the police had withdrawn from the area, and all of the university's buildings had reopened.\nMore images from the scene:\nDavid L.

      "text": " Google+ LinkedIn Comments Print The Boston Globe Tweet Share\nEvan Vucci/AP\nDonald Trump.\nBy Sacha Pfeiffer Globe Staff November 18, 2016\nDuring his campaign and since winning the race, President-elect Donald Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet about his view of the charitable sector. And since he has refused to release his tax returns, his own charitable giving is a big unknown.\nThat has many nonprofit organizations feeling deeply unsettled.\nAdvertisement\n“People are apprehensive, people are wondering what’s going to happen on a whole bunch of fronts,” said Jim Klocke, CEO of the Massachusetts Nonprofit Network. “There’s an awful lot of concern out there.”\nIn some parts of the nonprofit community, including those that work with immigrants, “there’s a lot of despondency,” said David Shapiro, CEO of Boston-based MENTOR, a youth development organization. “But there’s also a lot of girding up, a sense that these times are what advocates were made for, and we’re going to stand with our people.”\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Here are some areas of concern that a Trump administration presents to the nonprofit sector:\nNonprofits could suffer under Trump’s tax plan\nThe current federal tax code includes incentives for people to donate to charity, but Trump’s proposed tax reforms are expected to reduce those incentives, resulting in a falloff in donations.\nTrump has said he will lower marginal tax rates, raise the standard deduction, and cap itemized deductions, all of which will likely mean less money going to charities.\nAdvertisement\nA recent report by the Tax Policy Institute estimates Trump’s plan would reduce individual giving by up to 9 percent in 2017, or as much as $26 billion.\nOn the flip side, Trump’s generous tax cuts could result in taxpayers having more money to give to charity, at least theoretically. But Klocke would rather not test that theory.\n“We need the federal incentive for charitable contributions to stay in place,” he said, “because that’s a very important, very powerful incentive for charitable giving.”\nCuts in federal discretionary spending could harm nonprofits\nTrump has said he will cut spending by $1.2 trillion over the next decade, in part by repealing the Affordable Care Act and slashing non-defense discretionary spending. The latter encompasses a wide range of programs , including education, scientific research, national parks, and public health.\nThat has many federally funded nonprofits wondering if their budgets could be on the chopping block.\nAt the same time, Trump has pledged to increase spending on defense, infrastructure, veterans programs, and child care.\n“If you increase spending on military and infrastructure, and a big wing of your party doesn’t want to spend money at all, what’s going to get cut?” said Shapiro. “That feels to me like social services and other things a big part of our sector considers integral to our communities.”\nJeff Thielman, CEO of the International Institute of New England, which helps immigrants and refugees, noted that 70 percent of his budget is government money.\n“Our first concern is whether or not the funding priorities of the new administration are going to shift to such a degree that our funding is cut,” he said. “My other fear is President Trump could do something dramatic and say, ‘I’m going to shut down the program,’ or not as many refugees can come, or not certain types of refugees.”\n“We’re not sure what’s going to happen,” Thielman added, “but we certainly have an administration coming into place in Washington, D.C., that has made derogatory comments about Muslims, immigrants, and refugees, and that’s who we serve.”\nIf Trump cuts government services, nonprofits could be further burdened\nIf government-funded programs are reduced under a Trump administration, charities worry they’ll be left to pick up the slack even as they struggle with existing workloads.\n“All of those people will then turn to nonprofits for assistance,” added Tim Delaney, CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits. “There’s an expectation that nonprofits and private philanthropy will fill the void, but the nonprofit community is exhausted…and one more straw on this camel’s back can break us.”\nNonprofits wonder if Trump’s bark will also have bite\nGiven the disparaging remarks Trump has made about immigrants, women, and other minority groups, nonprofits that work with those populations wonder how Trump’s words will play out once he’s in office.\n“We can only hope that the campaign rhetoric that stoked fires of bigotry, misogyny, and xenophobia...doesn’t manifest itself in policies and practices that govern this nation,” said Michael Weekes, chief executive of the Boston-based Providers’ Council, a statewide association of human services organizations. “If that language translates into policies, then we’ve got a problem.”\n“There’s tremendous anxiety for nonprofit missions,” added Delaney. “People are feeling vulnerable because of the highly charged negative campaign language and they’re searching for answers, and those answers will not be forthcoming for a while.”\nOn the other hand, Delaney said, “now’s the opportunity for the nonprofit community to do what we do so well, which is to bring people together.”\nSacha Pfeiffer can be reached at pfeiffer@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+ Kate Tuttle Globe Correspondent November 18, 2016\ndavid wilson for the boston globe\nLowell native Linda Hervieux was living in France, working as a freelance journalist, when she met William Dabney at a 2009 event commemorating the 65th anniversary of D-Day. An African-American World War II veteran, Dabney had been invited by the French government to receive the Legion of Honor for his service, which had included storming Omaha Beach.\nHer interest piqued, Hervieux wanted to write more about Dabney, whom she’d been told was the last surviving member of the all-black 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion. “It wasn’t true,” she found. Of the 800-some names Hervieux tracked down through military payroll records, there were 12 remaining who were alive and still able to talk about their experiences.\nAdvertisement\n“The baby of the battalion was Bill Dabney,” she said. “He was 89. These men were in their nineties.” She faced failing memories and the natural reticence of veterans to tell their most painful stories. But some were ready to talk. When she called Wilson Monk, Hervieux said, “the first thing he said to me was, ‘I’ve been waiting for someone to call me for 50 years.’ ”\nOf the dozen Hervieux was able to interview for the book, six remain. “Forgotten: The Untold Story of D-Day’s Black Heroes, at Home and at War” is Hervieux’s attempt to write them back into history. “It’s the story of our country, all the way back to the Revolution,” she said. “Throughout American history we see a whitewashing of the African-American experience.”\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond.

Sign up for more newsletters here Among the honored guests at the commemoration at which she met Dabney, Hervieux said, was filmmaker Steven Spielberg. “If you see ‘Saving Private Ryan,’ you see the balloons that these men flew, but you don’t see the men; you don’t see that they were African American.”\nHervieux will read 11 a.m. Monday at Middlesex Community College, 50 Kearney Square, Lowell, and 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Tewksbury Public Library, 300 Chandler St., Tewksbury.\nKate Tuttle, a writer and editor, can be reached at kate.tuttle @gmail.com .",

      "text": "Google and Facebook have announced new steps to restrict ads on pages with false information, in an effort to stop the spread of \"fake news.\" CNE... \n“We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive , which includes fake news,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. “While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.” \nHowever, Facebook’s policy clarification does not touch fake news content shared elsewhere on the site — i.e. fake news shared by individuals on their personal News Feeds. \nIn the immediate aftermath of the election, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg minimized the idea that fake news on his company’s platform had an impact on this campaign season. \n“To think it influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,” Zuckerberg said. \nIn a statement last week, Adam Mosseri, vice president of product management at Facebook, struck a different tone, and acknowledged that “there’s so much more” the company needs to do to fight the spread of misinformation on its platform. \nIn the final days of his presidency, President Obama has emerged as perhaps the most visible critic of the rise of misleading information on Facebook and other social media sites. \nIn a new profile of the president and his legacy published in The New Yorker, Mr. Obama said that today’s media landscape “means everything is true and nothing is true.” \n“An explanation of climate change from a Nobel Prize-winning physicist looks exactly the same on your Facebook page as the denial of climate change by somebody on the Koch brothers’ payroll,” he told The New Yorker’s David Remnick. “And the capacity to disseminate misinformation, wild conspiracy theories, to paint the opposition in wildly negative light without any rebuttal—that has accelerated in ways that much more sharply polarize the electorate and make it very difficult to have a common conversation.” © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Google suspends accounts used to resell Pixel phones for profit Google suspends accounts used to resell Pixel phones for profit By Ryan Whitwam   2:13 pm Comment \nGoogle’s new Pixel phones are the finest example of Android , but they’re also in terribly short supply. The wait on devices to ship has been multiple weeks since launch day, and that has led some device resellers to get creative. It turns out Google is taking a harder line on enforcing its terms of service than it did in the Nexus days. Dozens of users had their Google accounts suspended for engaging in device reselling this week. This has been jokingly called a digital death penalty. \nWhen you purchase anything from the Google Store or Project Fi, you have to agree to Google’s terms and conditions. Among all the lines of legalese, there’s a clear prohibition on purchasing devices with the intention of commercial resale. So, if you buy a Pixel, it needs to be for your own personal use. There’s nothing stopping you from then giving or selling that phone to someone else later. However, the scheme being run by a phone reseller in New Hampshire was a large enough violation that Google took notice. \nAccording to deal site DansDeals , the New Hampshire reseller was having users buy multiple Pixel phones and list the reseller’s location as their home address. Since the operation was based in New Hampshire, the reseller was then able to sell the phones at a slight markup without sales tax. The result was a small profit split between the original buyer and the seller. \nThe fatal flaw in this plan was that thousands of orders were placed for the same address. Google noticed and suspended all the accounts that sent phones to that location. It was within its rights to do so, too. According to the Google terms of sale, “You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device.” If your Google account is suspended, you lose access to everything—photos, email, documents, music, and so on. Those affected were understandably panicked. The notice sent to those affected. \nWhile it seems at first like a clear overreaction, you can also sort of see Google’s side. For one, this looks a lot like fraudulent activity. Thousands of phones going to one place? Suspicious. Even when Google figured out the scheme, this is the kind of behavior that you as a consumer should want Google to stop. If resellers can just buy thousands of phones and mark them up, that lowers the supply of devices for people to buy directly at fair prices. \nThis tale has a happy ending, though. Late yesterday, Google decided to re-enable the suspended accounts, with the understanding that no one should attempt this again. The whole incident does raise concerns about the state of your Google account data. Something that isn’t even your fault can trigger an account suspension, and then all that information is gone. It’s a good idea to use Google’s Takeout tool on occasion to download an archive of your account data. Tagged In",

      "text": "By Robbie Gramer Robbie Gramer is a staff writer at Foreign Policy. November 17, 2016 - 10:55 pm @robbiegramer \nInformation overload is a real problem these days. Internet trolling, fake news stories, information “echo chambers,” and the dark side of social media have headlined discussions on the future of politics and culture, particularly after the U.S. presidential elections. Perhaps no one is better suited to address this challenge than the man behind Google. \n“We, and I personally, believe very strongly that more information is better, even if it’s wrong,” said Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google’s parent company Alphabet, Inc. \n“Let’s start from the premise that more information, more empowerment, is fundamentally the correct answer” to the world’s most pressing challenges, Schmidt said Thursday after accepting Foreign Policy’s Diplomat of the Year award. \nGoogle is facing scrutiny in the aftermath of a presidential election season headlined by hacking, falsified news, trolling, and hateful rhetoric on the net. On Tuesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said fake news sites bankrolled by Google-served ads could have swung the election results in President-elect Donald Trump’s favor. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pushed back against similar accusations, saying it was “extremely unlikely” that his social media platform swayed the election, despite new findings indicating fake news performed better than real news on Facebook during the election. \nPichai said Google has already taken steps to confront the fake news phenomenon. “From our perspective, there should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here.” \nIn a discussion Thursday night with FP CEO and Editor David Rothkopf, Schmidt touted Google’s recent tests to combat trolling. “I’m absolutely convinced that these questions about validity, good information, bad information, will be sorted out,” he said. On trolling, Schmidt said “there’s a straightforward technological solution to an evil behavior. It’s easy to do, we did it, it can be replicated. And there’ll be more such solutions.” Google announced a new project to automatically fact-check news in ‘real time’ earlier Thursday. \nSchmidt also stressed the positive impact of information on the world. “It’s amazing how powerful the need for information is and how information-starved everyone is. So let’s start by celebrating…that we are busy empowering people in a way that is fundamentally different,” he said, citing the economic, educational, and security benefits a person in the developing world gains from just a cell phone. \nSchmidt joined awardees Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and Hafsat Abiola, founder of the Kudirat Initiative for Democracy (KIND) on stage at FP’s awards dinner. Tech talk wasn’t the event’s only agenda item. Climate change also dominated the evening’s discussion. \nHidalgo, receiving the Green Diplomat of the Year Award on behalf of C40 Cities , called climate change “the most important challenge humankind has ever had to face.” In December 2015, a landmark international climate change deal was brokered in Hidalgo’s city. Now that deal may be under threat as Trump, a vocal skeptic of climate change, steps into the Oval Office. \n“Climate change is not just a bad movie or a bad reality show,” Hidalgo said, a tacit poke at the real estate mogul and reality TV star who just won the U.S. presidency. \nAmid talks of cyber war, fake news, and climate change, Abiola gave a message of hope and optimism at FP’s dinner when she received the Citizen Diplomat of the Year award. \n“What we hope depends on who is in our corner,” Abiola said, speaking of the optimism she shares for the future of her native Nigeria and the United States, despite the reality of each country’s political challenges. “The distance between hope and reality is partnership, collaboration, solidarity,” she said.

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nIf by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship.\nMark Zuckerberg — one of the most insightful, adept leaders in the business world — has a problem. It’s a problem he has been slow to acknowledge, even though it’s become more apparent by the day.\nSeveral current and former Facebook employees tell NPR there is a lot of internal turmoil about how the platform does and doesn’t censor content that users find offensive. And outside Facebook, the public is regularly confounded by the company’s decisions — around controversial posts and around fake news.\n(Did Pope Francis really endorse Donald Trump? Does Hillary Clinton really have a body double?)\nBehind whatever the controversy of the moment happens to be, there’s a deep-seated problem. The problem is this: At age 19, the then-boy genius started a social network that was basically a tech-savvy way to check out classmates in school. Then, over the course of 12 years, he made some very strategic decisions that have morphed Facebook into the most powerful distributor on Earth — the new front page of the news for more than 1 billion people every day. But Zuckerberg didn’t sign up to head a media company — as in, one that has to make editorial judgments.\nHe and his team have made a very complex set of contradictory rules — a bias toward restricted speech for regular users, and toward free speech for “news” (real or fake). And the company relies on a sprawling army of subcontractors to enforce the rules. People involved in trying to make it work say they’re in way over their heads. As one employee put it, “We started out of a college dorm. I mean, c’mon, we’re Facebook. We never wanted to deal with this s***.”\nSubcontractors running the show\nNPR got the official version of how the company censors and leaves up content this summer when Facebook’s head of policy, Monika Bickert, agreed to a phone interview. We spoke with 10 current and former employees total, on the record and on background, for this investigation.\nIt’s hard to remember this sometimes, but Facebook has never claimed to be a free-speech platform. The company is trying to create a safe space where, unlike on Twitter, people can share without being trolled or shamed. Bickert is in charge of setting the content policies. The Community Standards, which are posted online, are the rules for everyday users.\nShe explained that when a user reports a piece of content that might be offensive, the company exercises its power to censor with precision.\n“Context is so important. It’s critical when we are looking to determine whether or not something is hate speech, or a credible threat of violence,” she said. “We look at how a specific person shared a specific post or word or photo to Facebook. So we’re looking to see why did this particular share happen on Facebook? Why did this particular post happen?”\nHowever, three of Bickert’s former colleagues tell a very different story of how Facebook deals with controversial content. They and others declined to be named for fear of job repercussions (at Facebook or at their current employers, also Internet companies), but their descriptions are consistent with each other.\nWhen a user flags a post on Facebook — whether it’s a picture, video or text post — it goes to a little-known division called the “community operations team.”\nIn 2010, the sources say, the team had a couple hundred workers in five countries. Facebook found it needed more hands on deck. After trying crowdsourcing solutions like CrowdFlower, the company turned to the consulting firm Accenture to put together a dedicated team of subcontractors. Sources say the team is now several thousand people, with some of the largest offices in Manila, the Philippines, and Warsaw, Poland.\nCurrent and former employees of Facebook say that they’ve observed these subcontractors in action; that they are told to go fast — very fast; that they’re evaluated on speed; and that on average, a worker makes a decision about a piece of flagged content once every 10 seconds.\nLet’s do a back-of-the-envelope calculation. Say a worker is doing an eight-hour shift, at the rate of one post per 10 seconds. That means they’re clearing 2,880 posts a day per person. When NPR ran these numbers by current and former employees, they said that sounds reasonable.\nA Facebook spokesperson says response times vary widely, depending on what is being reported; that the vast majority of flagged content is not removed; and that the numbers are off. Facebook did not provide alternative numbers.\nIf the sources — who have firsthand knowledge and spoke separately with NPR — are correct, then this may be the biggest editing — aka censorship — operation in the history of media. All the while, Facebook leaders insist they’re just running a “platform,” free of human judgment. A person who worked on this area of “content management” for Facebook (as an employee, not a subcontractor) says most of the content you see falls neatly into categories that don’t need deep reflection: “That’s an erect penis. Check.” So it’s not like the workers are analyzing every single one in detail.\nThe problem is, simple and complex items all go into the same big pile. So, the source says, “you go on autopilot” and don’t realize when “you have to use judgment, in a system that doesn’t give you the time to make a real judgment.”\nA classic case is something like “Becky looks pregnant.” It could be cyberbullying or a compliment. The subcontractor “pretty much tosses a coin,” the source says.\nHere’s another huge barrier. Because of privacy laws and technical glitches (such as a post that is truncated to only show part of the conversation), the subcontractors typically don’t get to see the full context — to which Bickert referred so often.\nFrequent errors\nThat could be the cause of frequent errors.\nNPR decided to stress-test the system by flagging nearly 200 posts that could be considered hate speech — specifically, attacks against blacks and against whites in the U.S. We found that Facebook subcontractors were not consistent and made numerous mistakes, including in instances where a user calls for violence.\nWe say they were mistakes because the company changed its position in dozens of instances, removing some and restoring others — either when we flagged it a second time through the automated system or brought it to the attention of Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.\nConsider this post:\nA comment on this post (indicated by the light gray text) was flagged by NPR. Facebook’s subcontractors did not remove the comment, but after being pressed further, a spokesperson said they made a mistake and it should have been removed.\nFacebook/Screenshot by NPR\nOne user shares a video of a police officer kicking someone on the ground, and another says they “need to start organizing and sniping these bitches.” This is a call to shoot cops.\nAnd it’s occurring in a very specific context: days after Philando Castile was shot and killed by an officer (the shooting’s aftermath was live-streamed on Facebook); and in a city in Minnesota that’s just a few miles away from where Castile lay bleeding.\nThe subcontractors did not remove the post. When NPR emailed Facebook headquarters about it, a spokesperson said they made a mistake and the post should have been removed.\nOne source tells NPR that the subcontractor “likely” could not see the full post if just the comment was flagged, could not see the profile of the user or even view the video to which the user was responding — again for privacy or technical reasons.\nDifferent projects within Facebook have to compete fiercely for engineering talent, and have to make the case that their to-do list is worth expensive company resources. Two sources say that over the years, it’s been hard to make that case for fixing the editing system.\nOf posts that NPR flagged, this one, with the hashtag #blacklivesdontmatter, was left up erroneously, according to Facebook officials.\nFacebook/Screenshot by NPR\nNPR shared many posts with the company to get specific feedback on why something stayed up or was taken down. This post, with the hashtag #blacklivesdontmatter, was left up. The spokesperson says it should have been removed, but the reviewer’s perspective is not the same as a regular Facebook user; and because the company is protecting privacy, reviewers don’t have access to everything, which can affect their judgments. Also, the spokesperson says, reviewers don’t have the time a person at Facebook headquarters or at NPR may have to make a decision.\nAnother spokesperson notes that just because the reviewer has a limited view does not mean Bickert’s description is incorrect — that the two versions of the process are not mutually exclusive.\nA restrictive platform\nNPR also finds, interestingly, that Facebook can be strict.\nThink of it this way. Every media outlet has its own culture and voice. If The New York Times is urban liberal, Fox News is conservative, and Playboy is racy, you could say Facebook aspires to be nice — a global brand that’s as easy to swallow as Coca-Cola. (In this provocative talk at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center, law professor and author Jeffrey Rosen says Facebook favors “civility” over “liberty.”)\nThe bias is evident in these real-life examples:\nOne example of a Facebook post that was flagged where racial slurs were used.\nFacebook/Screenshot by NPR\nA second example of a Facebook post that was flagged where racial slurs were used.\nFacebook/Screenshot by NPR\nNPR asked two newsroom veterans to put themselves in the position of a Facebook content arbiter. We don’t have access to Facebook’s internal guidance on hate speech, so they had to rely on their own judgment and familiarity with Facebook as users.\nLynette Clemetson, formerly with NPR and now at the University of Michigan, says of Post 1, “now that’s just dumb.” Post 2, she says, sounds like a “rant.” Chip Mahaney, a former managing editor at a Fox television station, agrees. Both experts venture to guess that the posts are acceptable speech on the platform.\nTo their surprise, they’re not.\nWhen NPR flagged the posts, Facebook censors decided to take them down. The spokesperson explains to NPR: It’s OK to use racial slurs when being self-referential. A black person can say things like “my niggers.” But no one can use a slur to attack an individual or group. That’s prohibited. A white person cannot use the word “nigger” to mock or attack blacks. Blacks can’t use “crakkker” (in whatever spelling) to offend whites.\nWiggle room in pictures\nBut there are so many caveats and exceptions — particularly when it comes to interpreting images and videos.\nConsider this post:\nThis image showing a noose, which was flagged by NPR, was not removed. A Facebook spokesperson explains that if the image included a person, a specific victim of a hate crime, then it would be removed.\nFacebook/Screenshot by NPR\nThis is a noose, the kind used to hang slaves. Beside it is a sign. While the letters are faded, you can make out the words: “Nigger swing set.” It was shared by a user named “White Lives Matter 2.”\nThe news veterans would take it down. Clemetson says it’s not quite a call to violent action, but it’s certainly a reference to past action. “It’s a reference to lynching — and making a joke of lynching.” Mahaney says this is “obviously a pretty difficult picture to look at” and his instinct is, unless there’s a deeper context, “I would say it has no place on here.”\nFacebook left it up, and stands by that decision.\nThe spokesperson explains this historical reference doesn’t have a human victim clearly depicted. If the image included a person, a specific subject of a hate crime, then it would be removed.\nThe spokesperson also made a claim that has not panned out: that in some situations, like this one, Facebook requires the user who created the page to add their real name to the “about” section. By removing anonymity, the hope is, people will be more thoughtful about what they post.\nThe spokesperson says “White Lives Matter 2″ was told to identify him or herself promptly. Yet more than a month after NPR flagged the post, it hadn’t happened — yet another way Facebook’s enforcement mechanism is broken.\nWith news, a double standard emerges\nIf the user rules weren’t nuanced enough, add to that a new plot line: CEO Zuckerberg decided to forge partnerships with news media to make his social network the most powerful distributor of news on Earth. (Facebook pays NPR and other news organizations to produce live videos for its site.)\nWhat Facebook has found in the process is that it’s much harder to censor high-profile newsmakers than it is to censor regular users. As one source says, “Whoever screams the loudest gets our attention. We react.”\nAnd that’s making newsworthy content a whole other category.\nConsider the scandals around “Napalm Girl” and Donald Trump. In the first, Facebook was slammed for not allowing users to share a Pulitzer Prize-winning photo because it showed child nudity. In the second, Facebook came under criticism for allowing Donald Trump to call for a ban on Muslims coming to the U.S. — what is clearly hate speech under their regular rules, according to two former employees and a current one. One source said, “he hadn’t even won the Republican primary yet. What we decided mattered.”\nIn both cases, the company caved to public pressure and decided to bend the rules. The source says both decisions were “highly controversial” among employees; and they signal that Facebook leadership is feeling pressure to move toward a free-speech standard for news distribution.\nHow to define news is a huge source of controversy — not just with the elections, but with every charged moment. After Trump won, some critics blamed fake news on Facebook for the election’s outcome. After Philando Castile was shot by police, his video disappeared from Facebook. The company says it was “a glitch” and restored it. And the concern over its removal is part of an ongoing debate about what police-civilian standoffs should be live-streamed.\nWhat now?\nSome in Silicon Valley dismiss the criticisms against Facebook as schadenfreude: Just like taxi drivers don’t like Uber, legacy media envies the success of the social platform and enjoys seeing its leadership on the hot seat.\nA former employee is not so dismissive and says there is a cultural problem, a stubborn blindness at Facebook and other leading Internet companies like Twitter. The source says: “The hardest problems these companies face aren’t technological. They are ethical, and there’s not as much rigor in how it’s done.”\nAt a values level, some experts point out, Facebook has to decide if its solution is free speech (the more people post, the more the truth rises), or clear restrictions.\nAnd technically, there’s no shortage of ideas about how to fix the process.\nA former employee says speech is so complex, you can’t expect Facebook to arrive at the same decision each and every time; but you can expect a company that consistently ranks among the 10 most valuable on Earth, by market cap, to put more thought and resources into its censorship machine.\nThe source argues Facebook could afford to make content management regional — have decisions come from the same country in which a post occurs.\nSpeech norms are highly regional. When Facebook first opened its offices in Hyderabad, India, a former employee says, the guidance the reviewers got was to remove sexual content. In a test run, they ended up removing French kissing. Senior management was blown away. The Indian reviewers were doing something Facebook did not expect but which makes perfect sense for local norms.\nHarvard business professor Ben Edelman says Facebook could invest engineering resources into categorizing the posts. “It makes no sense at all,” he says, that when a piece of content is flagged, it goes into one long line. The company could have the algorithm track what flagged content is getting the most circulation and move that up in the queue, he suggests.\nZuckerberg finds himself at the helm of a company that started as a tech company — run by algorithms, free of human judgment, the mythology went. And now he’s just so clearly the CEO of a media company — replete with highly complex rules (What is hate speech anyway?); with double standards (If it’s “news” it stays, if it’s a rant it goes); and with an enforcement mechanism that is set up to fail.\n**If I get banned or this post gets banned from Facebook then every single one of you will know why and also know without a doubt that Facebook is run by government slaves hell-bent on collecting our private data.\nThat said, if by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship crap.\nHere are some of the differences you’ll find at Seen.Life :\nNo Censorship!

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nIf by now you haven’t figured out that Facebook and Google are in cahoots with the corrupt government, then I feel for you, but for those who are well aware of the issues it’s high time you switched over to Seen.life . It is a website that is similar to Facebook but without all the censorship crap.\nDoes anyone else remember how we had to listen Barack Obama whine and cry daily for the first four years of his presidency about how he “inherited” a horrible economy from President Bush? It’s hard to forget I know, because Obama never shut up about it, but yet that is exactly what is Barack Obama is deliberately doing to President-Elect Trump! By allowing the rioting and the lawlessness to continue unabated, come Inauguration Day, Trump will inherit a nation on fire from the moment he assumes office.\nIn the first video below, I review in detail why it’s way too early to be popping Champagne bottles and celebrating last week’s historic victory. There are far too many political land minds between now and Inauguration Day that could set off a chain reaction in this country of incomprehensible proportions, and the Community Agitator-In-Chief is playing his hand perfectly so far. Reviewing the evidence, all of which is public information, I make the case that right now Obama has the upper hand while Trump is busy with his transition team. It’s as plain as day, for anyone willing to look!\nI also cover the nonsense we keep hearing from the “protestors” that the “will of the people” was expressed in the popular vote, which Hillary didn’t even win when you take out 3 million illegal aliens caught voting, and 4 million dead people who voted. Anyone who is buying into that level of utter foolishness, is hopelessly misinformed, and isn’t worth wasting your time with.\nThe “will of the American people” has been made abundantly clear by the fact that Democrats have lost 60 House seats since 2010, lost 242 state legislative seats, 30 state legislative chambers have completely switched from Democrat to Republican, and 2/3 of the states now have Republican Governors. Republicans haven’t had margins like this since 1929, so the “protestors” need to shut up about “the will of the people.” They people have INDEED spoken!\nIn the second video, Police Sgt. Demetrick Pennie and attorney Larry Klayman, who are both suing President Obama and Black Lives Matter, appeared on Fox News to weigh in on the dangers of the anti-Trump riots, and Obama’s response to them, or lack there of. When asked if the violence is going to continue, attorney Larry Klayman echoes what I’ve been saying for months. As President, it’s Obama’s job to come out, and to enforce the rule of law. That was the oath he took as President of the United States.\nBecause what are taking place around the country are not “protests,” or “demonstrations,” but acts of domestic terror, or riots, and Obama has a sworn duty to put an end to them, by whatever lawful means necessary. As Larry Klayman explains, Obama will never do that. Why not? Because what is happening is precisely what Obama wants to happen.\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE TOP STORIES OF THE WEEK IN THE NEWSLETTER HERE\nWWW.THELASTGREATSTAND.COM\nFOR MORE NEWS BY VOICE OF REASON CLICK HERE!\nMichael Snyder Writes:\nDonald Trump is not the president yet, and Barack Obama could still do an extraordinary amount of damage during his last two months in the White House. Prior to the election, I described the period of time ending on January 20th as “the danger zone”, and my outlook has not changed just because Donald Trump was victorious on election night. As you will see, the next two months are an absolutely critical time, and if we can get through January 20th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier (at least for a while). On the other hand, the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos. A lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of Trump’s victory, but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard.\nAnd the truth is that Donald Trump has not even won the presidency yet. As I detailed shortly before election night , the next president will not be determined until December 19th when the Electoral College meets.\nOn Monday, December 19th the members of the Electoral College will gather in all 50 state capitals to cast their votes for president. It is then, and only then, that the next president of the United States will be elected.\nThroughout our history, electors have followed the will of the people more than 99 perfect of the time, but there have been “faithless electors” before, and if Democrats can get enough of them to switch sides in December it is still possible (though not probable) that Hillary Clinton could win the election.\nBE SURE TO CHECK THELASTGREATSTAND.COM FOR SURVIVAL GEAR!\nFREE DETAILED GUIDE TO SURVIVING ECONOMIC COLLAPSE OR MARTIAL LAW HERE\nIn the video below, Police Sgt. Demetrick Pennie explains what the majority of the mainstream media refuses to; he explains that a huge percentage of those “protesting” are being paid to agitate, by none other than George Soros, the same man who said before the election that Western society must fall, before One World Government can emerge. Pennie confirms what many of us already know, which is that far too many of the people out “protesting,” don’t even know why they’e out there. Because of the sheer number of “protestors,” and their propensity for violence, he also explains how tactically police are too outnumbered to engage the “protestors” safely, putting the general public at risk.\nLast week, most of the country waged a peaceful revolution in the ballot box, but it’s time the American people Wake Up to the reality that the far-left has no plans to be anything even remotely peaceful. Racial riots are already breaking out in cities all over the country, and as you’ll learn in the video below, despite knowing the First Amendment right to “ peaceably assemble “ does NOT cover rioting, setting fires, property damage, or hurting people, Obama has gone as far as to compliment the “protestors” anyway, and encouraged their right to “protest.”\nEven more scary, is that on Inauguration Day, groups like Black Lives matter plan to lead one of the biggest political protests in United States history on the capital. They have already put up Facebook pages , websites , and the hashtag “#DisruptJ20″ is being widely used all over social media. Social media, with the full cooperation of Barack Obama, are allowing their platforms to be used for the organization and recruitment of acts of domestic terror, and to do so with impunity.\nJust so there is no question that we’re dealing with domestic terror, as a reminder, Black’s Law Dictionary gives the “legal” definition of terrorism as:\n“The use of force or threats of violence to intimidate or cause panic, esp. as a means of affecting political conduct.”\nWe’re dealing with domestic terrorists being allowed to run free. End of story.\nINSTAGRAM | FACEBOOK | GOOGLE+ | TWITTER | PINTEREST | STUMBLE UPON | TUMBLR\nWWW.THELASTGREATSTAND.COM\nCHECK OUT THE NEW GOOGLE+ PAGE!\nOne petition that is asking electors to switch their votes has already been signed by more than 4 million people. The petition claims that Donald Trump is “unfit to serve” as president, and that since Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin she should be elected president instead. The following comes from a USA Today article entitled “ Could the Electoral College elect Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump? “…\nA Change.org petition, now signed by more than 4.3 million people, encourages members of the Electoral College to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton when the college meets on Dec. 19. The petition argues that Donald Trump is “unfit to serve” and that “Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.”\n“If they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win,” the petition states. “However, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine – which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay! We are calling on the Electors to ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.”\nPersonally, I don’t believe that this is going to happen. They may be able to flip a few electors, but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the Democrats to overcome.\nHowever, that is not the only concern we are facing. Ever since his victory on November 8th, there have been a multitude of violent threats against Donald Trump and his family. And without a doubt, there are a lot of very powerful people that would be very interested in finding a way to keep Donald Trump from getting to Inauguration Day. So let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family.\nIf Donald Trump were to be incapacitated after he wins the Electoral College vote on December 19th, Mike Pence would take his place.\nBut if something were to happen to him before December 19th, his electors would be free to vote for another candidate – including Hillary Clinton.\nIf everything goes smoothly and Donald Trump successfully makes it to Inauguration Day, he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in United States history.\nIn an article for The Most Important News , I showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon Washington D.C. on January 20th in order to disrupt the Inauguration festivities as much as possible.\nThis giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects, and they have already put up Facebook pages , websites , and the hashtag “#DisruptJ20″ is being widely used all over social media.\nTraditionally Inauguration Day is a day of joy and celebration, but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot.\nLet us hope that they are not successful.\nBE SURE TO CHECK THELASTGREATSTAND.COM FOR SURVIVAL GEAR!\nFREE DETAILED GUIDE TO SURVIVING ECONOMIC COLLAPSE OR MARTIAL LAW HERE\nAnother reason why we will be in “the danger zone” over the next two months is because of what Barack Obama may choose to do at the United Nations.\nNow that it looks like Donald Trump is going to be our next president, the international pressure on Barack Obama to do something at the United Nations regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense.\nAnd this is something that Trump and his advisers are actively concerned about. In fact, I came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the Trump team is warning Obama “against making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office” …\nSaying that pushing agendas “contrary to the president-elect’s position” would not be in the “spirit of the transition”, Trump national security advisor for Donald Trump last week warned the Obama administration against making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office.\n“On big, transformative issues where President Obama and President-elect Trump are not in alignment, I don’t think it’s in keeping with the spirit of the transition…to try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the president-elect’s positions,” the advisor told Politico .\nSpecifically, the concern is that Obama may decide to support a UN Security Council resolution that would officially recognize a Palestinian state, set the parameters for a “two state solution”, and establish East Jerusalem as the capital for the new Palestinian state.\nJust a few weeks ago, an article in the Wall Street Journal entitled “ Obama’s Israel Surprise? ” reported that this is one of the options that the Obama administration is strongly considering right now. A UN Security Council resolution would be legally binding on both Israel and the Palestinians, and it would be something that President Trump would not be able to undo.\nThe rest of the UN Security Council is eager to support such a resolution, and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of Barack Obama, and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do. The following comes from an article by Leo Hohmann …\nThe Wall Street Journal reported one week before Tuesday’s election that Obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nIsraeli diplomats, according to the WSJ story, are preparing for the possibility that a lame-duck President Obama “may try to force a diplomatic resolution for Israel and the Palestinians at the United Nations.”\nThe president is presumably now reviewing those options, which number about half a dozen.\nHe may be preparing to recognize a Palestinian state at the U.N. before he leaves office , WSJ reported.\nIf Barack Obama decides to divide the land of Israel at the United Nations, it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency. I have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in America if it happens, and it will also mean that many of the events that I warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating.\nBut if we can get to January 20th and the land of Israel has not been divided yet, we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while, because Trump has already said that he would not support a UN Security Council resolution that forces a solution on the Israelis and Palestinians.\nWhen politicians are going to do something that they know people won’t like, they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people aren’t paying attention. For example, yesterday I discussed how the legislation that created the Federal Reserve was rushed through Congress right before Christmas in 1913 .\nSo keep an eye on the period around Thanksgiving and the period around Christmas. If Barack Obama is going to stab Israel in the back, it may happen during one of those times.\nMy hope is that we can get through January 20th without anything going seriously wrong. If that happens, I know that I will be very thankful.\nAnd as I detailed in a previous article , Donald Trump will be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day in office on January 21st, and that will happen in year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar.\nCould that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe?\nOr will the next two months set off a chain of events that will be absolutely disastrous for this nation?\nI believe that this is an absolutely critical moment in our history, and let us hope that our leaders make the right decisions.\nBE SURE TO CHECK THELASTGREATSTAND.COM FOR SURVIVAL GEAR!\nFREE DETAILED GUIDE TO SURVIVING ECONOMIC COLLAPSE OR MARTIAL LAW HERE\nFOR MORE ON THE CHAOS COMING FROM THE 2016 ELECTION:\nTrump Supporters Have a Plan To Unite and Bring CNN to its Knees (Video)\nSorry Protestors: Looks Like Hillary Got Pummeled in the Popular Vote Too (Video)\nWhat is Obama Doing to Stop Planned BLM Chaos, Rioting, and Violence?

      "text": "\nIf you own a 4K television with Android TV installed, you might be able to watch a small selection of UHD films from Google Play Movies. The company first announced that 4K films would be added to its Movies & TV app during the Pixel press event in October, and it looks like that is indeed happening, although unofficially and very quietly.\nSee also: How to fix common Google Play Store error codes July 27, 2016 \nPosts on Reddit show that some users have spotted UHD options in Google Play Movies for movies like The Fifth Element, This is the End, Star Trek, Star Trek Beyond, and Zoolander. Some of these movies show the UHD option but the movies themselves are not yet available to download. The 4K movies are only appearing inside the Google Play Movies app, rather than directly from the Google Play Store. Also, as you might see from the screenshot above, the UHD version is priced up to twice as much as the HD option.\nApparently, Google support is telling uses that the UHD film options are a “mistake” but it’s likely that the company is simply just rolling this support out and testing it before making an official announcement. If you own a Chromecast Ultra , you can also check out these new UHD films if you hook it up to a 4K TV or monitor.\nGet it at Google Play ",
