      "text": "Apple to replace iPhone 6s batteries in case of unexpected shut downs Apple to replace iPhone 6s batteries in case of unexpected shut downs Apple is now replacing batteries for iPhone 6s users whose phones may unexpectedly shut down. Updated: November 21, 2016 2:28 pm Apple iPhone 6s battery issue: Company to replace battery for free on phones for users. \nApple is now replacing batteries for iPhone 6s users whose phones may unexpectedly shut down. The issue occurs when the device might still reflect enough charge like 40 or 50 per cent, but it shuts down without warning. It only comes back to life when put on charging again. The iPhone 6s battery replacement program comes soon after Apple announced one for iPhone 6 Plus users. In iPhone 6 Plus, the issue was with the touch display, which would stop responding. \nWith the iPhone 6s, Apple was quick to point out this is not a safety issue and only affecting a small number of devices. According to the company, “a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 201,” are impacted by this faulty battery. \nApple is advising customers who might have experienced this issue to visit an Apple Retail Store or authorised service centres with their device’s serial number to confirm eligibility. Unlike the iPhone 6 Plus ‘Touch disease’ issue where Apple is charging $149, the battery replacement process is totally free of cost. \nApple will examine if the device is eligible for the program and in working order before replacing the battery. With this exercise, Apple also recommends users back up their data to iTunes or iCloud, turn off Find my iPhone and delete all data on the device before handing it over for repair. In order to do so, go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase all Content and Settings and make sure you are connected to the internet before you hit erase all. \nAlso read: Apple’s repair program for iPhone 6 Plus addresses ‘touch disease’ issue \nApple says if your device has any other damage like a cracked display, they will charge extra to fix this. The company says broken displays affect replacement of the battery and the issue will need to be resolved. If anyone paid to have an iPhone 6s battery replaced for a similar issue, then they can contact Apple for a refund. \nApple says this program covers affected iPhone 6s batteries for 3 years after the first retail sale of the unit. The advantage is that if the issue shows up on your device a little later, you could still be able to get the battery replaced. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: ",

      "text": "Monday, Nov 21st, 2016 @ 1:22 am McLaren was quick to shoot down the rumors that claimed it was talking to Apple about a potential partnership . However, the company has backtracked and admitted it briefly explored a tie-up with the California-based tech giant.\"There wasn't a bid from Apple. They visited. We talked. We talked about what they did. We talked about what we did. They toured. It never matured to a definitive proposition,\" revealed Mike Flewitt, the company's Chief Executive, in an interview with Reuters .Flewitt added Apple isn't the company that has contacted McLaren about a partnership or a takeover, though he declined to name others. In fact, Ron Dennis recently resigned after leading the group for 35 years because he wanted to sell the McLaren Technology Group to a Chinese firm for £1.65 billion, a sum that converts to approximately $2.1 billion.Dennis still owns 25 percent of the company. Mansour Ojjeh -- Dennis' former friend and business partner -- owns another 25 percent, while the rest of the group is owned by an investment fund based in Bahrain. Flewitt made it clear that McLaren's shareholders want to retain ownership of the company and develop it on their own, meaning the group will likely remain independent in the foreseeable future. \n ",

      "text": "Reddit \nThe new Touch Bar-equipped MacBook Pro models may be in short supply, but demand for Apple’s new entry-level model without Touch Bar seems slower. Amazon is already discounting the machine, a $100 discount to bring the price down to $1399 . \nApp Advice spotted the discount, which is available for both Silver and Space Gray finishes. It’s of course for the base model, which has a 2GHz dual-core i5, Intel Iris 540 GPU, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and two USB-C/Thunderbolt ports. \nYou might not get the headline new feature, but you still get the same sleek form factor and improved display as the more expensive Touch Bar model. \nCheck out our review , and also Jeff’s opinion piece on why this machine is a better buy than the 12-inch MacBook.

      "text": "| Follow About | \nA daily digest of IT news, curated from blogs, forums and news sites around the web each morning. We highlight the key commentary and demystify the real story. Apple will replace the battery of your iPhone 6s that keeps shutting down Computerworld | Nov 21, 2016 3:45 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this Mingis on Tech: The iPhone 7, Apple Watch 2 -- and the gadget guy! \nFirst Samsung, now Apple. Battery problems in smartphones are all the rage these days. \nOf course, Apple's battery problems are very different than the ones Samsung users experienced, notably in that nothing has yet exploded. But what is happening to iPhones? And which models are affected? \nIn IT Blogwatch, we operate at full charge. \nSo what exactly is happening? John Ribeiro has the background : Apple...said...a few iPhone 6s smartphones are unexpectedly shutting down...Apple...appeared to suggest that the problem would be resolved by a replacement battery which the company offered free. ... The China Consumers Association asked Apple to investigate...iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s phones that were automatically shutting off. The...shutdowns were said to happen when the phone’s battery charge dropped to between 60 and 50 percent. \nBattery problems with another smartphone? We remember what happened with the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recently. Mikey Campbell assures us this isn't the same : It seems Apple has run into its own smartphone battery troubles...The company was quick to note devices experiencing shutdown...issues do not present a safety risk, wording likely included to allay fears that iPhone is suffering from battery problems similar to catastrophic failures recently seen impacting Samsung products...the iPhone 6s defect only affects a batch of devices manufactured between September and October 2015. \nSo what should you do if your phone is one of those affected? Chance Miller has the details : If...your iPhone 6s is affected...Apple instructs you to visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider to confirm your eligibility. From there, your battery will be replaced free of charge. ... Apple notes that devices with other damage, such as a cracked screen, will not be eligible for the repair program until the other damage is repaired...anyone who paid to have their battery replaced because of this issue can contact customer support about obtaining a refund. \nAnd is there anything users need to do to prepare their phones before going in for a replacement battery? Apple explains the process : To prepare your iPhone 6s for the battery replacement process...follow the steps below...Back up your data to iTunes or iCloud...Turn off Find my iPhone...Erase data and settings in Settings > General > Reset > Erase all Content and Settings...The program covers affected iPhone 6s batteries for 3 years after the first retail sale of the unit. \nIs this the only issue plaguing iPhones right now? As luck would have it, no. Eric Slivka tells us about another : Just...days ago, Apple launched a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus owners whose devices are experiencing...\"touch disease\" where users...see display flickering or a loss of touch sensitivity. That program carries a $149 repair fee...Apple says the issue is caused at least in part by the device having been \"dropped multiple times on a hard surface.\" \nHow do people feel about this problem? Not surprisingly, they aren't thrilled. Chrissy Hall tells us what she thinks : Thank you #iPhone6s battery...I love when you completely die at 56%.  ",

      "text": "Apple offers new battery for iPhone 6s phones that suddenly shut down Apple said the problem has been discovered in a few iPhone 6s smartphones Bangalore Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 21, 2016 3:31 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nApple's iPhone 6s Computerworld Holiday Gift Guide 2016: Wonderful Wearables \nApple has said that a few iPhone 6s smartphones are unexpectedly shutting down, confirming a problem reported last week by a Chinese consumer protection group. \nThe company said the problem is restricted to a small number of phones within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October last year. \nApple said it was not a safety issue, and appeared to suggest that the problem would be resolved by a replacement battery, which the company offered free. It did not say how many iPhone 6s phones were affected and in which markets. \nThe China Consumers Association asked Apple to investigate problems with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s phones that were automatically shutting off. The unexpected shutdowns were said to happen when the phone’s battery charge dropped to between 60 and 50 percent. \nThe battery replacement comes less than a week after Apple offered to repair for a reduced price of $149 iPhone 6 Plus devices that had display flickering or multitouch issues. \nThat problem was called “touch disease” in August by repair guide website iFixit, as it was characterized by a gray, flickering bar at the top of the display and an unresponsive touchscreen . Those who had already fixed their phones for the issue were offered a refund on the difference in the cost. \nApple's wireless carrier partners are not participating in the battery replacement program for the iPhone 6s, so eligible users have to contact Apple retail stores, authorized service providers or technical support. Users have been advised to back up their data to iTunes or iCloud, turn off their 'Find My iPhone' facility, and erase all content and settings in preparation for the battery change. \n“If your iPhone 6s has any damage such as a cracked screen which impairs the replacement of the battery, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair,” Apple said while announcing the program . \nUsers who believe their iPhone 6s phones was affected by the issue, and have already paid to replace the battery, can contact Apple about a refund, the company said.

      "text": "This article originally appeared on The Fast Mode. \nThe British mobile operator EE and Apple entered a partnership to bundle Apple Music with EE services in August. While OTT bundling is commonplace for carriers, this partnership is notable because EE has a differentiated offering for its prepaid & postpaid subscribers. Postpaid subscribers get Apple Music but the prepaid subscribers can listen to music through MTV Trax instead. Such a segmented approach to bundling includes significant advantages for mobile operators, both in reducing churn and increasing revenue. \nHow so? Today, mobile accounts for 42% of e-commerce traffic but only 21% of revenue. This means a lot of people are window shopping on their mobile devices but then making purchases somewhere else, i.e. desktop. Since a majority of new people are coming online in emerging markets where smartphone growth is the biggest, the amount of low income “window shoppers” with only access to smartphones but no way to make payments online will grow. \nFor carriers in emerging markets the subscriber base growth will also primarily come from window shoppers, i.e. users choosing prepaid SIM cards over postpaid accounts. The purchasing behavior for these users is likely to be similar to the e-commerce window shoppers. They will try out telco bundled services but once the free trial runs out, lower income prevents them from becoming paying users and they are again more likely to churn over to a competitor. \nThis is where segmented bundling comes in: offering different digital services of the same category to users based on their profile. While almost everyone might want an Apple Music subscription, not everyone will be able to afford it. Adding a regional, cheaper streaming provider for prepaid subscribers allows increasing the amount of people who take up a bundle offer and continue paying for it after the free trial runs out. \nSegmented bundling is not just something to think about in terms of existing and commonplace services, such as video and music streaming. The online audience is very fragmented and many different tastes need to be catered to. There are no “soccer moms” or “teenager” segments any longer; there are “house moms who listen to death metal and blog about vegetarianism” and “teenagers who write code for Raspberry PI at home” segments. \nWhile people in these new, niche segments are the same regardless of whether they have a prepaid or postpaid account, their spending capabilities are different. Thus different merchants can be chosen to partner with whose business logic matches that of the subscribers’ spending capability. \nThinking about the custom audiences and what people care about opens up many new bundling opportunities. For example, for postpaid office workers a bundle can be created offering free access to Office365, Evernote or Slack. For hardcore tech geeks there can be a bundle with free VPN, a launcher or anti-virus app. For students, free access can be given to an e-learning platform. For news addicts, premium access to a newspaper can be offered. For individuals selling physical goods online, free credits on a classified portal are an attractive proposition. The amount of online service providers is vast, yet carriers have so far focused on very specific segments for partnerships. Those who expand their bundle offering will be able to create more stickiness with the growing prepaid subscriber audience. \nWhen thinking about such new partnerships, the key is to take into account the user spending behavior and spending ability. Prepaid users are easier to acquire but they also churn more readily and are difficult to upsell to. Such users need to be engaged more often to spend, for example by sending promotional messages after they have topped up their account and have the money to spend on third party services. Reminders before their subscription to a service runs out or when a charge has failed help ensure they do not churn from the OTT service and eventually from the network. \nFor postpaid users with higher ARPU and money on their account, existing profiles on who they are can be used to create customized offerings. For example, if it is known that a subscriber spends most of their data on browsing news sites, they would be a perfect target to upsell a newspaper subscription to. Demographic information can be used here as well: on a user’s birthday, why not offer them a free trial to Evernote? \nThe key question for both existing bundles as well as new services is how carriers are actually going to make money off of it. While Apple Music is big, Spotify is even bigger , in part thanks to their numerous bundling partnerships with mobile operators. Carriers offer powerful user acquisition channels to such service providers in hopes that giving the service to their users for free will make them stay with the network. \nBut the growing prepaid subscriber base means many users (those without credit cards who can’t be monetized through regular “pay on the bill” channels) will be unable to continue paying for the service once their trial runs out. This means carriers simply end up paying the OTT services to keep churn lower. Instead, enabling carrier billing for the services would give prepaid audiences a seamless way to transition from a free user to a paying user - thus not just reducing churn, but also creating an opportunity for the carrier to make money as well. \nCarriers stand to gain significantly by thinking through their bundling strategy. First, by looking beyond existing segments to cater for “niche” audiences with “niche” services. And second, by adding a payments relationship with the merchant on top of the marketing relationship. This creates a stronger link with both the service providers as well as the users who will then rely on their carrier to access premium content online. Categories",

      "text": "Home / News / Mobile Phone News / Dodgy iPhone 6S battery? Apple will now give you a replacement Dodgy iPhone 6S battery? Apple will now give you a replacement \nby Joe Roberts Read Comments \nLast week Apple finally admitted the 'touch disease' problem with certain iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models, and now it has acknowledged a battery issue with the 6S. \nThe company is offering to replace batteries in phones manufactured between September and October 2015, as some have been shown to shut down at random. \nA page on the Apple website details the new scheme, saying: \"Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. \nRelated: Black Friday deals \n\"This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015.\" \nIf you have a phone made during that brief period, you can take it down to an Apple store or Apple service provider to have the serial number checked. \nOnce the number has been checked and shows the phone was from the batch of faulty devices, you can get a replacement battery free of charge. \nBefore sending the phone for a replacement, Apple advises users back up their data, turn of 'Find My Phone', and erase data and settings in Settings > General > Reset > Erase all Content and Settings. \nRelated: iPhone 6S review \nThe program covers affected iPhone 6s batteries for three years after the first retail sale of the unit, so you've got some time to get your phone in for a replacement cell if you think it's affected by the battery issue. \nJust last week Apple finally acknowledged an issue with iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices that has been dubbed 'touch disease' and involves a a flickering gray bar appearing at the top of the phone's screen before the display becomes unusable. \nThe company began to offer repairs for the issue last week, but will be charging customers £146.44, while US customers will have to shell out $149 \nWATCH: iPhone 7 review \nLet us know if youve been affected by the battery issue in the comments. 0 shares",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan iPhone 6s randomly turns off? Apple says it will replace battery for free Apple launches its second worldwide iPhone repair program in a week, this time for iPhone 6s smartphones that shut down unexpectedly. | Topic: Mobility \nApple says the iPhone 6s battery problem is not a safety issue and only affects a small number of devices. Image: Apple \nApple has kicked off a new program to repair what it says is a \"very small number\" of iPhone 6s handsets that shut down for no apparent reason. \nThe worldwide iPhone 6s battery-replacement program follows last week's launch of an offer to fix iPhone 6s Plus devices affected by issues referred to as 'touch disease', a bug that surfaces after the phone has been dropped on hard surfaces and results in an unresponsive touchscreen. \nUnlike Samsung's recent Galaxy Note 7 repair program for exploding batteries, Apple makes clear that the iPhone 6s battery problem is not a safety issue. It also only affects a small number of devices that were manufactured between September and October 2015. review Read More \nCustomers are being advised to go to an Apple Retail Store or an authorized Apple service provider to have the serial number checked for eligibility. If the device is eligible, Apple will replace the battery at no cost. \nCustomers who have already paid for a replacement battery and believe their iPhone 6s was affected by the issue can contact Apple about a refund. \nApple reminds customers to ensure they've backed up data, switched off Find my iPhone, and erased data on their device before returning it for a battery replacement. \nAlso, customers will need to fix and foot the bill for any unrelated damage, such as a cracked screen, before Apple will replace the battery. \nThe program doesn't extend Apple's standard warranty and only covers iPhone 6s batteries for three years from the first time they were purchased at retail. \nSome iPhone 6s users were reporting devices unexpectedly shutting down last year . However, Apple's new program follows a report by Reuters that the China Consumers Association had called on Apple to investigate complaints that iPhone 6s devices were shutting down with 50 to 60 percent battery levels.

      "text": "Apple offers new battery for iPhone 6s phones that suddenly shut down Apple said the problem has been discovered in a few iPhone 6s smartphones Bangalore Correspondent, IDG News Service | Nov 20, 2016 11:44 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nApple's iPhone 6s Cool Yule Tools- Hot Picks \nApple has said that a few iPhone 6s smartphones are unexpectedly shutting down, confirming a problem reported last week by a Chinese consumer protection group. \nThe company said the problem is restricted to a small number of phones within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October last year. \nApple said it was not a safety issue, and appeared to suggest that the problem would be resolved by a replacement battery which the company offered free. It did not say how many iPhone 6s phones were affected and in which markets. \nThe China Consumers Association asked Apple to investigate problems with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s phones that were automatically shutting off. The unexpected shutdowns were said to happen when the phone’s battery charge dropped to between 60 and 50 percent. \nThe battery replacement comes less than a week after Apple offered to repair for a reduced price of US$149 iPhone 6 Plus devices that had display flickering or multitouch issues. \nThat problem was called “touch disease” in August by repair guide website iFixit, as it was characterized by a gray, flickering bar at the top of the display and an unresponsive touchscreen . Those who had already fixed their phones for the issue were offered a refund on the difference in the cost. \nApple's wireless carrier partners are not participating in the battery replacement program for the iPhone 6s, so eligible users have to contact Apple retail stores, authorized service providers or technical support. Users have been advised to back up their data to iTunes or iCloud, turn off their 'Find My iPhone' facility, and erase all content and settings in preparation for the battery change. \n“If your iPhone 6s has any damage such as a cracked screen which impairs the replacement of the battery, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair,” Apple said while announcing the program . \nUsers who believe their iPhone 6s phones was affected by the issue, and have already paid to replace the battery, can contact Apple about a refund, the company said.

      "text": "1 Comment ... But you might need to buy a new watch to use it. \nWith Samsung and Apple already offering NFC payments on their smartwatches, it was only a matter of time until Android Pay caught up with its own wrist-based payment option. And now strings dug up by Android Police from within the latest Google Play Services APK file suggest it might be happening sooner rather than later. (Or at the very least, that Googlers may be testing it out in the wild.) \nThe strings discovered in an XML file inside the app, which would presumably appear in a menu of some sort, refer to adding an account for Android Pay, and holding the watch over a payment terminal. Pretty obvious what that's all about, then. Clearly Google is preparing the UI for Android Pay on Android Wear. \nHowever, not all current Android Wear devices will be able to use the feature when it rolls out — perhaps alongside the upcoming Android Wear 2.0 in early 2017 — because many popular models like the Huawei Watch and Moto 360 don't have NFC support. The most notable watches that do support this essential feature are ASUS's ZenWatch series. It's likely any new hardware launching alongside Wear 2.0 would feature NFC, and that Android Pay would be one of the tentpole features of the wide-ranging refresh of Google's wearable platform. \nAs for whether Google can make the experience of waving your smartwatch-laden arm over a payment terminal any less awkward than it sounds? We'll have to wait and see. Like us!",

      "text": "Doug Kass shares his views every day on RealMoneyPro. Click here for a real-time look at his insights and musings.\nMy Takeaways and Observations (Early Edition)\nOriginally published Nov. 17 at 3:41 p.m. EDT\nThe consideration of the contrary has been a theme all week. And here in \" Don't Run With the Crowd: Embrace the Contrary .\" Miami madness (of a real estate kind) Mark Grant is scared by our currency's strength . Danielle on scenarios. Boockvar to subscriber Bad Golfer! J.C. Penney ( JCP ) short puts--a 100% win . (Shorting options frequently ends differently!) Just say no to closed-end muni-bond funds . DRYS is all wet . Could iPhone manufacturing be coming back home ? On inflation breakevens--a picture that speaks volumes . The market moved higher from the \"get go\"--in large measure it seems to be a response to the better economic data this morning. At 3 p.m. stocks were near the day's highs. I shorted The Cisco Kid last night. Sticking with this short rental. I added to my ProShares UltraShort S&P500 ETF ( SDS ) long (growing ever larger). My net short exposure--is now between small and medium-sized at the close. The U.S. dollar, as discussed above, continued to rip higher against the euro. I am concerned. Mark Grant is concerned. The market is not concerned. The price of crude oil (down $0.20) settled lower after yesterday's robust gains. Gold fell $9 as it continues to break down--closing in on $1,200. Ag commodities: wheat up $0.07, corn up $0.04, soybeans up $0.05 and oats up $0.02. Lumber up $7 following the big housing number this morning. Bonds schmeissed ... iShares Barclays 20+ Yr Treas.Bond ETF ( TLT ) down $1.50. The yield on the 10-year and 30-year notes and bonds rose by about 5 basis points. The 2s/10s spread steepened by 2 basis points to about 125 basis points. Municipal bond funds traded lower. Closed-end funds got hit. High-yield was flat, though Blackstone/GSO Strategic Credit Fund ( BGB ) rose by $0.05. Banks continued to be the \"world's fair\" but to this observer it is getting heady and panicky. My finger is on the short Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLF ) button. But not yet. Insurers outperformed, but my long Hartford Financial ( HIG ) underperformed. Brokerages up big again. Very over-bought. Autos mixed. Energy stocks, some profit taking. Retail strong after Wednesday's weakness. Led by Best Buy ( BBY ) and Home Depot ( HD ) . Biotech was marginally higher, led by Allergan ( AGN ) and Celgene ( CELG ) . Valeant Pharmaceuticals ( VRX ) still in the regulatory cross hairs. Big pharma down--but barely. Old media led by an analyst upgrade in Microsoft ( MSFT ) . Consumer staples plagued by a strengthening U.S. currency. Investment short, Coca-Cola ( KO ) , can't get out of its own way ... a good thing. Consumer discretionary was mixed. (T)FANG had a good second day in a row--but stocks off their highs as Netflix ( NFLX ) turns red. Apple ( AAPL ) a bit lower after a great day Wednesday. Here are some value-added contributions on our site:\n1.Jim \"El Capitan\" Cramer on banks . I am less positive than Jimmy--believing that it is late in the financial stock move.\n2. Rev Shark on market manipulation.\n3. Homie Mike Norman .\n4. Tim Melvin explains his search for value.\n5. Sossi drinks the Kool-Aid, err ... the Pepsi !\nPositions:\nLong HIG large, JCP large, SDS large, GLD small Short SPY small, GM small, F small, CSCO small, NFLX small, KO, AAPL Position: See above .",

      "text": "\nRumor has it Apple will be discontinuing the company's wireless routers, a line that currently consists of the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and Time Capsule products last updated in 2013.\nMark Gurman, writing for Bloomberg :\nApple Inc. has disbanded its division that develops wireless routers, another move to try to sharpen the company's focus on consumer products that generate the bulk of its revenue, according to people familiar with the matter.\nApple began shutting down the wireless router team over the past year, dispersing engineers to other product development groups, including the one handling the Apple TV, said the people, who asked not to be named because the decision hasn't been publicly announced.\nEarlier this year, Apple told me they were discontinuing the Thunderbolt display . So, this wouldn't be the first accessory Apple cut to focus on core products.\nIf true, I'll miss both the easy AirPlay feature of the AirPort Extreme, and the set-it-and-forget-it backup capability of the Time Capsule. The former let me beam music to any speaker system plugged into the Express. The latter just worked over wireless to keep a local backup of my MacBook and MacBook Pro.\nHopefully Apple will partner with other vendors to fill those gaps. Just like LG replaced the 4K and 5K displays Apple decided not to ship, a variety of router makers could step up to support AirPlay and Time Machine.\nThere's a lot Apple could still do with a home hub, including nearline iCloud, update staging, HomeKit handling, multi-person Siri voice control, and more. But, all of that would factor into a future product, not a past one, and it would be more of a device in its own right and less of an accessory.\nStill, Apple still seems intent on updating other accessories, like the Magic line of Keyboard, Mouse, and Trackpad. The first of those, Magic Keyboard, seems especially primed for an update that includes Apple's new Touch Bar and Touch ID setup for Mac.\nSo, maybe it's better to frame it as Apple clearing the deck of what was so the company can focus on what's next?\nEither way, I've used AirPorts for over a decade, they've always served me well, and I'll always appreciate the hard work and dedication of the teams behind them for that.\n",

      "text": "  15:23 Apple to replace batteries for some iPhone 6s after unexpected shutdown \nApple is to replace faulty batteries in some iPhone 6s handsets that cause the smartphone to \"unexpectedly shut down\", the technology giant has said. \nThe iPhone maker is asking any users of the 6s who have encountered the issue to visit an Apple Store or one of the company's official service providers to have their battery examined, with replacements provided for free if found to be eligible. \nApple said in a statement the fault was not a safety issue and only affected a \"very small number\" of iPhone handsets. \n\"Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015, \" the company's statement said. \n\"If you have experienced this issue, please visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider and have your device's serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a battery replacement, free of charge.\" \nApple warned users that any iPhone handsets found to be eligible would need to have any cracked screens repaired before the firm could go ahead with the battery replacement. \nThe announcement comes just weeks after Samsung was forced to recall and then discontinue their Note7 smartphone after multiple incidents of devices catching fire and exploding. \nThe issue that was initially linked to battery manufacturing, but the Korean firm is still investigating to determine the cause. \nThe iPhone 6s was launched in September 2015 and was the first iPhone to feature a pressure sensitive screen, known as 3D Touch. \nThe battery replacement comes just days after Apple announced a similar scheme to fix a fault in their iPhone 6 Plus that causes the screen to become less responsive over time - an issue known as \"touch disease\". However that fix comes with a service price of £146. « Taking off, and then what?  ",

      "text": "Apple ends development of wireless routers By Dan Pye ● 30 minutes ago \nApple has shuttered its wireless router division, transferring the engineers to teams developing the Apple TV and other products, Bloomberg reports. Apple has been slowly shutting down the router team over the last year, sources familiar with the matter said. Apple hadn’t released a new AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme or AirPort Time Capsule since 2013, but a company spokeswoman declined to comment on the company’s future plans for the product lines. Apple’s router offerings have always lagged behind competitors in adopting new standards due to the company’s focus on integrating the devices into its device ecosystem, and the entire AirPort line only accounts for a tiny percentage of Apple’s overall sales.",

These ads are a bit more interesting than your average product advertising as the company uses this opportunity to promote different values. This year, Apple wants to tell everyone that they should be nice with everyone around them, beyond their families and friends. \nDirected by the same director as the 2013 holiday spot that won the best ad Emmy award, it’s a beautifully shot short story about Frankenstein. \nFrankenstein lives in a secluded house at the top of the mountain. It looks like a comfortable house with a fireplace and there’s a brief shot showing a cup of coffee or tea at the beginning. He uses his iPhone to record a music box (I love music boxes). \nBut something doesn’t feel right. He needs to challenge himself. You can see that he doesn’t come out of his house very often as he needs to dust off his top hat. \nYou don’t really see his face until he’s outside. And the comfortable, humming old man doesn’t look like the guy we pictured in the first shots. This time, it’s a limping monster. \nHe goes to the main square of the village to sing in front of a scared crowd. He doesn’t look confident, he hesitates and is about to give up. But a young girl fixes one of his lights and the crowd starts singing with him. \nIf the message isn’t clear enough, Apple also wrote “Open your heart to everyone” at the end of the spot. While the holidays are a good opportunity to spend time with your families and friends, the company is saying that you should look beyond that. \nThe divisions that led to the presidential election are probably one of the driving factors behind this ad too. We all share the same fears, the same smartphones and the same hesitation. So let’s be nice to one another after. 0",

      "text": "Apple reportedly stops making WiFi routers Your AirPort Extreme may now be a collector's item. Share Save \nWe hope you weren't dead set on getting a new AirPort Extreme any time soon. Bloomberg sources claim that Apple has \"disbanded\" its WiFi router division, quietly ramping it down over the past year as team members joined other divisions (including the Apple TV group). Reportedly, the shutdown is meant to \"sharpen the company's focus\" on those devices that make up the bulk of its revenue. A spokesperson wouldn't confirm the move, but Apple hasn't introduced a new router since 2013 -- it's not as if they had a lot of work on their plate. \nIt's a quiet end for a team that, at one point, was crucial to the proliferation of WiFi. The original AirPort Base Station, along with the first iBook laptop, helped popularize the very concept of wireless networking. Remember a keynote crowd freaking out when Steve Jobs showed that he didn't need an Ethernet cable to surf the web? For a while, Apple was usually one of the first companies to adopt a new WiFi standard -- it would even use draft specs and update once the technology was finished. It also made important strides in networked audio (through the AirPort Express) and fully integrated network backups (Time Capsule). \nHowever, it's not surprising if Apple is bowing out. Much like what we saw when it stopped making displays , the company is facing an increasingly commoditized market where rivals have to compete on purely iterative upgrades like increased coverage . Even speedy 802.11ad WiFi isn't a big selling point. How does Apple stand out (and thus make a profit) when most routers are fast enough, cloud backups are simple and networked audio is just a matter of buying a wireless speaker ? As sad as it might be to see the AirPort line fade away, it's not nearly as important to Apple's success as it once was.",

      "text": "If you’ve noticed that your iPhone 6S shuts down well before the battery runs out, you might be in luck. Apple announced late on Nov. 20 that it would be offering replacement batteries for certain phones.\nThe company said in a release that there’s an issue with “a very small number” of 6S models, which causes some phones to switch off before they’re out of power. Apple noted that the bug is not a safety issue.\nIf you have an iPhone 6S built between September and October 2015, head to an Apple Store or an authorized Apple service store to see if your phone is eligible for a free battery replacement. Even if you already paid to have the battery replaced yourself, you may still be entitled to a refund.\nApple seems to have waited a healthy amount of time after the September release of its latest smartphone, the iPhone 7 , to announce the replacement program. So if you upgraded because your old iPhone’s battery life was causing you grief, this might not be the most welcome news.",

      "text": "Apple reportedly stops making WiFi routers Your AirPort Extreme may now be a collector's item. We hope you weren't dead set on getting a new AirPort Extreme any time soon. Bloomberg sources claim that Apple has \"disbanded\" its WiFi router division, quietly ramping it down over the past year as team members joined other divisions (including the Apple TV group). Reportedly, the shutdown is meant to \"sharpen the company's focus\" on those devices that make up the bulk of its revenue. A spokesperson wouldn't confirm the move, but Apple hasn't introduced a new router since 2013 -- it's not as if they had a lot of work on their plate. It's a quiet end for a team that, at one point, was crucial to the proliferation of WiFi. The original AirPort Base Station, along with the first iBook laptop, helped popularize the very concept of wireless networking. Remember a keynote crowd freaking out when Steve Jobs showed that he didn't need an Ethernet cable to surf the web? For a while, Apple was usually one of the first companies to adopt a new WiFi standard -- it would even use draft specs and update once the technology was finished. It also made important strides in networked audio (through the AirPort Express) and fully integrated network backups (Time Capsule). However, it's not surprising if Apple is bowing out. Much like what we saw when it stopped making displays, the company is facing an increasingly commoditized market where rivals have to compete on purely iterative upgrades like increased coverage. Even speedy 802.11ad WiFi isn't a big selling point. How does Apple stand out (and thus make a profit) when most routers are fast enough, cloud backups are simple and networked audio is just a matter of buying a wireless speaker? As sad as it might be to see the AirPort line fade away, it's not nearly as important to Apple's success as it once was.",

      "title": "Here’s How Apple’s Jony Ive Redesigned the Christmas Tree",
      "text": "Apple design chief Jony Ive has redesigned the Christmas tree.\nThe luxury London hotel Claridge’s over the weekend unveiled its 2016 Christmas tree, designed by Ive and his good friend and Apple’s AAPL special projects designer Marc Newson. According to the hotel, Ive and Newson were inspired by “nature and technology, tradition and the future,” and created a “magical forest” to represent the Christmas tree. The display, which sits in the Claridge’s lobby, includes light boxes with black-and-white images of snow-covered silver birch trees, cast models of Scots pine, fir trees, and a “canopy of natural green pine.” It also features a three-foot-tall tree inside the forest to symbolize the future.\n\"There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology,” Ive and Newson said in a joint statement. “Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognizing our excitement about the future and things to come.\"\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nThe display is a major departure from Christmas trees designed for Claridge’s in years past. While all of the designers Claridge’s has enlisted over the years have employed their own interpretation of the tree, they’ve largely just created a tree. Last year, for instance, luxury fashion designer Christopher Bailey designed a tree decorated with more than 100 gold umbrellas.\nIve and Newson created a forest of trees.\nClaridge’s earlier this month announced plans to enlist the help of Ive and Newson for its annual Christmas tree . They said at the time that the duo would “reinterpret the tree in their own distinctive style.\" Neither Ive nor Newson would say what they had planned.\nThe reimagined Christmas tree comes on the heels of Ive last week celebrating the release of a new design book from Apple. The book, titled Designed by Apple in California , is essentially a picture book, detailing the company’s design concepts between 1998 and 2015. Ive called the book a design “archive,” and said Apple had a “responsibility” to designers around the world to publish the book.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nIve and Newson’s Claridge’s Christmas tree is on display now in the hotel’s lobby. It’s the seventh time the Christmas tree has been redesigned at Claridge’s.",

      "title": "iPhone 6S Shutting Down: Apple Inc. Offers Free Battery Replacement",
      "text": "Flip \nApple’s iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s are both troubling their owners. Last week, the company launched a repair program for the “ touch disease ” flaw affecting the iPhone 6 Plus, and now, it has launched one for the iPhone 6s to help users affected by a flaw in the battery which leads to an unexpected shutdown, reports 9to5 Mac. Image Source: iphonedigital/flickr.com Not a safety issue: Apple \nThe iPhones affected by the battery flaw are few and are those manufactured between September and October 2015. The owners of the affected units can get their batteries replaced free of charge. Apple also pointed out that this issue has nothing to do with users’ safety. \n“Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015,” the iPhone maker says. \nCustomers who find that their devices’ batteries are affected by this flaw should visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider to get their eligibility for the program confirmed. After this, they can have their battery replaced free of charge, the iPhone maker says. China complained of similar issues \nAs usual, Apple made it clear that devices with other damage such as a cracked screen are not eligible for the repair program until the other damage is repaired. The company will refund the cost of the battery replacement to customers who already paid to get it replaced because of this flaw. Such owners should contact customer support. \nApple’s repair program comes just days after the China Consumers Association asked the U.S. firm to look into the battery problem. The organization also suggested that the issue is causing problems on both the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6. However, Apple is covering just the defective iPhone 6s units under this program. \nFor the iPhone 6s Plus, the company launched a separate program. Several iPhone 6 Plus owners were dealing with the so-called “touch disease” problem, due to which the screens of the devices began to flicker or lose touch sensitivity. Under this repair program, Apple is charging $149 because it claims that part of the problem is due to careless handling of the device by owners.",

      "text": "On the heels of finally acknowledging “touch disease,” Apple is addressing a different problem with its iPhones — and is offering a free fix.\nRelated Articles Apple admits to iPhone ‘touch disease,’ blames users iPhone “Touch Disease” tales of woe: Users tell just how bad it is Apple said Sunday that it will replace the batteries of iPhone 6s models that are unexpectedly shutting down.\n“This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015,” the company announced on its website.\nApple said owners of eligible phones can get their batteries replaced at the company’s stores or at authorized service providers, but not at wireless providers. The company also said that iPhone owners who have already paid for replacement batteries may be entitled to a refund.\nLast week, the Cupertino company said it would repair iPhones that have “touch disease,” which causes flickering or unresponsive screens and is reportedly widespread. Apple said the problem — which it’s being sued over — likely stemmed from phones being dropped repeatedly. It said it would repair affected phones for $149.",

Sorry There was an error emailing this page. \nApple's iPhone 6s WWDC 2015: The top 3 biggest reveals \nApple has said that a few iPhone 6s smartphones are unexpectedly shutting down, confirming a problem reported last week by a Chinese consumer protection group. \nThe company said the problem is restricted to a small number of phones within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October last year. [ InfoWorld's Mobile Security Deep Dive . Download it today in your choice of PDF or ePub editions! | Keep up on key mobile developments and insights with the Mobile Tech Report newsletter . ] \nApple said it was not a safety issue, and appeared to suggest that the problem would be resolved by a replacement battery which the company offered free. It did not say how many iPhone 6s phones were affected and in which markets. \nThe China Consumers Association asked Apple to investigate problems with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s phones that were automatically shutting off. The unexpected shutdowns were said to happen when the phone’s battery charge dropped to between 60 and 50 percent. \nThe battery replacement comes less than a week after Apple offered to repair for a reduced price of $149 iPhone 6 Plus devices that had display flickering or multitouch issues. \nThat problem was called “touch disease” in August by repair guide website iFixit, as it was characterized by a gray, flickering bar at the top of the display and an unresponsive touchscreen . Those who had already fixed their phones for the issue were offered a refund on the difference in the cost. \nApple’s wireless carrier partners are not participating in the battery replacement program for the iPhone 6s, so eligible users have to contact Apple retail stores, authorized service providers or technical support. Users have been advised to back up their data to iTunes or iCloud, turn off their ‘Find My iPhone’ facility, and erase all content and settings in preparation for the battery change. \n“If your iPhone 6s has any damage such as a cracked screen which impairs the replacement of the battery, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair,” Apple said while announcing the program . \nUsers who believe their iPhone 6s phones was affected by the issue, and have already paid to replace the battery, can contact Apple about a refund, the company said.

SHARES \nAUSTIN, Tex. — During the presidential campaign, President-elect Donald J. Trump complained that America had lost too many manufacturing jobs and promised to force big companies like Apple to bring that work home. \"I'm going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China,\" he said . \nFor a host of reasons , Apple is unlikely to produce iPhones in the United States. But opening a smartphone factory in this country is not the only way to provide solid employment for working-class Americans who lack college degrees. \nMore from The New York Times: Dublin Appeals $14.3 Billion Tax Charge Against Apple \nApple's overall contribution to the American economy is significant. Beyond the 80,000 people it directly employs in the United States, it says 69 supplier facilities in 33 states manufacture parts that go into its products. Hundreds of thousands of software developers also write apps for iPhones and iPads. \nApple's rapid growth here in central Texas, where it now employs about 6,000 people, up from 2,100 seven years ago, provides a window into the vast constellation of jobs at the world's largest technology company and their economic impact. \nAt Apple's sparkling new complex in northwest Austin, workers who are spread throughout seven limestone-and-glass buildings field about 8,000 customer tech-support calls a day, manage the company's vast network of suppliers and figure out how to move around millions of iPhones a week to ensure they get into the hands of customers when they want them. \nEmployees here help run Apple's iTunes music and app stores, handle the billions of dollars going in and out of the company's American operations and continuously update the Maps software that is integral to iPhones and iPads. At another Austin location, about 500 engineers work on the chips that will run the next round of Apple's products. \nThe Austin campus — the company's largest outside its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. — offers plenty of perks, too. When employees are not working, they can lounge on chairs shaded from the Texas sun, dine at a two-story cafeteria that serves an abundance of food options, including barbecued ribs and banana-bread gelato, and visit a full-service medical clinic, which includes dentists, acupuncturists and a robot-assisted pharmacy. \nAlthough contractors at the Austin technical support call center earn as little as $14.50 an hour, equivalent to about $30,000 a year, many of them become permanent staff members, which means better pay, after the typical one-year contract is up. Experienced call center employees earn around $45,000 a year, plus generous benefits and small annual stock grants. Pay is even higher for more senior advisers and managers. Apple says that, excluding benefits and stock compensation, the average salary of its Austin employees, including management, is $77,000 a year. \nApple declined to discuss its future expansion plans in Austin and in the United States. \n\"Apple has created over two million jobs in the United States since the introduction of the iPhone nine years ago, including explosive growth in iOS developers, thousands of new supplier and manufacturing partners, and a 400 percent increase in our employee teams,\" the company said in a statement. \"We made the unique decision to keep and expand our contact centers for customers in the Americas in the United States, and Austin is home to many of those employees. We plan to continue to invest and grow across the U.S.\" \nLast week, a reporter and photographer visited the Austin campus and interviewed more than a dozen workers, from managers to a prep cook on the kitchen staff. Apple's public relations staff monitored some of the conversations, but others were unsupervised. \nGenny Lopez, who went to college for two years and used to work as a bartender, joined Apple as a contractor handling tech support calls. She is now on staff, troubleshooting difficult customer problems. \"You don't need a crazy technical background to do this job,\" Ms. Lopez said. \"A lot of the training is getting really good at talking to people.\" \nApple prides itself on providing top-notch phone service in 26 languages — 12 are spoken at the Texas call center alone — and the people who handle the calls are expected to follow up on any problem that cannot be quickly resolved. During the recent visit, Stephanie Dumareille, a senior adviser on iOS issues who is fluent in English and Spanish, patiently answered questions from a customer who was worried about saving her résumé online and did not know whether she was using a Windows or a Mac computer. \nEmployees say that Apple encourages them to move within and across teams, and the company is instituting a formal program to allow workers to try a completely different role for six months to see it if suits them and the company. Brisa Carillo, who started out in the call center fresh out of college five years ago, now handles international payroll matters and is studying for her M.B.A. so she can move up the ranks of the finance department within Apple. \nThe region's economy has deep roots in technology and is home to a number of big tech employers, most notably Dell. Apple's influence in the area extends beyond the people on its direct payroll. It has 350 suppliers in Texas alone. \nAnd about 3,400 construction workers helped build the Austin campus. Apple ensured that they all got paid at least $12 an hour. It also provided workers' compensation insurance and safety training, and it allowed the monitoring of conditions by an outside labor group, the Workers Defense Project , which has been trying to improve safety and pay in Texas construction. \n\"There is a high road, and Apple followed that path,\" said Bo Delp, director of the Better Builder program at the Workers Defense Project. \"It sent a pretty strong message to others in Austin.\" \nA mile from its Austin campus, Apple is involved in manufacturing, through Flex, a global contract manufacturer. Flex assembles Apple's Mac Pro desktop computers to meet the exact requirements of customers, who can choose among more than 4,000 combinations of features and hardware. \nFlex added about 2,000 jobs for the Apple project. Although Apple and Flex declined to discuss details of their arrangement, the assembly jobs start at $11 an hour and pay an average of about $30,000 a year, according to testimony by Flex officials in 2014, when they sought government aid for the expansion. \nApple could in theory build more products in the United States through contractors like Flex. But the company and industrial experts say that would be very difficult and could easily add $100 to the final cost of an iPhone. China has built a whole ecosystem of suppliers for nearly every electronic part imaginable. Vast pools of trained labor make it easy to quickly scale production up or down to meet demand. \nLarger products, or ones that require more customizing, such as PCs, make more sense to build close to the final customer. \n\"It's easy to ship a phone, and it's harder to ship a computer,\" said Andy Tsay, a professor at Santa Clara University who has studied global manufacturing patterns. \"And it's harder still for cars and refrigerators.\" \nOver time, the value of Apple's business is shifting away from hardware like the iPhone and into software such as apps and services like Apple Music, Mr. Tsay said. And those jobs can be much better for workers. \"There are fewer industrial accidents working in a call center,\" he said. \"There is probably more gender equity. And it's probably better for customers, too.\" \nAlan Marquis, a former Army officer who spent a couple of years streamlining processes on a manufacturer's assembly line before joining Apple, now manages part of the complex software that integrates Apple's suppliers into the company's production systems. \"Here, there's a lot more openness and creativity,\" he said. \"In manufacturing, it's a lot more widgets dropping off the line.\" \nMayor Steve Adler of Austin, a Democrat, does not sweat the details of the jobs companies create in his city. He is more concerned that the work pays enough — at least $20 an hour — to support the city's middle class, which is being squeezed by rising home prices. \nSome of the new jobs, like those at the Austin chip factory owned by Samsung, Apple's biggest rival in the smartphone business, will be in manufacturing. Others, like the ones Apple brings, will be in services. \"The best kind of jobs are those that allow someone to continue to grow and climb the ladder,\" Mr. Adler said. \nAsked about Apple's lack of manufacturing in the United States, Ms. Lopez said: \"The product that Apple builds here is us.\" \nCorrection: November 20, 2016 An earlier version of this article misstated the education attained by Genny Lopez. She attended college for two years; she did not receive an associate's degree.",

      "text": "What You Need to Know About Apple's New MacBooks Advertisement Mac Hardware Computer Apple \nAt its Special Event on 27th October 2016, Apple announced their new line of MacBook Pros. \nThis is the first major update in four years and there’s been some big changes. In this article, I’ll tell you what you need to know about the new MacBook Pro line and help you decide whether or not you need to upgrade. Three New Models \nThere are now three models of MacBook Pro: the 13-inch, 13-inch with Touch Bar and Touch ID, and the 15-inch with Touch Bar and Touch ID. The three new MacBook Pro models. \nThe entry level 13-inch looks more like a slightly-souped up replacement for the MacBook Air which remains in the lineup but hasn’t been updated. It’s got a 2.0GHz dual-core i5, a 256GB SSD, 8 GB of RAM and two Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports. Prices start at $1,499. \nThe 13-inch with Touch Bar and Touch ID is the first real replacement for the current MacBook Pro line. The base model has a 2.9GHz dual-core i5, a 256GB SSD, 8GB of faster RAM than the entry level 13-inch, four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports, the new Touch Bar and Touch ID. Prices start from $1,799. \nThe 15-inch with Touch Bar and Touch ID is Apple’s new top end MacBook. The base model has a 2.6GHz quad-core i7, a 256GB SSD, 16GB of RAM, Radeon Pro Graphics with 2GB of memory, four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports, the Touch Bar and Touch ID. Prices start from $2,399 and go up to $4,299 for a fully specced out model. A New Design Apple has basically put the power of a MacBook Pro into a frame that’s the size of a MacBook Air. \nThe most striking thing about the latest MacBook Pro line is the new design. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch models are significantly smaller than the previous generation. They’re also available in two colours: Silver and Space Grey. The new design is gorgeous. \nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro is just 14.9mm thick, 17% thinner than the previous model. The 15-inch is 15.5 mm thick, about 14% thinner than the older one. They both weigh half a pound, around 240 grammes, less than the computer they’re replacing. \nApple has basically put the power of a MacBook Pro into a frame that’s the size of a MacBook Air. Better Hardware \nAll the internal components have had a big update. The CPUs are all from Intel’s Skylake line which was released late last year. \nThe SSDs, RAM, graphics and other internal parts have all been upgraded. Everything should be a little faster than the current models, from transferring files to booting up. Even the entry level 13-inch can drive a 5K display. \nThe built-in screen is also had a massive upgrade. The Retina resolution remains the same but the screen is 67 percent brighter, displays 67 percent more contrast and supports a wider colour gamut. \nFor photographers and designers, the screen improvements are a big deal. \nThe Force Touch trackpad and keyboard have been updated as well. The new trackpads are a lot larger; half as big again on the 13-inch, and twice the size on the 15-inch. The keyboard is the second generation of the butterfly mechanism found in last years 12-inch MacBook. General Use Ports \nThe biggest and most controversial change has been that the seven ports on the previous generation of MacBook Pros have been replaced by four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports (and only two ports on the entry level model). \nThe MagSafe, SD Card slot, HDMI port and regular USB ports have all been removed. \nInstead, there are four Thunderbolt 3 ports that can each serve any of the purposes of the ports they replace—as long as you have the correct cables. The four Thunderbolt 3/USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pros. \nNow, the one port can power the Mac, connect it to an external storage device, drive a Thunderbolt display, and charge an iPhone. It’s a move away from single-use ports to more adaptable, general use ports. If you don’t use an SD Card slot or a HDMI port, they’re not taking up space on the Mac. \nAs with many of the big moves Apple makes, this one is happening earlier than some customers would like. Everything is moving towards general ports but it’s not there yet. Apple doing so on their MacBook Pros is likely to be the catalyst for other manufacturers moving to general use ports. \nThere’s some big advantages to it. \nUnfortunately, early adopters will have to deal with the transition period. For the time being, if you want to connect your MacBook to any old USB devices, you’ll need to use specific dongles. These can add back in SD Card slots, HDMI ports, and so on, at the cost of having an ugly plastic cable attached to the Mac. The TouchBar \nThe TouchBar is the flagship new feature of the latest MacBook Pros. Instead of a row of function keys, there’s now a touch screen that displays app specific shortcuts. One of the examples Apple gave was that if you’re in Messages , it will show different emoji. The TouchBar replaces the function keys. \nThe most obvious use, however, is in professional applications. For people who use Adobe’s Creative Cloud and other similar apps, having a customisable—and easy to use—shortcut bar could improve their workflow. \nHow useful it actually is remains to be seen. It’s a totally unproven input method. \nThe early signs, though, look promising. It’s not a must-have feature, but it’s certainly more interesting than a row of dumb buttons. Touch ID \nTouch ID revolutionised the iPhone. It’s made having a securely locked phone simple. Now Apple has brought the same level of security to the Mac. \nTouch ID will make it easier to use secure passwords. When apps like 1Password integrate it, all your passwords, whether they’re for Facebook or your webserver, can be ridiculously long strings that are protected by your fingerprints. Deciding if the New MacBook is for You \nThe new MacBook Pro is, in some respects, a hard sell. \nWhile it’s undoubtedly going to be Apple’s best MacBook yet, computers have reached the point of incremental gains. Unless you’re doing serious photo or video editing, you’re not going to see much of a difference day-to-day between the latest Pro and the same model of the previous. They’ll both happily have dozens of tabs open, run multiple apps at the same time, play HD YouTube videos, and so on. \nIf you bought your Mac in the last four years or so, the odds are that once you move everything across, it’ll feel the exact same. The screen will look a bit better, it’ll start up a few seconds faster, but it’s not going to blow your mind. The new MacBook Pro is, in some respects, a hard sell. \nThe other problem is that, with the new MacBook Pros, you’re sacrificing a lot. USB-C is the future… but it’s not quite the present. \nIn a few years, when other manufacturers have followed suit and added USB-C ports to their computers, there will be a much wider selection of peripherals. As things stand now, most external hard drives, data cables, mice, and anything else that plugs into your computer, use older USB standards. \nIt’s going to be inconvenient for at least the next year or two. \nAt some point, however, you will need to make the leap. The new hardware is stunning, the TouchBar seems promising, the extra large Trackpad will probably be a dream to use, and they are the most powerful MacBooks yet. \nIf your Mac has packed it in, or you can justify the cost for the extra power or prettier screen, then it’s worth upgrading. But until you need to upgrade, you’ll get by fine on your current Mac. Advertisement",

Companies are seeking ways to increase revenue and reduce expenses, as the global market competition continues to shrink profit margins. Organizations of all sizes are focusing more on analyzing sales and market saturation in specific territories and identifying gaps. However, the lack of awareness regarding the benefits of digitalization is a restraining factor for the digital transformation market. \nThe digital transformation market in APAC is estimated to register the highest growth rate during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the increasing technological advancements, increasing mobile app users, and big data analytics ompanies showing positive trend towards adoption of these technologies, thereby presenting immense growth potential for the Asia-Pacific digital transformation market in the near future. In the Asia-Pacific region, China will be the epicenter of digital innovations. Increasing e-commerce business in this country and the rapidly-developing social media platform in this region are among the major driving factors for the increasing digital transformation in the region. \nCompanies Mentioned:",

      "text": "Twitter \nApple isn’t exactly known for its generosity. On the contrary, the company is known for its premium pricing strategy. However, Apple is finally giving something away for free. Unfortunately, it’s just a replacement battery for your failing iPhone 6s. \nOver the last few months people have been complaining that the battery on their iPhone 6s iPhone 6s Review and Giveaway iPhone 6s Review and Giveaway Spoiler alert: if you like iPhones, you’re probably going to love the iPhone 6s. But are you really surprised? Read More is FUBAR. This is causing their handsets to shut down unexpectedly without any warning. Reports suggest the batteries are fine until they reach 50-60 percent, at which point the phone dies. \nApple has now published an official support document regarding the issue . The company maintains this issue is limited to “a very small number” of iPhones “within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015”. \nIf you have encountered this problem then Apple is offering to replace the battery on your iPhone 6s completely for free. We’ll just repeat that last part so that it properly sinks in…“completely for free”. I know! Bob’s Your Metaphorical Uncle \nAll you need to do is visit your nearest Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider. They will check your device’s serial number to confirm you’re eligible to receive a replacement battery, and Bob’s your metaphorical uncle. \nThere is, however, one caveat which could mean you’re still out of pocket: \n“If your iPhone 6s has any damage such as a cracked screen which impairs the replacement of the battery, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the battery replacement. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the repair.” Getting Touchy Over Touch Disease \nThe company appears to have been spurred into action by a request from The China Consumers Association, which asked Apple to investigate reports of iPhones shutting down unexpectedly. So it appears that if you want something sorted quickly, get China to complain about it. \nThis speedy response to complaints, and subsequent offer to fix the problem for free stands in stark contrast to Apple’s handling of Touch Disease The Touch Disease Killing iPhones, Google Punishes Pesky Pop-Ups... [Tech News Digest] The Touch Disease Killing iPhones, Google Punishes Pesky Pop-Ups...

The company maintains that’s completely down to user error (caused by people dropping their phones), so it’s charging $149 for repairs Apple Will Fix Your iPhone's Touch Disease... for $150 Apple Will Fix Your iPhone's Touch Disease... for $150 Apple has finally admitted that Touch Disease is a real problem. Unfortunately, it's blaming iPhone users for dropping their handsets, and charging them $150 for repairs! Read More . \nHas your iPhone 6s started shutting down unexpectedly? Will you be seeking a free replacement battery? Should Apple have handled the Touch Disease issue differently? Do you think Apple hardware issues are becoming more common?

      "text": "Does Drake's Apple commercial totally prove he's dating Taylor Swift? 3 hours ago Image: Getty Images Print Drake just so happens to be singing along to ‘Bad Blood’ in his new Apple ad Share Tumble   \nThe rumor mill swirled last month when Taylor Swift attended Drake’s birthday party in West Hollywood and the two supposedly spent a lot of time together . Seeming to take pleasure in the rumors, Drake posted a shot of himself with Swift on Instagram . And then everything died down, and we’ve heard nothing more — until now. A video posted by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Nov 20, 2016 at 9:55pm PST \nMore: 8 times Drake was actually hilarious, including that 'Bad Blood' Apple ad \nDrake dropped a new Apple Music commercial last night, which is as over-the-top absurd as it is delightfully watchable. Basically, Drizzy fires up a secret playlist after his trainer leaves the private gym in which he is getting his sweat on and pumps Swift’s “Bad Blood” at high volume, lip-synching along with it in classic Drake fashion. After getting his (awkward) dance moves on, he proceeds to the weight bench, where he finds himself unable to chest press the gigantic weight he has in his hands — and then falls off the bench. \nMore: 20 things you didn't know about Drake \nHonestly, the bench fall doesn’t make much sense — he pretty much catapults himself off the bench — but the whole thing is clearly in homage to Swift’s Apple Music commercial from earlier this year in which she hits the treadmill while listening to Drake and Future’s hit “Jumpman” and then winds up falling off the back of the treadmill (pretty much everyone’s worst fear). \nSwift posted the commercial on Instagram last night alongside the caption “YES @champagnepapi #drakevsbenchpress.” Drake followed suit, posting the commercial and the caption “@taylorswift @applemusic @21savage #SwiftGains #NoMercy #LightWork #Draylor” a few hours later. Image: Getty Images \nObviously, the pair is having a great time trolling us all. It definitely doesn’t seem like Drake and Swift — or should we say “Draylor,” as Drake did — are actually dating, but they are certainly pals and enjoying the ridiculousness of the rumors. Or, you know, they’re secretly in love. Doubtful, though: It really isn’t Swift’s forte to keep her relationships under wraps.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray UBS hardware analyst Steve Milunovich , who follows Apple ( AAPL ) and rates its shares a Buy, with a $127 price target, today offers up the transcript of a discussion on the company that took place during his firm’s “ UBS Tech Conference ” a week ago, with outside observers trying to figure out where Apple goes from here.\nThe panel participants were three: Adam Lashinsky , Assistant Managing Director at Fortune ; Horace Dediu , senior fellow at the Clayton Christiansen Institute for Disruptive Innovation and author of market intelligence site Asymco.com ; and Mark Gurman , journalist at Bloomberg.\nAll three participated in the same discussion a year earlier, so Milunovich asked them how they felt about Apple. “I don’t feel any better or worse frankly,” said Lashinsky, despite Apple’s growth “going into reverse” in the intervening time.\nApple has fulfilled Dediu’s expectation they would focus more and more on software and services :\nThe metrics on the services business have grown tremendously and very steadily, which is very different than what we’ve seen on the hardware side. As a result, we are actually better equipped today to measure them as a service and a recurring business in the long term. In some ways, the hardware metrics have plateaued. Perhaps we’re going to see a slight return to growth this quarter. It was very high volatility and now we’re stabilizing a bit. But I think the services side is still what’s interesting going forward […] I wouldn’t say it’s a services company. I would say it’s a recurring revenue model. Those customers who have the iPhone have attached to them an additional revenue source, which is a subscription. But the iPhone itself is a subscription. Your customers are coming back with 85% probability to buy another iPhone.\nGurman: “In terms of new products overall, not much has happened since the end of last year.”\nMilunovich asked, “What gives you confidence that given enough time, Apple is going to be able to find the next big thing ?”\nLashinsky responded “I think this is something that one cannot have confidence about. It either happens or it doesn’t.”\nDediu replied that “I want to de-emphasize the hit-driven business. I think Apple management also has been trying to deemphasize the hit-driven business.”\nHe added, “I think the hit-driven mind-set is demoralizing internally, and there is a concerted effort to tone down this “Let’s hit home runs” mind-set.”\nLater in the discussion, the trio talked about how Apple has apparently for the moment moved away from working on building a full-blown car .\nGurman said they are trying to “ nail the autonomous driving component ” before moving on to doing a car. That prompted Dediu to suggest the entire organization of the company has changed, from doing projects “in parallel” to doing them “serially,” one after another.\nThe sequencing from parallel to serial means that the timeframe just moved way out. That’s why Tim would have said it’s going to be Christmas Eve for a while. Unfortunately that just means that we’re going to have to wait.\nApple shares today closed up $1.67, or 1.5%, at $111.73.",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple today unveiled a new webpage teasing the upcoming Black Friday shopping holiday. On the webpage, Apple touts that it will be holding a “one-day event” this Friday, much like other retailers do. \nApple, however, has largely stayed out of Black Friday in recent years, instead opting to offload the responsibility of slashing prices to retail partners . If this webpage is any indication though, it seems like Apple might be preparing to reenter the Black Friday game this year… \nApple teases that “Friday can’t come soon enough” and invites customers to come back to shop and start checking items off their list on Friday: \nFriday can’t come soon enough. Our one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to check everyone off your list. \nAt this point, Apple’s “one-day event” webpage simply teases the upcoming event and outlines potential gifts across a variety of categories, including Music, Photography, Games & Toys, and actual Apple products. \nIt’s unclear what exactly Apple has planned for its Black Friday shopping event. Apple has never been one to offer huge discounts on its products during the shopping season (other retailers are where to look for that ). Rather, Apple in recent years has generally offered gift cards with the purchase of a product, with the gift card denomination varying depending on which product was purchased. Apple last participated in Black Friday during 2014, offering: iPod touch – $25",

The phones would not power back up when plugged into chargers, CNN reported . \nApple stressed it was not a safety issue. \nLast week, Apple admitted that iPhone 6 Plus phones can suffer from what is been dubbed \"Touch Disease.\" The touchscreen stops working when it has been bent or dropped repeatedly. Apple will fix phones with \"Touch Disease\" with a $149 service. \nTo find out if your iPhone 6s is on the list for a new battery, click here . The repair will be handled by Apple, not the wireless companies that feature the device, Apple announced . \nRead more top trending stories on wsoctv.com: ",

      "title": "Apple faces decade of uncertainty after next year's iPhone",
      "text": "By Jennifer Booton, MarketWatch\nAnalysts say shrinking gap between iPhone and rivals, along with growing market for used smartphones, mean 'risks ... have never been greater'\nApple Inc. is the world's most valuable company and has a massive cash stash, but some analysts fear a prolonged period of weak innovation has set the company up for a \"decade-long malaise.\"\niPhone sales are expected to peak with the release of Apple's (AAPL) 10th anniversary iPhone next year, according to models from Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz, who predicts 245 million iPhones will sell in Apple's 2018 fiscal year. That would reflect an increase of 9% from the fiscal 2017 FactSet consensus estimate of 225 million, and an increase of more than 15% from the fiscal year that ended in October.\nHowever, Uerkwitz believes next year's iPhone cycle will present \"one last growth hurrah\" before consumers begin to drift away from the high prices Apple commands for it smartphones. Apple may struggle to raise iPhone prices meaningfully beyond the next cycle as it deals with fewer hardware breakthroughs and a narrowing performance gap between the iPhone and its closest premium-tier competitors, Uerkwitz wrote.\n\"The risks to the company have never been greater,\" said Uerkwitz, who has a perform rating on the stock. \"We believe Apple is about to embark on a decade-long malaise.\"\nAlso Read: Share buybacks will return with a vengeance next year (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/share-buybacks-will-return-with-a-vengeance-next-year-2016-11-21)\nAnother analyst, Monness Crespi Hardt's James Cakmak, echoed similar bearish sentiment Monday, warning about changing consumer behavior that have lengthened upgrade cycles, and competitive threats from the likes of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) (GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) in the phone, video-streaming and augmented-reality realms.\n\"Apple won't have it easy again for a while, if ever,\" Cakmak said.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/7rfyaGqHfyB)\nOne issue is an increase in demand for used and refurbished phones. Cakmak warns that Apple's refurbished-phone program may cannibalize new-device sales, which would further depress average selling prices. Trends tracker IDC said Monday it expects the global used smartphone market to nearly triple from 2015 through 2020 (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/used-smartphone-market-to-triple-in-five-years-2016-11-21), which could impact original equipment manufacturers and mobile operators like Apple and Samsung Electronics (005930.SE) .\nLast month, Apple reported its first ever annual decline in iPhone sales (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-profit-revenue-slide-on-slower-iphone-sales-2016-10-25). Its shares have risen 2.3% in the past three months, virtually in-line with the Dow Jones Industrial Average , but have underperformed in the past year, falling more than 6% versus a 6% gain for the blue-chip index.\nDespite the bearish calls, the average rating on Apple stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average target of $130 implies 16% growth from Monday's closing price.\nBullish analysts have more confidence that Apple can maintain a stranglehold on the market for high-price smartphones. Canaccord Genuity's Michael Walkley, who reiterated a buy rating and $140 price target Monday, said he expects Apple to \"extend its leading market share of the premium tier smartphone market,\" despite competition from Google's Pixel phone and other Android phones. Samsung's disastrous Note 7 recall (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-could-sell-another-15-million-iphones-because-of-samsungs-note-7-explosions-2016-10-10)has also helped this quarter, he said.\nOthers have been bullish on Apple's reported efforts on smart cars and augmented reality. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has been optimistic about AR and has secured a number of acquisitions over the past two years to help accelerate those plans. While Cakmak said Apple is trailing both Google and Amazon, Upload VR's entrepreneur in residence, Robert Scoble, citing sources, recently reported that Apple is working on a set of mixed-reality glasses (https://www.facebook.com/RobertScoble/posts/10154677292964655) that could be ready in 10 months.\nAlso See: Apple and augmented reality--where we're going, we won't need iPhones (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-and-augmented-reality-where-were-going-we-wont-need-iphones-2016-08-19)\nStill, other uncertainties loom, such as the new White House administration (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-and-trump-can-a-tax-cut-for-overseas-cash-heal-wounds-2016-11-09). While president-elect Donald Trump's proposed repatriation tax \"holiday\" would make it easier for Apple to return cash to the U.S. and put that money to work, other Trump policies that might make Apple build more iPhone components in the U.S. could offset tax-related financial benefits.\nLast week, Japan's Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple reached out to supplier Foxconn Technology Co. Ltd. (2354.TW) about studying the possibility of moving some production to the U.S., (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-supplier-foxconn-reportedly-considering-moving-iphone-production-to-america-2016-11-17) which Cakmak said might have negative implications.\n-Jennifer Booton; 1817ET\n ",

      "text": "The failure rate of Apple iOS worldwide has gone has gone up to 62%, and Apple iOS is tagged as the worst performing mobile OS in Q3 2016 . These are the findings of Blancco, the global leader in mobile device diagnostic and business intelligence, in its Q3 report. Interestingly, the company also reported that failure rate of Apple iOS is considerably higher than that of Android, which clocked at just 47% failure rate. This comparison surfaced during the testing and analyzing of data collected from millions of devices worldwide.\nThe report, titled State of Mobile Device Performance and Health l Trend Report Q3 2016 ”, was released in the mid of November. Th e worldwide media, both online and offline, indulged in a rat race to publish it as early as possible – without checking with the authenticity of the data! \nThese days the blindness of media is so engraving that authors and editors believe on anything and everything that is served to them. All this only to hold on to the lead position in the rat race of pocketing advertising dollars. The very nature of content screening made hundreds of publishers, including many renowned brands like Android Authority , BGR , PhoneArena , PR Newswire , Gadget360 , and Yahoo! , report wrong information, accusing Apple iOS of high crash data.\nFailure Rate of Apple iOS vs. Android: A Questionable Report Last week, Blancco released a report that highlights the increasing failure rate of iOS in Q3 2016. According to the report, the failure rate of iOS devices was up by 4%,from 58% in Q2 2016 to 62% in Q3 2016. The company also bluntly stated that iPhone and iPad failure was almost twice as much as Android devices.\nWhile the data looks legitimate as it’s based upon the failure incidents reported on millions of devices, the teardown analysis of the report raises many questions about the authenticity of the report. \nThe report charts out the list of top 10 iOS models by failure percentage in Q3 2016. Each device’s failure figure is taken as a percentage of the total iOS failure rate (62%). If you add up all the percentage of top 10 iOS models, it sums up to 50%. Therefore, the failure rate of the other left over iOS devices must sum up to remaining 50% – which is quite impossible considering that there are only 4-5 other iOS devices available in the market. To add, none of these left out devices can have a failure percentage of more than 1%.\n\nBut this is not the only questionable finding that challenges the authenticity of the report.\nWe paid close attention to the failure percentage of “ Top 10 iOS Models by Failure Rate in Q3 2016 ” and “ Top 10 Android Models by Failure Rate in Q3 2016 ”.\nHave you got anything fishy? If not, then see the percentage of each device closely in both the charts – It’s identical! \nIt’s almost next to impossible that the failure rate of top 10 devices powered by iOS and Android has had the same failure rate in a given quarter. Isn’t it?\n\nAll the above points raise some serious concerns about the findings of the report: \nWhich OS has highest failure rate – iOS or Android? Is the overall failure rate of iOS wrong? If not, then we move to the next question! Is the overall failure rate of Android wrong? Is the failure rate of Top 10 iOS Devices wrong? if not then, we immediately ask- Is the failure rate of Top 10 Android Devices wrong? Does 4% increase in the failure rate of 58%, result in 62%? The Internet Sources of Information: Boon or Bane We keep saying “The Internet has all the information/Resources”, which is true. There isn’t anything that is not available over the internet. We need information at our fingertips, and we get it as well. But is everything served to us accurate?\nInternet consumers demand and deserve logically correct and data-driven rich content to take informed decisions. This means there is a dire need for content writers and analysts. Sadly, anyone with good English writing skills considers a content writing profile. On the other hand, in a bid to publish more and more compelling contents, media houses and popular blogs push content writers to act as analysts. Despite including a lot of data in the content, this trend of overlapping roles is resulting in incorrect data, misleading content, and entirely wrong information at regular intervals.\nPublishers are busy re-publishing anything and everything that surfaces on the internet. They get so engrossed in getting ahead of the race that they end up ignoring the far-reaching damages that are being caused. Feeding millions of readers with wrong information is just the beginning of corrupting the whole internet society.\nIt is not the first time that we have found such misleading data and claims in a report. We have reported about such incidents in the past with a commitment to serve authentic and the most reliable industry intelligence information and interactions.\nWe have written to Blancco about the possible misguided information in the report, seeking more explanation on their claims. Keep an eye on this space for further updates. We will get back to you ASAP once we hear from the company.\n",

      "text": "By Justin Luna Neowin LLC @_justinluna · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nApple is taking a break from its usual advertisements, like touting its Mac computers against the products of rival Microsoft , among others. As part of the upcoming holiday season, the Cupertino company has released a new ad entitled 'Frankies' Holiday,' starring the classic character Frankenstein. \nThe ad opens with him chilling in a cabin, recording a tune from his music box onto his iPhone. He then decides to step out of the house, walking towards a plaza full of people. Upon seeing the character, everyone is surprised and appalled, getting away from him as much as possible. Trying to not get too affected, Frankie plugs on some festive Christmas lights onto his neck, and starts to sing a rendition of '(There's No Place Like) Home for the Holidays' through his recording. \nWith the frightened crowd, Frankenstein stops singing, looking hopeless. However, a girl comes up, fixes his broken lights, and continues singing the rest of the song with him. It didn't take long before everybody else in the crowd followed through, much to Frankie's delight. \nBy the end of the video, Apple sent out a short but powerful message, asking viewers to 'open your heart to everyone.' In today's times where divisiveness is very apparent, the advertisement leaves us a good message of acceptance of all people, placing love as the most important thing above all else.",

      "text": "CNBC.com SHARES \nIf President-elect Donald Trump stays true to his word, Apple should hope that a big wad of extra cash can help compensate for what are likely to become big fights with the new administration over trade, encryption and immigration. \nEven though Apple would benefit immensely from Trump's proposed tax reform, the president-elect's stance on trade with China , his immigration-hawk attorney general, and his cybersecurity appointees could pose threats to America's wealthiest company, industry watchers said. Vasily Maximov | AFP | Getty Images An employee of Caviar Phones, a Russian-Italian company specializing in smartphone customization, displays a special gold-plated iPhone 7 smartphone bearing the likeness of US President-elect Donald Trump - at a minimum price of 197 000 rubles (2755 euros / 2971 dollars) - in the company's boutique outside Moscow on November 14, 2016. \n\"The Trump impact could have a double-edged sword impact on technology stalwarts such as Apple,\" said Daniel Ives, senior vice president of finance and corporate development at mobile cloud maker Synchronoss Technologies, who covered the company on Wall Street for years. \n\"On one hand, potential corporate tax cuts under Trump could have a major positive impact given Apple's massive tax burden and ongoing challenges,\" Ives said. \"However, if Trump walks the walk on the China tariff issues, this would have a very negative impact on production costs.\" \nTrump's victory comes at a time when Apple and the government are more intertwined than ever. Under CEO Tim Cook , Apple has spent about 3½ times more on lobbying than when co-founder Steve Jobs led the company, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics . Taxes \nApple is a clear-cut winner from Trump's offshore tax plan, according to Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi, since it has both a high tax rate and a huge offshore cash balance. \nWith a 26 percent tax rate and $216 billion stored offshore, Apple would benefit from Trump's proposals to lower the business tax rate to 15 percent and allow the one-time repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a tax rate of 10 percent, Sacconaghi wrote in a research note. \nOverall, the technology sector has one of the lowest average tax rates in the S&P 500, at 20.9 percent, making Apple's tax rate relatively high, Sacconaghi wrote. \n\"The upshot is that Apple will get both a meaningful earnings boost from a potentially lower tax rate, and has the potential to repatriate 37 percent of its market cap in offshore cash, which is the second highest percentage among the top 25 tech companies,\" Sacconaghi wrote. \nA year ago, Cook told CBS' \"60 Minutes\" he would \"love to\" repatriate Apple's overseas cash, but he thought the 40 percent tax rate was unreasonable, backward and awful . In the interim, he's faced what he's called \"political crap\" abroad, including a more than $14 billion tax bill from the European Commission . China \nPerhaps the most high-profile effect of Trump's election on Apple has been a backlash from China, after a state-backed newspaper warned that \" iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback \" if Trump carried out his promised 45 percent tariffs on trade. \nApple's supplier dossier lists about 350 addresses in China, where some of its most high-profile partners, like Foxconn, are located. China is also key to the company's promise to return to growth next year. \"Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world.\" -Tim Cook, Apple CEO \nOn top of that, Trump has vowed to shred the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed trade agreement that the Internet Association has said is \"a move in the right direction\" for technology companies. \nAdams Lee, an international trade lawyer at Harris Moure, said Trump may have overextended what he can do under the law. While there is some executive authority for emergency tariffs, they are targeted and specific. Lee said Apple could argue that such targeting was an abuse of executive authority. \nEven without Trump's new policies, Apple has challenges in China. Jinjin Wang, Asia Telecom analyst, told UBS that domestic brands are softening demand for iPhones there. Revenue fell 30 percent from a year ago in the fourth quarter in Greater China, Apple's third-biggest market behind Europe and the U.S. \nNikkei Asian Review reported that Apple may explore production in the United States, citing a source. Still, Cook is renowned for his ability to secure Apple's supply chain — and find the best talent around the world — in even the most challenging circumstances. Encryption \nThe case for strong encryption is one of Apple's most impassioned stances — and one Trump has decried. While much of his key law enforcement staff are pro-surveillance, it's not clear whether Apple will face the blowback Trump promised. \nTrump called for a boycott of Apple products earlier this year , after Apple refused to comply with a court order to de-encrypt a terrorists' iPhone for the FBI . Trump's pick for Attorney General, Jeff Sessions , also argued that government must have access to the phone , saying it was \"a more serious issue than Tim Cook understands.\"' \nOthers within Trump's new administration are more tempered on the issue. \nRep. Mike Pompeo, nominated for new CIA director, has called the use of strong encryption in personal communications a \" red flag \" — though he also said that a backdoor mandate would do little good. Michael Flynn, tapped as national security adviser, supported the Digital Security Commission Act , whose sponsors supported a commission to examine cases like Apple's. show chapters <p>Internet Association: Want to work with the White House on internet, encryption</p> <p>Michael Beckerman, Internet Association President &amp; CEO, discusses his association&#039;s open letter to President-elect Donald Trump to protect internet regulations and technology encryption.</p> Wednesday, 16 Nov 2016 | 11:19 AM ET | 01:54 \nWhile the president may set the tone for an administration's take on encryption, even the Obama administration had independent agencies advocating on both sides of the issue, said Sophia Cope, a staff attorney on the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \n\"No one knows what the heck that Trump is going to do,\" Cope said. \"To the extent that he feels that weakening encryption is an important policy goal for him, he's going to find a way to do that. Senators [Dianne] Feinstein and [Richard] Burr had proposed an encryption bill. He could find supporters in Congress to outline legislation that would find back doors. .... A lot of people would fight that. We would fight that. Even in the case of a statute passed by Congress, there are avenues of legal challenge.\" Immigration \nIf Trump's wavering campaign rhetoric is any indication, it's still unclear if Apple's immigrant-heavy workforce will face more scrutiny during his presidency. But Sessions' views indicate that Apple may have to fight to protect foreign workers. \nAs The Wall Street Journal points out, there's no longer mention of visas for highly skilled foreign workers — H1-B visas — on Trump's website, after the candidate made conflicting remarks on his support for the program. But there's no mincing words from Sessions, who as attorney general would help enforce immigration law : \n\"We need to create jobs for Americans first before we bring in foreign workers to take those jobs,\" Sessions testified in 2014. \nApple was among the top 10 employers of the H-1B temporary program, holding nearly 2 percent, or about 23,000, of the certified employees this fiscal year, according to the Department of Labor website . Technologists are by far the most popular category for this type of visa. \nWhile Cook hasn't made direct comments about the issue, Alphabet's Eric Schmidt has defended the use of foreign labor and called for reform of the program, arguing that if the U.S. kicks out out American-educated engineers, \" they go and build competitors to our companies .\" \n\"Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love,\" Cook said in a post-election memo. \nStill, the 65,000 cap on H-1B visas is mandated by Congress, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website , and high-skilled immigration reform is not clearly divided along party lines. \nFor example, the Employ American Workers Act , which prevents a company from displacing U.S. workers when hiring H-1B specialty occupation workers if the company received funds through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, was signed by President Barack Obama and co-sponsored by liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio has sponsored a bipartisan bill raising the cap on H1-B visas. \n\"Trump's stance towards tightening H1-B visas could negatively impact the company in the near term, given Apple and other companies in the Valley is a hotbed for technology developers,\" Ives said. \"That said, Apple is in a position of strength around R&D and developer talent worldwide, so while they would have to slightly pivot on their hiring around H1-B visas if Trump went down the path, it would not have a long-lasting impact to their model.\" ",

      "text": "iPhone 8 concept. Apple recently launched its latest flagship iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. However, everyone already seems to be talking about the next model.\nThere is a lot of speculation regarding the next flagship that is taking the rounds especially given the fact that Apple will celebrating its 10 th anniversary with iPhone 8 and the company is planning a major design and speculations overhaul with the launch of the same.\nKGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that the company will especially be focusing on improving the camera features with the iPhone 8. According to him, Apple will be opting for a dual optical image stabilization along with a significantly upgraded telephoto lens and dual OIS.\n‘We believe Apple will add OIS function to the telephoto CCM in order to enhance the selling points of new year’s new iPhone. We think photo quality and optical zoom range may both improve as a result,’ Kuo said.\n‘We expect the telephoto lens will be redesigned to support OIS in the telephoto CCM, with challenges likely coming from: 1) the need to increase the image circle of the telephoto lens, which will lead to longer calibration time and a more complex assembly processes, 2) a redesign of the telephoto lens, as an increased image circle will result in degraded photo quality around the corner,’ he added.\nIf rumors are believed to be true, Apple is planning on launching 3 different iPhone models next year. There is a speculation that Apple may introduce a new 5.8-inch iPhone featuring OLED display as default.",

      "text": "Josh Edelson | AFP | Getty Images Apple CEO Tim Cook (L) shows dancer Maddie Ziegler (R) a new iPhone during a product demonstration at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California on September 07, 2016. Even tech companies with a commitment to boosting the diversity of their workforce are finding gains hard to come by. \nA case in point is Apple . \nThe iPhone maker released new data Monday night showing that the company's highest ranks remain even more white and male than the company as a whole. \nJust 20 of Apple's top 107 executives are women, according to a government filing, while only five are from underrepresented minority groups (defined as black, Hispanic/Latino, Native American or Hawaiian/Pacific Islander). Another 14 executives are Asian, while the remaining 88 are white. \nThose numbers are roughly unchanged from a year ago. \nMore from Recode: \nAmazon has big plans to expand its online tickets business \nTrump's FCC transition team may spell the end of net neutrality \nApple doesn't need to make routers. What it needs is a new way to stand out. \n\nIn the next layer of management, women made up 27 percent of the workforce. More than 65 percent of those managers and mid-level executives are white, 23 percent are Asian, with just 11 percent from underrepresented minority groups and 1 percent who define themselves as multiracial. As with the executive ranks, those numbers are little different than they were in 2015. \nThe data is included in a form known as the EEO-1, which companies must file with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. \nEven while publicly sharing the data, Apple has said that the EEOC data doesn't reflect how the company itself breaks down its workforce, and is not the way it measures its diversity progress. \nIn August, Apple released its last public numbers, noting that 32 percent of its workforce was female and 22 percent of employees were from underrepresented minorities. The numbers, which represented slight increases from 2015, reflect global hiring for women, and only the U.S. with regard to underrepresented minorities. \nIn terms of new hires, Apple's figures were higher than its workforce as a whole, with 37 percent being women and 27 percent being from underrepresented minorities. (The data used for both the EEOC and Apple's companywide diversity report covers the same time period.) \nBut if Apple's gains are small, at least it's moving in the right direction. \nMicrosoft , by contrast, released figures last week showing that the overall number of women at the company dropped in 2016 for the second year in a row. Microsoft blamed layoffs in its phone unit for the decline. The total number of black and Latino employees at Microsoft did go up compared to last year, but just barely. \nAnd at least Microsoft and Apple continue to share their data. While many tech companies started sharing diversity reports several years ago, many have yet to offer updates this year, and fewer still have shared this year's EEO-1 filing. \nThe EEOC, meanwhile, has used aggregate data to highlight that whites, men and Asians are overrepresented in high-tech jobs, while women, blacks and Latinos are less present in the high-tech industry than in the workforce as a whole. \nWhile Apple is ahead of many peers in its percentage of women, and a leader in terms of employing underrepresented minorities, it has not been immune to criticism. Earlier this year, reports from Mic and Gizmodo raised allegations that some corners of Apple were home to a significantly sexist culture. \nIn an exclusive interview with Recode, Apple HR chief Denise Young Smith said the incidents described in the articles didn't reflect the Apple she knows, but that the company did investigate, adding that \"commensurate actions have been taken.\" Such actions can range from an informal conversation to dismissal, and Apple didn't disclose what actions it took.\nHere is Apple's 2016 form: And for comparison purposes, here is the 2015 form: And the one from 2014: — By Ina Fried, Recode.net . \n\nCNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.",

      "text": "Holiday shoppers looking for a bargain on Apple gadgets may not have to turn to third-party retailers this Black Friday. On its website, the company is teasing a one-day sales event set to take place Nov. 25, prompting Apple fans to “save the date.”\nApple has not yet revealed which items will be on sale, but the Apple Watch is prominently displayed on the page. Shoppers ordering in-stock items through Apple’s website before 5 p.m. this Friday will also be eligible for free two-day delivery, the company says.\nApple didn’t offer any Black Friday specials last year. In previous years, it bundled iTunes gift cards with certain purchases made on the shopping holiday. The teaser for this year’s event hints at deals that may include discounts on specific gadgets rather than just gift cards. It’s unclear whether the deals will be online only or in-store as well, but the teaser page says to “Come back this Friday to check everyone off your list.”\nApple’s Black Friday announcement comes as the company may be looking to boost sales around the holidays. Apple’s latest earnings results marked the third consecutive quarter in which year-over-year revenue had declined. And although Apple sold more iPhones than expected in the previous quarter, iPhone shipments fell by 5%, as CNBC notes .\nRetailers such as Target , Best Buy , and Walmart have already started promoting their Black Friday bargains on Apple products , including deals on Macs, iPhones, iPads, and the Apple Watch.",

      "text": "Apple, Intel, and Amazon: What's New in the Tech Sector? PART 4 OF 6 What Is Facebook Getting in This Startup Buyout? By Rachel Gunter | Nov 21, 2016 9:08 pm EST Potential upset for Snapchat Facebook ( FB ) is acquiring FacioMetrics, a specialist in facial image analysis. The financial details of the deal weren’t disclosed. However, the facial recognition technology that FacioMetrics is bringing on board could have multiple applications within the Facebook ecosystem, one of them being a competitive weapon against rival Snapchat. Since Snapchat turned down Facebook’s buyout offer of ~$3 billion, the two companies have been going neck and neck in trying to appealing to social media photo and video enthusiasts. Facebook could just use FacioMetrics to entice Snapchat users to any of its digital platforms and roil the waters for Snapchat as the company prepares to go public next year. How would investors react to a report that Snapchat’s user base is shrinking just as it prepares for an IPO? Facebook could be thinking along those lines to upset a rival that rejected its buyout overtures and forced it to acquire WhatsApp instead. Snapchat has ~300 million monthly active users. Boosting platform engagement Snapchat has a feature that enables its users to manipulate images, allowing them to express themselves more creatively and engage more deeply on the disappearing photo app. Facebook could bring such a feature to Instagram, WhatsApp, or its main app to encourage users to spend more time on those platforms. That would be important for the company’s goal of wooing more advertisers, given that rivals Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Twitter ( TWTR ), and LinkedIn ( LNKD ) have stepped up their competition for ad dollars. Monetizing WhatsApp As Facebook ( FB ) has avoided selling ads on WhatsApp, it could use facial recognition technology from FacioMetrics to make the app more attractive for paid business-to-customer communication. For instance, FacioMetrics’s image analysis tool could be used by businesses to measure audience reaction to the videos and images they share on WhatsApp. Facebook has been trying to pitch WhatsApp as a business communication tool and recently added secure video calling on the app to make it more appealing for face-to-face conversation between a business and its customers. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"FB\",\"TWTR\",\"LNKD\",\"GOOGL\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Facebook Inc\",\"Twitter Inc.\",\"Linkedin Corporation\",null]}",

      "text": "Is Apple indirectly acknowledging the grotesque nature of the first ever iPhone without a headphone jack in tow , pleading for holiday shoppers to look beneath the surface? Probably not, and Tim Cook would not take kindly to the 2-in-1 iPad Pro tablet line being likened to Frankenstein’s monster either.\nTo be perfectly frank (pun intended), we’re not sure exactly what Frankie, aka Mary Shelley’s literary creature, has to do with iDevices. Or the heartwarming holiday season. But often, when it comes to publicity stunts not involving silly celebrity cameos , Cupertino will try to randomly link a generic social message, corny music and/or cheesy short story to its always popular gadgets.\nThis time, the not-very-subtle “subtext” of Apple’s early Christmas commercial is “open your heart to everyone”, with gentle giant Brad Garrett of “Everybody Loves Raymond” fame playing, well, a gentle giant looking all frightening on the outside while wishing nothing more than to express his warm and fuzzy feelings inside to a non-torch-wielding mob.\nIt turns out a couple of strategically-placed colored light bulbs, a few clumsily-carried “Home for the Holidays” lyrics, and a courageous and helpful little girl are all a monster needs to earn social acceptance nowadays. I’m not crying, you’re crying!\n\nThe post Apple’s latest tear-jerking holiday commercial asks you to ‘open your heart’ to monsters appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "\nIn a surprise move, Apple has decided to offer some Black Friday 2016 deals and discounts on their products. The giant gadget and tech company teased an ad on Tuesday morning (above) that told shoppers to “save the date” on Friday. Although no details have yet been given on what they’ll put up for sale, Apple did mention in the advertisement that you’d be able to “check everyone off your list” for holiday shopping.\nOne clue they offer is that there’s a picture of an Apple Watch, which is certainly a product they’d like to sell for the holiday season. Companies like Walmart, Target and Best Buy have already started to offer Black Friday deals on Apple products, so it makes sense that Apple would want to also get onboard.\nThis would be the first time in two years that Apple’s offered their own unique Black Friday discounts. Back in 2014, Apple paired iTunes gift cards with purchases made over the holiday season, but that seems unlikely this time around. Instead, expect good deals on Macbooks, Apple Watches, Apple Watch bands, and more.",

      "text": "Tweet \nBlack Friday is mere days away, and shoppers are preparing to hit the streets and online stores . Big names like Microsoft have already revealed some of the bargains you can snap up, and this year Apple is getting in on the action too. \nApple has traditionally turned its nose up at Black Friday, but the lure of shifting a few extra units by lopping off a few dollars seems to have been too great this year. The company's Black Friday special offer site is up and running, but it's a bit of a tease at the moment. \nThe page for the 'one day shopping event' gives little away. It says 'Friday can't come soon enough', but the image of an Apple Watch certainly implies that there will be savings to be made on the smartwatch at the end of the week. So what else can we expect? \nApple is usually rather mean when it comes to cutting prices, so we're unlikely to see much -- if anything -- lopped off iPhone, iPad or MacBooks. It would appear that cheaper devices like the Apple Watch could be discounted. As an added bonus, the page lets us know that any orders placed before 5pm on Friday will qualify for free two-day delivery. \nSo… perhaps don't get your hopes up too high, but if you're in the market for an Apple Watch you might be in luck. We could also see savings on accessories, and it would be surprising if gift cards and apps weren't also in line for a bit of a price snip.",

      "text": "If you’re hoping to get some deals on Apple products on Black Friday, the company might have you covered.\nApple has published a new page on its website teasing a Black Friday shopping event. Details are slim at the moment, but the company said on the page that it will be for one day only. The deals will apparently be available both online and in stores. Apple also sent an e-mail to customers on Tuesday with the same hints but no mention of deals.\nApple has always had a hot-and-cold relationship with Black Friday. For several years, the company would offer special deals on the hardware and accessories it sold online and in its stores. However, those deals were widely panned by critics who argued they were hardly deals at all. In years past, for instance, Apple has offered $100 off on Macs that cost thousands of dollars. The company has also offered gift cards with the purchase of a full-priced device.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nLast year, Apple sat out of the Black Friday festivities. The company’s senior vice president of retail Angela Ahrendts said at the time it wouldn’t offer any Black Friday promotions because “ being good to your employees will always be good for your business .” Ahrendts added she had hoped other retailers would “knock off” the Black Friday tradition that sees massive crowds flock to stores across the U.S. The day also requires employees to work long hours--something from which Ahrendts had signaled she’d want to move away.\nFor more, read: Here Are the Best Black Friday Deals for Tech ; Here Are the Best Cyber Monday Deals for Tech \nHowever, Fortune on Tuesday called Apple AAPL retail stores across the U.S. and found that many will have special hours on Black Friday. While Apple will keep its stores closed on Thanksgiving, unlike many retailers, its brick-and-mortar locations will have extended hours on Black Friday. Many stores that regularly open at 10 a.m. on Fridays will open their doors at 8 a.m. on Black Friday. They’ll also be open a bit later, with one store saying it will be open until 10 p.m. that day--30 minutes later than normal.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nIt’s unclear what made Apple change its mind about Black Friday. The company did not immediately respond for a request for comment on the move. But it appears that Apple will this year rejoin other retailers and offer deals and extended hours on one of the year’s biggest shopping days.\nIf you’re interested in seeing other deals offered on Apple products by third-party retailers, click here .",

      "title": "Can Salesforce Sustain Its Growth?",
      "text": "Apple, Intel, and Amazon: What's New in the Tech Sector? PART 2 OF 6 Can Salesforce Sustain Its Growth? By Rachel Gunter | Nov 21, 2016 9:08 pm EST Revenue and earnings beat in fiscal 3Q17 Salesforce ( CRM ) reported a 25.3% year-over-year (or YoY) growth in revenue to $2.14 billion for the September quarter, which is its fiscal 3Q17, handily beating the consensus estimate that called for revenue of $2.12 billion. Adjusted EPS (earnings per share) for the quarter came in at $0.24, ahead of the consensus of $0.21. Without excluding certain items in its bottom line calculation, Salesforce saw a net loss of $37.3 million, equivalent to its EPS loss of $0.05 for the latest quarter. The loss widened from $25.2 million, or $0.04 per share, a year earlier. With that, it appears that Salesforce’s revenue growth is coming at a serious cost to the bottom line. So, is Salesforce’s top line growth sustainable? Battling stiff competition Salesforce offers enterprises a cheaper way of connecting with and pitching to customers. However, its rivals have mastered this business strategy and are threatening to wreak havoc. For instance, Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Oracle ( ORCL ) have recently become aggressive in marketing their cloud alternatives to Salesforce. This is causing Salesforce to spend huge amounts of money on acquisitions, partly to grow revenue and mainly to stave off competition. Both goals are eating into the company’s bottom line. Even in its acquisition, competitors are not allowing Salesforce enough breathing space. Microsoft edged out Salesforce in the race to acquire LinkedIn ( LNKD ), and Salesforce later departed from a path that would have seen it acquire Twitter ( TWTR ). However, Salesforce seems to be taking the competitive pressure in stride. The company has continued to grow its revenue at a double-digit rate despite stiff competition. Moreover, Salesforce said its deferred revenue rose 23% to $3.5 billion in fiscal 3Q17, and the company has provided an upbeat revenue outlook for the current quarter. It is expecting its current quarter revenue to range from $2.27 billion–$2.28 billion, while the consensus estimate calls for revenue of $2.24 billion. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"CRM\",\"LNKD\",\"MSFT\",\"ORCL\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"salesforce.com, inc.\",\"Linkedin Corporation\",\"Microsoft Corporation\",\"Oracle Corporation\"]} X",

      "text": "Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.03% will offer discounts on some products and free two-day delivery on Black Friday. In an ad scant with details posted to its website late Monday, the company announced a \"one-day shopping event\" for Friday, Nov. 25. Apple does not say what products will be included in the daily deals, but the photo on the ad specifically features Apple Watch, while links to other \"holiday gift collections\" range from devices to music and photography. It even offers a slew of games and toys, such as small plastic robots. It's unclear whether the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7S will be included, though the company has offered holiday deals on devices on past Black Friday events. Shares of Apple traded flat around $111.72 on Tuesday morning. They're risen 3% in the past three months, virtually in line with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DIA, +0.18% but have underperformed on the year, declining by more than 6% while the index has increased by 6%. Last month, Apple reported its first ever annual decline in iPhone sales .",

      "text": "Republish this article \nRepublish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons licence. \nThe Apple rumour mill is spinning with gossip that the company is reportedly developing and testing a set of augmented reality glasses. There’s little we know for certain about the plans, and the firm has reportedly not made a final decision about whether to commit to releasing a “smart glasses” product. But Apple has been enthusiastically recruiting engineers with expertise in both augmented and virtual reality . \nThere is strong speculation that any new wearable device from Apple will integrate with an iPhone and need one to operate, just as the Apple Watch does. Another rumour suggests Apple will add augmented reality capabilities to its iPhone camera so that it could recognise objects it filmed, including people’s faces. This raises the question of whether Apple would develop an additional wearable device that risked cannibalising a technology built into its flagship product. \nBut if the rumours of Apple’s smart glasses are true, there is plenty the company could learn from previous, largely unsuccessful attempts to make a head-mounted augmented reality display. When Google announced it was ceasing sales of its own Google Glass spectacles, some saw it as the start of a new phase of product development while others pronounced it a failure. Privacy problems \nSome of the key reasons why Glass was ultimately unsuccessful related to concerns about privacy and security. And there is little or no evidence those concerns have lessened in the last few years. With increasing numbers of reports about cameras being hijacked by hackers , fraudsters and even blackmailers , any new smart glasses could be seen as a window into our world for criminals. \nThere would certainly be doubts about giving a corporation direct access to what we see with our own eyes. Trust will be a key issue, and is still low between corporations and the public . As even the iPhone is no longer the legendary unhackable device it was once seen as, Apple would need to fundamentally boost consumer trust and confidence for it to win customers over. \nOther reasons cited for the failure of similar products included cost, limited battery life, our attachment to mobile phones and unwearable design. Alongside smartphones, virtual reality headsets, smart watches and so on, smart glasses may be one gadget too many, especially as Apple entry level prices are still high for many consumers. Consumers have also been bruised by under-performing and even dangerous batteries, and smart glasses would be another device that drains the iPhone and needs its own charging. \nIn terms of design, many users ditched Google Glass because it was a long way from being seen as cool. Apple’s product will need to be something we actually want to wear when we are on pubic view. The company may do well to root a new spectacle product in the functional minimalism of its smartphone and tablet ranges. Yet while that design ethos has lifted Apple to the number one spot in the last decade, those designs are now also being seen as becoming too safe and repetitive. Microsoft Hololens: who cares how it looks when it works? Microsoft \nMicrosoft is taking another tack with its HoloLens . In contrast to Google Glass, the device opts for an overtly tech look, an unashamedly prosthetic, even cyborg device. As a result, early reviews of the Hololens look past fashion design towards its potential for radical disruption. \nThere may be another more fundamental difficulty for Apple, however. Some commentators are suggesting current augmented reality technology is still too difficult for us to physically interact with . Apple would have to convince users that their new glasses are easy to use and will not lead us into brick walls or awkward interactions with family, colleagues, friends and strangers. \nAll this is important because Apple has been trading on long-past acts of creativity for years now. Judged by the mixed reaction to the Apple Watch, it’s not yet clear that wearables can change this situation or that a new set of smart glasses will represent a genuine disruption. There’s a chance that attempting to succeed with augmented reality will be seen as another “me-too” behaviour for the company. \nYet if Hololens or other products help augmented reality’s day to arrive sooner, and if Apple gets things right in terms of design, user experience, confidence and trust, it could be a breakthrough for the company.",

      "text": "Apple's diversity numbers haven't moved much in a year The company's leadership is still overwhelmingly white and male. Share Save \nIt's been a year where tech companies have been pledging their fealty to the concept of diversity , but backed that up with very little action. Recode has unearthed a document that Apple sent to America's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that might as well have been an A4 print-out of a \"¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.\" For all the talk, the company is still miles away from achieving parity between its white, male executives and everyone else. In fact, only 20 out of Apple's 107 top executives are women, and only five are defined as coming from an underrepresented minority. \nIn the firm's defense, remedying years (or decades) of lax employment practices doesn't happen overnight. These businesses are more like ocean liners than go-carts, and you can't simply fire hundreds of employees to make room. But earlier this year, Apple showed that it was hopeful for the future by revealing that the number of women and minorities that it hires as new entrants is increasing year on year . Whether the company has also worked to deal with its apparently toxic corporate culture is another story altogether.",

      "text": "The quality of Apple’s iOS is being called into question, this time because of a bug that is crashing iPhones when the user watches a certain video on them. Some Reddit users shared details about the new bug in a post yesterday.\n\nCrashing iPhones thanks to an MP4 An MP4 video causes this latest bug; all a user needs to do to have their iPhone crash is watch it. Having tested this bug on multiple iPhones, we can tell you that watching it will crash iPhones running on iOS 5 and above. In fact, it will even crash iPhones running on the iOS 10.2 beta. However, every one of the crashing iPhones was quickly brought back into a working state.\nHow to fix the problem As a precaution, we’re not going to publish a link to the video. However, should you watch it, here’s how to recover your device.\nThe solution is a simple one; all you have to do is a hard reset. So on devices older than the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus , that means long-pressing the power button and the home buttons at the same time. However, if you’re an owner of the latest-generation iPhone, you can’t solve this problem like this.\nApple removed the mechanical home button in the iPhone 7, so to recover a crashed iPhone 7, you need to long-press the power button and the downwards volume button at the same time.\n\nWhat causes the crash? As we mentioned earlier, we’re not going to share the video or file that’s crashing iPhones. But if someone sends you a message via iMessage asking you to watch a file named IMG_0942.mp4, DO NOT WATCH IT . This is the file name of the video we’ve been talking about which has resulted in crashing iPhones, and apparently, crashing iPads too.\nThe crash happens when the video is viewed via the Safari browser. It takes between 15 and 30 seconds for a user to realize that something is wrong with their device. No one knows why this happens, and even Apple has yet to comment on the problem officially.\nThe above video by Everything Apple Pro talks about the effects seen by iOS users who have experienced crashing iPhones due to this bug, but it fails to shed any light on why the bug exists and how it is causing the crashes. There’s a chance that this is just a prank gone wrong. According to Anthony Vanover, a commenter on 9to5Mac, the reason could be as follows:\n“I inspected the video file in 010 Editor. There’s an extra structure at the end of the file with no defined size. In fact, the entire structure is just “0D 0A”. That is, it’s a carriage return and line feed, but a video player may try to interpret it as the size of the current structure which, in this case, is 3338 (unsigned integer) which is larger than the end of the file itself.\n“I suspect this structure was put there by accident and that there’s a bug in the Safari web browser.”\nOther reports of crashing iPhones This isn’t the only time crashing iPhones and iPads have been reported due to a bug. Earlier this year, another Safari bug wreaked havoc, causing Apple’s devices to crash . In 2015, there was a bug that caused crashing iPhones, Apple Watches, iPads and Macs. So while Apple’s system may be tighter than Android when it comes to malware and viruses, obviously it can fall victim to stray code now and then.\nWe don’t know when Apple will address this. However, should enough people report the problem, we’ll probably hear something soon. In the meantime, if you receive a link or file you weren’t expecting, be extra vigilant. The best advice we can give is if you’re not expecting something, don’t click or open it.\n\nThe post This 5-Second Video Is Crashing iPhones: How To Recover If You Watched It appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "0 comments \nWhen Apple announced that their new line of MacBook Pros were going to have a touch bar that would adjust itself per the need of the program that’s currently active, people were skeptical yet interested. It seemed like a fascinating concept that would allow for greater control of your work, such as in Photoshop, iMovie, ProTools, etc… But what if you could run a program directly through the touch bar itself? \nYouTuber diffractive – b3ll tested that out and found that, yes, you can in fact run a program through that bar, although it looks rather ridiculous. Case in point, he ran the 1993 sci-fi/horror FPS classic Doom through the bar and played it at some ridiculously wide resolution. I saw one YouTube comment suggest that it was 21:9, although we all know how reliable those comments are. \nTo be completely honest, I can barely make heads or tails as to what’s going on in the touch bar. I recognize when a door opens but that’s really about it. If someone manages to beat the entire game using that screen, then I’ll be very impressed!",

The company sold close to 2.5 million units during those 12 months and is looking at services such as Apple Music to woo more users to buy into its ecosystem as it struggles to expand its 3 per cent market share. \nBoth Ola and Apple did not agree to reveal the financials of the deal. An Ola spokesperson, however, said the integration with its new Ola Play platform will mutually benefit both companies, bringing more riders to Ola and giving users a taste of Apple's service. \nLast year Apple launched its music streaming service on Android devices, the first Apple product to come to Google's mobile operating system. In India, the company launched the service at a subsidised price of Rs 120 (approx $2) for an individual subscription and Rs 190 (approx $3) for a family subscription to take on local rivals such as Gaana and Saavn. \nThis fee is far lower than what Apple charges customers in the US for instance where Apple Music is priced at $9.99 and $14.99. Analysts said the move was in line with Apple giving Indian users a taste of its service to the millions of Android users here, owing to 94 per cent of all smartphones in the country running on Android and hoping that they upgrade to a more expensive iPhone. \nApple's efforts to locally produce and sell low-cost refurbished models has been snubbed by the Indian government and is hoping that it would engage with premium customers by opening its Apple stories in the country. \nThe US tech giant's partnership with Ola comes on the back of the US tech giant's $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing, a partner and investor in Ola, in May. The company is riding on Ola's new in-car entertainment platform Ola Play, which was unveiled at an event in Bengaluru on Tuesday. \n\"Music is at the heart of every car ride and we've designed music to be at the heart of Ola Play. We've worked with none other than Apple Music to create a unique experience. It's very different and much better than the experience you have in your own car,\" said Bhavish Aggarwal, co-founder and CEO of Ola. \nOla has said that it will install multimedia tablets in every one of its cabs which will give customers access to audio and video streaming services such as Apple Music and Sony Liv, hoping to get their loyalty in its fight with Uber. The company has partnered with Qualcomm to power the hardware that will go into each of the cars and will be able to control in-car functions in the future. \nCar manufacturer Mahindra and Mahindra which has already signed a deal with Ola to sell 40,000 cars to drivers on Ola's platform, said it will take the integration further in future models. Apart from its partners, Ola said its open platform will allow other developers to build their services into its cabs, giving them access to millions of customers. \nOla claims it does over a million rides a day with an average travel time of 60 minutes, giving developers who jump onto its platform huge access to consumer time. However, the company did not disclose whether it would earn revenue through its partnerships. \nUber in the US had partnered with Apple's rival Spotify in November 2014 to allow customers control music within the car. \n\"The opportunity our country and Ola has is to make this leapfrog this traditional paradigm of car ownership and move to ridesharing.

      "text": "Apple may replace your iPhone 6s battery for free \nThe company has issued a recall for certain devices By Peter Hess posted Nov 22nd, 2016 at 10:34am \nPixabay Creative Commons \nA number of iPhone 6s devices made between September and October 2015 are eligible for a free battery replacement \nHas your iPhone 6s suddenly powered down, even though it had a full battery? If so, it's worth checking with Apple to find out whether you're eligible for a free replacement battery. \nThis week, the company announced that a limited number of devices, manufactured between September and October 2015, may shut down unexpectedly. \"If you have experienced this issue,\" reads the statement on their website, \"please visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider and have your device's serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a battery replacement, free of charge.\" \nApple emphasized that this is not a safety issue, unlike the recent Samsung Galaxy 7 recall , which was due to exploding batteries. So if you've been having power issues with your phone, talk to Apple support online or swing by a retail store to find out if you're eligible. Tags:",

      "text": "\nApple is getting in on the Black Friday craze.\nThe tech giant this week teased out a “one-day shopping event,” noting that “Friday can’t come soon enough” at its website . It’s unclear which products will be offered, but the tease page shows off an Apple Watch.\nCustomers will qualify for free two-day shipping if they order in-stock items by 5 p.m. Friday. Apple also encourages people to download the Apple Store app “for the fastest way to shop our one-day event.” Some physical Apple Stores will be open for extended hours.\nThis is a shift from last year, when Apple didn’t offer any deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.\nApple’s latest quarterly results posted last month show a continued decline in iPhone sales, which fell to 45.5 million units from 48 million units in the same period a year ago. The company is reportedly expecting a strong holiday season as its largest rival, Samsung, deals with the aftermath of its Galaxy Note 7 discontinuation .",

      "text": "Of all the operating profit generated from smartphone sales in the third quarter of this year, Apple received 91 percent of it, according to a report out today from research firm Strategy Analytics. \nApple’s operating profit for the quarter came out to $8.5 billion out of a total of $9.4 billion, with Huawei, Vivo, and Oppo trailing behind the Cupertino company, Strategy Analytics said in a statement on the report. No other company brought in more than 2.5 percent of operating profit. In other words, if the data were charted out, it would look like a very long tail.\nThe 91 percent factoid is certainly a positive indicator after three consecutive quarters of iPhone sales decreases, which have resulted in sales decreases for Apple as a whole. \nApple unveiled the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus during the third quarter. Those phones start at $649, yet they cost $224.80 to build, according to IHS Markit . Apple has not yet provided sales figures for its new iPhones.\nBeyond smartphones, Apple has faced criticism for its refreshed MacBook Pro partly because it’s so expensive — the least expensive model costs $1,499, and Touch Bar models begin at $1,799. \n",

      "text": "Comment The Roku Express is cheap but offer a wide selection of apps. Twitter \nThe options for television streaming are becoming more varied, and depending on your budget and need, there are several options for you to choose from. If before, one needed to shell out at least $100 for a TV streaming device, nowadays $30 is enough to get you one. \nIf you are planning to purchase a TV streaming device or service for the holidays, here's a guide for you to help in your choices. \nWhat makes devices differ from each other is the ease of access to videos and apps. There are devices that have voice features, but on-screen menus still require a remote to navigate. \nChromecast is one an exception to this, as with Chromecast you begin with a video from your iPhone or Android and cast it to the screen by tapping a button. \nRoku has an almost complete app library, with only iTunes missing from its roster. If you want to access iTunes, you'll need an Apple TV for that. \nAmazon's Fire TV does not have iTunes, ABC, Vudu, Freeform, and Google Play. \nApple TV has an extensive app selection as well, but it does not have direct access to Amazon, Google Play, Playstation Vue and Vudu. \nA subscription to these services is still required, as the device only allows playback on big screens. \nLow-range Price \nThe Roku Express is the cheapest at $30, but expect a slower interface and no remote. But it's the best choice if you are looking for an entry level device which offers a wide app selection. \nNext on the list is the Chromecast, which will cost you $35, very affordable for its price, but you will not get a remote. \nLast for the entry level devices is Amazon's Fire TV Stick. At $40, a voice remote is included and Alexa assistant queries on various information. \nMid-range price \nMi Box by Xiaomi is an Android device that will cost you $69. With that price, you can watch 4K videos, but of course, your TV must support 4K. So far some Netflix and Youtube videos offer 4K resolution. \nChromecast Ultra by Google will cost you $69 also, and it also supports 4K and HDR. \nThe Roku Premiere is the priciest of the bunch, at $80, but the problem is it has no voice support. You can get a Fire TV for $90 that has a voice remote and can support 4K. \nFor those who has more money to shell out, the choices are the Roku Premium Plus ($100) and the Roku Ultra ($130). Both devices have 4K and HDR, and you can the headphone jack in both remotes in case you want to watch but everyone in the house is already sleeping. \nApple TV starts at $149 and is great for those who want to do more than just watch as there are many apps that you can access through iTunes.

Ola co-founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal announced Ola Play at a news conference in Bangalore, India, on Tuesday. (/Manjunath Kiran / Agence-France Presse) Tracey Lien \nApple may have scrapped its plans to build self-driving cars , but if its recent deal with Indian ride-hailing firm Ola is anything to go by, the tech giant’s auto industry ambitions are far from over. \nOla, India’s largest ride-hailing company, announced Tuesday that it is partnering with Apple to offer Apple Music as part of the in-car experience. The firm, which also announced partnerships with Sony, Qualcomm and Audio Compass, said the service will be made available in some of its vehicles as part of a platform called Ola Play. When passengers book an Ola ride, they will be able to interact with an in-car tablet to control the vehicle’s air conditioning, music, watch videos and even read ebooks. \n“Cars were initially built for the driver,” Ola Chief Executive Bhavish Agarwal said during a news conference reported on by India media outlet YourStory . “But with ride-sharing, the control needs to be there for the passenger, and Ola Play works along that.\" \nThe partnership is similar to a 2014 deal between Uber and Spotify , in which Uber passengers were given control of the car’s music through the Spotify app on their smartphone. \nBut analysts were quick to note that this is the second overseas ride-hailing company that Apple has either invested in or partnered with, suggesting that the Cupertino company may have plans to develop software or services for ride-hailing companies or even automakers. \n“Apple invested $1 billion in [Chinese ride-hailing giant] Didi, so it has access to all their data. Now Apple will have access to Ola’s Apple Music data,” said Grayson Brulte, president of technology consulting firm Brulte and Co. “So you start to put the pieces together. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Apple try to gather all the data in the food chain.\" \nWhat Apple might do with this data is anyone’s guess. The notoriously secretive company did not immediately responded to a request for comment. \nBrulte said it wouldn’t be surprising to see Apple shift from working on self-driving cars to working on the services and interfaces with which drivers and passengers interact. Think: The sleek and simple design of iOS, for cars. \nThe question now is what Apple’s next move might be, as this will be a clearer indicator of what Apple is betting on, Brulte said. \n“What’s the next relationship?” he said. “We’re waiting for the third domino to fall, and when it does, we’ll understand where this is going.\" Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss \nPresident-elect Trump released his first extended remarks since the election in a YouTube video , an Orange County health network is putting doctors in grocery stores , the range and scope of Donald Trump’s business interests are unprecedented , and Kanye West was hospitalized Monday for stress and exhaustion after a bizarre week .

      "title": "Jony Ive in back seat at Apple?",
      "text": "Jony Ive. Getty\nLast fall, Apple Chief Design Officer Jony Ive was asked what he would do if he wasn't designing for Apple.\n\"If I wasn't doing this, I think I would just be drawing or making stuff for friends,\" Ive said during an interview with Charlie Rose. \"Maybe it would just be Christmas tree ornaments, I don't know.\"\nLast Sunday, London hotel Claridge's unveiled its annual Christmas tree installation.\nIt was designed by Ive.\nApple's official company bio says that Ive is \"responsible for all design at Apple, including the look and feel of Apple hardware, user interface, packaging, major architectural projects such as Apple Campus 2 and Apple’s retail stores, as well as new ideas and future initiatives.\"\nBut people who know the company well are starting to suggest that Ive has been taking more of a back-seat role, and may not even be deeply involved in product design anymore, which was where he made his biggest mark on the company.\n\"I've heard that he has lately been checked out or not as directly involved with product design and that he's been largely focused on architecture,\" Apple watcher John Gruber said to Jason Snell , former editor of Macworld, during a podcast last week. Ive is mostly working on the new retail stores and working closely with head of retail Angela Ahrendts, Snell said he's heard.\n(Gruber later clarified on his blog that he did not mean to imply Ive was on his way out, and that Apple sources have told him \" every aspect of every new product remains as much under his watchful eye as ever.\")\nKif Leswing/Business Insider\nThere isn't a whole lot of evidence one way or the other. But a new glossy book taking a look back at Ive's best designs is certainly stoking the speculation.\n\"Criticizing execs is unpopular, but Ive seems stretched thin, burnt out, and bored,\" Apple blogger Marco Arment tweeted . \"I’d love to see some fresh design leadership at Apple.\"\nThe history Rob Price/Business Insider\nDuring Apple's meteoric rise from 2000 to 2011, Ive was at Steve Jobs' side the entire time.\nHe ran Apple's industrial design department, which was empowered to imagine products like the iPhone. Ive often gave concepts to Apple's engineering department, telling them to make the product design possible, which is counter to how industrial design works at other high tech firms.\nIve considered himself to be Jobs' closest friend, and he is still seen as a critical person for the company. His small 20-person design team designed every single one of Apple's iconic products for the last 15 years, from the iPod to the iPhone.\nIf Ive were to retire officially, it could certainly spook investors.\nAfter Jobs' death, it looked as if Ive had received even more responsibility at Apple. He expanded his role from strictly physical industrial design to digital user interface as well.\nThen, in the summer of 2015, Ive received a \"promotion\" to Chief Design Officer. The news was announced in a British newspaper on a bank holiday Monday .\nCook explained the move in a memo to employees, which was leaked and published on 9to5Mac :\n\"As Chief Design Officer, Jony will remain responsible for all of our design, focusing entirely on current design projects, new ideas and future initiatives. On July 1, he will hand off his day-to-day managerial responsibilities of ID and UI to Richard Howarth, our new vice president of Industrial Design, and Alan Dye, our new vice president of User Interface Design.\"\nWhen Ive left, his handpicked lab manager and right-hand man, Harper Alexander, left the group, too — he now does corporate recruiting for Apple.\nMany analysts, like Above Avalon's Neil Cybart, still believe that Ive is one of the most important people at the company. \"With Jony Ive positioned as overseer of Apple design, his influence on Apple's product direction cannot be overstated,\" he wrote earlier this month.\nBut earlier this spring, Apple's iPhone SE launched without a product explanation from Ive, as most previous Apple products received. And he kept a very low profile at the launch event — only one reporter who attended told us he saw Ive, while many others thought he wasn't there.\nIve did contribute voice-overs to the launch of the iPhone 7 and new MacBook Pro this fall. But as many have observed, he did more press, including two interviews, for his new book than he did Apple's latest products.\nIve is certainly keeping a much lower profile than he did before his promotion.\nImpossible to tell SEC\nDespite his clear importance to the company and his role in Apple lore, the company does not list Ive as one of its six most highly compensated executives in SEC documents.\n(Those execs are CEO Tim Cook, CFO Luca Maestri, Ahrendts, online services SVP Eddy Cue, Hardware SP Dan Riccio, and general counsel Bruce Sewell.)\nThe last time Ive was listed on a SEC Form 4, which is required whenever an \"insider\" acquires or disposes of stock, was in 2009 . It said he owned 28,127 shares of Apple stock at the time. (There's been a 7-1 split since then.)\nSimply put, nobody outside Apple knows how much Jony Ive makes — even though we know what the rest of Apple's executive team makes.\nShareholders do not know what Ive makes. It could be massive — or he could already be collecting a nominal salary because he's effectively retired. It's impossible to tell.\nMaking it harder for investors to gain clarity on the situation, Ive has traditionally run a leak-free, extremely secretive ship. Even Snell and Gruber, with their inside Apple sources, realize there is only so much any given Apple employee would know, given that Ive's team has traditionally worked completely apart from the company, especially the software engineering departments.\n(Former Apple exec Scott Forstall, who developed iOS, could not get into Ive's lab with his senior vice president ID card, according to a biography of Ive .)\nThe team was small, at less than 20 members, although it has grown recently and now comprised user interface as well. Few people ever leave the group, although recently Daniel Coster, a long-time member, was wooed to GoPro.\nThis team sits together at lunch, and is fiercely loyal to each other. If anyone knows if Ive is no longer showing up to the shop very often, it's them, and they're not talking — to other Apple employees or the press.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe future? Apple Campus 2 City of Cupertino\nOf course, Ive could just be heads down working on Apple's next big thing, the successor to the iPhone that will ensure the company remains the world's most admired for years to come.\nSnell suggests that the now seemingly back-burnered Apple Car was an Ive passion project. That's certainly plausible. One of the reported goals for the Apple Car project was always to retain top talent who might be bored working on incremental iPhone improvements.\nBut it's much harder to see Ive driving the development behind a pair of smart glasses, or augmented reality , like Apple is currently working on.\nIve told the New Yorker that the face \"was the wrong place\" for technology, for a long profile written in the fall of 2014 just before Apple unveiled the Apple Watch. Ive sounded tired:\n\"He was a few days from starting a three-week vacation, the longest of his career. The past year had been 'the most difficult' he’d experienced since joining Apple, he said later that day, explaining that the weariness I’d sometimes seen wasn’t typical. Since our previous meeting, he’d had pneumonia. 'I just burnt myself into not being very well,' he said.\"\nA Quote: from Steve Jobs' widow in the same profile hinted at a role change as well:\n\"He had discouraged the thought that Newson’s appointment portended his own eventual departure, although when I spoke to Powell Jobs she wondered if 'there might be a way where there’s a slightly different structure that’s a little more sustainable and sustaining.' Comparing the careers of her husband and Ive, she noted that 'very few people ever get to do such things,' but added, 'I do think there’s a toll.'\"\nIve's studio is currently located on the ground floor at 2 Infinite Loop, with a direct passageway to 1 Infinite Loop, where Cook and the rest of his executive team meet weekly.\nWhen Apple moves into its new \"Spaceship\" Campus 2, the industrial design group, which now also includes user interface design, will get the best location on the ring.\nThey'll be on the fourth floor, in a new 30,000 square foot studio. They will have a view across much of Apple's campus. It's a symbol of how important the industrial design group led by Ive has been to Apple.\nWhen the team moves in, will Ive be there, looking at the campus he designed and helped build with them? Or will he be off in England designing retail stores, the Apple car, or Christmas ornaments for friends?\nKnow anything about what Jony Ive is up to these days?

      "text": "Apple may be nostalgic for the bygone days of the flip phone.\nApple has been granted a patent for a flexible iPhone that can fold in half and grip your clothes. This would potentially cut down on the need to stuff devices into pockets.\nWhile Apple often files for patents for technology that never see the light of day, it often provides a glimpse into what the company is thinking for the future.\nThe patent for “flexible display devices” — which was filed in July 2014 — features a touchscreen smartphone with a design popularized by clamshell phones.\nThe patent highlights how screens featuring a flexible OLED display could bend to face each other or fit back-to-back. Additional hinges could accommodate different ways of folding the phone, too. For example, it could bend in thirds instead.\nIt’s unlikely we’ll see a foldable iPhone anytime soon, but flexible screens are in the realm of possibility — and this isn’t the first time Apple has shown interest in them.\nEarlier this month, Apple was granted its first patent for a foldable flip phone — one that opened and closed like a notebook. Instead of a screen, the patent described how “carbon nanotubes” could bend to form the center hinge. Meanwhile, it was awarded a patent for a flexible screen in 2016. It detailed flexible components on an iPhone-like device that could withstand bending, warping or dropping.\nFollowing complaints of faulty flexing phones dubbed “Bendgate,” Apple may be looking for a way to improve the durability of its hardware and better conform to our back pockets.\nOther recent Apple patents include a 360-degree screen that wraps entirely around a phone and smart glasses to rival Google’s failed Glass product.\nAlthough the patent for the latest flexible display illustrates how it could be used with a phone, the language references any “electronic device.”\nIt’s unknown as of now if there is an iPhone flip phone in the works, but there’s certainly an interest in the old school category.\nIn May, Motorola released a flip phone Razr teaser video, which was viewed online more than 6 million in its first week.",

      "text": "Apple's iPad Pro Seems Like A Rip-off Of Microsoft's Surface Pro? [Details Here] By Matt Lawrence , Parent Herald November 22, 04:45 pm Microsoft Surface Pro is leading the trend in two-in-one devices leaving behind Apple's iPad Pro.(Photo : Technology News/YouTube) \nMicrosoft Surface Pro has been quite a successful device and there are sales figures to prove it. The Surface Pro has been an example of a risk that Microsoft has taken according to Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella and now Apple is following the lead with iPad Pro. Advertisement \nA few years ago, questions have been raised as to the usefulness of these so-called two-in-one devices. But the success of Microsoft's Surface Pro has proven that there is a demand in the market for such a device, a demand that Microsoft's fiercest competitor has begun to take notice of. \nApple has just recently launched its iPad Pro device, which they have marketed as a computer. A marketing strategy that has drawn some criticism since it basically contained a mobile OS. Microsoft's Surface Pro, on the other hand, boasts of a full-fledged Windows desktop OS. \nThere seems to be a trend nowadays for these two-in-one devices and Microsoft's Surface Pro seems to be leading the trend. Despite claims from Apple that their iPad Pro was a productivity device it seems to be lagging as some users perceive the tablet to be a glorified iPhone. The Surface Pro has set a standard for portable productivity, that the iPad Pro is struggling to match. I recently purchased a Microsoft Surface 4 Pro. I have not been disappointed. Surface allows me to use Visual Studio easier than my MacBook https://t.co/KJ3wkbUQFZ \n— Jake F Anderson (@AndersonInfoSys) November 17, 2016 \nApple's CEO Tim Cook back in 2012 has mused about hybrid devices having too many trade-offs. In an interview with Australian Financial Review , Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella seemed to throw the same words back at Apple's CEO, by showing how Microsoft's risk with these hybrid devices was a worthy endeavor. \nThe lead that Microsoft has taken with the Surface Pro has created the perception that Apple is ripping off Microsoft's device with their iPad or simply trying hard to take back the tablet market. Apple, however, can take comfort in the fact that their product name has more popularity than Microsoft, in that some customers would often mistakenly call the Surface Pro an iPad.

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple may have scrapped its plans to build self-driving cars, but if its recent deal with Indian ride-hailing firm Ola is anything to go by, the tech giant's auto industry ambitions are far from over.\nOla, India's largest ride-hailing company, announced Tuesday that it is partnering with Apple to offer Apple Music as part of the in-car experience. The firm, which also announced partnerships with Sony, Qualcomm and Audio Compass, said the service will be made available in some of its vehicles as part of a platform called Ola Play. When passengers book an Ola ride, they will be able to interact with an in-car tablet to control the vehicle's air conditioning, music, watch videos and even read e-books.\n\"Cars were initially built for the driver,\" Ola Chief Executive Bhavish Agarwal said during a news conference reported on by India media outlet YourStory. \"But with ride-sharing, the control needs to be there for the passenger, and Ola Play works along that.\"\nThe partnership is similar to a 2014 deal between Uber and Spotify, in which Uber passengers were given control of the car's music through the Spotify app on their smartphone.\nBut analysts were quick to note that this is the second overseas ride-hailing company that Apple has either invested in or partnered with, suggesting that the Cupertino, Calif., company may have plans to develop software or services for ride-hailing companies or even automakers.\n\"Apple invested $1 billion in (Chinese ride-hailing giant) Didi, so it has access to all their data. Now Apple will have access to Ola's Apple Music data,\" said Grayson Brulte, president of technology consulting firm Brulte and Co. \"So you start to put the pieces together. I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple try to gather all the data in the food chain.\"\nWhat Apple might do with this data is anyone's guess. The notoriously secretive company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBrulte said he could see Apple shift from working on self-driving cars to working on the services and interfaces with which drivers and passengers interact. Think: The sleek and simple design of iOS, for cars.\nThe question now is what Apple's next move might be, as this will be a clearer indicator of what Apple is betting on, Brulte said.\n\"What's the next relationship?\" he said. \"We're waiting for the third domino to fall, and when it does, we'll understand where this is going.\"\n(c)2016 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nShare Comment",

Apple has been granted a patent for a flexible iPhone that can fold in half and grip your clothes. This would potentially cut down on the need to stuff devices into pockets. While Apple often files for patents for technology that never see the light of day, it often provides a glimpse into what the company is thinking for the future.\npockets.\nWhile Apple often files for patents for technology that never see the light of day, it often provides a glimpse into what the company is thinking for the future.\nThe patent for “flexible display devices” — which was filed in July 2014 — features a touchscreen smartphone with a design popularized by clamshell phones.\nThe patent highlights how screens featuring a flexible OLED display could bend to face each other or fit back-to-back. Additional hinges could accommodate different ways of folding the phone, too. For example, it could bend in thirds instead.\nIt’s unlikely we’ll see a foldable iPhone anytime soon, but flexible screens are in the realm of possibility — and this isn’t the first time Apple has shown interest in them.\nEarlier this month, Apple was granted its first patent for a foldable flip phone — one that opened and closed like a notebook. Instead of a screen, the patent described how “carbon nanotubes” could bend to form the center hinge. Meanwhile, it was awarded a patent for a flexible screen in 2016. It detailed flexible components on an iPhone-like device that could withstand bending, warping or dropping.\nFollowing complaints of faulty flexing phones dubbed “Bendgate,” Apple may be looking for a way to improve the durability of its hardware and better conform to our back pockets.\nOther recent Apple patents include a 360-degree screen that wraps entirely around a phone and smart glasses to rival Google’s failed Glass product.\nAlthough the patent for the latest flexible display illustrates how it could be used with a phone, the language references any “electronic device.”\nIt’s unknown as of now if there is an iPhone flip phone in the works, but there’s certainly an interest in the old school category.\nIn May, Motorola released a flip phone Razr teaser video, which was viewed online more than 6 million in its first week.",
