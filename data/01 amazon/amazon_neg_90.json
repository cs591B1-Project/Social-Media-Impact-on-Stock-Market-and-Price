      "text": "December 06, 2016 at 14:30 PM EST TeraDeep Takes Rapid Video Analytics to the Cloud with Amazon Web Services \nCAMPBELL, Calif. , Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- TeraDeep, a developer of accelerated deep learning applications for the cloud and on-premise Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) appliances, announced today that it plans to use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) F1 instances to bring high-performance, low-power video analytics to AWS cloud customers. \nThe low-latency, power-efficient TeraDeep Amazon Machine Image (AMI) relies on Amazon EC2 F1's FPGA-optimized architecture. \n\"TeraDeep has developed FPGA-based accelerator technology to substantially reduce the time and cost for complex video processing,\" said Didier Lacroix , CEO of TeraDeep. \"Massive amounts of video footage are captured on camera systems and streamed every second. Accurate, automated, and low-latency video processing is critical so users can be alerted and respond to events immediately.\" \n\"As a growing startup, we found that the capital expenditure and lead time for developing and deploying FPGA technology on-premises is time-intensive and is the major reason there aren't more FPGA startups today,\" added Lacroix. \"Amazon FPGA Images (AFI) and Amazon EC2 F1 Instances have dramatically reduced the time and cost to deploy our technology, eliminating the large up-front expense and slashing time-to-market for custom FPGA cards from months or years to just days.\" \nAbout TeraDeep \nTeraDeep is a pioneer in the development of specialized neural networks and acceleration technology for deep learning. The company develops and markets high-performance, low-power deep learning solutions for the cloud as well as on-premise AI Appliances. Its complete solutions offer a creative combination of specialized hardware designed for purpose-trained networks, available through a robust set of APIs. TeraDeep AI Appliances are leased either directly or through its value-added partners. It licenses reference designs and pursues OEM models with qualified parties. \nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/teradeep-takes-rapid-video-analytics-to-the-cloud-with-amazon-web-services-300373214.html \nSOURCE TeraDeep Nasdaq quotes delayed at least 15 minutes, all others at least 20 minutes.

      "text": "December 06, 2016 at 13:57 PM EST Line Free Checkout Provider FutureProof Retail Reacts to Amazon Go \nNEW YORK , Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Amazon has announced Go and revealed their plan for outflanking brick and mortar merchants on the high-street. \nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161206/446032 \nMuch was made of Amazon Fresh, the online grocery delivery service that, along with its competitors, was supposed to take a bite out of the supermarket industry. However, after 8 years Amazon Fresh is only in 12 cities and its disappointing growth stands as evidence that most people would rather buy their groceries in person. \nThen in November, leaked internal documents revealed Amazon's next plans: opening 2000 brick & mortar grocery stores in the US. The Amazon Go announcement video shows Amazon's strategy for taking on brick & mortar: As the happy shoppers walk out the final message is \"No lines. No checkout. (No, seriously.)\" Amazon is betting that line-free shopping is the future of grocery, and that they can get there first. \nIt's not surprising that Amazon would focus their innovation on convenience. Their Amazon Prime service is so popular that 40% of US households pay for the privilege. \nAmazon isn't the only one betting that line-free checkout will be a key competitive edge. WalMart's Sam's Club Scan & Go rolled out this year to a great reception, with a similar rollout expected at WalMart proper next year. FutureProof Retail launched the first store in the US to open with line free checkout in November, San Luis Obispo's California Fresh Market. FutureProof's whitelabel technology provides line-free checkout and unlike Amazon's, it's available now and it's an easy upgrade for existing stores. \n\"As Amazon Go stores open across the country we'll be there, giving brick and mortar stores the chance to go line-free first.\" FutureProof CEO William Hogben said, \"We have limited installation dates open this Spring, email us for more information or join us at NRF Booth 3783 for a hands-on demo with our partner Bizerba.\" \nAbout FutureProof Retail \nEstablished and based in New York, NY , FPR is comprised of award-winning software engineers and business developers. FutureProof Retail was founded by a group of impatient shoppers, and brings a unique focus to ease of use in mobile self-scanning systems.

      "title": "Amazon launching new store where you don't have to check out",
      "text": "By Herb Scribner Deseret News @HerbScribner Published: Dec. 6, 2016 12:45 p.m. Updated: 37 minutes ago Leave a comment \nAmazon wants to make shopping at the grocery store so easy that it’s almost like you don't shop at all. \nOn Monday, the online shopping company announced Amazon Go , a grocery store that doesn’t require shoppers to wait in lines at the register or use self-checkout, according to Engadget. \nRather, as Engadget explained, the store will ask shoppers to submit their payment information beforehand through the Amazon Go app. Computer software will monitor customers and charge people's bills when they pick up items and leave the store with them. \nThe first store will launch in Seattle, according to Engadget. \nThe store will only be open to Amazon employees, but others can sign up to be notified when the shop is open for general business. \nSo far, observers remain split on whether the Amazon Go shop will help consumers in grocery stores. \nNeil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Conlumino, told Reuters that he thinks the shop will appeal to shoppers because it doesn’t require everyone’s least favorite part of the shopping experience — waiting. \n\"The checkout lines are always the most inefficient parts of the store experience,\" Saunders told Reuters. \"Not only would you save a lot on labor costs, you actually would make the process much quicker for consumers and much more satisfying.\" \nBut, he said, it won’t be easy for shoppers to understand how the stores work. He said the concept will make buyers feel as if they are stealing items from the store, and “there is a bit of education need for consumers.” \nMeanwhile, analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research said this new product could end up disrupting the grocery store industry. \n\"If there were hundreds of these stores around the country, it would be a huge threat,” he said, according to Reuters. \nThe store’s announcement may also just be a bunch of buzzwords from Amazon, designed to help the company see its stock value increase around the Christmas season , according to Forbes’ Ryan Mac. \nMac wrote that the store does fit into Amazon’s plan to make shopping better for customers. But too many questions exist around the product for it to take over mainstream supermarkets just yet. \n“That sounds good, but how does it really work? How many items will be in the store? What happens when the store doesn't recognize a customer? What if someone is overcharged?” Mac asked. \nBut Mac wrote that Amazon’s been thinking about products like this for close to four years, which shows there’s a vision ahead. The company even filed a patent about 18 months ago that described the vision of Amazon Go. \nAmazon already had a separate e-commerce store called Amazon Fresh, which, for a monthly fee of $14.99 , allows people to order groceries online that will be shipped to their house, according to TechCrunch. +",

      "text": "Amazon unveils grocery store with no checkout lines CNN 9:27 AM, Dec 5, 2016 10:44 AM, Dec 5, 2016 Share Article Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday December 5, 2016 that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. From Amazon Previous Next \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Amazon has gone after book stores, retail chains and electronics shops. Now it's taking on grocery stores, with a twist. \nAmazon unveiled in a video a new physical store on Monday that sells a mix of \"grocery essentials\" and ready-made meals. But the key selling point is what it doesn't have: checkout lines. \nThe video shows how customers check in at the entrance of the store with a new app called Amazon Go, then grab whatever items are needed. Amazon claims it can track the items automatically through a combination of computer vision and deep learning technologies. When you're done shopping, you just walk out. \nThe first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. \nFor years, there have been rumors the e-commerce company would expand its dominance from digital to physical shopping. Amazon began experimenting with physical bookstores a year ago, but Amazon Go may mark its boldest bet on bricks-and-mortar yet. \nBy eliminating much of the staff needed to operate a store, Amazon keeps costs lower than traditional competitors. It's also in a strong position to bring together data on its customers shopping habits online and offline to make better suggestions in all situations. \nHowever, Amazon's move deeper into physical retail shops comes in a sensitive political climate. The company could be perceived as being a threat to some of the 3.4 million Americans who work as cashiers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \nOn the campaign trail, Donald Trump repeatedly criticized Amazon and its founder Jeff Bezos for \"getting away with murder tax-wise\" and having \"a huge antitrust problem.\" Will the President-elect add \"job killer\" to the list of criticisms? \nAmazon's effort to launch a new kind of retail store predates the rise of Donald Trump. \n\"Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go?\" the company says on an informational page about Amazon Go. \nFor now, Amazon is starting slow. The first store is only open to Amazon employees and will not be an option for the general public until early next year. \nThe-CNN-Wire ",

      "text": "At Amazon’s New Grocery Store, AI Takes Over Cashier Jobs Amazon In Brief Amazon's 1,800 square foot retail space in Seattle has no checkout lanes — customers simply choose the items they want and are automatically charged when they leave the store. Expected to open to the public early in 2017, the store is another example of how AI and machine learning are taking over many jobs once held by humans. Shop and Go \nEver race another grocery shopper to get to the shortest checkout line or put an item back just so you could hit the 15 items or fewer line? Amazon believes you won’t need to do any of that in the grocery stores of the future. In fact, the company thinks those stores won’t have any checkout counters at all. \nThe company is bringing their vision for the future to life with Amazon Go , an aptly named smart store where you can just take anything from the shelves and leave. The store is powered by sensors, deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) , and computer vision , which allows it to detect which items a customer has selected and even when products are returned to shelves. \nTo start their shopping experience, the customer just needs to download the Amazon Go app on their smartphone. They swipe the app upon entering the building, and after walking out of the store, the shopper’s Amazon account is charged for the items and a receipt is sent to the app. \nCurrently, Amazon Go is in its beta phase, available only to the company’s employees. The 167 square meter (1,800 square foot) retail space is located in Seattle, and the company expects the grocery store to open to the public early in 2017. The AI Labor Force \nAmazon Go has no checkout lines, no registers, and no cashiers. It’s a sneak peek at what some experts deem the inevitable future in which artificially intelligent devices take over many of our jobs . \nA report from tech analyst Forrester claims that AI will have the biggest impact in the fields of transportation, logistics, customer service, and consumer services, and Amazon Go falls into the majority of those categories. When quick-learning, pattern-reading machines can execute repetitive work perfectly each time, how will a human worker compete? \nWhite collar workers shouldn’t be so quick to scoff at the labor force takeover. A study from IT researchers proved the increasing possibility that even doctors , lawyers , and accountants could easily be replaced by AI. Machine learning algorithms could settle disputes without the need of lawyers, and the WebMD network already gets more hits per month than there are visits to all the doctors in the United States, so people are prepped to get their medical advice from machines. \nThe reliability of advanced technology has truly changed human living forever. Amazon Go is yet another testament to the very near, and very different, future ahead.",

(Dec. 5, 2016) \nAmazon.com Inc. has built a convenience store that allows shoppers a faster experience. Amazon Go is a store where shoppers can come in, grab items and walk out without going through a register. (Dec. 5, 2016) Debbi Baker The system is in place at a grocery store in Seattle where shoppers first scan their phones when they enter. They they choose what they want and as the items are removed from the shelf they pile up in a virtual shopping cart. \nIf someone decides they want the Frosted Flakes instead of the Cheerios they simply put Tony the Tiger back on the display and the price is deducted from the total. \nWhen the shoppers leave the store, the bill is automatically totaled, charged to their Amazon accounts and a receipt is sent. \nThe mammoth retailer calls the system the “world’s most advanced shopping technology,” similar to that used in self-driving cars. It uses “machine learning, computer vision and artificial intelligence,” that is weaved into the “very fabric of the store.” \nThe new market is open right now to Amazon employees only but it is set to open to the public early next year.

      "text": "Amazon, the mammoth online retailer, is now opening brick-and-mortar grocery stores. But unlike any grocery store you've ever seen, theirs has no check out line. They're called Amazon Go .\nThe first one opened in Seattle, but only to Amazon employees until the testing phase is finished, which is expected to be early next year. At that time the store will be open to the public.\nIt may feel a bit like stealing, but the way it works is you go into the store, grab the food you want, then walk right out the door. Say goodbye to waiting in line because there's simply no checkout, not even a self-checkout. No scanning of barcodes. Just literally grab and go.\nTo make the process even faster, Amazon says the stores themselves are pretty small, about 18-hundred square feet, so customers can get in and out quickly. To add to the convenience of it all, Amazon Go specializes in ready-to-eat foods and meal kits that can be made at home in addition to what you'd normally find at a grocery store.\nLeave it to Amazon to implement this revolutionary technology. The company says all the food items are equipped with computer sensors that detect when an item has been taken off a shelf, placed in your shopping cart and carried out the door. Customers do need an Amazon account, a supported smartphone and the Amazone Go app. Shortly after leaving the store, your Amazon account is charged and you're emailed your receipt.\nWhile this may sound like a dream come true for people who hate to wait in line at the grocery store (and who doesn't?) not everyone thinks this is good news. CNBC reports that Quartz and The Wall Street Journal declared the experimental store might signal the end of \"millions of cashier jobs.\" The New York Post's front page story on Tuesday called the store \"the end of jobs.\"",

      "text": "Martian mVoice watches add Amazon Alexa support 12/06/2016   \nAmazon’s Alexa Voice service may have debuted on the company’s smart home speaker, but Amazon is encouraging developers to integrate it into everything from robots to tablets . \nAnd now you can also use Alexa to interact with Martian’s mVoice wristwatches. The company has released a software update that lets you use Amazon Skills for navigation, shopping, setting alarms, and more. \nWhile the watches have list prices around $300, you can currently pick one up from Amazon for as little as $160 . \nMartian has been shipping watches since 2013, including models with classic watch designs but smart features such as the ability to display smartphones notifications on a small, secondary display. \nThe mVoice line was introduced earlier this year with a built-in noise canceling microphone and a speaker to let you make phone calls, compose text messages, or generally communicate with your phone by speaking to the watch. \nThe addition of Alexa support brings way more features thanks to Alexa’s ecosystem of around 5,000 skills from Amazon and third-party developers. For example, you can get weather forecasts, search the web, or control smart home products including lights, locks, and cameras. \nWhile the Martian mVoice isn’t the first watch to support Alexa skills , it may be one of the most affordable options currently available.",

      "text": "\n* Financials lead; Goldman Sachs hits 9-year high \n* Amazon, big tech names also shine \n* Health sector lags as insurers stumble \n* Indexes up: Dow 0.24 pct, S&P 0.58 pct, Nasdaq 1.01 pct (Updates with close of U.S. markets) \nBy Lewis Krauskopf \nDec 5 (Reuters) - Wall Street rose on Monday, with the Dow Jones industrials setting fresh record highs, as services sector data gave further evidence of strength in the domestic economy. \nU.S. services sector activity hit a one-year high in November, with a surge in production boosting hiring, following on the heels of Friday's employment report that showed strong job gains last month. \nU.S. stocks have climbed since the Nov. 8 election, fueled by expectations of significant economic stimulus and cuts in corporate taxes and regulations under President-elect Donald Trump. \n\"A lot of people were negative going into the election, or cautious, so now they're scrambling year-end to own stocks,\" said Alan Lancz, president of investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc in Toledo, Ohio. \nLancz said U.S. investors on Monday also were encouraged by strength in European equities following Italy's political referendum. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi was set to resign after suffering a resounding defeat over constitutional reform. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 45.82 points, or 0.24 percent, to 19,216.24, the S&P 500 gained 12.76 points, or 0.58 percent, to 2,204.71 and the Nasdaq Composite added 53.24 points, or 1.01 percent, to 5,308.89. \nThe Dow, which closed at a record and minted a new intraday peak, has topped the other major indexes since the election, as investors have rotated into the financial and industrial sectors. \nFinancials gained 1.2 percent on Monday and were the best-performing major S&P sector. Goldman Sachs shares rose 2.3 percent after HSBC initiated coverage with a \"buy\" rating. \nMonday's economic data reinforced the view that the Federal Reserve is primed to raise interest rates next week, benefiting banks. \n\"We have a situation where the Fed is probably going to raise rates next week and this time raising rates is being viewed as a positive, mainly because of its impact on the financial stocks, which are all doing quite well today,\" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. \nBig tech names also lifted the S&P 500 and helped the Nasdaq outperform on Monday. Amazon.com rose 2.6 percent as it said it opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store in Seattle without lines or checkout counters. \nHealth insurers Aetna and Humana fell 3 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively, as a trial over their proposed merger kicked off. The health sector fell 0.2 percent and was the worst-performing group. \nAbout 7.1 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 7.9 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.59-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.14-to-1 ratio favored advancers. \nThe S&P 500 posted 52 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 232 new highs and 29 new lows.

      "title": "Amazon Could Expand Amazon Go And Drive-Through Grocery Store Formats With 2,000 Locations",
      "text": "by Brittany Goetting   Amazon Could Expand Amazon Go And Drive-Through Grocery Store Formats With 2,000 Locations What if we lived in a world where we never needed to wait in line in order to buy some milk or toilet paper? Amazon is working on making that dream a reality. The corporation has just opened a brick-and-mortar grocery store dubbed “Amazon Go” in Seattle, Washington and plans on opening 2,000 more locations of varying types. Amazon stated, “Four years ago we asked ourselves: what if we could create a shopping experience with no lines and no checkout? Could we push the boundaries of computer vision and machine learning to create a store where customers could simply take what they want and go.”Groceries have been difficult to sell online and account for only two percent of all grocery sales. If its first store is successful, Amazon plans on opening around 2,000 locations. The company is considering other formats, such as allowing drivers to pick up goods curbside. Amazon Go appears to be targeting “fill-in” trips or quick trips where customers only need a few essential items, and thus could be competition for drugstores like CVS or Walgreens. The Amazon Go aesthetic is similar to Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s and therefore appears to be catering to yuppies and millennials. The store offers grocery basics like bread, as well as ready-to-eat meals made fresh by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries. Prepared meals will present competition to typical fast food and carry-out restaurants, especially places like Chipotle. Amazon's pre-packaged meal kits could threaten companies like Blue Apron and Hello Fresh. This new format eliminates much of the staff that is needed to operate a store and therefore keeps costs down. Amazon Go, however, could potentially be a threat to the retail industry. More than 3.4 million Americans work as cashiers and Amazon Go has come at a time when several states voted to raise the minimum wage. The rollout of Amazon Go will be a slow process overall and Amazon will need to build an extensive store network in order to gain traction. The first Amazon Go store is currently only available to Amazon employees, and will open for regular customers in early 2017.",

      "text": "Mindful of Amazon, malls take the Santa experience high-tech JOSEPH PISANI, The Associated Press Published: December 6, 2016, 2:03 pm Updated:   \nNEW YORK (AP) — Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the “Naughty or Nice O’Meter.” Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. \nAbout 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa’s lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything. \n“It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,” says Katie Mass, who took her twin daughters through Santa’s Flight Academy, a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey. \nShe had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. “They started running,” says the stay-at-home mom from Westfield, New Jersey. \nThe girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. “It was extravagant and well done,” says Mass. \nMalls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They’re increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates. \n“The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can’t do it,” says Davidowitz. \nSanta’s Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc., which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa’s Flight Academy. \nGuy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman’s Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Connecticut, credited this year’s “great” store traffic to Santa’s Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight. \n“It is getting a lot of good reviews,” says Perry. \nAn old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV. \nAs kids stand on the “Naughty or Nice O’Meter,” they can watch their names pop up on Santa’s “Nice List” screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they’re handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music. \nQuite a difference from last year’s Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees. \n“It’s Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,” says John Scaturro, a marketing manager for the mall. \nQueens Center’s owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro. \nIn addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network’s home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls. \nIt’s cartoon characters that share the spotlight with Santa at another mall display, the DreamWorks DreamPlace. The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio’s “Kung Fu Panda” films — replacing the green ogre from the “Shrek” movies that were last year’s focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa’s sleigh. \nWhatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop. \n“I don’t see many things out there that equal Santa’s power to draw crowds,” he says.",

More than 30,000 attendees descended on the Venetian in Las Vegas last week to hear a flurry of product and partnership moves from the world's leading public cloud provider. \nAWS used the event to unveil a number of virtual machine instances designed to drive specialized workloads, increase efficiency and add flexibility to empower a broader set of use cases. It also demonstrated new services that enable artificial intelligence, serverless computing and tighter security. If that wasn't enough, a large-scale data migration product was showcased (on the back of a big rig.) \nHere are 10 companies that displayed their cloud-powering wares, plus a few other interesting sights that were found on the re:Invent pavilion floor.

How is it too thick? 2.5 inch is the correct size for the PS4. Because it's a 4-platter design (4 x plates of 750GB) and is therefore 15mm thick (not 7mm or 9.5mm like 2.5\" drives up to 2TB).",

      "title": "Impinj Could Ride Amazon’s ‘Go’ Retail Design, Says RBC",
      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Impinj ( PI ), the Internet of Things company that went public public on July 21st, could be a beneficiary of the “ Amazon Go ” retail concept that Amazon.com ( AMZN ) unveiled yesterday morning, according to RBC Capital ’s Mitch Steves , if Amazon ends up going with the company’s sensors and software.\nSteves, who has an Outperform rating, and a $37 target, for Impinj stock, thinks Amazon is one of a number of “upside drivers” for Impinj, others being deals with airlines and healthcare companies.\nAmazon yesterday unveiled a system whereby a customer enters a retail location and as they pick things off the shelf, items are automatically detected by a smartphone app and debited from the customer’s Amazon payment source, apparently relying heavily on wireless sensors in the goods on the shelf.\nWrites Steves, it seems likely Impinj is behind this effort, though there’s been no confirmation from either party:\nAmazon revealed its first convenience store yesterday and is currently private beta testing in Seattle with Amazon Go (smartphone enabled grocery stores). Importantly, Impinj is working with Amazon in its small set of retail stores and we think the Company may be involved in the Amazon Go initiative as well (no confirmation from either party at this time). This would act as a logical extension of the Impinj product line as the chips could be used as the inventory Management tracker (when lifting a new item the system recognizes a picked up sale allowing for seamless walk-out the door checkout). Finally, while the ~2,000 retail stores would be a large tailwind for companies involved in the tracking devices, we think the material upside would come from Amazon warehouses.\nImpinj shares today are up $1.31, or almost 5%, at $28.79.",

      "text": "(Before It's News)\nE-commerce giant Amazon.com officially entered the brick-and-mortar world on Monday as it unveiled a cashier-less grocery store in the company’s hometown of Seattle, and reports indicate that the 1,800-square-foot location is only the first part of a much larger plan.\nDubbed Amazon Go, the new convenience shop allows customers to walk in, take the items they want to buy, charge it to their existing Amazon account, and walk out of the store, according to The Verge . Individuals use an app when they enter the store, and an array of cameras and sensors keep track of the items they take with them when they leave, eliminating the need for checking out.\nThe company recently released a video detailing how the project should work:\nAmazon Go will stock typical convenience store items such as snacks, drinks, milk and bread, as well as pre-made food products, and a report from The Wall Street Journal suggests that it is one of at least 2,000 such grocery shops that the online retailer hopes to open throughout the US.\nIn fact, the Journal indicates that Amazon is considering two additional store formats in addition to the convenience outlet. Sources familiar with the website’s plans told the newspaper that their tech team approved a proposal to open several large, multifunction stores featuring curbside pickup in November, as well as two drive-through only locations scheduled to open in a few weeks.\nReports: retailer to build thousands of brick-and-mortar stores\nIf the test locations perform well, Amazon plans to ultimately open more than 2,000 of its brick-and-mortar grocery stores, challenging prominent grocer Kroger, which according to the Journal runs approximately 2,800 stores in 35 different states. The stores offering curbside service would be designed to challenge similar centers run by Target and Walmart, The Verge added.\nThe retail convenience shops and grocery stores are “part of their secret sauce in terms of all of the different ways in which they can engage the customer in bringing the product to them,” Bill Bishop of retail consultancy Brick Meets Click , told the Journal Monday. “Everyone is looking at grocery because of frequency. Frequency guarantees that you have density.”\nWhile an Amazon spokeswoman declined the Journal’s and The Verge’s requests for comment, reports indicate that the drive-through prototypes are currently under construction in the Seattle area. As for the larger, chain-style stores, they would be between 30,000 and 40,000 square feet in size and would allow customers to use touch screens to order in store, then use curbside service to pick up their purchases at a later time. Said orders could also be placed online.\nThe current Seattle-based Amazon Go location is currently open only to Amazon employees, but is expected to open to the general public early next year. The soon-to-open drive-through centers are currently under construction in the suburban Seattle neighborhood of Ballard, and individuals close to the project have told the Journal that they will open within the next few weeks.\n“The third concept, the newly approved multi-format store, combines in-store shopping with curbside pickups,” the newspaper noted, again citing its unnamed sources. “It will likely adopt a 30,000- to 40,000-square-foot floor plans and spartan stocking style… offering a limited fresh selection in store and more via touch-screen orders for delivery later. Stores in this format, which are smaller than traditional US grocery stores, could start appearing late next year.”\n—–\nImage credit: Amazon\nThe post Amazon will open high-tech grocery stores with no checkout line appeared first on Redorbit .\nredOrbit.com\noffers Science, Space, Technology, Health news, videos, images and reference information.

      "text": "Amazon testing cashier-free retail store Agence France-Presse Posted at Dec 06 2016 01:01 PM \nShare — Amazon (@amazon) December 5, 2016 \nSAN FRANCISCO - Customers at the concept store in Amazon's hometown of Seattle, Washington, can fill their shopping carts and walk out -- with the costs automatically tallied up and billed to their accounts with the US online giant. \nAmazon Go, which is being tested with Amazon employees and will open to the public next year, is a \"checkout-free shopping experience made possible by the same types of technologies used in self-driving cars: computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning,\" its webpage said. \n\"Our Just Walk Out technology automatically detects when products are taken from or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in a virtual cart. When you're done shopping, you can just leave the store. Shortly after, we'll charge your Amazon account and send you a receipt.\" \nThe 1,800-square-foot (170-square-meter) store is selling a variety of food products, including bread, cheeses and ready-to-eat meals, as well as Amazon Meal Kits, which contain ingredients for home-cooked dishes. \nIt was not immediately clear whether Amazon will expand this model with more physical stores or offer the technology to other retailers. \nThe online giant has been rumored to be looking at creating brick-and-mortar stores but so far has only announced a handful of outlets selling books. \nThe Wall Street Journal cited people close to the matter as saying that Amazon Go was one of several store formats the retail giant is considering. \nTwo prototype drive-through locations in Seattle without in-store shopping options are set to open in the coming weeks, the Journal reported. \nDepending on the success of the test locations, Amazon could reportedly open more than 2,000 brick-and-mortar grocery stores under its brand. \nIf it does push forward with selling fresh food in stores, Amazon could put a lot of pressure on traditional grocers and superstores like Wal-Mart. \n© 1994-2016 Agence France-Presse",

(AP Photo/Branden Camp) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter.\" Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. \nAbout 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa's lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything. \n\"It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,\" says Katie Mass, who took her twin daughters through Santa's Flight Academy, a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey. \nShe had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. \"They started running,\" says the stay-at-home mom from Westfield, New Jersey. \nThe girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. \"It was extravagant and well done,\" says Mass. \nMalls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They're increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates. \n\"The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can't do it,\" says Davidowitz. \nSanta's Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc., which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa's Flight Academy. \nGuy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman's Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Connecticut, credited this year's \"great\" store traffic to Santa's Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight. \n\"It is getting a lot of good reviews,\" says Perry. \nAn old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV. \nAs kids stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter,\" they can watch their names pop up on Santa's \"Nice List\" screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they're handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music. \nQuite a difference from last year's Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees. \n\"It's Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,\" says John Scaturro, a marketing manager for the mall. \nQueens Center's owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro. \nIn addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network's home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls.   \nIt's cartoon characters that share the spotlight with Santa at another mall display, the DreamWorks DreamPlace. The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio's \"Kung Fu Panda\" films — replacing the green ogre from the \"Shrek\" movies that were last year's focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa's sleigh. \nWhatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop. \n\"I don't see many things out there that equal Santa's power to draw crowds,\" he says.",

      "text": "Can Oracle Really Beat AWS? Dec. 6.16 \nOracle is betting big on beating Amazon in cloud. \nIt has introduced its bare-metal cloud service, which is a solid first step. \nIf Oracle can build on its strengths, the task will get easier. \nOracle (NASDAQ: ORCL ) is going through an interesting transition phase. The company said that it will put more emphasis on renting hardware going forward than selling hardware. As a result, its hardware business might seem to be slowing down although that's not the case actually, the company said. \nOracle's current position in the cloud IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) space is insignificant. But the company is preparing itself to compete with leaders like Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) AWS. In fact, Oracle's executive chairman Larry Ellison has already laid down a 10-point plan for beating Amazon. In this article I will delve deeper into Oracle's prospects in cloud. \nClick to enlarge \nOracle Bare-Metal Cloud \nOracle has introduced its bare-metal cloud service to mark its entry in the cloud IaaS marketplace. This is what renting hardware means. Hosted bare-metal is nothing but renting physical servers via cloud. Mr. Ellison is very optimistic about Oracle's transition. He recently said : \nBut our overall business, especially once we get through this transition, our overall business will grow very rapidly. And we're going to be a much larger company, growing double-digits and more profitably than we were before. \nI believe renting hardware, i.e., physical servers is a solid first step Oracle has taken since bare-metal environments are ideal for big data/analytics workloads. In a bare-metal environment there is no need to run a hypervisor, which enhances the security of the environment compared to virtualized environments based on VMs (virtual machines). \nIn terms of performance, virtualized cloud offers less speed compared to bare-metal cloud. However, bare-metal is costlier. Nonetheless, the market for bare-metal is growing not only due to better performance but also because it supports big data and analytics related workloads with greater efficiency and security. \nIn addition to offering hosted bare-metal cloud service, Oracle is also offering its customers easily deployable Docker container service. Containers are fast becoming an alternative virtualization technology, which is gradually replacing VMs for certain workloads. I discussed this topic in a previous article . I believe Oracle's cloud strategy makes sense which involves gradually expanding its cloud market share by offering hosted bare-metal powered by containers. \nOracle has a rich portfolio of PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) offerings, which is its strength. Running containers on bare-metal (instead of VMs) is an evolving technology which has tremendous growth opportunity. If Oracle can capitalize on this opportunity to expand its cloud IaaS market share, the adoption of its PaaS and SaaS offerings will also increase. As a result, it will become a 360-degree cloud provider. \nOracle's Strength: Can Oracle Build On Its Strength? \nAs I said, Oracle's strength is its PaaS and SaaS offerings which allow enterprises to run applications. Oracle is the No. 2 software maker in the world, after Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). In the PaaS space its database products like Oracle Database (NYSE: DB ) and MySQL compete well against Microsoft's SQL Server. In addition, its application development platforms, particularly Java, also enjoy solid demand. Java is a tough competitor for Microsoft's .NET platform. \nIn the SaaS space Oracle is a big player indeed. Its enterprise resource planning (ERP), human capital management, supply chain management and customer relationship management (NYSE: CRM ) software suites have a huge share in the enterprise market. Even Microsoft doesn't have such dominance in the enterprise market. \nHowever, Oracle's biggest risk is that despite its platform and software strength it might gradually become irrelevant with the new waves of open source software hitting the enterprise shores. A well-defined cloud strategy which would help it leverage its strengths can save it in the long run. I believe offering customers the chance to deploy containers on bare-metal is such a strategy. Why? Well, as I said, I believe containers will be used extensively in the cloud IaaS space going forward. \nA robust cloud infrastructure strategy will ensure Oracle's smooth transition into cloud where it will offer its PaaS and SaaS products on per-use or monthly payment basis. Why having an IaaS offering is essential? Because it will help Oracle compete with leading cloud infrastructure players, namely Amazon and Microsoft. \nInfrastructure is the gateway to the cloud for enterprises which allows them to run applications. Running applications are enterprises' ultimate goal in the cloud. Without offering customers an elastic and scalable cloud infrastructure service consisting of compute, storage and networking facilities, it's almost impossible to offer them facilities for running applications (such as application development platforms and software services). \nFor Amazon, having no solutions (except third-party solutions) that would allow enterprises to run applications could emerge as a big drawback for its business model. Oracle's aim is to capitalize on this drawback. That's why it has invested heavily in cloud since 2015 (see the table presented below). \nAcquisition Date",

      "text": "Amazon testing system that eliminates checkout lines at grocery store Published http://str.sg/4AoX Copy \nNEW YORK • Amazon.com has unveiled technology that will let shoppers grab groceries without having to scan and pay for them - in one stroke eliminating the checkout line. \nThe company is testing the new system at what it is calling an Amazon Go store in Seattle, which will open to the public early next year. Customers will be able to scan their phones at the entrance using a new Amazon Go mobile app. \nThe technology will track what items the customers pick up or return to the shelves and add them to a virtual shopping cart in real time, according to a video that Amazon posted on YouTube. Once the customers exit the store, they will be charged on their Amazon account automatically. \nThe concept store and automated checkout mark Amazon's latest attempt to upend the grocery business. The company began experimenting with fresh food in 2007, when it started AmazonFresh, a delivery service now active in 16 US markets. \nAmazon has since started opening pick-up centres, where shoppers can collect their Web purchases. Perhaps recognising that many people remain reluctant to buy fresh food online, sight unseen, the company is now testing what looks a lot like a convenience store. How Amazon Go works \n1 To get started, you need an Amazon account, a supported smartphone and the free Amazon Go app. \n2 Walk into an Amazon Go store that features Just Walk Out technology. \n3 Hold the phone to a scanning device that works like a turnstile and it registers that you have entered the store. \n4 Put the phone away and start shopping - picking up items and adding them to your bag. \n5 A combination of the Amazon-developed artificial intelligence, computer vision from multiple cameras tracking each customer plus data from multiple sensors detects what items you have picked up, retained or put back on the shelves. \n6 As you leave the shop, the system detects your exit and tallies the prices of items selected. \n7 No checkout cashier is needed. Your account is automatically charged for each item you selected, and a receipt is sent to you. \n\"Most people still have two requirements,\" said Forrester analyst Brendan Witcher. \"One is, 'I want something today, I don't want to wait'. No. 2 is, 'I want to touch and feel the product before I commit to it'.\" \nSo if the Amazon Go concept works, will the company build small grocery stores in cities all over the country? Amazon is not saying. \nBut some analysts envision a combination of pick-up centre, fulfilment warehouse and small grocery store. After all, Amazon is already building urban warehouses, including a 4,645 sq m facility in midtown Manhattan, that handle same-day deliveries to local customers. \nSelling fresh food is a strategy long employed by retailers to boost foot traffic and get people to make more purchases. \n\"I believe you're going to see growing offline presence in high-turnover goods, which is mostly groceries and household items,\" said Mr James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. \nAmazon employees are testing out the 167 sq m store on the company's campus, where they can buy ready-to-eat breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack options, as well as essential grocery items such as bread and milk, and artisanal cheeses and locally made chocolates. \nGrocers have been experimenting with automated checkouts for years. But Amazon Go takes the concept to a new level. \n\"While it remains to be seen how well the technology works, the experience could be very compelling,\" said Mr Michael Chui, a partner at McKinsey Global Institute. \nBLOOMBERG \nVIDEO \nSee how Amazon Go works. http:/ /str.sg/4AkM A version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on December 07, 2016, with the headline 'Amazon testing system that eliminates checkout lines at grocery store'.

      "text": "Don't Miss: Amazon 12 Days of Deals Sale \nWe all know that using counterfeit chargers can severely impact our iPhones - but what many of us didn't realize is that it can also impact our physical health as well. A study recently looked at 400 counterfeit Apple iPhone chargers and found that 99% of the imitation devices failed a basic safety test and could result in an electric shock. Don't Miss: Top 100 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2016 Photos \nThe study was done by the Canadian division of power safety compliance firm UL and shows that they can be deadly. They purchased the chargers from eight countries, including the US, Canada, Colombia, China, Thailand, and Australia. \nThey tested the devices and found that there was insufficient insulation which poses a threat of shock to users. \nIn this particular test, only three of the 400 devices passed the test. During the test, 22 of the units were immediately damaged when turned on, and 12 could potentially electrocute a person. \nIt is never a good idea to use a counterfeit iPhone charger as they have been known to start fires and shock people. Make sure that you buy an Apple product - a recent study found that over 90% of the \"genuine\" chargers are counterfeit. \nThe r esearchers explain why you should avoid these: \"The internal components are vastly different when compared with a genuine UL Listed Apple adapter. Post testing analysis of the tested samples revealed a complete lack of triple isolation wire used for the secondary windings; neither the primary or secondary windings were separated properly, which is the major reason for the dramatic failure rate on the electric strength test.\" \nThose components are what makes the chargers safe to use. Companies like Apple have to test their devices many, many times before selling. Still, counterfeit chargers don't have to go through that process. \nIn order to ensure that your charger is the real thing, make sure they are white, Apple-branded, and sold in a box. Even better, only buy from Apple or participating retailers. Remember that most Apple chargers are at least $19, if not more. \nIt isn't worth your safety to not spend a few more dollars and get what you need.",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter.\" Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online.\nAbout 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa's lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything.\n\"It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,\" says Katie Mass , who took her twin daughters through Santa's Flight Academy , a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey.\nShe had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. \"They started running,\" says the stay-at-home mom from Westfield, New Jersey.\nThe girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. \"It was extravagant and well done,\" says Mass.\nMalls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They're increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz , chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates.\n\"The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can't do it,\" says Davidowitz.\nSanta's Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc. , which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa's Flight Academy.\nGuy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman's Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Connecticut, credited this year's \"great\" store traffic to Santa's Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight.\n\"It is getting a lot of good reviews,\" says Perry.\nAn old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV.\nAs kids stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter,\" they can watch their names pop up on Santa's \"Nice List\" screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they're handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music.\nQuite a difference from last year's Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees.\n\"It's Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,\" says John Scaturro , a marketing manager for the mall.\nQueens Center's owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro.\nIn addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network's home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls.\nIt's cartoon characters that share the spotlight with Santa at another mall display, the DreamWorks DreamPlace. The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio's \"Kung Fu Panda\" films — replacing the green ogre from the \"Shrek\" movies that were last year's focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa's sleigh.\nWhatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop.\n\"I don't see many things out there that equal Santa's power to draw crowds,\" he says.",

      "text": "Online scammers are targeting Amazon shoppers in Australia and the United Kingdom — and getting tricked during the busy holiday shopping (and shipping) season could mean major consequences for your financial safety. \nShoppers are getting emails from “Amazon” claiming their orders can’t be shipped. \n“There was a problem processing your order. You will not be able to access your account or place orders with us until we confirm your information. Click here to confirm your account,” the email reads. \nThe message is riddled with spacing and capitalization blunders, but if you click to confirm your account, the “Amazon” page you land on looks almost exactly like a real Amazon page. \nScreenshots obtained by AARP show an “Amazon” page with the familiar top navigation bar, gold field headers and the typical Amazon beige button for you to save your data. \nBut the information it asks for is totally bogus. Amazon would never ask you to click a link in an email message and type in your full name, address, and the numbers, expiration dates and security codes on all the credit cards you use to shop at Amazon. \nDo you know how to tell if an email from Amazon is real or fake? Read on before this scam tries to wiggle its way toward U.S. shoppers. How to Make Sure You Don’t Get Scammed \nThis scam is a phishing attack , one that fools you into giving away your information for malicious use. \nIf you receive an email that makes you suspicious, Amazon recommends taking these steps: Check who the email is from. If the sender doesn’t use an “@amazon.com” email address, it’s fake! Visit the “Your Orders” page of your Amazon account to determine if any of your recent orders have fulfillment, billing or shipping issues. Visit “Your Account” to check your payment options. Amazon says if you aren’t prompted to update your billing info on your account’s “Manage Payment Options” page, the email you got isn’t from Amazon. Report the suspicious email to stop-spoofing@amazon.com. Amazon doesn’t respond to these emails, but it investigates potential issues. \nYour Turn: Have you received a suspicious email claiming to be from Amazon? What did you do about it? \nLisa Rowan is a writer and producer at The Penny Hoarder. Contributor for The Penny Hoarder 0",

      "text": "NEW YORK — A new advertisement in New York City for the second season of the Amazon TV series “The Man in the High Castle” shows the Statue of Liberty giving a Nazi salute. An ad campaign last year for the Amazon Studios show’s first season offended many Jews and non-Jews, and the new Times Square billboard in the heart of Manhattan is doing the same, Gothamist first reported Monday. “I can think of a million better ways to promote this show, and I can’t even imagine how a Holocaust survivor who lives in the city would feel if they saw that,” New Yorker Uri Katz told Gothamist.\nOthers have said the ad represents “what American politics have become.”\nThe series, based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, depicts an alternate version of the United States in the 1960s after the Axis powers won World War II.\nLast November, Amazon covered an entire New York City subway car with an advertisement for the series that featured the Nazi eagle and cross symbol. After the Anti-Defamation League’s New York regional director and others called the campaign insensitive, the city’s Metropolitan Transit Authority pulled the ads.\n@Amazon ad campaign plasters #NY subway with #Nazi -like insignia https://t.co/fm2wcqnMVW #merica @gop @AFPhq #koch pic.twitter.com/70zGbIBe1n \n— MichaelLoBurgio (@MikeLoBurgio) November 24, 2015 \n\nLast year, the “Man in the High Castle” made headlines when it covered the York City subway with the Nazi insignia in an ad promotion.\n ",

      "text": "Amazon's new grocery store, Amazon Go, may have created a surprise winner: Impinj, a $600 million IoT company that went public about four months ago.\nOn Tuesday, Impinj closed up more than 7.5%, after RBC Capital published a note saying the company could be a major beneficiary of Amazon's new grocery store initiative.\nImpinj offers real-time inventory tracking technology which makes it easy for retailers to see the movement of every item in the store.\nAlthough there hasn't been any official partnerships, it theoretically makes sense for Amazon to adopt Impinj's technology, as Amazon Go comes with no  cashiers or checkout lines. \nIn fact, RBC Capital's Mitch Steves wrote in the note that Impinj is already working with Amazon in its \"small set of retail stores,\" and predicted that the company could get involved in the build out of Amazon Go, as well. \nHe wrote: \n\"Impinj is working with Amazon in its small set of retail stores and we think the Company may be involved in the Amazon Go initiative as well (no confirmation from either party at this time). This would act as a logical extension of the Impinj product line as the chips could be used as the inventory Management tracker (when lifting a new item the system recognizes a picked up sale allowing for seamless walk-out the door checkout).\"\nSteves added the potential partnership could give Impinj an instant 3% to 5% revenue growth, and even double its annual revenue if it finds a way to get into all of Amazon's warehouses. Last year, Impinj had $78.5 million in revenue.\nNeither company responded when reached for comment by Business Insider.\nImpinj, founded in 2000, is best-known for its RAIN RFID wireless technology that can track products in real-time. Its technology is used in a number of markets, including retail, healthcare, and manufacturing. The video below, published in 2013, gives a clue to how its technology works in a retail setting:\nYoutube Embed:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/jO6-TKkKj-I\nWidth: 560px\nHeight: 315px \nNOW WATCH: The best way to cook scrambled eggs — according to Anthony Bourdain \n",

      "text": "26 \nActually, that’s not true. James Comey's ego is the most direct factor in Trump’s win, followed by Putin's hacker army , but for those who insist on going to the “white working class feeling hopeless” angle, then yeah. This. This is the wellspring of that problem. \nCall it Amazon.com’s driverless store. \nThe tech giant has built a convenience store in downtown Seattle that deploys a gaggle of technologies similar to those used in self-driving cars to allow shoppers to come in, grab items and walk out without going through a register. \nAmazon is planning up to 2,000 of these stores. If their automation system works, don’t expect them to be alone. There are over 150,000 convenience stores in the United States, employing 2.3 million Americans. What Amazon is doing isn’t a threat to those jobs, it’s a promise. Those jobs are going away. So are the 1.7 million jobs to be replaced by driverless trucks. \nObviously, a single store still in testing and a few test trucks wandering the nation’s highways weren’t actually responsible for Trump’s victory. In fact here’s a far more accurate headline: I’m the reason Trump won . \nIt wasn ’t just me, but I certainly helped. For the last six years, my title has included the word “automation.” You can treat the position as “improving productivity” or even “increasing worker safety.” I’ve certainly pitched it that way. But there’s a better definition of what I and every other Director of Automation, Automation Architect, and Automation Engineer are up to: making jobs go away. \n… our research suggests that as many as 45 percent of the activities individuals are paid to perform can be automated by adapting currently demonstrated technologies. In the United States, these activities represent about $2 trillion in annual wages. \nThat train has already rolled through manufacturing industries. It’s not that someone in China is now doing every job that used to be in Allentown. It’s that no one is. \nThis was clear enough during the campaign, although no one seemed to want to say it. \nA look at the numbers suggests that the country is having the wrong economic debate this year. Employment security won’t come from renegotiating trade deals, as Donald Trump said in a speech Monday in Detroit, or rebuilding infrastructure, as Hillary Clinton argued in Warren, Mich., on Thursday. These are palliatives. \nThe deeper problem facing the United States is how to provide meaningful work and good wages for the tens of millions of truck drivers, accountants, factory workers and office clerks whose jobs will disappear in coming years because of robots, driverless vehicles and “machine learning” systems. \nIf you’re thinking that the solution is to just retrain all those manufacturing workers—and the coming wave of drivers replaced by automated vehicles, and store workers replaced by automated stores— so they can all be happy, well-paid programmers, think again. The number of new jobs created by automation is tiny in comparison to the number that are eliminated. Minuscule. When someone gives you an analogy involving the buggy-whip industry, just whip them. \nAutomation. Kills. Jobs. \nIf automation actually created new programming and analyst positions at a rate anywhere close to the number of workers being removed from factories, mines, stores, and vehicles it wouldn’t be cost effective. It is. It’s extremely cost effective. Which is why it’s not going to stop. \nBesides, it’s perfectly possible to automate much of the analysis—programming loop. Tech companies have been trying for decades, and they’re starting to have some success. There’s nothing magical about tech jobs that says they can’t also be automated. \nWhy aren’t companies being forced to pay more to their workers? They don’t have to. Automation is eating, eating, eating away at the need for workers, making sure that, no matter what the industry, it’s almost certain that there’s no shortage of qualified people. Trump voters may have turned their blame and anger toward black Americans, or brown Americans (a move helped by people who were very happy to aim their hate at traditional targets), but it’s the shiny metal ass of robot Americans that really deserved their ire. \nOf course, automation isn’t a disease; it doesn’t spread on its own. Corporate executives make the choice to implement the systems. But they do it exactly for the reasons advertised—automation drives up productivity and profits, turning corporations into money funnels that allow those same execs to collect their bonuses from booting out surplussed workers. \nSo that growing gap between worker pay and executive pay? That’s also my fault. \nWhen not making the magical new jobs argument, those cheering for automation will also pull out the Henry Ford story. You know, the one about Ford paying workers enough to afford his products. The idea being that companies can’t automate all their jobs, because someone has to buy their products. \nThere are two things wrong with that: \n1) Companies don’t have to get rid of all their workers to cause enormous disruption. Scroll back up there where it says 45 percent of workers could be automated, and that’s with the tech that exists today. Imagine what that would mean to the economy. Imagine what it would mean if just half that many went out. \n2) Sure they can automate all their jobs! Hey. There are other companies. Someone out there will pay our customers. ... We assume. \nThe problem that fed the Trump campaign is one that isn’t even close to demonstrating its full destructive potential. The basic nature of capitalism drives companies to seek increased productivity. Technological improvements are essentially removing the lid from productivity, and as companies get less and less timid about using that technology, productivity is soaring. That’s more product per person—which makes things cheap. Yea! And greatly decreases the need for people. Boo! \nThis isn’t a problem that can be solved through marginal adjustments of the tax rate, or temporary programs to boost road building. It’s not just affecting us, it’s affecting everyone. It’s the engine of the “oh, gosh, something is wrong, how about we try fascism for a change?” movement that’s going on around the world. \nThis is a fundamental challenge to both our political and economic system. One that calls for some radical solutions and a willingness to make rapid modifications to a system that’s worked for centuries, but can’t stand up to forces now squeezing in from all sides. Except … Trump. \nSo, anyway. How about that new automated store? Pretty cool, eh?",

      "text": "by Emily Laurence , December 6, 2016 Photo: Amazon \nEven though Amazon is a massive online mega-retailer, the company is still branching out. There’s Amazon’s online streaming service with original series like Transparent , for one. And did you know it owns a bunch of other sites , such as IMDB.com and Goodreads ? Oh, and then of course there’s the way they are changing the way we food shop by having groceries and restaurant takeout delivered ASAP . \nBut their latest announcement is the company’s biggest one yet. Amazon just revealed that the company will be opening its first brick-and-mortar store in 2017 (in its home base of Seattle, of course)—and 2,000 more in the next 10 years. And here’s the best part: there will be no checkout line. You’ll be able to scan items as you go using the Amazon app (connected to your Amazon account, which will bill you). Then, you can just prance out of the store. \nSo what will these new stores sell? Called Amazon Go, it will be a supermarket with everything from grocery staples to locally made chocolates —as well as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks made by on-site chefs and local kitchens and bakeries. Or you can pick up an Amazon Meal Kit, with everything you need to make a meal for two in about 30 minutes. \nAnd to think, once upon a time you only used Amazon to order books online. \nRather just have a meal kit delivered to your home every week? Here’s how to find the perfect one . And here’s a quick primer on how to read a food label, to ensure you buy stuff that really does your body good .",

      "text": "Kayapo tribe in Brazil relies on Gofundme campaign to save their culture and Amazon forest Posted on by admin Kayapo is a small tribe in Brazilian Amazon that has turned to the crowdfunding platform Gofundme.com to save their ancient culture and art. The first goal of the campaign is to raise $5000 which will help the tribe to preserve their art and also save the natural rainforest treasure that affects the whole world. There is a shop on Etsy https://www.etsy.com/shop/KayapoArt.com as well that sells authentic beaded jewelry developed by the Kayapo tribe itself, the profits earned from which go towards the development of the tribe and preserving their natural habitat. The Kayapo tribe was living happily and not under threat until 30 years ago but in the past few years, the urban progress is affecting and threatening the kayapo’s way of living and the forests of Amazon too. The land though belongs to Kayapo tribe as per the Brazilian law, is now slowly taken over by loggers, ranchers, miners and planned infrastructure builders. They may create a serious threat of deforestation and the Kayapo tribe. After observing these things, (i’m not happy with the words things…) the Kayapo tribe had to come out of their isolated living and find measures to stop this for preserving their culture and livelihood. The deforestation of Amazon forests will not only affect the Kayapo tribe but everyone on the planet earth as these forests are the basic need of life. With the financial help received from the fundraising campaign, the Kayapo tribe will be able to mark their territory, have better access to agriculture and solar power resources for producing more food for their people. They will be able to provide a better education for their children so that they can understand the ways of a developed society and also work towards saving the culture, land, and traditions of their tribe. The success of the campaign will ensure that Kayapo tribe is able to protect and preserve their centuries-old culture and also their natural home which provides life sources to so many animals and humans as well. Oz Arie, the man behind the fundraising campaign came across Amazon forests while searching for a fruit named Jagua, to create temporary tattoos with. He went on to learn how this fruit is used by the local tribe which ultimately made him learn about the Kayapo tribe and their struggles to preserve their culture and home. He understood that Kayapo way of living is much different to the lifestyle of outside capitalist world which is why he decided to help them in saving their culture. More information about the crowdfunding campaign can be found on https://www.gofundme.com/helpkayapo Contact Details",

      "text": "By JOSEPH PISANI\nNEW YORK (AP) — Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter.\" Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online.\nAbout 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa's lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything.\n\"It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,\" says Katie Mass, who took her twin daughters through Santa's Flight Academy, a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey.\nShe had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. \"They started running,\" says the stay-at-home mom from Westfield, New Jersey.\nThe girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. \"It was extravagant and well done,\" says Mass.\nMalls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They're increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates.\n\"The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can't do it,\" says Davidowitz.\nSanta's Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc., which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa's Flight Academy.\nGuy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman's Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Connecticut, credited this year's \"great\" store traffic to Santa's Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight.\n\"It is getting a lot of good reviews,\" says Perry.\nAn old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV.\nAs kids stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter,\" they can watch their names pop up on Santa's \"Nice List\" screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they're handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music.\nQuite a difference from last year's Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees.\n\"It's Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,\" says John Scaturro, a marketing manager for the mall.\nQueens Center's owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro.\nIn addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network's home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls.\nIt's cartoon characters that share the spotlight with Santa at another mall display, the DreamWorks DreamPlace. The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio's \"Kung Fu Panda\" films — replacing the green ogre from the \"Shrek\" movies that were last year's focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa's sleigh.\nWhatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop.\n\"I don't see many things out there that equal Santa's power to draw crowds,\" he says.",

      "text": "  Demonetisation helps Amazon clock triple-digit growth: Amit Agarwal Demonetisation helps Amazon clock triple-digit growth: Amit Agarwal 9 hours ago | 06-12-2016 | IANS New Delhi, Dec 6 : Cashing in on the ongoing demonetisation drive across India, Amazon India is witnessing triple-digit growth in its sales as it has switched to various electronic payments platforms, said the company's Vice President and Country Manager Amit Agarwal. [NK Business] \"When demonetisation was announced, we had switched off cash-on-delivery (COD) for 48 hours because it was very important for us to allow our logistics team to move from one compliant world to the new compliant world. Since then, we have allowed our customers to benefit from loading up their Amazon balance so that they can shop in a fruitful manner,\" Agarwal told BTVi in an interview. \"Customers can, right up to their doorsteps, choose to switch their cash payment option with the ability to pay with credit or debit card in one of the point of sales (PoS) devices that our logistics (team) carry with them. What we have seen is that the number of customers choosing to switch has gone up 10 times,\" he added. On November 8, the government decided to demonetise high denomination Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes across the country. \"So there is distinctly a dramatic shift towards electronic payment methods which is good in my opinion for e-commerce, for customer experience and for India as a whole going forward. And as we look at our business today, we have mostly returned to normal with very healthy triple-digit growth rates year-on-year and we're very excited,\" Agarwal said. He said that when the e-commerce company had switched off COD, sales got impacted as they were not letting the customers shop in lieu of cash. \"But since then, as we have enabled these other services, we are mostly normal and we are seeing triple-digit growth rates.\" The company has more than 95 million products now on its website with more than 1.8 million products eligible for next-day guaranteed delivery. ppg/ag/hs/dg",

      "text": "'Tis the season for brewing your favorite mug of tea, then wrapping yourself in a cozy cocoon on the couch while watching A Miracle on 34th Street . But after a few nights of movie marathons, it's time to switch from mint to something cinnamon-infused, right? Don't let a lack of cabinet space hold you back from expanding your assortment. YouCopia's TeaStand ($25, amazon.com ) is all you need — according to almost 300 rave reviews on Amazon.\nThe organizer includes 12 clear, removable bins so you can stock up on a robust collection of bags (more than 100, to be exact). Meanwhile, the compact design lets you slide the organizer into your cabinet without sucking up all of the surface area the same number of tea boxes would require. When guests come over, pull the entire organizer out so they can pick their flavor — or, if you know it, just pull out their favorite.\n To say tea drinkers find this organizer to be life-changing would be an understatement — and that's why it's one of the best reviewed organizers on Amazon.\n\"I love tea and this has saved me so much space. It's just the perfect convenient tea stand that shows off my variety, \" Alice Grey says.\n\"This is the tea organizer every tea drinker needs!\" How-To Book lover says. \"If you have a large volume of tea to organize, want easy access to the tea bags, as well as being able to easily see what teas you have this is the product for you!\"\n\"Just what I wanted to store my favorite tea selections,\" Rebecca Williams says. \"Easy to handle and fits neatly into my cabinet. Will be ordering another soon.\"\nClearly, all 291 reviews (88 percent of which are five stars and 10 percent are four stars) have something in common: gleeful satisfaction. Which begs me to wonder if this is the best gift ever for mom, grandma, and even myself. I think yes.\nFrom: House Beautiful\n ",

      "text": "Retail \nEnter store, pick up stuff, leave. \nAmazon’s desire to be the only shopping experience you will ever need is about to reach a new level. \nThe ecommerce behemoth announced that it is beta testing a physical grocery store for shoppers called Amazon Go. According to the nascent service’s website , Amazon Go will allow people to enter a physical store, pick up the items they need and leave the location without standing in line or even checking out. \nThe store is equipped with the same technologies that you find in advanced machine learning—computer vision, sensor fusion etc. \nShoppers enter the store using the Amazon Go app, which then keeps track of what is taken from or returned to the shelves. Customers pick up a product from the shelves and that item is instantly added to a virtual shopping cart. When the customer leaves the store, Amazon charges the associated account and sends a receipt. \nPeople can expect to find the sort of products that you would find in a convenience store, Amazon said. Amazon Go will sell food, wine, ready-to-eat meals and baked goods. Both well-known brands and artisanal products will jostle for space on the shelves, but with only 1,800 square feet to play with the store is “conveniently compact.” \nSee also: Why Amazon Will Dominate The Holiday Shopping Season … Again. \nThe “Just Walk Out” shopping experience may sound a bit like an Amazon-approved form of shoplifting, but the ultimate goal is make shopping as hassle-free as possible. No lines, no registers, no checkout … just grab and go. The service purports itself to really be that simple. \nAmazon Go has been in development for four years, Amazon said. For the moment, there is only one store—Seattle, near Amazon’s headquarters—and the beta version of the store is also only available to Amazon employees. The first public version is expected to open in 2017, although there are no details as to where this store will be. Amazon has already moved into the physical retail space after it opened a Seattle-based bookstore just over a year ago with more stores expected in the future. \nShoppers can check out the Amazon Go experience for themselves below. \nAmazon Go has some pretty obvious benefits for consumers, not least of which is the convenience. All you need is an Amazon account and a smartphone that supports the free app. The service will also allow Amazon to track the items that a person is interested in which could be used to provide more personalized recommendations in the future. \nLike what you’ve read?

      "text": "Amazon has teamed up with Bay Area-based studio Portal A to sneak in some last-second influencer marketing before the holidays. YouTube stars Alex Wassabi and Ingrid Nilsen are the central figures within “ Prime For The Holidays , ” a campaign that shows off the benefits Amazon Prime offers to shoppers.\nIn each video, the featured YouTuber uses Prime to assemble an array of themed gifts for someone close to them. Nilsen’s spot focuses on the beauty star’s friend’s dog, for whom Nilsen provides a gaggle of new accessories. Wassabi, on the other hand, chooses to do something nice for his girlfriend, fellow YouTube star Lauren “ LaurDIY ” Riihimaki. By using Amazon Prime to order wintry decorations, Wassabi was able to bring Riihimaki back to her cold, snowy homeland of Canada — without ever having to leave Los Angeles.\n\n\nPortal A is known for its frequent work with online video stars. One of the studio’s most prominent projects is the annual YouTube Rewind video, which sums up the year that was on the world’s top video site. The 2016 edition of that collaboration followed just a few days behind “Prime For The Holidays.”\nVisit Tubefilter for more great stories.\n",

      "text": "Amazon is up to something, and it is probably of interest to anyone who is interested in Nintendo’s throwback console.\nThe NES Classic Edition , a tiny $60 gaming box that looks like the original Nintendo Entertainment System and features 30 of that console’s games ( read our review ), is nearly impossible to find , but that’s not stopping one of the web’s largest retailers from teasing everyone about it. In a tweet today, the Amazon Video Games account claimed it has a “couple of exciting announcements to make in the coming weeks” for “NES Classic fans.” It didn’t give any other hints, but let’s hope that it’s getting ready to reveal that it has plenty left in stock to ship before the gift-giving holidays.\nNES Classic fans: we've got a couple exciting announcements to make in the coming week. Stay tuned for more info soon!\n— Amazon Video Games (@amazongames) December 7, 2016 \n\nEven while Nintendo’s Wii U is on the way out, the company still has one of the most popular gaming consoles this holiday. The NES Classic Edition is easily one of the holiday season’s hottest gifts. Whenever it goes on sale at Walmart or Amazon, the NES Classic sells out almost immediately. And even when you do get an order in, you may have to wait before it’ll show up. I placed an order for one on November 22 from Walmart’s online store, and the retailer still hasn’t even shipped it more than three weeks later due to overselling its supply.\nThe demand is so high that some people have set up bots to purchase all available NES Classics . Those scalpers then flip the NES mini on eBay and elsewhere — often for an extreme profit.\nIf Amazon announces an easy to way to find and buy an NES Classic for $60 without getting cutout by scalpers, then that is big news. But who knows? It’s probably going to announce a Kindle Classic Edition that can play classic games from the Amazon Fire Phone.\n",

      "text": "\nAmazon is willing to experiment with new products. \nThe Dash program fits into Amazon’s strategy of making shopping as easy as possible. \nDash program will be viewed one of Amazon’s successful experiments. \nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) does business in many different categories. What started as an online book retailer is now also selling more than books. One of the big reasons for their success is their willingness to experiment. CEO Jeff Bezos said in Amazon's 2015 Letter to Shareholders , \"To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment. Most large organizations embrace the idea of invention, but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments necessary to get there. Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right… Big winners pay for so many experiments.\" \nAmazon first introduced the Dash program in April 2014 with the Amazon Dash Barcode Scanner. It was available for free to a limited number of AmazonFresh users. The company expanded the Dash program in March 2015 with its Dash Buttons and Dash Replenishment Service. The main theme of the Dash program is to make ordering as easy as possible for customers. \nThe cost to purchase each Dash Button is $4.99, but after your first order Amazon credits your account $4.99. Essentially the buttons are free for customers in exchange for the purchase of the product. If Amazon was just giving away each button for free, they would be taking a loss for each button. \nBut Amazon is not losing money on hardware in hopes of making it easier to purchase products from them. Instead of having to choose between the two, Amazon is both making money with the Dash Buttons and making it easier to purchase products from them. Amazon is paid $15 by participating companies for each button sold. They also receive 15% of each Dash product sale, which is on top of the normal 8-15% commission . When the Dash buttons were first introduced there was a $200,000 buy-in fee for the program. It has been reported that at sometime in 2016, this buy-in fee has been dropped to help grow the program by removing a barricade to entry for some companies. \nThe Dash Buttons fit into Amazon's strategy of making shopping as easy as possible. They want to give their Prime members more reasons not to go their competitors stores. From a financial side, it makes so much sense for Amazon. On top of the normal commission they would usually receive from a sale, they get to add another 15% to that. They also are expecting that by making it easier and more convenient for their customers to make the purchase, their will be more repeat sales. Because of this, Amazon is anticipating that the Dash Buttons will increase their sales volume. \nFor Amazon's partner companies, the Dash program also is beneficial. First, they lock in their customers to their products. Though the Dash program, customers do not have to go to the store to replenish their supply of product they are running low on. This means that they do not see the offerings of their competitors and do not see any possible alternatives. Second, the companies view the Dash buttons as a targeted advertisement to a customer that had purchased one of their product in the past. Seeing your Tide Dash button when walking your washing machine is the reason why the Dash program make sense for Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG ). Third, it is reported that another reason that many companies are participating is to \"maintain close ties to Amazon.\" \nI believe that for participating companies, the Dash program is not only about revenue. Obviously, money is an important consideration in any business decision, but the real value for these companies is the analytics they receive. This is the most valuable part of the Dash program for the partner companies. When a company sells their products through department or grocery stores, they usually do not receive much information other than whether the product is selling or not. Through a traditional subscription plan on Amazon, the brands receive much more data, including demographic information. By participating in the Dash program, companies receive information about the frequency of orders. With all the information available to the participating companies, they can tailor their advertising to better target their customers. \nLooking to the future, Amazon could have a lot of plans for the analytics receive from the Dash Buttons. Fast Company has a few interesting possibilities on how Amazon could use this data. Amazon could build buttons into the product packaging itself. Each button would work once and would be discarded along with the package. Data from Dash Buttons would help Amazon and product makers understand what products and package sizes to offer, as an integrated button would make the packaging pricier. An evolved version of Amazon's Subscribe & Save service could offer more flexible delivery timing, with Amazon's mobile apps and Alexa assistant checking in to make sure you're well-stocked. To make this work, Amazon would need data to understand how purchasing patterns vary for each product, and how those purchases change over time. Amazon's app and Alexa could offer to add new items to your shopping list based on past behavior, along with competing products and other items bought by similar shoppers. Dash Button data would help Amazon figure out the right products and package sizes to recommend. \nThese future possibilities for the Dash program highlight the opportunities that it has. They make ordering easier for the customers and they provide better data for Amazon and its partner companies. \nConsidering that currently the Dash program is just a small part of Amazon's business, how profitable it is will not matter to much to the company as a whole. The real value of the Dash program is analytics. The program looks to be a benefit for Amazon in the future. The program is designed to make purchasing on Amazon easier while providing Amazon with more information. Another positive for Amazon is that the partnering companies are covering any costs from the hardware. In a few years, we will look at the Dash program as one of Amazon's successful experiments.

      "text": "Open Letter to Roy Price, Amazon Dot Com Good Girls Revolt - Yes, we do (Amazon photo) \nDear Roy, \nI just had the great pleasure of watching the best Amazon series I’ve seen to date: Good Girls Revolt . It was released on October 28, right at the start of the busy holiday season with no promotion that I saw, unlike others you have released to significant fanfare. It just quietly showed up in the listings. Intrigued, I turned it on and was hooked instantly. \nI commend Sony Pictures Television for this excellently produced, written, casted and performed based-on-fact series telling the story of the landmark Newsweek sexual discrimination suits of 1970-72. Though fictionalized, it is an accurate portrayal of the lives of women in newsrooms and indeed workplaces throughout the US. I quickly grew to love these women in the series because I know them. They are my mother and sisters, my coworkers, friends - they are me. Their experiences, both professional and personal, are ours. We live them. Their voices too are ours, screaming from the rooftops at the injustices. These are the voices you want to silence. You don’t like them . \nAlong with other viewers, I was stunned to learn that you have refused a second season of this critically acclaimed series. A good business decision, Roy? (You have not earned my deference with an honorific title.) I think not. According to Symphony Advanced Media Good Girls Revolt enjoyed greater numbers of viewers than many other Amazon series including twice the viewers of Transparent . You have only to look at the reviews on your own site to see how popular and appreciated it has been among Prime members. But you didn’t like it. You. One guy in a position of power denying women an earned (by metrics that earn other series continuation) platform for further expression. Gee, why does this sound so familiar? \nYou may have noticed that I don’t use past tense though the series dramatizes events from 1969-70. You think these issues were settled, Roy? You believe that women have achieved equity and no longer suffer harassment, bullying, denied dreams, and worse? Perhaps I can direct you to current news:",

      "title": "Mindful of Amazon, Malls Take the Santa Experience High-Tech",
      "text": "Email Hop on a virtual sleigh ride to the North Pole. Stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter.\" Snap a selfie and see your face on a dancing elf. The Santa experience has gotten a makeover as many malls install shows and games they hope will lure shoppers who are buying more online. About 40 malls in the U.S. and one in London have the high-tech Santa displays, most of them located near major cities that tend to house pricier stores. Taking photos on Santa's lap costs about $30 and up, around the same as at other malls, but most of the malls say people can walk through without purchasing anything. \"It was a half-hour of entertainment that was free,\" says Katie Mass, who took her twin daughters through Santa's Flight Academy, a 3,000-square-foot setup at The Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey . She had gone to the mall to return some dresses, but had to stop when her 2-year olds saw the spectacle. \"They started running,\" says the stay-at-home mom from Westfield, New Jersey. The girls tapped touch screens, pulled levers and watched as flight suits were virtually fit over their bodies on a screen. The final stop was a two-story tall enclosed sleigh that dropped fake snow upon them. One girl made snow angels on the floor while her sister danced under the colorful lasers. \"It was extravagant and well done,\" says Mass. Malls are hoping the over-the-top Santa visits remind people what brick-and-mortar stores can offer. They're increasingly trying to offer special experiences as they compete with online rivals, says Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting group Davidowitz & Associates. \"The parents love it, the kids love it and Amazon can't do it,\" says Davidowitz. Santa's Flight Academy was developed by mall operator Taubman Centers Inc., which spent two years on the idea. After testing it last year at The Mall of San Juan in Puerto Rico, the company rolled it out to 11 other Taubman malls this year, replacing a low-tech ice palace that had housed Santa for years. Like other malls with elaborate Santa sets, Taubman declined to say how much it spent on Santa's Flight Academy. Guy Perry, a manager of a Disney Store at Taubman's Westfarms mall in West Hartford, Connecticut, credited this year's \"great\" store traffic to Santa's Flight Academy. Kids come into the store and tell him how they helped Santa take flight. \"It is getting a lot of good reviews,\" says Perry. An old-school Santa display got the boot at Queens Center in New York as the mall this year installed Santa HQ, a set sponsored by cable TV channel HGTV. As kids stand on the \"Naughty or Nice O'Meter,\" they can watch their names pop up on Santa's \"Nice List\" screen. In another room they can take a selfie and see themselves as dancing elves. In the last room, they're handed tablets that use augmented reality technology to make it appear as if cartoon elves are popping out of the walls and packing gifts. The entire set and trees put on a light show every 20 minutes that is synchronized with holiday music. Quite a difference from last year's Santa setup: A couch and some Christmas trees. \"It's Santa-meets-21st-century-technology,\" says John Scaturro, a marketing manager for the mall. Queens Center's owner, Macerich Co., first installed Santa HQ at some malls two years ago. This year, that expanded to 15 malls from 10. As of November, sales of photos with Santa at Queens Center nearly tripled from last year, says Scaturro. In addition to bringing in shoppers, the set is an advertisement for HGTV. Screens air the network's home improvement and real estate programs. Stars of its shows were set to sign autographs and take photos at two Macerich malls. It's cartoon characters that share the spotlight with Santa at another mall display, the DreamWorks DreamPlace. The set, created by DreamWorks Animation, stars characters from the movie studio's \"Kung Fu Panda\" films — replacing the green ogre from the \"Shrek\" movies that were last year's focus. Thirteen malls are using the set, which uses rumbling seats, wind and mist to create a virtual ride on Santa's sleigh. Whatever malls are spending on the Santa spectacles is worth it, says Davidowitz. Santa has always attracted crowds, he says, but adding a high-tech twist is likely to bring in even more who may stop to shop. \"I don't see many things out there that equal Santa's power to draw crowds,\" he says.

      "text": "  Eros Executive Calls Netflix \"a Friend,\" Amazon a \"Tough Competitor\" in India 2:49 PM PST 12/6/2016 by Georg Szalai Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty Images CFO and president, North America Prem Parameswaran also discusses Disney's decision to stop Bollywood productions. \nIndian film company Eros International, whose Eros Now streaming service is a key growth focus for management, feels optimistic about its outlook despite new streaming competition from Netflix and Amazon, CFO and president of North America Prem Parameswaran said Tuesday. \nSpeaking at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York, he said developing original programming for Eros Now is a big push for the company. \"The cost of making an original in India for us is roughly $2 million-$3 million, and we an do about 24 episodes,\" he said in highlighting one competitive advantage over foreign competitors. \"Compare that to the cost of making a series here, it's probably $40 million-$50 million.\" \nAsked about Netflix, which launched in India early this year, Parameswaran said: \"To us, Netflix is a friend, not a foe. It shows adoption of OTT. They are really more focused on Western content, which we respect.\" The Eros CFO highlighted that Indians like local content, mentioning that only 10 percent of the box office in the country \"is Western\" as \"Indians really want Bollywood content,\" he said. \nAnd Parameswaran added: \"Their prices are much higher, about $8 a sub,\" compared to Bollywood-focused Eros Now's 75 cents-$1.50 per month. \nAmazon is \"a great company\" and \"we like them,\" he said before acknowledging. \"But they are also being a tough competitor.\" Amazon has said it plans to launch its streaming video service in India the near future and has been striking content deals with local production firms. \n\"They have gotten into the market, [and] they have offered to buy digital rights-only from some of the production houses, so not the theatrical distribution,\" Parameswaran said. \"And that has caused a pricing shift at some of the production houses.\" \nWhat does this mean for Eros' approach? \"We have since held steady on our strategy,\" he explained. \"We are not going to by just the digital rights to films. If we are going to do a movie, we need to have both theatrical distribution and digital rights.\" Looking ahead, he said: \"We'll see how it plays out,\" but \"this is certainly causing new competition, but at the same time we like our strategy.\" \nStreaming video is a competitive field in India, Parameswaran told the UBS audience. Eros Now had 1.32 million paying subscribers, the company said last month, adding it expects to end its fiscal year in March with more than 2 million paid users. 21st Century Fox's Star has had success with its hotstar streaming service. \"It's a great product,\" he said. \"They focus primarily on sports and cricket ... They probably have more registered users than any OTT platform in the country. They are doing extremely well.\" \nAsked about Walt Disney's decision this year to shift its focus to driving its Hollywood slate in India and ending Bollywood production “given the challenges with the current economic model for investing in the local film industry,” the CFO said Eros has continued to have about 30 percent-plus film market share in India over the past decade despite deep-pocketed Hollywood competition. \n\"We were still able to sustain our market share,\" he said before adding about Disney's withdrawal from Bollywood films: \"It helps us obviously, that's one less competitor. But we built our business over time.\"",
