Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. Joseph Pisani AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nStarbucks will be unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year with what look to be snowflakes and reindeer, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. \nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. Related content",

      "text": "A flag flies over Starbucks offices in Seattle. (Via Joshua Trujillo, Starbucks) Under an image of an American flag flying above his company’s corporate headquarters in Seattle, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz addressed partners in a post-election post on Tuesday, admitting that he, too, was stunned by Donald Trump’s presidential victory.\nBut the coffee giant’s stores, present in thousands of cities and towns across the United States — no matter the red or blue colors on an election map — must be a place of “inclusion and optimism,” Schultz wrote in the message titled “Onward Together.”\nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz. “Whether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice,” Schultz said. “Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores.”\nLast week, during Starbucks’ quarterly earnings call , Schultz admitted that his company, and indeed society as a whole, was navigating through a difficult time as the campaign season drew to a close. Without predicting an outcome, he expressed concern for the retail sector and said he hoped for a return to a “natural state of affairs in terms of consumer behavior” after the election.\n“I would label this time as just a high degree of uncertainty that obviously is domestically driven but has affected the rest of the world,” Schultz said. “… I don’t think we’ve ever witnessed such concern about what could happen in the U.S. as a result of the election.”\nHere is the full post from Schultz on Tuesday:\nDear Partners,\nLast night, like so many of you, I watched the election returns with family and friends. And like so many of our fellow Americans — both Democrats and Republicans — I am stunned.\nWe cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world. I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.\nAs Americans, we must honor the democratic process. We have a president-elect in Donald Trump, and it is our responsibility as citizens to give him the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together.\nWhether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice. Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores.\nWe can choose to answer the challenges of the day with kindness and compassion. We can choose to listen, to understand and to act with respect. We can choose to live by the values that reside in each of us, and honor our commitment to nurture the human spirit with love, and offer everyone in our stores and communities a place of inclusion and optimism.\nToday, I trust you, and I trust all that is good in our country. Let’s take care of each other and the people in our lives. I believe we will each find the best version of ourselves to help our country move on in the direction we all deserve. Together is where our collective power lies, as partners, and as Americans.\nI am so very proud to be your partner.\nOnward,\nHoward\n",

      "text": "By JOSEPH PISANI - 11/9/16 3:17 PM \nNEW YORK — Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year’s more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10. \nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.",

By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10. \nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.",

      "text": "Snowflakes, Santa look to be back on Starbucks holiday cups AP News Share Tweet \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10. \nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.",

By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday.

By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday.

      "text": "In this Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, photo, Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York. (Photo: Joseph Pisani / AP) \nNew York — Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year’s more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.\nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer.\nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.\nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10.\nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols. \nStarbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nSome fans and observers were concerned Starbucks had abandoned the red holiday cup. The company rolled out a green “unity” cup on Nov. 1 , the same day its holiday beverage lineup debuted. ",

By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday.

Joseph Pisani AP Photo 1 of 2 Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nStarbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer. \nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10. \nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.

ADVERTISEMENT In a public letter to his company on Wednesday, Schultz said “we must honor the democratic process” and give the president-elect “the opportunity to govern well and bring our country together.”\n“Whether you are pleased or disappointed by the outcome, we each still have a choice,” he wrote. “Today and every day, we have a choice in how we treat one another in our homes, in our neighborhoods, and of course in our stores.” \nSchultz was a vocal opponent of Trump and endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton \n“We've seen such vitriolic display of bigotry and hate and divisiveness, and that is not the leadership we need for the future of the country,” he said about Trump, according to Business Insider . \nBut his post-election letter urged people to move beyond the rhetoric of the campaign. \n\"We cannot know what the precise impact will be on our country and the rest of the world,\" he wrote. \"I am hopeful that we will overcome the vitriol and division of this unprecedented election season.\" Tags:",

Now that’s something that could really Make America Great Again. Unfortunately, that’s not happening either. \nAccording to a Bloomberg report , Alphabet’s Project Wing unit has put the kibosh on a partnership with Starbucks. \nThe report says Google’s parent company is making cutbacks within the drone division and apparently delivering pumpkin spice lattes to office workers who can’t get out on their lunch breaks is no longer a priority. \nRelated: What is Project Wing and when will it take off? \nIn an email, a spokesperson for Alphabet X wrote: “ Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world . \n\"What we’re doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems.\" \nAlthough the Starbucks deliveries are off the table for now, Google is still on track with its plans for an express burrito service. In September it inked a deal with the Chipotle, the purveyors of marginally flavorful Mexican food. \nGoogle’s drone strategy has shifted focus to the commercial market following early plans to delivery health cares supplies. \nAlphabet is in direct competition with Amazon, who plans to deliver items from its online store through the Air Prime initiative. \nWatch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week 0 shares",

But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer.\nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015’s plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.\nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was “a symbol of unity.” Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10.\nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.\nIn this Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2016, photo, Starbucks holiday cups appear on display at a store in New York.

      "text": "DEARBORN, Michigan (AFP) — At a Starbucks cafe in Dearborn, Michigan, 25-year-old Mona Musid was glued to her laptop, watching a YouTube video of President-elect Donald Trump’s victory speech. This Detroit suburb is home to one of the biggest populations of Muslims and Arabs in the United States, and Musid was among many in her community on Wednesday trying to make sense of the brash Republican’s election. “I’m just interested in what he has to say, and where it’s going to go,” she said, listening for clues in the victory speech of what her immediate future might look like.\nMusid said many in her extended family, who are of Yemeni ancestry and trace their US roots back to the 1940s, are in a state of shock and worry.\n“They don’t know what’s going to go on. They came here for opportunity. They’re just worried if he takes it away from us,” she said.\nDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks with patrons at Miller’s Bar on November 4, 2016 in Dearborn, Michigan. (AFP/Brendan Smialowski)\nTrump’s campaign rhetoric included calls for a ban on Muslim immigrants entering the US, followed by promises of “extreme vetting” of immigrants from countries affected by terrorism.\nAcross the country, Muslim Americans are now wondering what a Trump presidency might mean, said Hazem Bata, head of the Islamic Society of North America, a national advocacy group.\n“What I’m hearing is a mixture of fear and concern,” Bata said.\n“Many people feel vulnerable. Many Muslims here are not necessarily US citizens. They’re here legally, but they’re not US citizens. They’re concerned. Some are outright scared.”\nDuring his victory speech, Trump offered a conciliatory tone.\n“I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all of Americans,” Trump said. “All races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs.”\nMalaysian Muslim school girls pose for a selfie with a cut-out of the US presidential candidate Donald Trump during an event to follow the election results in Kuala Lumpur on November 9, 2016. (AFP/Manan Vatsyayana)\nBut those words rang hollow for three sisters at The Lava Lounge, a popular lunch hangout in Dearborn.\nTelevision news blared in front of the three fifth-generation Americans of Lebanese descent. Alyse, one of the three, who didn’t want to give her full name, said Trump’s ascendancy exposed “how much hatred there is within our country.”\n“The damage is irreversible,” she said.\n“I feel like hard times are gonna come,” added her sister Nadeen Hider, 24. “Within one night, 60 years of progression was wiped clean.”\nTrump’s victory was also as much a source of confusion as fear.\nAt the Muslim American Youth Academy in Dearborn — an elementary and middle school — children in the morning were asking questions of each other and their parents.\n“How could they elect Trump over Hillary Clinton?,” asked one youngster to a group of peers and adults, who offered no answer.\nProtestors hold signs against US President-elect Donald Trump on November 9, 2016 in front of the White House in Washnigton, DC. (AFP/Nicholas Kamm)\n“Four years of nothingness,” a young girl exclaimed as she entered the school with her parents.\nFor some, the consequences of Trump’s victory were direct and immediate.\nHiba Nasser, 19, a sophomore at Wayne State University in Detroit, said she was afraid to leave her home Wednesday morning.\nNasser wears a hijab, the traditional Muslim head covering, and was concerned that Trump’s victory would embolden those who might target her. She said she already endures occasional harassment.\n“People tell me I’m a terrorist, that my being in this country is wrong, that I should go,” Nasser said.\nHowever, there was also a counter-narrative among Muslim Americans in Dearborn — many of whom have lived in the US for decades and are less concerned about immigration issues.\nDemonstrators hold placards that read ‘No to racism, No to Trump’ during a protest outside the US Embassy in London on November 9, 2016 against US President-elect Donald Trump after he was declared the winner of the US presidential election. (AFP/Ben Stansall)\nOften not wishing to be identified by name, several told AFP that they were happy with Trump’s victory, because they did not trust Clinton.\nWhile buying breakfast at New Yasmeen’s Bakery, Hassan Elhassani, 33, said Trump was the lesser of two bad choices.\n“I am not concerned by (Trump’s) rhetoric,” said Elhassani, who emigrated from Lebanon 17 years ago and is a US citizen.\n“If you are a citizen, he can’t change nothing.”\n ",

But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and other holiday symbols.Starbucks Corp. says its plans are still under wraps and declined to say more about the cups. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997.",

Snowflakes, reindeer and candy canes are back on Starbucks holiday coffee cups, after last year’s plain red cups caused uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. (AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) comments NEW YORK — Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas.\nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday. But a New York store had a display Tuesday showing 10 different cups it said were designed by customers around the world, some featuring ornaments, Santa Claus and reindeer.\nStarbucks Corp. said its plans are still under wraps and declined to confirm that the cups on display were the holiday ones. It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain.\nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10.\nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.",

      "title": "Trump's Impact On Tech; GoPro's Drone Recall; Google Drone Nixes Starbucks -- Eye On Tech",
      "text": "Trump's impact will be felt throughout a number of sectors, including tech. \nGoPro recalls all of its Karma drones, already. \nGoogle's Project Wing cuts ties with Starbucks in a move to save money. I think many of us here are still stunned by what we've seen from the 2016 presidential election. I know I am. My wife and I agreed that we wouldn't watch the results; that we would watch some shows, head to bed early and see what happened in the morning. So what happened? Fresh off a six-season binge of Game of Thrones that ended Monday, we weren't able to isolate ourselves in Westeros-based bliss. To pass the time, we watched one episode of Shameless - where we heard this gem of a song - watched Detroit Red Wing's Andreas Athanasiou dangle a beauty across the goal line , drank probably a bit too much Jameson and laid anxiously in bed jumping between Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ), Google's (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) (NASDAQ: GOOG ) \"election results\" page and the futures quotes, the last of which showed devastating losses that ultimately never materialized, (in fact, just the opposite). So now that all that's over, where do we go from here? There's a number of sectors that could ultimately feel Trump's impact when he takes office in January. But for the sake of this column's focus, we're only go to look at tech. The impact potential is pretty wide-ranging. First there's the AT&T (NYSE: T ) deal to buy Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ), which Trump has said \"deals like this destroy democracy\" and reasoned that his administration would never sign off on a deal like that. Then there's the hit to solar. With the GOP occupying the Oval Office and Congress, pessimism quickly swelled around going green. The Guggenheim Solar ETF (NYSEARCA: TAN ) is down 5.5% on the day, while shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) were under pressure too. Tesla of course, is reliant on electric car sales and the likely-soon-to-be business of SolarCity (NASDAQ: SCTY ). Without government backing a move from fossil fuels to clean energy, these companies could face an uphill battle over the next four years or so. Don't forget about Trump's issue with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), which stems from CEO Jeff Bezos' ownership of the Washington Post. He's criticized WaPo, as well as Amazon's tax structure, both of which could be a focus from the president when he takes office. \n\"Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. [Bezos is] using the Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed…he's using [the Washington Post] as a tool for political power against me and against people and I'll tell you what, we can't let him get away with it.\" Finally, there's Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), which is in an interesting position and can be viewed as sort of a bellwether in this situation. Not just for tech, but in general, because it is one of the companies that depends massively on overseas manufacturing. On the one hand, Apple is set to benefit the most from Trump's plan to allow the repatriation of overseas cash at a substantially lower tax rate of about 10% . One analysts estimates that 91% of Apple's $238 billion in cash resides abroad, which along with a far lower tax rate, would be a boon for Apple's bottom line. However, a bottom-line nightmare may come true should Trump impose strict trade laws, particularly with China, which he has been highly critical of in the past. Whether those tariffs would be passed on to consumers or eaten by Apple (or a combination of both) is yet to be decided. That is assuming the tariffs indeed come to fruition. But given Trump's opposition to the current globalization at hand, it would seem that some form of negatively will arise from this situation. It impacts more than just Apple and tech, like apparel companies and automakers for instance, but it's still way too early to tell how it will all shake out. Will Apple's potential benefit of lower taxes and cash repatriation offset or even trump the negative impact from more strict trade deals? The answer is unclear, which is probably why the stock is down about on the day, while major indices power higher. Recall Woes We're not talking about Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) this time. Instead, it's GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO ), which has seen its shares fall another 4% Wednesday in what has more to do with a recent product recall than the outcome of the election. GoPro has recalled all of its Karma drones \"because 'in a very small number of cases' the Karmas lost power while in use.\" The device was released a few weeks ago, with unit sales totaling about 2,500. The recall has drawn the ire of analysts too, who cite the company's delayed product launch to ensure high quality, along with production issues with the Hero 5 camera as reasons to be disgruntled with the stock. It's just one thing after the other with GoPro. When will it stop tripping over its own two feet? The stock is down 25% this month and it's a surprise it's not down more than that. Last Friday, the company reported a 40% drop in sales, missed EPS   and provided full-year and 2017 guidance that disappointed investors. Somehow, that wasn't enough to flush the stock to new lows and even with more bad news this week, it's still comfortably above those levels. Even if the stock doesn't trade lower on bad news anymore - which isn't the case today, but could indicate the stock has bottomed - I wouldn't be a buyer, personally. Last week, we wrapped up by saying : GoPro is the unquestioned leader in action cameras. And the drone is pretty cool, no doubt. But a great product doesn't make a great business, and that's the dilemma this company faces right now. At some point, Fitbit (NYSE: FIT ) and GoPro will have value. But I'm not going to be the one sticking my neck out to find it. I stand by that. Make That Two Drones Down Google's drone-delivery project has showed some entertaining and convenient potential for the future. But at least for now, it won't be delivering your Frappuccino from Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ). The company announced that it has scrapped Starbucks from its partnerships involved in the Project Wing operation. Was it a dispute that led to the tie-cutting? Actually no. It was a cost-cutting move by Google. The end of its relationship with Starbucks wasn't the only move though, as Project Wing halts hiring and looks to shift some employees to other projects. We saw similar actions from the company's Google Fiber unit. This has got CFO Ruth Porat written all over it, if you ask me - and I mean that in a good way! Porat was brought in to show some financial discipline in a company that has typically not worried too much about what outsiders thought of its plans. It spent freely on projects and on acquisitions, getting itself into all sorts of diverse industries. At times this was good and in other instances, it was bad. Porat joined Google in May 2015 and shares are up 45% since - no small task for a large company, one that now sports a $550 billion market cap. The 18 months prior to her arrival? A gain of just 7%. The comparison might not be perfect, but her effect has been felt. Since her arrival, the company has beat on EPS estimates 5 of the past 6 quarters. Before that, Alphabet had missed earnings estimates 6 quarters in a row . On the revenue side, Google has beat estimates on 4 of the past 6 quarters, while only going 2-for-6 prior to Porat's arrival. With this track record, I wouldn't question where Porat decides to tighten and loosen the purse strings when it comes to the company's projects and ambitions. Clearly, she's doing a fine job on her own. Disclosure: I am/we are long SBUX.   Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

      "text": "November 9, 2016 Customer Experience Starbucks Unveils 2016 Holiday Red Cups Share Instagram Downloads \nFor many, when Starbucks red cups return, it’s a signal that the holiday season is drawing near. \nSince 1997, Starbucks has welcomed the holidays with a special red cup that celebrates the spirit of the season. Over the years, designs have ranged from the modern, using whimsical brushstrokes in bold colors, to the nostalgic, featuring mistletoe and ornaments. This year, for the first time, Starbucks red cups will feature designs created by customers with 13 distinct cups in stores starting tomorrow (November 10). \n“We hope that this year’s red holiday cup designs express the shared spirit of the holidays as told by our customers,” said Sharon Rothstein, Starbucks global chief marketing officer. \nFor years Starbucks customers have been decorating their white cups (Starbucks even held a contest to support this creativity). Taking a cue from customers who had been using their red holiday cups as a canvas, last December Starbucks invited customers to share their designs on Instagram. \n\nFrom Illinois to Indonesia, Pennsylvania to Korea, Dubai to Ontario, in just eight days, Starbucks received more than 1,200 individual submissions from 13 countries. Many of the images were featured in an online cup collection . \n“We were surprised and inspired by the amount of incredible art submitted by our customers, the designs were beautiful, expressive and engaging,” said Dena Blevins, creative director, Starbucks Global Creative Studio. “We quickly realized there was potential to use the customer created art for our holiday cups.” Related: Meet the Customers Who Designed Starbucks 2016 Red Cups \nThe Starbucks Creative team printed each design posted to social channels and noticed the themes that began to emerge – graphic, inspirational, intricate, seasonal, typographic. No customer names were included, just a photo of the cup that was submitted. \n“We loved how the red cups with white designs naturally created a collection,” Blevins said. “They hang together as one idea but each expression is unique.” \nNext, the Starbucks team asked a small group of customers to mail in their cup so that it could be evaluated for potential production. The team worked to honor the artists and the integrity of their artwork, making as few changes as possible to the original. \nIn the end, 13 customer designs were selected from six countries to represent the collective spirit of the holidays around the world. Their designs will be showcased on the holiday cups served in the more than 25,000 Starbucks stores in 75 countries. \n“People will be walking around the street in Shanghai, New York and London carrying these cups,” Blevins said. “We love that this year our customers’ artistry can play a part in brightening someone’s day.” \n ",

(AP Photo/Joseph Pisani) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks is unveiling its holiday coffee cups for this year and appears to be bringing back snowflakes, candy canes and other holiday symbols, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nThe coffee chain was set to roll out the red cups to stores Thursday.

It has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company unveiled a new green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\" Three days later, Starbucks released a 30-second online video that said its holiday cups were returning Nov. 10. \nThe company plans to officially unveil its holiday cup plans Wednesday evening.",

In all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops.

The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. The company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \"It's just a cup,\" he joked. For the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo.

The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nThe company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols.

The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nThe company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down.

By JOSEPH PISANIAP Business Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Snowflakes, Santa Claus and reindeer are returning to Starbucks' holiday cups this year, after last year's more subdued red cups caused an uproar from critics who said the chain was part of a so-called war on Christmas. \nIn all, 13 different cups will hit stores around the world Thursday. Eleven of them will be available in U.S. shops. The cups were designed by customers who uploaded pictures of their designs on Instagram last year, the company said Wednesday. \nStarbucks has released holiday cups every year since 1997. The outcry over 2015's plainer red cup grew after now President-elect Donald Trump suggested boycotting the chain. \nThe company was surprised by last year's controversy, CEO Howard Schultz said at an event in New York on Wednesday where the designs were displayed. \n\"It's just a cup,\" he joked. \nFor the holiday cups, the company said it received 1,200 designs from customers online and narrowed them down. All the cups for hot drinks are red and have white designs featuring candy canes, ornaments or other holiday symbols. The one cup for iced drinks has a wreath wrapped around the Starbucks mermaid logo. \nLast week, the Seattle-based company also unveiled a green cup ahead of Election Day that it said was \"a symbol of unity.\"",

(Donald Trump, our new president-elect, even proposed a boycott of the coffee chain one year ago.)\n\"So this year, after 24 consecutive years of designing a red cup that will be seen all over the world, we decided to do something quite different,\" Schultz told the crowd. \"With everything that's going on in the world, and everything that's going on in our country, we have a lot to be thankful for.\"\nNancy Poznoff speaks at the launch event.\nImage: sophie hirsh/mashable\nNancy Poznoff, the VP of Marketing at Starbucks, then came on stage. She explained that last year, Instagram garnered 1,200 displays of red cup art from 13 different countries over the course of eight days. In representation of those 13 countries, 13 women's designs were chosen.\nShe then welcomed 11 of the 13 cup designers up to the stage. The women represent various American cities as well as Indonesia, Dubai, Canada, Russia and South Korea.\n“I love the Christmas season so I was really inspired. To me, the color red symbolizes the celebration of love and life,” Anz Soza, one of the designers from Dubai, said.\n“The magnolia symbolizes friends and love and the hedge sparrow represents faith and creativity. I hope that my design inspires people to joyfully love life and be creative, even when faced with tough times,\" said Florencia, from Bandung, Indonesia.\nImage: starbucks\nImage: starbucks\nImage: sophie hirsh/mashable\nThere is also a holiday-themed iced coffee cup, designed by Tracy from Los Angeles.\n“I love the nature and the woods, so I decided to illustrate a wooden wreath with ornaments of various shapes and patterns,\" Tracy said. \"Topping it all off is some snow, a bow and a dash of holiday spirit.”\nImage: starbucks\nAfter an emotional election night and a decision that has reminded me and millions of other women that yes, in fact, we still have a long way to go, seeing 11 proud young women on stage felt like it mattered.\nBelieve me, I was not expecting to find solace today at a Starbucks cup launch event. But seeing a powerful American corporation positively employing the designs of 13 diverse women means something.\nNo matter what the design is, Starbucks' holiday cups are sure to cause a stir for years to come, and it will be particularly interesting to see what sort of drama they cause this year.\nImage: starbucks\nThe 2016 red cups will be available at 25,000 Starbucks locations across 75 countries starting Thursday, Nov. 10.",

      "title": "Starbucks is bringing back its red holiday cups — but this year there's a twist (SBUX)",
      "text": "Starbucks \nThe holiday season has officially begun — at least at Starbucks.\nStarbucks debuted not one but 13 new holiday red cup designs on Wednesday. The coffee chain will begin serving beverages in the new cups on Thursday morning. \nSince Starbucks launched holiday cups in 1997, its red cups have become a holiday mainstay.\nLast year, Starbucks faced backlash when the company debuted minimalist red cups that some complained weren't \"Christmas-y\" enough. After evangelist and internet personality Joshua Feuerstein posted a video on Facebook protesting the cups, the outrage — and outrage at the outrage  — quickly grew, with hundreds sharing their views on social media.  \nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz referenced the controversy at an event in New York City on Wednesday where the new cups were unveiled. \n\n\"Should we just go back to last year and come out with a great red cup... and perhaps start another firestorm?\" Schultz said. \"We didn't think that was such a good idea.\"\nStarbucks \nSo, the company turned to customers for inspiration. The 13 designs are inspired by customers' photos of their decorated red cups, posted on Instagram last year. \nThe red cups are Starbucks' second seasonal cups of 2016. \nIn the week or so leading up to the election, Starbucks debuted a green cup  that featured  an illustration showing the faces of more than 100 people, drawn with a single continuous line. The cup was intended to encourage unity during what Schultz called a \" divisive time in our country.\"  \nInstead, many customers were critical of the cups. While some people were simply confused about the color, others accused  the coffee chain of \"political brainwashing\" with the new cups.   \nDespite social media blowback, Starbucks has long maintained their cups are an apolitical holiday tradition.  Some of the backlash may be due, not to the cups themselves, but CEO Schultz's own political opinions.  \nSchultz has long been an outspoken figure when it comes to politics, known for his support of progressive causes. In September he endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for president. \nOn Wednesday morning, Schultz sent a  solemn note to his company's more than 120,000 US employees , saying he was \"stunned\" by Donald Trump's election and encouraging the  chain's workers to move \"onward together.\" \nNOW WATCH: We put the most popular frozen pizzas to the test — the winner was clear \n",
