      "title": "'Stranger Things' Season 2 Adds Sean Astin, Paul Reiser as New Characters",
      "text": "by Katie Roberts \nFilming is already underway on the sophomore season of Netflix sensation \" Stranger Things ,\" and the '80s-set series is doubling down on its homages to pop culture from that decade with some high-profile new additions to the cast. \nEntertainment Weekly reports that the show has landed Sean Astin and Paul Reiser to play two new characters with connections to the core gang, and both actors have roles in their past that wink to some of the streaming series's main influences. \"Lord of the Rings\" star Astin played the lead in 1985's beloved kids adventure flick \"The Goonies\" (to which \"Stranger Things\" has been compared), while \"Mad About You\" star Reiser had a key role as a villain in \"Aliens,\" a sequel that \"Stranger Things\" creators Ross and Matt Duffer previously told EW was part of their inspiration for Season 2. \nIn addition to Astin and Reiser, Danish actress Linnea Berthelsen has also joined the ensemble. Here's a breakdown of the three new characters, according to Netflix and EW: Astin will play Bob Newby, \"a kindhearted former nerd who went to high school with Joyce (Winona Ryder) and Hopper (David Harbour) and now manages the local Hawkins RadioShack.\" Reiser will play Dr. Owens, \"a high-ranking member within the Department of Energy on a 'clean-up' assignment, tasked with containing the events of last year.\" Berthelsen will play Roman, \"an emotionally damaged, magnetic young woman who suffered a great loss as a child. Although she does not live in Hawkins, she is mysteriously connected to the supernatural events at the lab...\" \nSeason two of \"Stranger Things\" is in production now. It's expect to debut on Netflix sometime in 2017",

      "text": "Telus debuts hundreds of hours of Netflix content in 4K on Optik TV \nRose Behar \nNovember 7, 2016 4:23pm \nTelus Optik TV customers can now watch Stranger Things and other Netflix exclusive content without additional hardware. \nThe carrier has announced that the streaming service is now available directly through its Optik TV 4K set-top boxes, providing additional video content to subscribers and eliminating the need for them to buy devices like Google Chromecast to facilitate streaming. \n“We’re making it easy for Telus customers to enjoy the most binge-worthy 4K content on the market by offering convenient access to all of their favourite shows in one place,” said Blair Miller, Telus vice-president of content, in a statement issued to MobileSyrup . \nThe addition of Netflix brings more to 4K Optik TV’s fairly minimal line-up of content, which includes TSN 4K, Stingray Ambiance, a collection of On Demand movies, Optik Local content and Adrenaline Sports On Demand. \nTelus launched Optik TV in British Columbia and Alberta on July 20, 2016, becoming the first telecom to offer 4K programming in Western Canada (which includes Manitoba and Saskatchewan). \nTo get Netflix in 4K, Telus customers will need a Netflix Premium account, a 4K TV, a 4K-enabled PVR box and Internet 50. The current price for Optik TV and Internet 50 comes in at $130 per month . ",

      "text": "The smash hit Netflix series \"Stranger Things\" is about paying tribute to the sci-fi and horror shows of the 1980s. So the casting of some stars of the era makes total sense. A rep for Netflix confirmed to ABC News that Sean Astin , one of the stars of the classic 1985 movie \"The Goonies\" — which is somewhat similar to \"Stranger Things\" in plot — has joined the cast as Bob Newby. The character is a former nerd and high school classmate of Will Byers' mom, Joyce Byers, and Sheriff Hopper and is now the manager of the local RadioShack. \n\nNetflix \nScene from the Netflix original, \"Stranger Things.\" \n\nWinona Ryder 'Sick' of Being Shamed for Being Sensitive \n\nWhy Winona Ryder Never Got Married \nMeanwhile, Paul Reiser, who memorably played a villain in the 1986 sci-fi horror movie \"Aliens,\" has also come on board.

      "text": "'Grimm' spinoff after Season 6 possible; Netflix bidding the series for Season 7? By RG Nov 07, 2016 06:43 AM EST Comic-Con International 2016 - 'Grimm' Panel Advertisement \nNBC's occult drama series, Grimm , had been announced that its upcoming season will be the last. Following this, fans were disappointed as they had expected that the series will extend for further seasons, basing on the number of viewers the show has. \nBut they are once again excited when rumors have started appearing regarding the series' possible spinoff. According to Counsel & Heal , Grimm might have a spinoff after the release of all its episodes in the sixth season, and it will probably focus on Silas Weir Mitchell's character, Monroe, and Bree Turner's character, Rosalee Calvert. Advertisement \nIt can be recalled that an addition to the fans' disappointments, aside from the confirmed cancellation of the seventh season by NBC, is the lesser episodes to be aired for the sixth season, from 22 episodes to only 13 episodes. \nBecause of this, fans and viewers of the drama series have started a petition on Change.org , calling out Netflix, to pick up the show after NBC announced that the sixth season will be the last. The petition currently has more than 10,000 supporters and this has also started the rumor that the network might be bidding for the series, to the excitement of the fans. \nAccording to Movie News Guide , it is possible that Netflix might pick up Grimm because of its significant number of supporters and viewers all around the world, and for its unique cultural diversity as well. Since the petition on convincing NBC to extend the series did not work because the network seemed to have its final decision, fans are now hoping that Netflix will be the one to get their hopes up. \nHowever, the speculations are still not confirmed by the network or with any related parties, and fans are just waiting for the official announcement as of this moment. Advertisement \nMeanwhile, in Season 6, fans can expect to find answers from their questions in season 5. It can be remembered that Juliette Silverton, portrayed by Bitsie Tulloch, had been transformed into a Hexenbiest in the final episodes of the previous season, so viewers can expect a transformed Juliette in the upcoming season. \nIt has also been reported by the source that the child of the Wesen couple, which fans can also expect in Season 6, might be just as powerful as the Adalind's children. \nGrimm Season 6 will premiere on January 6, 2017, at 8 PM EDT on NBC. © 2016 HNGN , All rights reserved.

      "text": "PHOTO COURTESY OF NETFLIX \nMatt Smith and Claire Foy star as the Royal Couple in Netflix's \"The Crown.\" \nIf you want to make a TV show about Queen Elizabeth II, you pretty much have to go through Peter Morgan. \nMorgan not only wrote the acclaimed drama “The Queen” starring Helen Mirren, he followed it up with “The Audience,” a stage play that also starred Mirren as QEII. So it’s fitting that Morgan is the creator of the ambitious new Netflix series “The Crown,” a six-season series that premiered its first season last weekend. \n“The Crown” will look at the long reign of Queen Elizabeth, with each season looking at a different decade. It’s hard to see how future seasons will be able to match the drama of this engrossing first season, which looks at how a young Elizabeth (Claire Foy) ascended to the throne. \nThe appeal of such a series is to get a glimpse into the person beneath the crown, the human being behind the throne. “The Crown” is at its best when it shows Elizabeth and Philip as real people dealing with the burden of reigning over the British Commonwealth. \nDirected by Stephen Daldry (“The Hours”), the first episode features the lavish 1947 ceremony of Elizabeth’s wedding to the future Prince Philip (Matt Smith, who was the eleventh Doctor Who). But the series actually opens with a more private, but perhaps far more telling ritual – Philip giving up his Greek nationality in order to marry the daughter of King George VI (Jared Harris). He’s giving up a part of himself in order to become part of something larger, and it’s the nature of that transaction defines so much of “The Crown.” \nHarris (“Mad Men”) is great as King George VI (as played by Colin Firth in “The King’s Speech”), who passes away from lung disease in the second episode. The other big name in the series is John Lithgow, who hunches over and scowls merrily as Winston Churchill. But Lithgow goes beyond caricature in playing Churchill, who carries himself as “the Father of the Nation” even out of power, which gives him a special, complex relationship with the royals. He’ll be missed in future seasons. Don't miss a thing. Get a Cap Times daily summary sent to your inbox Sign Up!

Which is why it’s so important to have the right person by your side,” he responds. Whether she has becomes one of the central questions of the series. \n“The Crown” is a sumptuous, spare-no-expense kind of drama, and one that will likely appeal to fans of “Downton Abbey” and other “Masterpiece Theatre” dramas. But I still wonder if it can sustain this level of drama and interest in future seasons. It’s been a long reign indeed. \nAlso on streaming: Cinephiles rejoice! The new streaming site Filmstruck , a partnership between the Criterion Collection and Turner Classic Movies, launched last week at filmstruck.com . As Netflix cuts back on its film titles, especially classic films, it seems like an essential site for film lovers, especially since the Criterion films will include many of the bonus features available on the DVD editions. A subscription is $7 per month for just the Filmstruck titles, $11 per month for Filmstruck plus Criterion films, or $99 a year for a full annual membership. Tags",

She also sent the message that with time things can improve. \n“Recovery is possible,” she added in another tweet soon after. “Please don’t give up on yourself.” \nAlthough Purser won’t be back for the second season of the hit Netflix supernatural series, fans will still get a chance to more of her acting soon. In the wake of the breakthrough as Barb, the teen has been cast in the CW’s live-action Archie Comics series “Riverdale” and the upcoming Melissa McCarthy movie “Life of the Party.” Share this:",

      "text": "In the United States, Netflix and Amazon Prime are the two most popular purveyors of subscription-video on-demand (SVOD) services. With both of those players (and Netflix in particular) beginning to reach a high level of saturation within the American market, they have turned overseas , where they hope to attract international audiences in order to continue to grow their subscriber numbers.\nIndia, which now counts a population of more than 1.2 billion people, is a particularly juicy target for America’s SVOD giants, and now that Indian consumers are showing more interest in online video , Netflix and Amazon are making overtures to them. In recent days, both companies have laid out plans to attract new subscribers within the South Asian nation. In Amazon’s case, the plan includes a major price cut; Netflix, on the other hand, is looking to help Indians account for limited bandwidth.\nA subscription to Amazon Prime costs $99 per year in the U.S., but in India, that service is available for just $15 per year, and a recent deal — which Mashable calls an “introductory offer” — will chop that price in half once again, to $7.50. For the denizens of a country whose average GDP per capita is significantly lower than the U.S.’, that price cut is attractive. It also makes Amazon a much cheaper choice than Netflix; for the price of a one-month Netflix subscription, an Indian consumer can now get an entire year of Amazon Prime.\nAll that’s left is for Amazon to actually launch its video service in India, though it seems as if that will happen soon, and some content deals are already in place. Netflix, on the other hand, is already available in India, and its first deal for an original Indian series occurred four months before Amazon’s . Now, Netflix’s main goal is to ensure that its Indian viewers can actually stream its content. It has announced its plan to create an offline mode that will let users download videos during non-peak hours. While it hasn’t specifically mentioned India as a region where that feature would be deployed, though its Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos specifically noted the “undeveloped world” as a target . A similar feature developed by YouTube over the past couple of years is marketed to Indian Internet users. CNBC notes that Amazon Video already has an offline mode as well.\nIn terms of price and ease of streaming, Amazon has the edge over Netflix, but the latter company’s content plans seem much more fully developed. The battle between the two SVOD platforms for South Asian supremacy will be interesting to watch; whichever one grabs a bigger market share will likely be rewarded with millions of new subscribers.\nVisit Tubefilter for more great stories.\n",

      "title": "Netflix Adds Some Big Names to the Cast of Stranger Things’ Second Season",
      "text": "10 Geeky Halloween Decorations to Give Your Guests a Fright \nThe first season of Stranger Things had a largely unknown cast, but some famous faces, such as Matthew Modine and Winona Ryder, were peppered in to add even more to the 1980s nostalgia permeating the series. In season two, this trend will continue. \nSean Astin and Paul Reiser will join the cast for season two, along with Danish star Linnea Berthelsen. \nAstin, known mostly for his work in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and 80s films like Goonies , will be playing Bob Newby, who went to high school with Joyce and Hopper and now runs a Hawkins RadioShack. He’s been described as a “kind-hearted nerd.” \nReiser, known for Aliens and Mad About You , seems to be taking the place of Modine’s Department of Energy character. He’ll be playing Dr. Owens, who is a high-ranking member of the organization tasked with clean-up after the events of season one. \nBerthelsen is a relative unknown (her IMDB page only contains a few short films) but has been cast as Roman. According to Netflix , Roman is “an emotionally damaged, magnetic young woman who suffered a great loss as a child. Although she does not live in Hawkins, she is mysteriously connected to the supernatural events at the lab…” \nI’m sure there was something intentional about Astin and Reiser’s casting, at least considering their connections with 80s nostalgia properties. Stranger Things has a lot in common with both The Goonies and Aliens , and while both are great actors, there’s also probably an amount of pandering involved–not that there’s anything wrong with that. Stranger Things is all about nostalgia pandering, but it does it well. \nThe three actors join a growing list of new cast members, including Sadie Sink ( Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt ) and Dacre Montgomery (from the new Power Rangers film). The two will be playing Max and Billy, who are mysterious step-siblings who live in the town. Max is described as a tough, shy girl with a “complicated history” and Billy as “violent and unpredictable.” \n“There’s definitely a handful of really compelling new characters this season, but absolutely servicing the core group first and foremost,” executive producer Shawn Levy told The Hollywood Reporter . “Like the show itself, it’s multigenerational new characters and really, really intriguing ones.” \nProduction has already begun on our favorite sleeper horror show, which is set to premiere its next season in 2017. The crew has already posted the first image from production. sƃuıɥʇɹǝƃuɐɹʇs#",

      "text": "What we learned about Marvel movies and Netflix shows from Comic-Con \nThe cast for The Defenders only continues to grow with the announcement Monday that Elektra–who seemed to die at the end of Daredevil’s second season, will be returning to the Marvel Netflixverse. \nElodie Yung will reprise her role as the assassin in the upcoming team-up series, which already has a full cast pulling from the four other series (not mentioned in the previous article is that Jessica Henwick , who plays Colleen Wing in Iron Fist will be in The Defenders ). \nNetflix confirmed the news on its Twitter page. \n— The Defenders (@TheDefenders) November 7, 2016 \nElektra re-entered Matt Murdock’s life in season two after knowing him in college. While the two seemed to be rekindling a relationship at first, we found out that she had less than genuine intentions with reconnecting. This was all before she was taken by the Hand and revealed to be The Black Sky, a weapon with unknown powers. Of course, even after turning away from the Hand and joining Matt, she dies. \nBut because this is comics, and nothing ever stays dead in comics, Elektra’s body was seen being put into a large stone urn. Considering Nobu’s return from death, it’s most likely that Elektra will be resurrected by the Hand. She is, after all, one of their most prized weapons and will do… something for them. \nDaredevil season two left a lot of questions unanswered, especially when it comes to the Hand, possibly as a way to build up mystery before the Defenders take it on. It’s still unclear what the Black Sky is and what that even means. In season one, we know that Stick killed another version of the Black Sky, which was a young boy. So we know it’s a person, but whether that means the person has powers or is just a symbol is unclear. \nWe weren’t keen on the way Elektra’s story was done in the Daredevil . She started off strong but ended up just becoming a tool to be passed around from group to group by the end of the season with no consistent character of her own. We hope that her next appearance will add a bit more to the character. Share",

      "text": "\nA lot of story unfolds in the premiere episode of Netflix’s new royal drama, The Crown . Replete with a lavishly, cinematic production , the ambitious series spans several years in it first episode alone. It begins in 1947, shortly before a then-Princess Elizabeth’s wedding and progresses from there.\nThe Crown ‘s first season is comprised of 10 episodes. They briefly chronicle Elizabeth II’s life before becoming the Queen of England, and then focus on the period after she unexpectedly takes the reins in her mid-twenties.\nHere are the 5 major plot points from Netflix’s The Crown , Episode 1: “Wolferton Splash”…\nKing George VI tried so valiantly to overcome his stammer… #TheCrown pic.twitter.com/RWAr91OhlG \n— The Crown (@TheCrownNetflix) November 6, 2016 \n1. King George is dying \nThe Crown opens on a coughing King George VI (Jared Harris), as the ailing monarch preps for a final ceremony before his daughter can marry Philip Mountbatten (Matt Smith), Duke of Edinburgh.\nAs the episode progresses George’s health declines. His blood addled coughing fits eventually lead to a dire cancer diagnosis. George is not initially made aware of his own prognosis.\n[Image by Robert Viglasky/Netflix] 2. Princess Elizabeth II marries a controversial husband \nDespite some controversy over the pairing, Elizabeth (Claire Foy) marries Philip in a regal ceremony. Elizabeth is portrayed hesitating in the midst of her vows. Is it a sign of a troubled marriage to come?\nElizabeth is depicted as quiet, smart, kind and bashful. While her husband Philip is portrayed as having a headstrong and vibrant personality. His and Elizabeth’s marriage while genuine, is also shown to be a tumultuous one.\nThe younger sister governed by passion. #TheCrown pic.twitter.com/4NPuXQ7d82 \n— The Crown (@TheCrownNetflix) November 6, 2016 \n3. Princess Margaret is having an affair \nIt is revealed that Elizabeth’s younger sister Princess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby) is carrying on a secret affair with her father’s equerry, Peter Townsend (Ben Miles), a married father of two.\n4. Princess Elizabeth settles into home life \nUnaware of her father’s ailing health, Elizabeth settles into life as a wife, mother and moderately active princess. Through a montage of time progression, The Crown ‘s audience is told that her oldest child and eldest son Prince Charles, and only daughter Princess Anne are born in 1948 and 1950, respectively.\n[Image by Alex Bailey/Netflix] 5. Winston Churchill wins the election for Prime Minister \nWinston Churchill (John Lithgow), England’s feisty former Prime Minister, wins back his old office at the age of 78-years-old. His wife, Clementine (Harriet Walter) is anxious over her husband’s return as PM. Churchill learns about King George’s cancer before George himself. Churchill shares the privileged news with his wife.\nBehind-the-Scenes \n-Peter Morgan, the screenwriter behind the Oscar-winning 2016 biopic The Queen , is the creator, showrunner, and sole writer of each episode of The Crown . Helen Mirren’s performance in The Queen won her an Oscar for Best Actress, back in 2007.\n– The Crown brought in some heavy hitters behind the camera to knock Netflix’s expensive new series out of the park. Oscar-winning music composer Hans Zimmer ( Batman v Superman, Pirates of the Caribbean ) conducts the series’ original theme.\n-Zimmer conducted the score for the 2013 film Rush , which starred Chris Hemsworth ( Thor ) and Daniel Bruhl ( Captain America: Civil War ). Peter Morgan was the screenwriter for that film.\n-If you noticed any similarities between the feel of The Crown and HBO’s Game of Thrones , there is a connection between the two series. Game of Thrones ‘ casting director Nina Gold acts in the same capacity for 5 of The Crown ‘s 10 episodes.\nA young woman thrown into a life she wasn’t prepared for. #TheCrown pic.twitter.com/B5CyQ44pdp \n— The Crown (@TheCrownNetflix) November 5, 2016 \nRoyal Reprisal \nThe Crown is not the first series or movie to adapt the events surrounding the current royal family.\n-Elizabeth’s father, King George VI’s struggle with his speech, and the friendship, he developed with his therapist was the subject of the Oscar-winning 2010 film The King’s Speech . George was portrayed by Colin Firth in that film. He went on to win the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal.\n-The fabled events of Elizabeth and her sister Margaret’s night out celebrating V.E. day in 1945 was the focus of the 2015 film A Royal Night Out , which is currently streaming on Netflix in the US.\nThe entire first season of The Crown is currently available to stream on Netflix.\n[Featured Image by Alex Bailey/Netflix]\n‘The Crown’ Bows on Netflix – Time to Review 5 Key Plot Points from Episode 1 is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "By Amen Oyiboke 3 hours ago \nNetflix and Leonardo DiCaprio are shedding light on the dangerous elephant poaching crisis in Africa’s Central and Eastern countries in a new, heart-wrenching documentary. The Ivory Game, on Netflix now , enters the trenches of the deeply rooted trade and slaughtering of more than 30,000 African elephants a year due to ivory hunting. This also includes the senseless killings of park rangers who are battling preservation of wildlife with ivory hungry militants. Sadly, the driving influence for people to kill off elephants for financial gain is not discussed in detail in the film, and is left for interpretation — but what the movie does say about poaching is truly enlightening. \nDirected by Richard Ladkani and Kief Davidson, the film echoes the harsh reality that one of the biggest mammals on the face of this earth will vanish sooner than we think if poaching continues. Every 15 minutes, an African elephant is killed —that’s the closing statistic from the United Nations Environmental Program , as mentioned in The Ivory Game . The Great Elephant Census (GEC), meanwhile, revealed in a survey that only 352,271 animals were counted for in the countries they surveyed, a n eye-opening drop from the 1.3 million elephants accounted for in 1979. \nAs unfortunate as it is to discover these harsh realities about the endangered wildlife of elephants, the question of why poaching continually happens so often will boggle the minds of viewers. \"Traders of ivory actually want the extinction of elephants,” said Craig Millar, head of security and field coordinator of the Big Life Foundation, in an interview with CNN . \"The less elephants there are, the more the price rises; the more the price rises, the more people want to kill them. And this is an ever ongoing circle.\" [Embed] \nAn ivory poacher receives about $250 for killing an elephant, according to the film, which amounts to $7 a kilo for ivory that will most likely receive $3,000 per kilo in China. That illegal trade is recognized in the film, connecting the dots of how elephants are butchered and tusks are sent and sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars from countries like Kenya to China. The movie discusses how the Chinese government has even legitimized this trade with a legal “allowance” for domestic consumption of ivory , which encourages the black market participants to use this legality for their own gain of illicit material. \nThe thriving need and greed for ivory stems from an appetite for luxury goods, but one question that is left dangling in the air in the film is what financial circumstances might get a poacher ignited to be involved in such horrible work. The documentary discusses the relationship between the consumers of the ivory market and the mass killings of the African Elephant, and it's heartbreaking to see the circumstances involved. As a Nigerian-American, I know how much the culture and animals mean to the natives, but I also know the financial circumstances of many rural Africans who are in need of financial stability. Many of Africa's countries are resource-rich places, but have a high volume of poor citizens, and, unfortunately, this can lead to participation in illegal trade. Just as there is sympathy for the extinction of these mammals, there has to be a sympathy for these hunters who may have taken the last resort to get the money they need to survive. \nThere is hope for change, though. In 2012, the World Bank stated that most African countries will reach middle income status (identified as making at least $1,000 per persona a year) by 2025 if economic growth continues.The financial development of these countries could mean less involvement with poaching, but that's not to say it will definitely happen. Africa is the mother of more than 1,100 different species of mammals , and the decrease of elephants will soon inevitably affect the biodiversity of the world. \nThe Ivory Game is necessary to see because it just doesn't show the confirmation of an animal issue, but it shows the greed of human consumption and the deadly influence one action can have. Watch this film, and see the reality of the sad connection between people, money, poverty, and greed. \nImages: Netflix , Giphy ",

      "text": "The cast of Stranger Things is growing on Netflix.\nWhen Season 2 comes around, Paul Riser, Sean Astin and Linnea Berthelson will also be along for the ride.\nReiser will play Dr. Owens, a high-ranking member within the Department of Energy on a “clean-up” assignment, tasked with containing the events of last year.\nAstin will be Bob Newby, a kind-hearted former nerd who went to high school with Joyce (Winona Ryder) and Sheriff Hopper (David Harbour) and now manages the local Hawkins RadioShack.\nBerthelsen will portray Roman, an emotionally damaged, magnetic young woman who suffered a great loss as a child. Although she doesn't live in Hawkins, she' mysteriously connected to the supernatural events at the lab.\nIn addition to Ryder and Harbour, they’ll join new series regulars Sadie Sink and Dacre Montgomery, along with the group we've come to love already, Joe Keery, Noah Schnapp, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin and Millie Bobby Brown (of course she's back!!).\nWith The Big Bang Theory Season 10 being the last with everyone on contract, CBS is starting to make plans for a potential spinoff.\nWhile it's fully expected that the wildly successful series will be renewed for another season, if not more, it's time for the stars to start negotiating contracts, and that means possible changes for the upcoming seasons.\nThe spinoff, titled Sheldon, would focus on the 12-year-old prodigy and all the crazy characters in his life. Hello Meemaw! It would also be partnered with The Big Bang Theory on the schedule, and if successful, be the series to take the place of TBBT when it eventually goes off the air. \nYes, all good things must eventually end.\nJonathan Howard has been cast on the upcoming season of The Last Ship as a British Royal Navy Commander and MI-6 agent. \nThis handsome fellow is described as a cross between James Bond and a Navy SEAL, according to Deadline.\nFletcher is tasked to work with the crew of the USS Nathan James to recover stolen items crucial to the survival of the planet. I can't imagine what they might be, but it sounds a bit like an Indiana Jones situation.\nHe'll work closely with Sasha Cooper, who’s still with the ship, even in the absence of Capt. Chandler, who walked off Nathan James at the end of The Last Ship Season 3 .\nFXX has scheduled the season premieres for It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Man Seeking Woman, it was announced today by Chuck Saftler, President of Program Strategy and COO, FX Networks.\nOn Wednesday, January 4, Season 12 of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia will return at 10:00 PM, immediately followed by the Season 3 premiere of Man Seeking Woman at 10:30 PM.\nIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia Season 12 will feature the gang going to a waterpark, dealing with a Wolf Cola PR nightmare and actually spending a whole day tending bar.\nMan Seeking Woman Season 3 will see Josh face his toughest challenge yet: a serious, long-term relationship. Together, Josh and Lucy (Katie Findlay) will take on anniversaries, merging friend groups, ruthless drug lords, friendly forest creatures, student loans and even God himself.\nNashville's Chris Carmack confirmed in a tweet that Luke Wheeler, played by Will Chase, will return to the series.\nIt's always a good day opening up for Luke Wheeler! @WillChaseMe @NashvilleCMT pic.twitter.com/eIF82bpr9W \n— Chris Carmack (@RealCarmack) November 6, 2016 The role, however, will be brief. He's now starring on Time After Time on ABC, but will be in concert on the Nashville Season 5 premiere on its new home on CMT.\nThat gives fans a whole new reason to tune in if they were afraid things might not be the same with the series they grew to love on ABC.\nEven better, something fans always loved and was missing in the later episode, the music, will once again become a focal point of the country-music-business based themed series. \nIf you've been enjoying American Housewife, you're not alone.\nIt launched as the highest rated ABC program on Tuesdays right from the start, and has now been given a back nine order of episodes for a full season of 22.\nKaty Mixon stars as a flawed, but confident, mom who lives in uptight Westport, CT, where they don't take to flaws of any kind very well. I like to think of it as Odd Mom Out for broadcast networks. \nFinally, TV Land handed out a series order for American Woman, a series based loosely on the upbringing of co-executive producer Kyle Richards. Set in the '70s, the single camera comedy will star Alicia Silverstone and follow the sexual revolution and feminism.\nSilverstone stars as Bonnie, a mother of two girls who, together with her two best friends, struggles to find her independence in a world not ready to give it. Mena Suvari and Jennifer Bartels also star.\n\"We feel very lucky to be working with John Riggi and John Wells on this fantastic series that is not only beautifully written and directed, but has a stellar cast that portrays the themes of the ‘70s in a way that is still relevant today,” said Keith Cox, president of development and original programming at TV Land.\nView Slideshow: 15 TV Grandparents We Wish Had Been Ours!

      "text": "Netflix\nDespite her tragic and untimely death during Season 2 of Daredevil , Elodie Yung will return to the Marvel television universe with an appearance in the freshman season of Netflix’s The Defenders . Yung’s sword wielding crime fighter, who burst back into Matt Murdock’s life after they were once lovers and fighters side-by-side, didn’t last the entire Daredevil season. But unlike some in the Marvel universe who are gone for good once they die on screen , Elektra will be back in action – at least in one way. \nAccording to reports from Entertainment Weekly , Elektra will be back fighting in the same battles as Murdock, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist. Except this time she won’t be fighting with them , but against them on the side of The Hand. The Hand is the reported first season enemy for The Defenders, and was also the mysterious cabal that viewers saw taking Elektra’s corpse during Daredevil ‘s last season. Elektra had been under control of The Hand and was trying to move away from that life to be with Matt before she died. Now, she is back under their thumb – as is “Black Sky,” which made her the intense killing machine she was. \nYung’s portrayal of Elektra wasn’t perfect, but it was a far cry from Jennifer Garner’s panned performance in the 2003 movie. Elektra brought some much-needed female badassery to Daredevil (please, please give Rosario Dawson some more to do if she returns!) and switched between ferocity and sympathy with ease when called upon. Her return should be positive news for fans, as many thought that her story wasn’t done after her first story arc concluded. How much more difficult will it be for Matt and the rest to overcome The Hand’s power now that it its confirmed they will have Elektra’s powers under their control? We guess that’s why they will have to work together in order to win when the series finally premieres in 2017. \n(via Entertainment Weekly )\n",

      "text": "Elektra to return in Netflix's Defenders series, apparently not a spoiler 5 hours ago by: 3 Comments \nThe Marvel Netflix shows seem to be knocking it out of the park. In fact, when LUKE CAGE first premiered, Netflix crashed from too many downloads . Suffice to say, people love them some Marvel. And from the very outset every Marvel Netflix show, from DAREDEVIL, to JESSICA JONES, to LUKE CAGE, to the as-of-yet unreleased IRON FIST, were all leading to the team up show THE DEFENDERS (a sort of street-level AVENGERS). \nWhich brings us back to the show that started it all, DAREDEVIL. In its second season, not only did it bring in fan favorite Punisher, but also his love-interest from the comics, the anti-hero assassin Elektra. While she (SPOILER!!!) met her untimely demise at the end of that season, the show is based on a comic-book, in which the only deaths that ever stay permanent are Bucky Barnes , Jason Todd , and Uncle Ben. And even then I wouldn't be surprised if a few years down the road we get a revelation that Uncle Ben is actually Mysterio or some shit. \nAnyway, Netflix just revealed Elektra's return in DEFENDERS via a tweet (which seems like a spoiler, but what do I know?): — The Defenders (@TheDefenders) November 7, 2016 \nSo what's everyone's thoughts on this? Did you guys like Élodie Yung's take on the character? And, if so, you excited at her inclusion in the new show? Sound off below! \nDEFENDERS will defend on Netflix sometime next year. Extra Tidbit: A scene was shot with Ben Affleck as Daredevil in the film ELEKTRA, but was cut out so that ELEKTRA could stand out as its own franchise. History has shown that was the right move.

      "text": "The first season soundtracks for the Netflix shows “Marvel’s Jessica Jones” and “Marvel’s Daredevil” will be given a limited edition double LP vinyl release on November 9 via Mondo. “Jessica Jones” features a score composed by Sean Callery, and the show won a 2016 Emmy Award for its “Original Main Title Theme Music.” John Paesano wrote the score for “Daredevil.” The soundtrack for “Jessica Jones” will be pressed onto purple vinyl, and “Daredevil” will be released on red vinyl. The artwork for both releases was done by Matthew Woodson; each features a portrait of the titular character on the front with the show’s villain in the interior gatefold. See what the artwork looks like below. Both releases are limited to 3,000 copies and will be available to order on Wednesday.\n\nA Tribe Called Quest’s Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Adrian Younge scored “Marvel’s Luke Cage.” Their score was also given a vinyl release by Mondo. Earlier this year, Marvel rolled out a series of variant comic book covers that reimagined covers of classic hip hop albums. Jessica Jones was among the heroes chosen for a new cover.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Jessica Jones”:",

      "title": "Planet Earth II: Baby iguana fights snakes in viral video | EW.com",
      "text": "Netflix responds to Aziz Ansari-'Planet Earth' subtitle mix-up \nHot on the heels of this weekend’s intense penguin drama comes nature’s next nail-biting moment — this time, courtesy of the BBC One nature documentary series, Planet Earth II . \nAs you can see in the clip below — which went viral Monday — it’s literally a race for survival as a newborn marine iguana is forced to make its way past a host of eagerly-awaiting Galapagos racer snakes, who more than live up to their name. It’s a tense scene that easily highlights the British series’ proclivity for capturing life in the wild. \nUnfortunately for American viewers, the whole show won’t be making its premiere stateside until Jan. 28 on BBC America. The David Attenborough-narrated, Hans Zimmer-scored series consists of six episodes, each set in a different ecological habitat. The clip, featured above, is from the show’s first episode, titled “Islands.” Possibly the greatest scene in documentary history. Incredible. #PlanetEarth2 pic.twitter.com/01dDjDJcdX ",

      "text": "by Taylor Bryant Photo Via Netflix. \nResident normcore best friend Barb of Stranger Things has become an internet sensation virtually overnight. Ask most viewers, and they’ll tell you she’s the friend everyone needs but doesn’t deserve. She’s the queen of reality checks and wasn’t afraid to let lovestruck Nancy now how she really felt. It looks like Shannon Purser, the actress behind the cult character, is just as worthy of being praised. \nPurser took to Twitter this morning to share a revealing message about her history with self-injury. “*TRIGGER WARNING* I haven't self-harmed in years, but I kept this around, ‘just in case,’” she captioned a photo of her holding a razor. “I forgot it was there & now it's in the trash.” *TRIGGER WARNING* I haven't self-harmed in years, but I kept this around, \"just in case.\" I forgot it was there & now it's in the trash. pic.twitter.com/C0oAQTL0IM — Shannon Purser (@shannonpurser) November 7, 2016 \nShe followed up with another hopeful tweet: “Recovery is possible. Please don’t give up on yourself.” She also shared a similar encouraging message about depression last month. Please don't ever feel like your depression is invalid because of your life circumstances. Depression does not discriminate. #youarenotalone — Shannon Purser (@shannonpurser) October 10, 2016 \nSuffering from mental illness can often feel isolating. Sometimes, it’s nice to know that you’re not suffering on your own. \nIf you or someone you know is dealing with mental illness, there are ways to get help. Find resources, tips, and immediate help at Half of Us , or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK.",

However, as seen above Netflixs content will also be fully integrated into the X1 content screen.You can use the X1 voice remote to launch the Netflix app and search for specific content or actors. The two companies are highlighting Netflix series such as House of Cards, Orange Is The New Black, and Stranger Things.Comcast expects to have the X1 platform in 50 percent of Comcast homes by the end of 2016.Existing customers can log in right away.

      "text": "Comment If you’re loving Claire Foy and Matt Smith on new Netflix series The Crown, don’t get used to them because they’ll be replaced after season 2. \nThe newest Netflix Original series was released on November 4 with the first season of The Crown. The 10-episode first season takes us to Buckingham Palace where we see the future Queen Elizabeth marry, have kids and take on the role of shaping the country when her father, King George IV gets sick with lung cancer and eventually succumbs to the disease. \nClaire Foy plays the young royal and she’s quite spectacular in the role and producer Andrew Eaton says everyone fell in love with her when she read for the part. “Everyone fell in love with her and she felt like somebody that you could go on that journey with for that length of time. Some of the other people who auditioned, it felt like they were trying to do more of an impression of the Queen, rather than create a character who was based on her.” Related Story: 50 times Grey's Anatomy made us ugly cry \nBut don’t get too attached because Foy and her on-screen husband, played by Matt Smith, will no longer be on the show after season 2. In fact, Digital Spy reports the entire cast will be recast for season 3 and season 4 and again for season 5 and 6, presumably the show’s final two seasons. \nThis will be done because the show will be advancing forward in time and the show will require older actors and actresses. So while there will be two more Queens introduced to the show, which will require plenty of debate about who should be up for the part, the focus is on Foy and the tremendous job she’s doing playing the part. \nDon’t be surprised if Foy gets some consideration for a Golden Globe or Emmy for her portrayal either, she’s been that remarkable. More netflix: 50 Best TV Dramas on Netflix \nThe Crown also stars John Lithgow as Winston Churchill and as one of the non-Brits on the show, playing the former Prime Minister was one of the things that first attracted me to the show. But he will also be gone after season 2. \nThe Crown is now streaming exclusively on Netflix. Top Stories ",

      "text": "  Netflix Buys Exclusive Distribution Rights for South Korean Film 'Pandora' 12:17 AM PST 11/8/2016 by Lee Hyo-won Courtesy of Next Entertainment World 'Pandora' The disaster film, from the producers of breakout zombie hit 'Train to Busan,' will be made available in 190 territories through the online streaming giant \nNetflix and South Korean film production and distribution company Next Entertainment World announced on Tuesday an international licensing agreement for the anticipated nuclear disaster film Pandora . \nPandora will be available to stream exclusively on Netflix in 190 countries, excluding South Korea, next year. In South Korea, the film will be available to stream after its theatrical release. Its opening date in Korean cinemas has not yet been set. This is the first time a Korean title has been pre-sold to Netflix. \"We are excited to work with Next Entertainment World to bring such high-quality Korean titles like Pandora to our members worldwide,” said Rob Roy, vp content acquisition at Netflix. \"Netflix is committed to bringing the best of global entertainment to the world and in an era where the Internet knows no bounds, this is another step towards delivering great stories to fans no matter where they live.\" \nSays Kim Woo-taek, CEO of NEW: \"We are delighted to partner with Netflix, a world-class content distributor, to be able to present Pandora to global audiences in over 190 countries. Following the recent success of Train to Busan in Asia, we hope the nuclear-themed Pandora can win much love from the audiences worldwide.\" \nPandora , a CAC Entertainment film, is directed by award-winning screenwriter-turned-filmmaker Park Jung-Woo, who is known for the science fiction horror film Deranged. Disaster strikes a nuclear power plant in a small, quiet town when an earthquake unexpectedly hits. The Pirates star Kim Nam-gil plays a man who risks his life to save his family and country from the impending nuclear disaster. The film also stars Kim Young-ae ( The Attorney) , Jung Jin-young ( Miracle of Cell No. 7 ) and Kim Dae-myeong ( Misaeng ). Netflix made headlines earlier this year when it announced that it was investing $50 million in Okja , a fantasy film by Bong Joon Ho that is also due for simultaneous release over Netflix and in cinemas next year. Top execs Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos stated plans to expand Netflix's slate of Korean originals in addition to shows such as Drama World that have recently premiered.",

      "text": "The hit Israeli TV series Fauda will soon be available for streaming on Netflix, which purchased the rights to it from the YES satellite TV company. “Fauda” (Arabic for “chaos”) has been lauded for its realism, its extensive use of Arabic, and the empathy viewers are forced to have for the Hamas characters. The show is about a team of Israeli undercover operatives called “mistaarvim,” the term used for Israeli agents dressed like Arabs, who are trying to capture Abu Ahmed, a notorious (and fictional) Hamas terrorist. The show’s counter-terrorism agents live in a constant state of fear, never knowing when their cover could be blown, forcing them to have to get out, fast.\nThe series is written by Times of Israel correspondent Avi Issacharoff and the series’ lead actor, Lior Raz. Its first season aired in 2015.\nAvi Issacharoff, left, and Lior Raz, the co-creators of Israeli TV series ‘Fauda.’ (Courtesy YES)\n“It’s a dream come true,” Issacharoff told Walla, thanking the people involved in negotiating the deal. He also extended his gratitude to all those who took part in Fauda’s creation and production.\nFauda’s first (and so far only) season will be available to streaming on Netlfix on December 2, 2016. Additionally, a premier event for the show is scheduled for November 28 in Los Angeles.\n\n ",

      "text": "Ubisoft And Netflix May Be Talking About An Original Series 8:45 am By Conner Flynn \nNetflix has proven again and again that it’s capable of creating great original content. The company plans to focus more on providing even more original content, because that is where the future is now that everyone is offering streaming services. \nAccording to a new report, we might soon get to see another new series that features characters from the Ubisoft universe. It wouldn’t surprise anyone, I don’t think. This is intriguing. I wonder what property it is. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that the company is in talks with Netflix about a series. He also addressed the speculation about the company’s future, stating his desire to keep Ubisoft independent even as a major shareholder named Vivendi continues to mount pressure to take over the company. \nVivendi’s stake in Ubisoft is more than 20 percent right now. It has been gradually increasing its stake in the company trying to gain more influence, but Vivendi has said that it’s not going to make a hostile bid for Ubisoft. Ubisoft has already dabbled in the film business so it was only a matter of time before it turned its attention to TV. If they do things right, it could be a great money maker for them. We don’t have any details at this point, so nothing is known about this original series. Stay tuned.",

      "text": "Lionsgate Circling Relativity Library As Chapter 7 Filing Looms \nNetflix asked the California Superior Court in Santa Clara to dismiss the suit: The accusations that Relativity finds disturbing were made as part of a case being heard at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, the filing says. And that’s “protected speech under the constitutional right to petition the courts.” \nNetflix charges that in September “Relativity released its first two films since emerging from bankruptcy”— Masterminds and Disappointments Room — which “both bombed at the box office. Running out of cash, and with no good movie product to release, Relativity went searching for someone to blame. Hence, this lawsuit – a desperate and futile effort by Relativity to avoid responsibility for its own failures.” \nThe case flows from a Bankruptcy Court dispute over whether a 2010 agreement enabled Netflix to run the two films in June, ahead of their theatrical release. The judge sided with Relativity, giving the studio a shot at theaters before the films run online. \nRelativity charged that the releases were hampered by Netflix’s “disparaging” allegations that the studio might be unable to distribute them successfully. \nBut Netflix says that the studio “has failed to properly plead an essential element of its trade libel cause of action – pecuniary loss – because the Complaint includes only a bare allegation of loss and does not identify particular transactions or relationships that allegedly were interfered with.” \nWhat’s more, Netflix allegations in court — including one saying Relativity’s “business model was flawed”— are “statements of opinion, not fact. They are therefore not actionable.” \nYuuZoo recently agreed to buy 33.3% of Relativity’s equity for $50 million — including $27.5 million in cash and $22.5 million in either cash or stock. The deal would give the Singapore-based web company one of the studio’s three board seats and is contingent on its completion of a debt restructuring. ",

      "text": "The best part of Netflix's 'The Crown' is the insanely big size of John Lithgow as Churchill Published by Mashable on Tue, 08 Nov 2016 Netflix's The Crown is exciting to watch for many reasons: the show's historical accuracy, its all-star cast and, of course, its very compelling script.More than all of that, however, there exists an even more captivating aspect to the show. A subtle detail, just noticeable enough to keep me coming back for more after every hour-long episode.I'm speaking, of course, about how insanely big John Lithgow's Winston Churchill is.SEE ALSO: 6 times Prince George gave absolutely zero f*cksLook how big Lithgow is here, next to this normal-sized car.

      "text": "print \nGuillemot, CEO of Ubisoft, speaks on stage during the Ubisoft E3 conference at the Orpheum theatre in Los Angeles Thomson Reuters \nPARIS (Reuters) - The head of French software games developer Ubisoft reiterated on Monday his desire to keep Ubisoft independent, in the face of pressure from shareholder Vivendi, and added Ubisoft was in talks with Netflix over a series. \nVivendi has been gradually increasing its stake in Ubisoft, and holds more than 20 percent at the moment. But Vivendi ruled out making a hostile takeover bid for Ubisoft in October. \nUbisoft's chairman and chief executive, Yves Guillemot, also told reporters at a news briefing that there had been no new contact with Vivendi. \nGuillemot added Ubisoft was considering acquisitions in the 50-100 million euros ($110.7 million) price range, primarily in the mobile phone games sector, and that Ubisoft was considering hiring 500-1,000 staff in France over the next five years. \nHe also said Ubisoft's founding family was looking at ways in which they could have the most control over Ubisoft. \n($1 = 0.9033 euros) \n(Reporting by Gwenaelle Barzic, writing by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Brian Love) Read the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "Allef Vinicius Good morning texts, Sunday cuddle nights with Netflix, flowers and chocolates, long walks, coffee at midnight, exchanges of sweet messages, traveling around the world, knowing someone is always there for you… just it’s idea sends a kaleidoscope of butterflies and a crooked but sincere smile – I know that feeling. It makes mornings a little easier to wake up to. It magically makes problem a little lighter. It makes spending midnight working on a project a little more fun.\nLove- it’s worth all kinds of sacrifices and pain, isn’t it? \nWe encounter a narcotic wave of love pulling us deeper to a pit of unknown – of something unpredictable – yet we take a plunge. Crescendos and decrescendos of heartbeats and rhythms and pulses and intertwining dreams to reality. Once you catch the love bug, it’s a roller coaster ride of romantic comedies and tragedies combined into one mixup.\nYes, love may be one of the best emotions out there, but everything about love also feels so fragile. A wrong word would shatter someone’s day, or not replying to a text can dig a problem from 2 years ago. I’m a thinker. And simply “just” loving as what everyone does doesn’t really grind my days.\nA love with sexual relationships do not appeal to me so much, for now.\nI rid myself of the fact that I need someone now. Because I can’t. I drive my attention to something else when I feel a little pinch of missing the feeling. Because I can’t. Life is already too much to handle. I’m not ready for a commitment.\nI might choose the wrong person at this wrong time. I’m not ready. I have so many plans. I have lots of other priorities. I just can’t. I tell myself all sorts of things to make sure my heart and my head are aligned in one common mindset.\nA guy once told me, what if all you need is someone to be there for you. One who will understand, one who will back you up, one who will help you complete yourself.\nBut even then– especially then– I cheat myself.\nIt’s frustrating at times though – being happy single – like it’s an odd disease. People around you think that you’re just a little salty from your past relationships. And explaining yourself will just seem to prove them right even more. Even if you’re not.\nMaybe my life doesn’t make a plot as great as Cinderella or 50 First Dates or The Fault in Our Stars. Maybe my life would make a crappy movie. But I don’t want those kinds of plot to a happily ever after just because everyone feels it’s the perfect love story- or even one that I need now.\nFalling in love is not an idea that appeals to me. Because falling means you have no idea where you’ll land or how difficult it would be to climb up again. You’ll get bruises and scars and injuries and you’ll never know if there would be someone to put you back together or see your flaws and quirks as perfect. How can you love someone wholly if you can’t love yourself completely?\nSo this is me, telling myself that I don’t care. This is me acting all grown up in this quarter-life phase. This is me using my mind over my heart on each possible suitor. This is me cheating how I feel.\nLocking it up, placing walls, making the glorious idea of love hidden deep in me. I don’t want to be attached to anyone, not just in a sense of sexual relationships, but adding any more friends than what I have now will make me think that it’s okay to take risks in letting people in my life.\nI’m a work in progress, and so long as I’m not done with being content with myself, I want to cheat how I feel and figure out what I want, what I don’t, what I want to do, where I’m heading and what kind of person I want to be with for the rest of my life. I want to cheat how I feel until I figure out how to set my life piece by piece to its right place before making myself part of someone else’s life.\nI need to know I’m complete as myself before I can let myself fall in love – if that’s the phrase everyone uses. I need to assure myself that I’ve travelled enough, or made enough mistakes, or got to the height of my career before I can allow myself to trust anyone to come into my life– before I trust anyone to come into my life– and possibly ruin it. But I won’t break down even then, because I know I’m complete as I am.\nAnd when I am ready; when I’m done cheating, I know it’ll be perfect. It’ll be at the perfect time, with the perfectly imperfect person and the perfect reason. ",

      "title": "Netflix Picks Up Israeli Political Thriller ‘Fauda’",
      "text": "Courtesy of Netflix  10AM PT \nNetflix has picked up “ Fauda ,” the nail-biting Israeli television series about a deep-cover unit of the Israeli Defense Forces. The streaming site will begin airing the drama’s first season, which played to critical acclaim on Israeli satellite network YES last year, on Dec. 2. \nNetflix has also purchased rights to “Fauda’s” second season, which is in production. \n“Fauda” follows a close-knit unit of mista’arvim, the commando unit of the Israel army whose soldiers are trained in the language, dress and mannerisms of Palestinians, and whose undercover work is hailed in Israel for scuppering terror attacks and guiding military operations. \nThe show was the most-watched in YES history and also earned a best drama statue at the 2015 Israeli version of the Emmys. \nThe series was created by Avi Issacharoff , a journalist and Arab affairs specialist, and actor Lior Raz. Both are graduates themselves of the mista’arvim unit. The show broke barriers in Israel by giving its Arab characters equal screen time and equally complex backstories as its Jewish characters. The terrorists, in this show, are as much fathers and brothers as they are combatants, and are drawn with equal complexity as the Jewish soldiers. Neither side, the show insists, is innocent. \nWith both Arabic and Hebrew dialogue, the show also found its way into Palestinian audiences’ hearts, and its plot twists, hostage negotiations and close-combat battle scenes were rehashed on Arabic social media at a level never before seen for Israeli television. \nThe Netflix deal was brokered by Hadas Mozes Lictenstein from ADD Content Agency and Danna Stern from Yes DBS Satellite. According to the deal, Fauda will be dubbed a Netflix Original Series — the first-ever Israeli series to receive such a label. \nThe show will be aired in its original languages of Arabic and Hebrew, with English subtitles. \nIssacharoff and Raz will be on hand in Los Angeles for a screening and premiere party on Nov. 28.

      "text": "Courtesy of Maria Jose Cuevas  00AM PT Theatrical run in Mexico via Cinepolis in late November \nVying for a top award at the Los Cabos Int’l Film Festival’s Mexico First competition with her maiden docu-feature “ Bellas de Noche ” (“Beauties of the Night”), Maria Jose Cuevas comes with prizes and top festival berths already under her belt. \nAfter participating in Los Cabos’ Work in Progress program last year, her docu screened at the Ambulante and Telluride film fests after which Netflix snapped it up before it participated in Toronto. Exhibition grandee Cinepolis plans to release it in late November, after which it rolls out on Netflix, most likely in February. \nAt the Morelia Int’l Film Fest in October, “Bellas de Noche” won best documentary, the Premio Guerrero Press Award and best documentary by a woman, the latter an apt win given the subject matter of her docu: In “Bellas de Noche,” Cuevas explores the past and present lives of Mexico City’s showgirls, pop culture celebrities in the ‘70s and ‘80s. \nA graphic designer, photographer and video artist, Cuevas was about 10 years old when her father, a famous painter, took her to cabarets and into the dressing rooms of these showgirls. After meeting one of her docu subjects, Princess Yamal, 10 years ago, she was inspired to interview more of them and start researching for her docu, which she produced along with Cinepantera and Detalle Films. \n“The massive 1985 earthquake in Mexico City destroyed these cabarets, which were never rebuilt, so they are the last generation of these showgirls,” said Cuevas. She filmed some 180 hours of film, gaining the confidence and trust of her five subjects, one of whom, Lyn May, will attend Los Cabos. \n“Thanks to my privileged access to them, I feel I learned how to celebrate life; understand what gives life meaning and makes us alive,” she mused. She credits her sister, video artist Ximena Cuevas, for skillfully editing her doc. “She’s the only one who understood me completely and what direction I wanted to take,” she said. \nHer next docu will deal with something even closer to home: her father Jose Luis Cuevas whose young wife has isolated him from everyone, including his family. But that is just the takeoff point of her main theme, mental manipulation. \n“What I like are portraits of human beings; to explore the human condition, discover and understand it.” Filed Under:",

      "text": "‘The Crown’ Queen Elizabeth Wedding Gown Costs How Much? 08/11/2016\nHOW MUCH DID NETFLIX SPEND FOR A REPLICA?ELLE has reported that no expense was spared for the wedding gown that Queen Elizabeth wore on her wedding day. The producers capitalized on every detail that will drive the fans of the British royalty crazy and made the movie splendid to make sure they will “eat it right up and lick the spoon.”\nThe 10-episode Netflix series already has a price tag of $130 million and one will see why with the extravagant production design. The replica of Queen Elizabeth II’s gown costs $37,000 and that’s hefty for any TV series produced on Earth.\nRelated: http://www.queeniewedding.co.uk/halter-neck-wedding-dresses \nTHE CROWN UPDATE: ELABORATE DETAILS OF THE MUCH TALKED ABOUT GOWNIt was said that the original gown was inspired by Botticelli’s Primavera and was designed by royal couturier Noman Hartnell. It was made of ivory silk duchess satin, which features elaborate embroidery of orange blossom and star lily motifs with over 10,000 imported seed pearls and glittering crystals encrusted and studded on the dress.\nAccording to Daily Mail UK, the fake queen’s dress took only seven weeks to make whereas the original version was made in six long months. It was definitely a showstopper both in the lives of the real queen and Claire Foy’s.\n“The Crown” is a Netflix series which depicts the life of the crowned queen of England Queen Elizabeth since she was a little girl up until the present day. It highlights the lives of the young Queen and King when they were thrust into the limelight shortly after the Queen’s father has died.\nThe real queen had to save up her ration coupons to buy the fabric of her famous dress and the politicians at the time was objecting about the extravagance of the dress, although her government gave her 200 more coupons for it.\nAlso see: lace wedding dresses uk",

      "text": "Ubisoft CEO reiterates desire to keep group independent, eyes Netflix series Mon Nov 7, 2016 5:41am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nPARIS (Reuters) - The head of French software games developer Ubisoft reiterated on Monday his desire to keep Ubisoft independent, in the face of pressure from shareholder Vivendi, and added Ubisoft was in talks with Netflix over a series. \nVivendi has been gradually increasing its stake in Ubisoft, and holds more than 20 percent at the moment. But Vivendi ruled out making a hostile takeover bid for Ubisoft in October. \nUbisoft's chairman and chief executive, Yves Guillemot, also told reporters at a news briefing that there had been no new contact with Vivendi. \nGuillemot added Ubisoft was considering acquisitions in the 50-100 million euros ($110.7 million) price range, primarily in the mobile phone games sector, and that Ubisoft was considering hiring 500-1,000 staff in France over the next five years. \nHe also said Ubisoft's founding family was looking at ways in which they could have the most control over Ubisoft. \n($1 = 0.9033 euros) \n(Reporting by Gwenaelle Barzic, writing by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Brian Love) © Thomson Reuters 2016 All rights reserved.

Deadline reports Universal Pictures has inherited and is writing for a potential live action Voltron film. \nUniversal Pictures received an assortment of development and production projects and also inherited live-action picture that was being developed from DreamWorks Animation. \nSo now, a live-action VOLTRON film is being scripted by David Hayter. Hayter’s previous projects include X-Men, X-Men United and Watchmen. \nUniversal haven’t made any decisions on what they’re going to do with VOLTRON because it is an inherited project. Once they get the script drafted, they’ll move forward. \nThey’ll most likely follow through and green light it because there is a fandom there. Not to mention it’s on Netflix and season 2 will be coming out in January. \nFor any of you that want to reminisce, flip the page and watch the old cartoon intro. 1",

      "text": "Will the love for Netflix’s “ Stranger Things ” never cease? Honestly, I hope not! \nToday we’re bringing you a really fun video created by Book Shelf Productions , which recreates several scenes from the supernatural mystery series using LEGO blocks, stop motion photography, and original audio from the series. The final result is a super truncated version of many iconic moments, including Will’s disappearance, Joyce’s frantic discussion with Sheriff Hopper, and the van flip scene, among others. \nRelated: “Stranger Things” Season 2 Officially Kicks Off Production \nIt’s pretty awesome to see LEGO blocks used for all sorts of horror-ific visions. We highlighted a recent pop-up cemetery book design , a recreation of the Addams Family mansion , a Dead Space USG Ishimura , and Dante’s 9 Circles of Hell . \nWhat are some of your favorite combinations of LEGO and horror? Let us know in the comments! \n\n",

      "text": "– A + Netflix soon to be added to video options for Comcast X1 customers By Mike Wuerthele \nTuesday, November 08, 2016, 07:18 am PT (10:18 am ET) \nMovie streaming service Netflix will be available to Comcast subscribers with an X1 set-top box as soon as November 10, but won't be exempt from the 1TB data cap recently levied against a good portion of Comcast's internet customers.\n\n\n\n\nUsers of both services will be able to \"seamlessly move between the Netflix app and their cable service\" without changing inputs, according to a joint statement issued by both companies. Additionally, Comcast's voice search will work with Netflix, and streaming videos from Netflix will be displayed in conjunction with Comcast on-demand video offerings.\n\nHowever, in the deal's frequently asked questions list , Comcast says that the Netflix videos are being streamed across the Internet, and are \"subject to Xfinity Internet data usage policies.\"\n\nComcast data caps exist most of the company's serviced areas with little competition from Verizon or Google Fiber. Customers are allowed to exceed the cap in two months in a rolling year without additional fines.\n\nHD video from Netflix will consume approximately 3 GB per hour of use. Comcast claims that its caps, assuming no other use of the Internet, will allow users to stream HD video for 10 hours a day without hitting the limit.\n\nComcast customers will not get a discount or any promotional rate on Netflix, nor vice-versa.\n\nA firm launch date is not yet known. No terms of the deal have been announced.",

      "text": "What's coming to Netflix, Hulu and Amazon in November \n5. Trailer Park Boys (2001-2007, revived by Netflix in 2014) When fleeing America due to the Illuminati conspiracies that have rigged every election since George Washington took office, you'll want a few creature comforts to ease your transition to bags of milk, Tim Horton's and toothless hockey players. And what's more American and familiar than trailer-park trash? Trailer Park Boys follows three petty criminals who live in a Nova Scotia trailer park as they concoct schemes to get rich and probably blow all the money on rum and weed. It's rude, crude and full of bad dudes, just like the United States. God bless America! I mean Canada! Trailer Park Boys \n4. SCTV (Second City Television) (1976-1984) When fleeing a once-great democracy that's now smoldering ruins, it's important to laugh! SCTV was Canada's Saturday Night Live , launching the careers of John Candy , Eugene Levy , Rick Moranis and Martin Short . This gave us Strange Brew , hosers! Available: Unfortunately, full episodes are not streaming anywhere, but you can watch highlights on YouTube . \n3. Heartland (2007-present) Canada's long-running drama is based on the book series of the same name -- albeit swapping the locale from Virginia in the States to the Alberta Rockies. It chronicles the story of a young woman, Amy Fleming ( Amber Marshall ), who realizes she has the gift of healing wounded horses from her deceased mother. Of course, Amy's family ranch isn't just home to horses but her grandfather Jack ( Shaun Johnston) , love interest Ty ( Graham Wardle ), as well as the setting for sweeping emotional sagas with her sister Lou ( Michelle Morgan ) and once-estranged father Tim ( Chris Potter ). Having begun its 10th season this year, it's a flagrant and unapologetic tugger of heartstrings. They don't call it Heartland for nothing. \n2. Are You Afraid of the Dark? (1990-1996, 1999-2000) Americanyoung adults may remember this '90s horror-fantasy show as an integral part of their childhoods when it aired on Nickelodeon. A group of teens who called themselves The Midnight Society would convene at a secret location in the woods and tell a frightening story -- tales of witches, vampires, ghosts and the like that scared the bejesus out of children all across the country. Even though it was for kids, its creepy clowns and special effects were legitimately terrifying -- effects that, for the time anyway, seemed as gory as anything we'd see on The Walking Dead today.",

      "title": "Netflix has more 'Certified Fresh' movies than HBO and Amazon Prime combined",
      "text": "Netflix's US streaming catalog has shrunk by over 50% since 2012 , but Netflix's argument is that it's filled with more TV shows and movies that you'd actually want to watch — as opposed to filler. \nBut still, some movie fans have grumbled that Netflix doesn't feel like it's built for them anymore. \nNetflix's selection of the best 200 movies ever made, at least by IMDB ratings, has gone down in the last two years by a substantial amount . And Netflix is simply not producing original films at the same rate it is TV shows (though it is reportedly dropping $90 million for a new Will Smith movie). \nResearch by Barclays earlier this year even showed that, at that time, Netflix had four times fewer movie titles than Amazon Prime Video, one of its major competitors. \nThere's a narrative floating around that as Netflix pivots toward original content, its selection of good movies is suffering. \nBut new research from Streaming Observer puts that into a bit of perspective, and shows that Netflix is still beating Amazon and HBO when it comes to good movies — at least judged by Rotten Tomatoes scores. \nReviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes has a section of movies designated \"Certified Fresh,\" which means they have a steady rating of 75% or higher, after a certain review threshold. Streaming Observer looked at these \"Certified Fresh\" movies and compared their availability on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO, to see which service had the best movie selection. \nNetflix came in with a commanding lead at 357 titles, whereas Amazon Prime had 236, and HBO had 52. \nHere's the chart: \nStreaming Observer \nSo Netflix, while its stable of films may be declining, still has a few hundred movies that are probably worth your time. However, as an absolute number, Netflix had only 15% of the movies on Rotten Tomatoes' list. Other options \nIf you are a diehard movie fan and willing to pay a few dollars a month, it might be worth it to look elsewhere. There are a host of new streaming services that have cropped up built just for you. A recent service that looks promising is FilmStruck, Turner's standalone streaming service targeted at \"film aficionados.\" \nIt certainly has some impressive titles, like “Seven Samurai,” “A Room With A View,” “Blood Simple,” and \"Breathless.\" \nThe catalog features \"an eclectic mix of contemporary and classic art house, indie, foreign, and cult films,\" and was built by the teams behind Turner Classic Movies (TCM) and the Criterion Collection. The focus is on critically acclaimed and \"hard to find\" films, according to the company, so you won't find any TV shows. A standard FilmStruck subscription will cost $6.99 per month, while getting access to 1,200 movies from the iconic Criterion Collection will make it $10.99. \n“It's tailor-made for the diehard movie enthusiast who craves a deep, intimate experience with independent, foreign, and art house films,” John Martin, chairman and CEO of Turner, said in a statement earlier this year.",

The French mass media company ruled out making a Ubisoft hostile takeover bid in October, but currently holds more than 20 percent of shares, according to Reuters.

      "text": "Courtesy of Next Entertainment World  47AM PT \nMultinational video streaming giant, Netflix has acquired international rights to “ Pandora ,” a South Korean nuclear disaster blockbuster from leading film production-distribution company Next Entertainment World . \nThe film is highly anticipated in Korea and is directed by award-winning screenwriter-turned-director Park Jung-Woo (“Deranged”). \n“Pandora” will be available to stream exclusively to Netflix members in 190 countries, excluding South Korea, from next year. In Korea it will have a theatrical release in December and stream from a later date. \nStarring Kim Nam-Gil and Kim Young-Ae, “Pandora” sees the story of a small town blown apart by a disaster, as an unexpected earthquake hits the nuclear power plant. \n“We are excited to work with Next Entertainment World to bring such high-quality Korean titles like ‘Pandora’ to our members worldwide,” said Rob Roy, VP of content acquisition at Netflix. “Netflix is committed to bringing the best of global entertainment to the world and in an era where the internet knows no bounds, this is another step towards delivering great stories to fans no matter where they live.” \n“We are delighted to partner with Netflix, a world-class content distributor, to be able to present ‘Pandora’ to global audiences in over 190 countries. Following the recent success of ‘Train to Busan’ in Asia, we hope the nuclear-themed ‘Pandora’ can win much love from the audiences worldwide,” said NEW CEO Kim Woo-Taek. Filed Under:",

      "text": "IMDB / Dreamworks \nNetflix's US streaming catalog has shrunk by over 50% since 2012 , but Netflix's argument is that it's filled with more TV shows and movies you'd actually want to watch — as opposed to filler. \nBut still, some movie fans have grumbled that Netflix doesn't seem as if it's built for them anymore. \nNetflix's selection of IMDb's 200 highest-rated movies has gone down in the past two years by a substantial amount . And Netflix is simply not producing original films at the same rate it is TV shows (though it is reportedly dropping $90 million for a new Will Smith movie). \nResearch by Barclays earlier this year even showed that, at that time, Netflix had just one-fourth as many movie titles as Amazon Prime Video, one of its major competitors. \nA narrative is floating around that as Netflix pivots toward original content, its selection of good movies is suffering. \nBut new research from Streaming Observer puts that into a bit of perspective, and shows that Netflix is still beating Amazon and HBO when it comes to good movies — at least as judged by Rotten Tomatoes scores. \nRotten Tomatoes, the review aggregator, has a section of movies designated \"Certified Fresh,\" which means they have a steady rating of 75% or higher, after a certain review threshold. Streaming Observer looked at these movies and compared their availability on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO, to see which service had the best movie selection. \nNetflix came in with a commanding lead at 357 titles, whereas Amazon Prime had 236 and HBO had 52. \nHere's the chart: \nStreaming Observer \nSo while its stable of films may be declining, Netflix still has a few hundred movies that are probably worth your time. As an absolute number, however, Netflix had only 15% of the movies on Rotten Tomatoes' list. Other options \nIf you are a die-hard movie fan and willing to pay a few dollars a month, it might be worth it to look elsewhere. A host of new streaming services have cropped up that are built just for you. A recent service that looks promising is FilmStruck, Turner's standalone streaming service that is targeting \"film aficionados.\" \nIt certainly has some impressive titles, like \"Seven Samurai,\" \"A Room With A View,\" \"Blood Simple,\" and \"Breathless.\" \nThe catalog features \"an eclectic mix of contemporary and classic art house, indie, foreign, and cult films,\" and it was built by the teams behind Turner Classic Movies and The Criterion Collection. The focus is on critically acclaimed and \"hard to find\" films, according to the company, so you won't find any TV shows. A standard FilmStruck subscription will cost $6.99 a month, while getting access to 1,200 movies from the iconic Criterion Collection will make it $10.99. \n\"It's tailor-made for the die-hard movie enthusiast who craves a deep, intimate experience with independent, foreign, and art-house films,\" John Martin, the chairman and CEO of Turner, said in a statement earlier this year.",

      "text": "Netflix May Eventually Allow Its Customers to Download Films By: Mishal Omar   engadget Netflix is best known for its online streaming services and may be looking into offering video playback rather than simply streaming. As of right now, the company only offers streaming services and it has justified this fact with the idea that most customers of the company are rarely away from a Wi-Fi connection. This is unlikely to be true and as the company seeks to expand its reach, it may be foraying into this new territory. The potential service will allow customers to download movies and shows from their accounts, rather than only being able to watch when they are connected to Wi-Fi. This new online streaming service could result in Netflix being the first choice for people who travel often or find themselves without an internet connection on a regular basis.",

      "text": "11/08/16 AT 11:36 AM Close \nThe Netflix series “The Crown” is a fictionalized drama about the British Royal Family, but there are some truths woven into the show. One of the things “The Crown” highlights is the relationship between Queen Elizabeth the II and her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. \nPhilip has an interesting background. He was born in Greece in 1921. He is the son of Prince Andrew and Princess Alice, Biography.com wrote. \nHis family was exiled from Greece by a revolutionary court in December 1922 after Philip’s uncle, King Constantine I of Greece, was mandated to abandon the throne Sept. 22, 1922. Philip made the journey to France in a cot that was fashioned from a fruit box, Radio Times wrote Monday. \nHis parents split, with his mother being committed to a psychiatric instruction. His father moved to the south of France with his girlfriend. Philip barely spoke to his father over the years. During World War I, he adopted the surname Mountbatten, which is his mother’s maiden name. \nPhilip was ultimately raised by a grandmother in England. He went to British schools and became a naturalized British citizen. Despite being born in Greece, he never learned to speak Greek. \nOne thing some people might not know is that Elizabeth and Philip are related. They have the same great-great-grandparents, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, Time Magazine revealed Thursday. This makes them third cousins. In fact, marriage between cousins was common for royals. \nElizabeth fell in love with Philip the first time she met him. Her father, King George VI, took her to visit the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth when she was 13 years old. It was Philip, who had just joined in 1939, who showed her around. \nElizabeth wrote about her connection with with Philip in a two-page letter to author Betty Shew, who was writing about the royal wedding. “I was 13 years of age and he was 18 and a cadet just due to leave,” Elizabeth wrote in 1947. “He joined the Navy at the outbreak of war, and I only saw him very occasionally when he was on leave — I suppose about twice in three years. Then when his uncle and aunt, Lord and Lady Mountbatten, were away he spent various weekends away with us at Windsor. Then he went to the Pacific and Far East for two years.” \nOne of the thing “The Crown” touches on is that the English government didn’t want Elizabeth II to marry Philip, Time Magazine wrote. This was true in real life. Of course, Elizabeth went ahead with the marriage anyway. \nThere is real love between Elizabeth and Philip, according to Claire Foy and Matt Smith, the actors who play the royals on “The Crown.” \n“…What's interesting and brave about this show is it doesn't show it as this easy romance,” Smith told E! Online Monday. “It shows it going through real turmoil and the pressure and trauma of becoming queen isn't an easy thing for them to navigate or deal with. I think that dramatically is really engaging.” Related Stories",

      "text": "NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Shares of Netflix ( NFLX ) were lower in late morning trading on Tuesday, after Scripps Network (SNI) turned down the chance to renew its partnership deal with the online streaming service. The partnership will conclude at the end of 2016. \n\"We assessed and analyzed the S-VOD [streaming video-on-demand] universe and have made the strategic decision not to extend our S-VOD agreement with Netflix past the end of this year,\" Scripps Network COO Burton Jablin said in a conference call on Monday. \"In the end, it is really not the kind of dual revenue model that best monetizes our content over the long-term.\"\nThe parent company of HGTV, Food Network, the Cooking Channel and the Travel Channel is saying it can't make money off of the service,  Fox Business' Liz Claman explained on Tuesday morning's \"Varney & Company.\" Scripps Network saw its distribution revenue drop. \n\"That's a big blow, I think, to Netflix to have somebody say, 'Nope, we're not signing up with you anymore,'\" she claimed. \nShares of Scripps Network were higher in late morning trading on Tuesday. \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author.\nTheStreet Ratings team rates Netflix as a Hold with a ratings score of C+. The primary factors that have impacted the team's rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks.",

      "text": "What to Read About ‘The Crown’ By Eleanor Stanford \nThe first season of “The Crown” hit Netflix on Friday. Since then the new series, a luscious dramatization of the life of Queen Elizabeth II, has generated conversations about historical accuracy and about how we mythologize the British royal family. Netflix plans to dramatize six decades of the Queen’s reign, and the first season opens with Princess Elizabeth juggling her responsibilities and her relationship, like so many modern women. How Historically Accurate Is It? \nHow ‘The Crown’ Uses Real History to Make Drama (TIME) \nKate Samuelson talks to the show’s script editor about how much research went into making the show historically accurate. It turns out that many moments in the show that seem too good to be true, like the scene in which Winston Churchill takes a bath while his secretary reads to him, really happened. \nPoor Margaret. Her affair with the palace employee Capt. Peter Townsend was hot gossip in the 1950s. This piece includes excerpts from contemporaneous reporting on the doomed affair. Will I Like It? \nWhy Should I Care About Queen Elizabeth II, Star of Netflix’s ‘The Crown’? (Vulture) \nIf you’re expecting the show to “unravel the personality of a ruler whose decisions and viewpoints shaped a nation,” look elsewhere, Kathryn VanArendonk argues. The joy of watching “The Crown,” she says, is in its exploration of how we use notable people to talk about bigger cultural narratives. \n“‘The Crown’ is costume drama done right,” writes Daniel Fienberg. If you liked “House of Cards” or “Downton Abbey,” he contends, this is a show for you. What Do the Brits Think? \nThe £100 Million Gamble on the Queen Pays Off Royally (The Guardian) \nWhen the BBC makes something about the British royal family, Lucy Mangan writes, the network is always in close communication with the staff at Buckingham Palace. Because Netflix did not do likewise, she argues, “The Crown” is “a rich, non-reverent drama.” \nNetflix is disrupting British broadcasting, too. Using “The Crown” as a starting point, an ex-BBC executive offers suggestions for how the public broadcast network can compete with the streaming giants. HAVE A MOVIE OR TV QUESTION?

      "text": "Ernesto Ruscio/Getty Images \nAmazon has scored Robert De Niro's first TV series as it continues to beef up its Prime Video content in its war against Netflix.\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter , the new mafia drama will star De Niro and fellow Oscar winner Julianne Moore. It will be directed by David O'Russell, whose previous work includes \"Silver Lining Playbook\" and \"American Hustle.\"\nBut De Niro's new show won't come cheap for Amazon. It's reportedly paying $160 million for the 16-episode show, while De Niro is getting paid $850,000 per episode.\nThat would make De Niro one of the highest paid actors on TV, right behind the three lead costars of \"The Big Bang Theory,\" who are each getting paid $1 million a pop, based on Variety's estimates . \"Gilmore Girls\" Lauren Graham gets $750,000 per show, while Kevin Spacey gets $500,000 for each \"House of Cards\" episode, Variety says. The highest paid actor among Amazon shows is Jeffrey Tambor from \"Transparent\" at $275,000 per show.\nAmazon has been stepping up its investment in its Prime Video service lately.  I n a clear sign that it's going after Netflix , Amazon made its video service available to non-Prime members in April,  launching a standalone video service that can be purchased month by month. Prior to that, Prime Video was only available through the $99 annual Prime membership, which gives access to two-day free shipping and a bunch of video and music content. \nIt's also doubling its spend on video content in the second half of this year, compared to last year, CFO Brian Olsavsky said in the most recent earnings call.  Amazon last disclosed its investment amount on video content back in 2014, when it spent a total of $1.3 billion.  \nDe Niro is the latest high-profile movie star to make the transition to TV.  Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are part of HBO's \"True Detective,\" while Netflix recently landed Jonah Hill and Emma Stone for its new series \"Maniac.\"\nNOW WATCH: The ‘Apple of China’ just unveiled a phone that’s more powerful and better looking than the iPhone \n",

Already, there has been a confirmed cast photo and the announcement of three new faces to the series. Now, it can be confirmed that producer/director Shawn Levy is returning to get behind the camera for at least two episodes, per Collider .\nLevy explains that the crew want to follow the same formula as the first season, so the Duffer Brothers are directing the first two episodes while Levy will get in for the third and fourth ones. “ Yes, we are a little superstitious so just like last year, they’re doing 1 and 2, I’m going in and doing 3 and 4. So the first four are gonna kick off exactly the same as last time… I am going to start prepping right around Thanksgiving and I’ll be filming my episodes through December and January, ” he explains. \nAs for when we’re going to see the show return, Levy urges patience. “ You can do a little bit of math, we’re not magicians so there’s no way it launches in Spring since I just admitted we started filming today, and we’re doing nine. ” That “nine” he’s referring to at the end is how many episodes there will be in the second season, which is one more than the first.\nWhile he won’t comment on specific plot points, Levy does talk a bit about Will and how his time in the Upside-Down affected him, saying, “ Will Byers was in that Upside Down for a while. So Season 2 is about this determined desire to return to normalcy in Hawkins, in the Byers family, in that group of friends, and it’s the struggle to reclaim normalcy and maybe the impossibility of it. ”\nFinally, Levy explains that he and the Duffer Brother’s are not going to find themselves in a spot where they are making things up as they go along. If a third season gets announced, they plan on being well-prepared. “ We are not gonna be caught off guard and we don’t wanna be making stuff up like the day before we have to write it and make it, ” Levy says. “ So we are definitely optimistic and we have started thinking ahead. “\n",

      "text": "print Robert De Niro Ernesto Ruscio/Getty Images \nAmazon has scored Robert De Niro's first TV series as it continues to beef up its Prime Video content in its war against Netflix. \nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter , the new mafia drama will star De Niro and fellow Oscar winner Julianne Moore. It will be directed by David O'Russell, whose previous work includes \"Silver Lining Playbook\" and \"American Hustle.\" \nBut De Niro's new show won't come cheap for Amazon. It's reportedly paying $160 million for the 16-episode show, while De Niro is getting paid $850,000 per episode. \nThat would make De Niro one of the highest paid actors on TV, right behind the three lead costars of \"The Big Bang Theory,\" who are each getting paid $1 million a pop, based on Variety's estimates . \"Gilmore Girls\" Lauren Graham gets $750,000 per show, while Kevin Spacey gets $500,000 for each \"House of Cards\" episode, Variety says. The highest paid actor among Amazon shows is Jeffrey Tambor from \"Transparent\" at $275,000 per show. \nAmazon has been stepping up its investment in its Prime Video service lately. I n a clear sign that it's going after Netflix , Amazon made its video service available to non-Prime members in April, launching a standalone video service that can be purchased month by month. Prior to that, Prime Video was only available through the $99 annual Prime membership, which gives access to two-day free shipping and a bunch of video and music content. \nIt's also doubling its spend on video content in the second half of this year, compared to last year, CFO Brian Olsavsky said in the most recent earnings call. Amazon last disclosed its investment amount on video content back in 2014, when it spent a total of $1.3 billion. \nDe Niro is the latest high-profile movie star to make the transition to TV. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are part of HBO's \"True Detective,\" while Netflix recently landed Jonah Hill and Emma Stone for its new series \"Maniac.\" Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

The movie joins our ranking of the 50 best horror movies on Netflix and should be added to your watch list if you’re in the mood for a good vintage gothic horror flick. \nFrom writer/director Osgood Perkins and producers Rob Paris, Robert Menzies. The cast features Paula Prentiss as Iris Blum, Ruth Wilson as Lily, Bob Balaban as Mr. Waxcap and Lucy Boynton as Polly Parsons. \nThe film tells the story of a Lily, a young nurse hired to care of elderly Helen Bloom, a best-selling author of ghost stories who has chosen to live out her final days in her beloved country home – a home that holds a horrific ghost story of its own. \nThis movie is a combination of a haunted house story and a ghost story but Perkins likes to refer to his movie as a ghost’s story giving a first person account of how this ghost was killed and how they ended up where they are. Perkins cites Edgar Allen Poe and Henry James, Shirley Jackson as influencers as well as murder ballads like “Pretty Polly” and “Fatal Flower Garden”.

      "text": "  \nFrench game publisher Ubisoft has already entered the world of film production, as well as the traditional television space, but its latest venture may take one of its franchises to Netflix. \nSpeaking to reporters at a news briefing Monday, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that “Ubisoft was in talks with Netflix over a series,” but stopped short of disclosing what particular game franchise, if any, the publisher had planned to use for the project. \nThough the obvious choice would appear to be the Rayman spinoff “Rabbids” series, it already exists as a Nickelodeon program titled Rabbids Invasion . \nSeveral other films based on Ubisoft’s series are already in the works. Assassin’s Creed , starring Oscar winner Marion Cotillard and Michael Fassbender, hits theaters this October, while adaptations based on Tom Clancy’s The Division , Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell , Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon, Watch Dogs , and Far Cry are also in the works. \nMore: Ubisoft celebrates 30th anniversary by making Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon free later this month \nIn the past, Ubisoft has seen its series make their way to the screen, but results have been mixed. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time stands as one of the most profitable video game films of all time , but received a mixed critical response. The first Far Cry film, directed by the infamous Uwe Boll and released in 2008, was also predictably terrible, though original developer Crytek appeared to have been in control of the series’ film rights at this point. \nGuillemot’s announcement was made as media giant Vivendi continued its efforts to exert more control over Ubisoft’s board. Vivendi now holds more than 24 percent of the company’s stock and more than 21 percent of its voting rights. Ubisoft has continued to seek investors to block a potential “hostile takeover” of the company — an event that occurred with Gameloft, a company founded by Guillemot’s brother, earlier this year.

      "text": "in You Do You \nThe next time you spend hours scrolling through Netflix (as we all inevitably do), instead of selecting your typical lighthearted romcom or yet another episode of your favorite bingeable show, why not try something a little more disturbing? \nIf you enjoy a nice and unsettling psychological thriller like The Machinist or Primal Fear, one that makes you seriously question the twisted minds who created it, then each and all of these mind-fucking films will be right up your alley. 1. The Usual Suspects (1995) \nIf you have yet to see The Usual Suspects , this is not a film for the light-hearted nor for a night of gabbing with the girls (though, I don’t think any of these films fall into that particular category.) However, from the minute you press play you will find yourself engrossed in a story about con man Kint (Kevin Spacey) who is attempting to convince federal agents that one of the most infamous criminals of all time drew himself and 4 of his partners into a multi-million dollar heist. \nWatch the trailer 2. Twisted (2004) \nTwisted is one of those movies that will have you puzzling until the very end and possibly scare you shitless. Inspector Jessica Shepard (Ashley Judd) has set out to solve San Francisco’s most recent string of murders when she realizes the victims have something in common, they’re all her ex-lovers. As the headcount increases, Shepard begins to question her own sanity and wonders if she herself could be the killer she’s hunting for. \nWatch the trailer 3. The Machinist (2004) \nEven if you haven’t heard of this film, you’ve probably seen a few disturbing photos of a barely skin and bone Christian Bale. Those were captured when he took on the role of a factory worker named Trevor Reznik who suffers from an insomnia you couldn’t imagine in your worst nightmares. His chronic lack of sleep unintentionally leads to a work accident that further disturbs him. Reznik’s increasing paranoia will have you cringeing, but hooked until the very last scene. \nWatch the trailer 4. Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (2004) \nWe’re willing to bet that many of you have seen this popular Jim Carrey film. For those of you that haven’t, you’re in for a really twisted treat. Kate Winslet plays a broken-hearted ex girlfriend of Carrey’s character who is determined to erase any memory of him from her mind. When Carrey learns of this, he decides to do the same and the pair begin to forget each other altogether. Though it sounds kind of depressing, this movie is unbelievably addicting and you might just need a glass of wine or two while watching it. \nWatch the trailer 5. Perfect Stranger (2007) \nIn this psych thriller, Halle Berry plays Rowena Price, a reporter using her keen investigative skills to seek justice for her friend’s murder. Her clues lead her to an advertising executive (Bruce Willis) and Price is forced to take on a new identity inorder to get closer to the truth. This particular movie calls for lots of blankets and probably all of the lights on unless you just enjoy being terrified. \nWatch the trailer 6. Mr. Nobody (2009) \nIt should come as no surprise that any film starring Jared Leto is going to be fucking disturbing. Don’t get me wrong, I visually enjoy Leto as much as the next girl (probably more so), but this movie amongst his others is particulary unsettling. Leto portrays the last mortal human on Earth in the year 2092 who reflects on his long past and all the lives he could have lived. \nWatch the trailer 7. All Good Things (2010) \nNext on our list of mind-wretching thrillers is the ill-fated romance between dynasty heir David Marks (Ryan Gosling) and Katie (Kirsten Dunst) a woman of modest upbringing. The couple’s once seemingly perfect marriage begins to deteriorate as David is forced to choose between his father’s company and his own sanity. This film, is also loosely based on a true story, so good luck sleeping after finishing it. \nWatch the trailer 8. Dream House (2011) \nForewarning: Do not watch this movie with the lights off, especially if you have cruel friends who enjoy jumping out at you. Yes, I’m speaking from personal experience and yes, this movie may have given me several nightmares, BUT you should totally still watch it. Daniel Craig stars as publisher Will Atenton who moves his wife and kids from a hectic New York City life to a quiet house in the New England suburbs. Already sounding creepy right? The family soon discovers that their new house was once home to a mother and her daughters who were brutally murdered. Needless to say, the Atenton family’s lives are turned upside down. \nWatch the trailer 9. The Loft (2014) \nThis is by far one of the most fucked up movies on our list and is the perfect movie to watch with your bff who just got out of a nasty breakup. It’s a twisted reminder that being single and not sneaking around might just be a better idea (no shit). When 5 men are offered the opportunity to share a penthouse in the city for their abundance of extramarital affairs, shit quickly hits the fan after the body of a dead woman appears in the loft. The group realizes the killer must be one of them, but WHO? \nWatch the trailer 10. Stonehearst Asylum (2014) \nThis 2014 film is one of my favorites on the list, partly due to the appearance of my one true love, Jim Sturgess and also, because I find insane asylums extremely intriguing. Stonehearst is not your typical asylum, though, as recent Oxford graduate Dr. Edward Newgate soon discovers. The practices applied on mental patients are shocking to say the least and Newgate begins to develop feelings for a seemingly out of place patient. However, there is something far worse brewing in the depths of the hospital and the good Dr. is forced to choose between love and his own sanity. \nWatch the trailer 11. The Invitation (2016) \nLast, but certainly not least The Invitation was released in theaters earlier this year and terrified hundreds of movie-goers (including myself). Logan Marshall-Green (swoon) is attending a supposed dinner party at his ex-wife’s house when he begins to suspect that she and her new husband have other, more deadly plans for the guests in attendance. Yeah, maybe don’t watch this one by yourself, like ever.",

      "text": "Netflix buys rights to popular Israeli TV series ‘Fauda’ November 8, 2016 2:16pm \nJERUSALEM ( JTA ) — Netflix will air the popular Israeli television series “Fauda.” \nThe drama focuses on a commando unit of the Israeli Defense Forces whose members embed themselves in the Palestinian community, gathering intelligence and preventing terror attacks. \nIts first season aired on the Israeli satellite television service YES in 2015 and went on to win for best drama series and five other awards at Israel’s Ophir Awards. It was the most watched series in the satellite network’s history. \nThe second season is in production; Netflix has purchased its rights. \nFauda is an Arabic word meaning “chaos.” The show incorporates both Arabic and Hebrew dialogue. It will air on Netflix with English subtitles. \nThe series was created by the English-language Times of Israel news website Arab affairs reporter, Avi Issacharoff, and actor Lior Raz, who stars in the show. Both men served in the IDF unit depicted in the series, according to Variety. \n",

      "text": "Election 2016: When and Where to Watch \nThe end is nigh! After a year and a half of tumult, the endless election season is finally drawing to a close. If you’re burnt out on news coverage, stream these great election films and TV specials that poke fun at the political madness — or at least put the real-life drama into perspective. \n1. Election ( Hulu ) \nPick Flick! This comedy about an overzealous candidate for high school class president ( Reese Witherspoon ) and the civics teacher determined to stop her ( Matthew Broderick ) became an instant classic when it was released in 1999. \n2. Ides of March ( Hulu ) \nGeorge Clooney and Ryan Gosling head up this high-minded drama about the messy backdoor deals that create a complicated web of alliances during an election season. \n3. Bulworth ( Netflix ) \nA candidate with nothing to lose, who says whatever’s on his mind? Sounds familiar. This 1998 film cowritten by and starring Warren Beatty depicts what happens when a senator plots his own assassination and goes for broke on the campaign trail. Reese Witherspoon in 'Election.' Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection \n4. Triumph The Insult Comic Dog Election Specials ( Hulu ) \nEver the master of finding a topic “for [him] to poop on,” this longtime fixture of Conan O’Brien ’s shows (voiced by Robert Smigel) skewers both sides of the 2016 election in three not-to-miss Hulu specials. \n5. Wag the Dog ( iTunes, $4 rental ) \nEver since this idiom turned 1997 satire was released, it has been a go-to reference for political maneuverings by way of conveniently timed “news” dropping. In the film, a PR mastermind ( Robert De Niro ) and a Hollywood director ( Dustin Hoffman ) invent a fictional war in order to distract from their candidate’s messy sex scandal. \n6. Game Change ( HBO Now ) \nThe only figures more entertaining than Sarah Palin herself are the actresses who have portrayed her. While Tina Fey ’s folksy SNL impression made a splash in the 2008 election, it’s Julianne Moore ’s nuanced portrayal in this 2012 drama that’s stunning to watch. Just check out this scene where she tries to pronounce “Saakashvili.” Ryan Gosling in 'Ides of March.' Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection \n7. An American President ( iTunes, $4 rental ) \nGet a break from the drama with some romance in the oval office! This 1995 film features a widower president ( Michael Douglas ) and the lobbyist ( Annette Bening ) whose heart he tries to win, along with his reelection. \n8. The Campaign ( iTunes, $4 rental ) \nAfter years of impersonating George W. Bush on Saturday Night Live, Will Ferrell fit right in to this absurd 2012 election comedy in which his career politician, Cam Brady, goes head-to-head with naïve underdog Marty Huggins ( Zach Galifianakis ). \n9. Primary Colors ( Amazon Prime ) \nInspired by Bill Clinton ’s 1992 campaign, this sharp comedy penned by Elaine May features John Travolta as a candidate who’s sure to win the presidency … until enemies exposing his affairs and special favors come out of the woodwork. Sean Penn in 'Milk.' Focus Features/Courtesy Everett Collection \n10. In the Loop ( Hulu , Netflix ) \nExpect to hear the most creatively foul insults ever lobbed in this satire about the behind-the-scenes negotiations between American and British political operatives, directed by Veep showrunner Armando Iannucci.",

      "title": "Ubisoft Talking to Netflix About Making a TV Series",
      "text": "Video game publisher and developer Ubisoft reveals it is currently in talks with the streaming service Netflix to potentially create a brand new television series. As of late, Ubisoft is no stranger when it comes to adapting the video game versions of its intellectual properties into live-action products. For instance, the company’s Assassin’s Creed series is set to receive its first full-fledged theatrical release this December with the Academy Award-nominated actor Michael Fassbender in the lead role.\nNow, it seems as if Ubisoft is prepared to set its sights on the small screen, as the publisher and developer is discussing the possibility of producing a television series with massively popular video streaming service Netflix. As it happens, Reuters officially reported that the company’s CEO Yves Guillemot stated on Monday that Ubisoft was “in talks with Netflix over a series.”\nDetails are scant at the moment, but according to the report, Ubisoft’s Guillemot declared that the Netflix talks were a part of a response to Vivendi’s acquisition of extra stock shares in the company . As one would surmise, it’s more than likely that the television series would be an adaptation of one of Ubisoft’s properties, but, of course, it’s not guaranteed. However, it would be strange for the company to not capitalize on the popularity of a preexisting franchise and opt to make a totally original program instead.\n\nShould Ubisoft eventually hammer out a deal to create its own show for Netflix, it will be joining the ranks of other video game publishers and developers that have done so. For example, the company’s competitor in Activision recently released Skylanders Academy on Netflix , which Activision declares to be the streaming platform’s first original show based on a video game property.\nLike Activision’s own Activision-Blizzard Studios for television and film projects, Ubisoft also has a movie and TV studio , dubbed Ubisoft Motion Pictures. The division of the company produced the Rabbids Invasion TV show for Nickelodeon, and is also planning on putting out a movie based on its third-person shooter The Division starring actor Jake Gyllenhaal .\nTaking all of this into consideration, Ubisoft’s decision to potentially foray into television with Netflix would undoubtedly become a lucrative venture, especially should the company center the series around one of its more kid-friendly properties like Rayman: Origins , as it could market and sell lots of colorful toys and ancillary products. Naturally, though, it’s anyone’s guess as to what will come of Ubisoft’s negotiations with Netflix, but the company could end up surprising everyone by catering to more mature audiences with a series focusing on one of its Tom Clancy titles like, say, Splinter Cell .\nUbisoft ‘s next major video game release is Watch Dogs 2 , and it’s set to launch on November 15, 2016 PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and on November 29, 2016 for PC.\nSource: Reuters (via GameSpot )\n",

      "text": "A five-year-old patent brawl between Netflix and Rovi (now TiVo) has reached a turning point, with the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upholding a major lower-court victory by Netflix.\nThe litigation between the two companies began in 2011, when Netflix sued to invalidate a batch of patents on Rovi's digital entertainment guides, for which Rovi had demanded Netflix pay licensing fees.\nThe patents described ways of navigating TV and other video content online. Even after Netflix lawyers bested Rovi at the International Trade Commission and then pounded all five patents out of existence at district court last year, Rovi said it would push forward with an appeal.\nNow it's clear that Rovi's strategy to patent digital TV guides has hit a wall. Just a few days after Rovi's lawyers made their oral argument, a panel of judges at the Federal Circuit upheld (PDF) the lower court's decision in its entirety without comment.\nFurther Reading Netflix nukes Rovi’s “we own TV guide” patents Rovi's patents were on very basic ways of organizing video content, including one on using \"combination categories\" like \"sports dramas\" or \"romantic comedies.\" Another was on bookmarking shows across devices, which Rovi argued was a new idea when it filed its patent. \"A novel abstract idea is still an abstract idea,\" US District Judge Phyllis Hamilton informed the company in her opinion, which has now been upheld.\nRovi sued and settled with other companies over its patents, including Amazon, Hulu, Toshiba, Sharp, and China-based Haier.\nIn April, Rovi acquired TiVo , another company that has turned its patents into a revenue stream. It soon took on TiVo's name. Executives of the merged company told investors they were going to focus more on licensing IP than building hardware. But even with TiVo's big litigation wins, the company couldn't ultimately stop itself from becoming an afterthought. The big bets that companies like TiVo and Rovi made on software patents aren't panning out, especially since the Supreme Court's Alice decision has made it substantially easier to invalidate patents that describe basic business processes.\nNeither TiVo nor Netflix immediately responded to requests for comment on the decision.",

      "text": "French game publisher Ubisoft has already entered the world of film production, as well as the traditional television space, but its latest venture may take one of its franchises to Netflix.\nSpeaking to reporters at a news briefing Monday, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said that “Ubisoft was in talks with Netflix over a series,” but stopped short of disclosing what particular game franchise, if any, the publisher had planned to use for the project.\nThough the obvious choice would appear to be the Rayman spinoff “Rabbids” series, it already exists as a Nickelodeon program titled Rabbids Invasion .\nSeveral other films based on Ubisoft’s series are already in the works. Assassin’s Creed , starring Oscar winner Marion Cotillard and Michael Fassbender, hits theaters this October, while adaptations based on Tom Clancy’s The Division , Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell , Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon, Watch Dogs , and Far Cry are also in the works.\nMore: Ubisoft celebrates 30th anniversary by making Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon free later this month\nIn the past, Ubisoft has seen its series make their way to the screen, but results have been mixed. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time stands as one of the most profitable video game films of all time , but received a mixed critical response. The first Far Cry film, directed by the infamous Uwe Boll and released in 2008, was also predictably terrible, though original developer Crytek appeared to have been in control of the series’ film rights at this point.\nGuillemot’s announcement was made as media giant Vivendi continued its efforts to exert more control over Ubisoft’s board.

Of course, we still follow Queen Elizabeth's every move to this day, but what did she and her family look like during the era that the show's first season takes place, in the '40s and '50s? Here's a quick look at the main characters on the show, alongside their real-life royal counterparts. We attempted to find photos of each at the age they're seen in the show, but we had to settle for some from a bit later on. Take a look! Related:",

      "text": "Netflix Grabs SVOD Rights to 'Bellas de Noche' Updated: November 8, 2016 — 9:00 AM EST Share Anna Marie de la Fuente Variety Media, LLC \nBy Anna Marie de la Fuente \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Vying for a top award at the Los Cabos Int'l Film Festival's Mexico First competition with her maiden docu-feature \"Bellas de Noche\" (\"Beauties of the Night\"), Maria Jose Cuevas comes with prizes and top festival berths already under her belt. \nAfter participating in Los Cabos' Work in Progress program last year, her docu screened at the Ambulante and Telluride film fests after which Netflix snapped it up before it participated in Toronto. Exhibition grandee Cinepolis plans to release it in late November, after which it rolls out on Netflix, most likely in February. \nAt the Morelia Int'l Film Fest in October, \"Bellas de Noche\" won best documentary, the Premio Guerrero Press Award and best documentary by a woman, the latter an apt win given the subject matter of her docu: In \"Bellas de Noche,\" Cuevas explores the past and present lives of Mexico City's showgirls, pop culture celebrities in the '70s and '80s. \nA graphic designer, photographer and video artist, Cuevas was about 10 years old when her father, a famous painter, took her to cabarets and into the dressing rooms of these showgirls. After meeting one of her docu subjects, Princess Yamal, 10 years ago, she was inspired to interview more of them and start researching for her docu, which she produced along with Cinepantera and Detalle Films. \n\"The massive 1985 earthquake in Mexico City destroyed these cabarets, which were never rebuilt, so they are the last generation of these showgirls,\" said Cuevas. She filmed some 180 hours of film, gaining the confidence and trust of her five subjects, one of whom, Lyn May, will attend Los Cabos. \n\"Thanks to my privileged access to them, I feel I learned how to celebrate life; understand what gives life meaning and makes us alive,\" she mused. She credits her sister, video artist Ximena Cuevas, for skillfully editing her doc. \"She's the only one who understood me completely and what direction I wanted to take,\" she said. \nHer next docu will deal with something even closer to home: her father Jose Luis Cuevas whose young wife has isolated him from everyone, including his family. But that is just the takeoff point of her main theme, mental manipulation. \n\"What I like are portraits of human beings; to explore the human condition, discover and understand it.\" More Coverage ",

      "text": "Netflix Picks Up Israeli Political Thriller 'Fauda' Updated: November 8, 2016 — 1:20 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Debra Kamin \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Netflix has picked up \"Fauda,\" the nail-biting Israeli television series about a deep-cover unit of the Israeli Defense Forces. The streaming site will begin airing the drama's first season, which played to critical acclaim on Israeli satellite network YES last year, on Dec. 2. \nNetflix has also purchased rights to \"Fauda's\" second season, which is in production. \n\"Fauda\" follows a close-knit unit of mista'arvim, the commando unit of the Israel army whose soldiers are trained in the language, dress and mannerisms of Palestinians, and whose undercover work is hailed in Israel for scuppering terror attacks and guiding military operations. \nThe show was the most-watched in YES history and also earned a best drama statue at the 2015 Israeli version of the Emmys. \nThe series was created by Avi Issacharoff, a journalist and Arab affairs specialist, and actor Lior Raz. The show broke barriers in Israel by giving its Arab characters equal screen time and equally complex backstories as its Jewish characters. The terrorists, in this show, are as much fathers and brothers as they are combatants, and are drawn with equal complexity as the Jewish soldiers. Neither side, the show insists, is innocent. \nWith both Arabic and Hebrew dialogue, the show also found its way into Palestinian audiences' hearts, and its plot twists, hostage negotiations and close-combat battle scenes were rehashed on Arabic social media at a level never before seen for Israeli television. \nThe Netflix deal was brokered by Hadas Mozes Lictenstein from ADD Content Agency and Danna Stern from Yes DBS Satellite. According to the deal, Fauda will be dubbed a Netflix Original Series -- the first-ever Israeli series to receive such a label. \nThe show will be aired in its original languages of Arabic and Hebrew, with English subtitles. \nIssacharoff and Raz will be on hand in Los Angeles for a screening and premiere party on Nov. 28.

      "text": "Ubisoft Talking to Netflix About a Series   Alex Co \nWhile Ubisoft is once again turning one of its biggest video game franchise into a movie with Assassin’s Creed , it seems the publisher is eyeing more than that. \nAccording to Reuters, Ubisoft CEP and Chairman Yves Guillemot has been in talks with entertainment company Netflix over a “series.”Unfortunately, that’s all we know for now. While nothing’s certain, Ubisoft is most likely attempting to turn one of its video game franchises the Netflix treatment. Given how awesome Stranger Things turned out, as well as how Netflix has handled Marvel’s property, that’s not a bad move by Ubisoft. \nCould this be a new revenue stream for Ubisoft? What Ubisoft franchise would you want to see on Netflix?",

      "text": "Netflix has picked up “ Fauda ,” the nail-biting Israeli television series about a deep-cover unit of the Israeli Defense Forces. The streaming site will begin airing the drama’s first season, which played to critical acclaim on Israeli satellite network YES last year, on Dec. 2.\nNetflix has also purchased rights to “Fauda’s” second season, which is in production.\n“Fauda” follows a close-knit unit of mista’arvim, the commando unit of the Israel army whose soldiers are trained in the language, dress and mannerisms of Palestinians, and whose undercover work is hailed in Israel for scuppering terror attacks and guiding military operations.\nThe show was the most-watched in YES history and also earned a best drama statue at the 2015 Israeli version of the Emmys.\nThe series was created by Avi Issacharoff , a journalist and Arab affairs specialist, and actor Lior Raz. Both are graduates themselves of the mista’arvim unit. The show broke barriers in Israel by giving its Arab characters equal screen time and equally complex backstories as its Jewish characters. The terrorists, in this show, are as much fathers and brothers as they are combatants, and are drawn with equal complexity as the Jewish soldiers. Neither side, the show insists, is innocent.\nWith both Arabic and Hebrew dialogue, the show also found its way into Palestinian audiences’ hearts, and its plot twists, hostage negotiations and close-combat battle scenes were rehashed on Arabic social media at a level never before seen for Israeli television.\nThe Netflix deal was brokered by Hadas Mozes Lictenstein from ADD Content Agency and Danna Stern from Yes DBS Satellite. According to the deal, Fauda will be dubbed a Netflix Original Series — the first-ever Israeli series to receive such a label.\nThe show will be aired in its original languages of Arabic and Hebrew, with English subtitles.\nIssacharoff and Raz will be on hand in Los Angeles for a screening and premiere party on Nov. 28.\nRelated stories\nNetflix Acquires Global Rights to Korean Nuclear Disaster Film 'Pandora'\nNetflix Grabs SVOD Rights to 'Bellas de Noche'\n'Stranger Things' Season 2 Casts Sean Astin, Paul Reiser, Linnea Berthelsen\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "Home » News » Netflix Patches Vulnerability That Allowed Account Takeover Via… Netflix Patches Vulnerability That Allowed Account Takeover Via Voicemail Latest Security News \nAn Austrian security researcher recently unveiled a vulnerability affecting Netflix that allowed attackers to takeover user accounts. \nIn a blog post published on Monday, the researcher – known as ‘ Slashcrypto ’ – explained the attack works when a victim’s voicemail can be hacked to bypass the password reset function of Netflix. \n“… When a user wanted to request the code, the user had the possibility to get an automated voice call, which then told the code to the user,” said the researcher. \nHowever, the researcher notes that certain mobile carriers, such as Austria’s T-Mobile network, do not password-protect users’ voicemail by default. This leaves many users vulnerable to the issue of voicemail hacking. \nAn attacker must also be able to spoof the number from which the call is supposedly coming from, although a “very easy” step nowadays due to VoIP, said the researcher. \nConsequently, the post claims it was possible to take over a target’s Netflix account using the following exploit flow: On the Netflix password reset screen, enter the victim’s account ID and corresponding phone number. Request a voice call to reset the account password – at the same time, call the victim, so that the automated call gets redirected to the voicemail of the victim. Spoof the caller ID to get access to the victim’s mailbox and play the voicemail with the security code. \n“This means, that if the victim added a phone number to his/her Netflix account to improve the security of the account, it actually weakened it,” said the researcher. \nThe bug was reported to Netflix via its responsible disclosure program. \n“I noticed that they have a really good and fast responding security team,” the researcher added. “It took a little bit longer to fix the issue because the automated phone calls used by Netflix are handled by a third party.” \nNetflix fixed the bug on November 4 by requiring a key press before the security code gets transmitted to ensure the automated call does not go to voicemail. \n“This is nothing new, it is no new discovery and everybody who is in security should be aware of this,” concluded the researcher. \n“ I think, many people do not know that caller ID spoofing, SMS spoofing or E-Mail spoofing even exists and that it is relatively easy to do for everyone,” the researcher warned. \nThe researcher urges users to set a voicemail password, if their provider offers the feature.",

      "text": "Nov 8, 2016 6:03 PM (Image: Comcast) Share Tweet \nIt might be difficult to envision at this point on election day, but no matter which candidate becomes our supreme overlord, life will actually go on after tonight. In fact, Comcast subscribers even have something to look forward to once this election nonsense wraps up, as USA Today is reporting that the cable company’s new X1 TV boxes will begin to include Netflix in the coming days. That means (if you have a brand new Comcast box), you’ll be able to watch Netflix through the same thing that allows you to watch cable, without having to go through the tedious process of changing an input or just glancing down at your phone. This unexpected team-up was announced back in July , with some pessimistic analysts suggesting that it’s part of a scheme to convince the government that the cable companies and streaming providers are playing nice and not engaging in any illegal monopolies. \nBut who cares about that, because soon it’ll be easier for some people to watch Netflix. The USA Today report even quotes Netflix’s Reed Hastings as saying that the Comcast user interface is “the most convenient” one they’ve ever had—which seems like a low bar to get past, since some of the Netflix interfaces out there are pretty horrid. Hastings also hypes up Comcast’s new X1 voice remote, saying that it’s like “magic” because he just has to say “Netflix” and it pops up on the screen. Granted, that’s a thing lots of phones and streaming devices have been able to do for a while, but whatever. \nSend your Newswire tips to",

      "text": "Courtesy of Bill Nye August 31, 2016 | 08:45AM PT \nScientist Bill Nye has landed a new Netflix talk show set to launch in spring 2017, the streaming network announced Wednesday. “Bill Nye Saves the World” will explore science and its impact on politics, society and pop culture. \nEach episode of the series will tackle a topic from a scientific point of view, dispelling myths, and refuting anti-scientific claims that may be espoused by politicians, religious leaders or titans of industry. \n“Bill Nye Saves the World” marks Nye’s long-awaited return to TV since first emerging as a household name in the 1990s as the creator and star of the Emmy award-winning syndicated television show “Bill Nye the Science Guy,” which ran for five seasons and introduced millennial audiences to science and engineering. \n“Since the start of the ‘Science Guy’ show, I’ve been on a mission to change the world by getting people everywhere excited about the fundamental ideas in science,” said Nye. “Today, I’m excited to be working with Netflix on a new show, where we’ll discuss the complex scientific issues facing us today, with episodes on vaccinations, genetically modified foods and climate change. With the right science and good writing, we’ll do our best to enlighten and entertain our audience. And, perhaps we’ll change the world a little.” \n“Bill Nye Saves the World” is produced for Netflix by Bunim/Murray Productions. Gil Goldschein and Julie Pizzi serve as executive producers for Bunim/Murray Productions. Michael Naidus (“The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson”) serves as showrunner and executive pproducer. Writer and standup comedian Mike Drucker serves as Head Comedy Writer; and, astronomer, author and award-winning science communicator Phil Plait serves as Head Science Writer. \nNye is represented by United Talent Agency.

      "text": "10 Awesome Films You Probably Missed Life's too short to spend browsing Netflix - watch these movies instead. Flipboard Shout Factory \nDepending on which survey you believe, the average viewer spends 18 minutes each day (or 115 hours per year) browsing Netflix for something to watch. That’s 4.9 days spent wondering if Dolph Lundgren’s Shark Lake will suck as badly as Lake Placid Vs Anaconda (it does). \nClearly, this is part of a conspiracy designed to lower standards, dull sensations and pave the way for a Razzie Award winner’s assault on the White House. Now that all that nonsense is behind us, we can focus on the important stuff, such as deciding whether Fifty Shades Of Black is worse than Dirty Grandpa (jury’s still out). \nFailing that, you could always settle for what old time critics call a “sleeper” – a movie that comes out of nowhere and knocks your socks off. Typically featuring no-name casts (or future stars in their salad days) and produced for Batman V Superman’s catering budget, these are the kinds of films that make the hunt worthwhile. \nSee for yourself.",
