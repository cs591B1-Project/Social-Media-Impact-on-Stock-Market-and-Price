Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement - including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu - customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods.

      "text": "Michael Keaton on McDonald's founder Ray Kroc - and that Beetlejuice sequel Karl Quinn 18 Nov 2016, 12:30 p.m. Having narrowly missed out in 2015 with Birdman, Michael Keaton is once again stirring Oscar talk with The Founder. But, he tells Karl Quinn, he won't let the chatter go to his head. Michael Keaton on McDonald's founder Ray Kroc - and that Beetlejuice sequel \"Work hard and never whine\": Michael Keaton's latest role has the Oscars pundits buzzing. Photo: Art Streiber / AUGUST/Raven & Snow ╳ exit \nThe official version of the McDonald's story runs as smooth and orderly as every one of the fast-food giant's franchise operations is meant to. \nA single burger stand in California gives birth to a global brand. The people who started it, brothers Dick and Maurice McDonald, watch on happily as the man who saw its potential rolls it out across the US. And when Ray Kroc offers them $3 million for full rights to the name and the company in 1961 (a sum worth about $24 million in today's money), everybody walks away from the table feeling pretty damned McHappy with themselves. \nOnly that's not quite how it played out. \nThe version of the McDonald's story told in John Lee Hancock's The Founder is rather different from the version you'll find on the McDonald's website , though both place Ray Kroc front and centre. In the official version he is an inspiration and a visionary. But the version of Kroc portrayed so brilliantly in the film by Michael Keaton is also a cut-throat, a drunk and an utter cad. \nSo, I ask Keaton, when you were offered the role, did Ray Kroc strike you as a heroic character or a villainous one? \n\"He struck me as an interesting character,\" he says. \"In a lot of ways this is not even a biopic. It's about a thing, a thing that is personified by Ray Kroc. It's the story of the free enterprise system, about capitalism.\" \nThe Founder opens squarely in Death of a Salesman territory, with Kroc a struggling travelling rep for a company that sells milkshake machines. They're bulky, expensive, and damned hard to shift. We get scene after scene of Kroc lugging one of these cast-aluminium beasts out of the boot of his car and onto the counter of some rundown milk bar in the middle of that vast American heartland, only to be greeted by the stony indifference of the proprietor. The only thing that stops him throwing in the towel, you suspect, is the fact he owns the company, Prince Castle. The Founder .\" src=\"http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/o/c/s/5/i/image.imgtype.articleLeadwide.620x349.png/1461626033536.png\" title=\"\" width=\"100%\">\nWinners are grinners: Could Keaton's turn as Ray Kroc spell Oscar glory? Photo: Roadshow \nIt is just the latest in a long line of moderately successful enterprises the thrusting Kroc has thrown himself into, we soon discover. His wife, played by Laura Dern, wants him to settle for what they've got – a big house, dinners at the country club, a place in polite society if only he stuck around long enough to take up the offer. \"When's enough going to be enough for you?\" she asks him at one stage. \"Probably never,\" he replies. \nKroc's life changes when he gets an order for six machines from one operator in San Bernardino, California. Intrigued, he drives thousands of kilometres to take a look. What he sees there – a fast-food joint run like an auto assembly plant, with the McDonald brothers' patented Speedee system and a workspace planned down to the inch – blows his mind. That the burgers are good, the fries crisp and the milkshakes thick, and all delivered to him seconds after ordering, only seals the deal. \nAnother day, another zero dollars. \nKeaton says it's hard for us to appreciate just how revolutionary this all was in 1954. \"I don't think people realise how much McDonald's changed things culturally. The way we eat – anywhere you want. You don't need any silverware, you don't need anything. We don't think about that now, but it really changed things.\" \nThere are now more than 36,000 McDonald's outlets globally. The company operates in 119 countries. For many of us it seems always to have been there ( the first McDonald's in Australia opened in 1971 ; today, there are more than 900 stores here). \nKeaton knew nothing about the origin story before he read the script. \"You just drive by those big arches, that big M, and you think it's just a thing like a tree, a thing I see every day,\" he says. \"I didn't even know there were McDonalds brothers.\" \nWhich is probably just the way Ray Kroc would have wanted it. \n\"That's exactly right,\" he says with a laugh. \nThere are many great moments in The Founder , but one of the finest has Kroc producing a business card with the single word \"Founder\" beneath his name. By the time he's pulled it out of his pocket, we know beyond doubt that he is not the founder – or at least not the founder of the burgers, the fries, the production line, the golden arches, the name or any of the other things we generally associate with McDonald's. But he is the man who saw the potential in all of that, the man who convinced the McDonald brothers – played here with a very straight bat by Parks and Recreation 's Nick Offerman and character actor John Carroll Lynch – to let him franchise the concept. \nMac McDonald (John Carroll Lynch) and his brother Dick (Nick Offerman) in The Founder . \nTo a degree, The Founder is really a meditation on the virtues or otherwise of copyright. Yes, the idea belonged to the McDonald brothers, but if it had stayed with them, its full potential might never have been realised (and granted, a lot of people might argue that would be no bad thing). Yes, Kroc is a bit of a crook, but in seeing and unlocking all that burger stand might become he is also something of a genius. \n\"It was really the beginning of branding, and Ray Kroc understood branding,\" says Keaton. \"He understood everything the McDonald brothers didn't understand. And they had the chance to jump on, they had every chance in the world to go along for the ride, and when they didn't he said, 'All right, I'm going to go on this ride without you'.\" \nKeaton is deeply ambivalent about Kroc. \"What I admire is his work ethic, his determination, his ambition, his hustle, his go-get-'em spirit. That I'll defend all day long.\" \nBut, he says, \"the choices he makes towards the end after he becomes successful are harsh, man – I mean harsh – and nothing I would ever do, nothing most people would ever do. But that's one of the more interesting things about the movie, if you ask me.\" \nHis favourite scene in the movie, he says, \"doesn't even have dialogue\". It's just Kroc staying behind into the night, after everyone else has gone home, to obsessively sweep and clean the forecourt of his store in Des Plaines, Illinois (the first one opened under his management). \"My oldest brother ran a dry-cleaning business and he worked like that,\" he says. \nKeaton was one of seven kids raised by his Catholic parents in a farmhouse in Pennsylvania. In the speech he gave at the Golden Globes in 2015, when he won best actor in a comedy film for Birdman , he said \"I don't ever remember a time when my father [a civil engineer] did not work two jobs\". \nMichael Keaton let it all hang out in Birdman . \nRay Kroc would have been perfectly comfortable with the principles instilled by the parents of the man born Michael Douglas (he changed his name when he took to acting for obvious reasons). \"In the household in which I was raised, the themes were pretty simple,\" he said at the Globes. \"Work hard. Don't quit. Be appreciative. Be thankful. Be grateful. Be respectful. Also to never whine. Ever. Never complain and always, for cryin' out loud, keep a sense of humour.\" \nThe ruthless side of Kroc doesn't sit so well with Keaton, an avowed Democrat (albeit one who enjoys hunting in the wilds near his home in Montana), but there was never any question of softening his sharp edges for the screen. \n\"To try and sugar-coat anything, I had zero interest in that,\" he says. \"To be honest with you, I find it kind of cowardly as an actor to always need to be loved, to be begging for sympathy. \n\"The people I love, like Joaquin Phoenix and Daniel Day-Lewis, the people whose work I like, it never enters their mind. The character is the character. The story is the story. My job is to serve it.\" \nIt's fair to say that, at 65, Michael Keaton is enjoying a career renaissance when most people are thinking about retiring. It's not that he ever stopped working: between Batman in 1989 and Birdman in 2014, he made 24 movies, including one as star and director ( The Merry Gentlemen , 2008), and a bunch of TV too. It's just that he somehow slid inexorably off that rung reserved for stars and back into the ranks of the jobbing actor (albeit the jobbing actor still getting film roles in Hollywood). \nBut there's no question Birdman set his career soaring again. With its fading star most famous for playing a superhero, Alejandro Inarritu's film looked like it had been written specifically for Keaton, though it had not. But it certainly reminded the world what it had been missing. \nKeaton won the Golden Globe and was hotly tipped to add the best actor Oscar. But while the film won four statues in February 2015, Keaton missed out to Eddie Redmayne (for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything ), and the eagle-eyed cringed for him as the camera briefly caught sight of Keaton putting his acceptance speech back in his pocket. \nIt must have been a bittersweet experience, I suggest. \n\"It was just a sweet experience,\" he shoots back. \"Sweet, sweet, sweet. Eliminate the bitter. Sweet, sweet, sweet as can be. I just loved it, loved all of it.\" \nThere's a growing sense that The Founder may give him another crack; certainly the film's release has been timed for an Oscar run and the buzz around it, and Keaton's performance, is strong. We can certainly expect to see a rash of \"for your consideration\" ads in the Hollywood trade papers over the next couple of months. \nDoes that create any kind of pressure? \n\"It's flattering but it doesn't really affect me,\" says Keaton. \"I mean it affects you because it's bigger than you are, it's a giant international industry, and you'd have to be an idiot to be totally ignorant of the process. But I ain't gonna die one way or the other. I'm gonna keep doing what I do, in my career and in life.\" To Beetlejuice or not to Beetlejuice, that is the question: Michael Keaton on those sequel rumours \nThere's really only one thing that would give Keaton's many fans greater satisfaction than seeing him collect an Oscar: a sequel to Tim Burton's1988 comic-horror masterpiece Beetlejuice . \nIt's been promised for years, and it's listed in Keaton's imdb credits as a project for 2017, with a big red \"announced\" next to it. \nSo, is it real? \n\"I have no idea,\" he says. \nRiiight. But are you at least interested in doing it? \n\"I keep getting asked this question, so you can help me,\" he says, sounding more bewildered than annoyed. \"I really mean this, because I've been asked this how long – 10 years? Longer than that. So, tell me what makes you ask the question.\" \nMichael Keaton and Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice . \nWell, I've read bits and pieces about it in the trades over the years. \n\"But when did you start hearing about it, and what made you think I was thinking about it?\" \nEr, it's there on your imdb credits. As \"announced\". And yes, I know we should always take that stuff with a large grain of salt, which is why I'm asking if it's real. \n\"Yeah. I know,\" he says, now sounding a little weary of the whole thing. \"But have you ever read anything about what I think about it? Honestly, this is the reason I'm asking. \n\"I can go back 20 years, maybe longer, maybe I was the one who even brought it up. I maybe said, 'If there's one thing I'd like to remake it's Beetlejuice ' – and that might be 20 years ago that I said it. Nobody paid attention, but all of a sudden people tell me, 'I hear you're doing it', and I'm like 'I have no idea what you're talking about'. Wait a minute, am I crazy? Why are people still talking about this? \n\"This is a thing that's come and gone like 10 times. People say, 'Hey, it was announced today', and I say 'Really? Well I haven't heard'. Then it goes away and then it comes back again. Then another four years pass.\" \nSo, are you saying it's not happening? \n\"Look, that's a little piece of art. That's Tim Burton as an artist, it's 100 per cent original, it's unique, and you can say that about hardly anything. I f---ing loved doing that movie. If I never did another thing, you could point to it and say, 'There was never anything like that'. So I always said, man let's do that again.\" \nSo, it is happening? It isn't happening? Where are we on this? \n\"Whoever is in charge has had the opportunity to make it for many, many years,\" he says. \"They should have just pulled the trigger and done it. But they didn't, and it had nothing to do with me or Tim.\" \nSo, you wouldn't say you're exactly haunted by the spectre of this much-rumoured Beetlejuice sequel, then? \n\"It doesn't haunt me at all.\" \nJust the rest of us. \n\"That's true,\" he laughs – and, spookily, he sounds a little like Betelgeuse as he does. \"You all need a bio-exorcist.\" \nKarl Quinn is on facebook at karlquinnjournalist and on twitter @karlkwin ",

      "text": "McDonald’s mcd , aiming to become more modern and nimble, is updating U.S. restaurants with self-service kiosk ordering, mobile payments, “smart” menu boards, custom sandwiches and table service, executives said on Thursday.\nThe 61-year-old fast-food company has been overhauling its food with simpler ingredients and selling breakfast items 24-hours a day, but it is playing catch up in the technology realm to early adopters such as Domino’s Pizza, Starbucks and Panera Bread.\nAbout 500 of McDonald’s more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants have made the changes with Florida, New York and Southern California the first regions to adopt the new format.\nRestaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, and Seattle will start making the switch next year, according to the company, which declined to give a timeline for how long the changes will take to go nationwide.\nMcDonald’s will pilot mobile ordering in the U.S. in the first half of 2017 and do a national rollout in the second half, Chris Kempczinski, a former Kraft Foods executive who will take over as McDonald’s USA president on Jan. 1, told journalists at a press event in New York. Mobile ordering and payment will be added to the McDonald’s app, which has been downloaded by 16 million people, he said.\nChief Executive Steve Easterbrook said the company was in the early stage of using technology. “There is nothing more powerful than one-on-one customer experience” such as smartphone apps, he said to Reuters .\nStill, some of McDonald’s U.S. franchisees have chafed at the prospect of making significant investments at a time when labor costs are rising and restaurant sales growth is tepid.\nAnalysts note that just 50% of U.S. McDonald’s restaurants have been recently renovated, and the company wants new food and tech elements in addition to the restaurant makeovers.\nThe cost of installing kiosks is between $50,000 and $60,000 and the company is willing to help with money or financing, McDonald’s executives said. Eastbrook has said that equipment is not expected to reduce the number of workers in restaurants, since traditional order takers would be redeployed to help customers learn to operate kiosks and to deliver food to tables.\nDemonstrating returns is key to convincing franchisees to make the switch, executives said. In a video, one U.K. executive said sales grew 8% in downtown London as a result of the initiative.\n“People may not always like to change, but people like to make money,” Kempczinski told Reuters.\nMcDonald’s USA draws on results from modernization projects in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada as it pushes the effort. “We’ve worked a lot of the kinks out,” Easterbrook told Reuters. \nFor more on McDonald’s, watch Fortune’s video: \n\nKempczinski said McDonald’s may also pick up the pace of its response to consumer demands for simpler, more natural food.\nMcDonald’s USA already has switched to chicken raised without antibiotics important to human health, replaced margarine with butter in its Egg McMuffins, and swapped sugar for high-fructose corn syrup in its hamburger buns.\nMost recently, it said it would fully transition to cage-free eggs in the U.S. and Canada over the next decade.",

      "text": "Scott Olson / Getty Images ID: 10004981 \nThe next step in McDonald’s ongoing evolution — which already all-day breakfast, some upgraded ingredients, and new restaurant designs — is table service.For those wanting to dine in, servers will now bring the burger to the customer at their table. It’s major departure from the bare-bones services that customers associate with fast food — a style shaped in large part by McDonald’s itself.McDonald’s executives announced the new table service option on Thursday, describing it as another step in efforts to reshape the chain into a “modern, progressive burger company.” The company is trying to sustain a domestic sales turnaround which has seen growth return after years of decline. \nIn the new system, customers order via touchscreen kiosk or with a cashier, then take a Bluetooth-enabled, numbered locator to their table. The locator allows servers to detect what general section of the restaurant they are in, spot the table, and deliver the food. Venessa Wong for BuzzFeed News ID: 10004944 \nThe company did not say when table service would be available in all 14,000 US restaurants. About 500 US stores already offer table service and kiosk ordering, which is coming soon to restaurants in Boston, Washington DC, Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco — markets that CEO Steve Easterbrook called “opinion-shaping” and “trendsetting.” \nThe shift to ordering via touchscreen kiosks has raised many questions about the future of the low-paid jobs that McDonald’s offers in abundance, with some believing the chain will reduce its labor needs through automation as labor costs rise. \nIn an interview with BuzzFeed News, Easterbrook said the new table service model will not affect restaurants’ headcount or labor costs, as the addition of self-service ordering will shift workers who were behind the counter into new roles delivering orders. He does hope, however, that this additional service will grow sales without increasing labor costs. \nIn the first half of 2017, McDonald’s will also have a limited launch of a mobile order and pay app in several markets, which it plans to make available nationwide by the end of next year. \nEasterbrook said the dine-in experience at McDonald’s hasn’t evolved as quickly as it needed to. The new table service program is about giving customers more options, he said, pointing to the program’s success in European markets where it has already launched. \nBut in America, table service can only play a small part in how the burger chain is experienced by its customers: about 70% of US sales come from the drive-thru. Of the remaining 30% that do walk in, a significant portion takes their food to go.Franchise owners, who are responsible for the day-to day management of most McDonald’s restaurants, will need to invest in the new touchscreen ordering kiosks. The size of such investments will vary based on the size of store: the cost for eight screens is about $56,000, according to a spokesperson.

      "text": "Bank led by Treasury contender hit with discrimination claim By Danielle Wiener-Bronner \nSo the fast food giant is rolling out self-order kiosks, mobile pay options, an updated interior design, even table service. \nThe changes are already starting to show up at locations in Florida, New York and Southern California, where 500 restaurants have been updated. Restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, D.C. and Seattle will get upgrades in early 2017. \nNow, McDonald's loyalists will be able to place their customized order on a touch screen, take a seat and have their meal brought right over. Next year, they'll even have the option of mobile ordering. \n\"Customers have access to information that gives them much more control over their lives,\" Easterbrook said in an interview with CNNMoney's Cristina Alesci. \nThat's pushing consumers to demand more, he says -- especially in the way of personalized eating. \n\"They're expecting us to evolve and offer greater convenience,\" Easterbrook said. \nThe move is the company's latest attempt to win back the customers it's lost to popular fast-casual joints like Shake Shack. When Easterbrook took the reins in March 2015, McDonald's was suffering from falling sales and lousy earnings. \nSince then, McDonald's has launched an all-day breakfast menu. It's introduced more customizable sandwiches with fancier ingredients, and announced two new sizes of Big Macs. The chain is also trying to be healthier, cutting artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets and offering more wraps and salads. \nThe strategy is working. Revenue and profits for the third quarter topped forecasts. \nConsumer tastes aren't the only thing changing the way companies operate. \nDonald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election has left many business executives wondering what his administration means for employment, trade and economic growth. In the meantime, Easterbrook and McDonald's are sitting tight. \n\"No one likes uncertainty,\" he said. \"The sooner we get through this period, and there's some clarity as to the way things are going to go going forward, we'll be able to make the long term decisions of business.\" \nCopyright 2016 by CNN NewSource .

      "text": " Google+\nRichard Drew/Associated Press\nMcDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook demonstrated an order kiosk.\nAssociated Press November 18, 2016\nNEW YORK — McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its US locations.\nThe world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee to bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction.\nAdvertisement\nMcDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees.\nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday. Sign Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the United States have not increased, the company said.\nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but ‘‘the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.’’ He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option.\nEven though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-through in the United States, the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom.\nAdvertisement\nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald’s has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-through.\nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.",

      "text": "NEW YORK -- McDonald's on Thursday announced a bold plan to roll out its \"experience of the future\" concept, including kiosk ordering and table service, to restaurants in Chicago and other big U.S. cities in an effort to better compete with \"better burger\" rivals.\nThe burger chain has nearly 500 redesigned restaurants around the country so far.\nThe world's largest burger chain will first focus the rollout in its hometown of Chicago and a handful of other big U.S. cities, including Boston and Washington, D.C. But the company says it will eventually unveil the concept, which has already shown significant success in other countries like the U.K. and Australia, in all of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It didn't offer a timeline or overall cost for the rollout.\n\"Food ordering is one of the most enjoyable moments at restaurants, but at McDonald's that can be one of the most stressful moments,\" CEO Steve Easterbrook said. The aim is to eliminate that frustration, while also bringing employees out from behind the counter to interact with customers. With the ability to customize, upgrade and add-on items themselves, customers also tend to spend more per visit, Easterbrook said.\nThe plan to eventually redesign and upgrade all U.S. restaurants signals a significant change in the look and feel of eating at McDonald's, and it also brings a great deal of risk. The ambitious remodeling effort was announced by Easterbrook and other company executives Thursday morning at a redesigned restaurant in New York City.\nThe redesigns will include the option of ordering at a bank of kiosks, though counter service also will be available for those who are paying with cash or prefer not to use the touch-screen machines. After using a kiosk, a customer takes a Bluetooth-enabled number placard to a table where an employee brings the food. Customers can pay at the kiosks using a credit or debit card, or Apple or Android pay.\nThe changes will be funded in large part by the franchisees that operate McDonald's restaurants, but the company said it will contribute in some ways as well. It's not clear exactly how much the remodels will cost, and the price will vary depending on what technology the restaurant currently offers. Ordering kiosks alone can cost $60,000.\nIncoming McDonald's U.S. President Chris Kempczinski said that while the plan is significant, he also promised further improvements in food quality and promotions like all-day breakfast, which have been the driver of more than a year of improving sales at the chain.\n\"It's a great start, a significant step forward, but it's also a sign of things to come,\" he said.\n(c)2016 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\n ",

I got to McDonald's at 10:40 a.m. and sure enough, the sign said, “Free breakfast for Vets.”\nWhen I ordered, I was told breakfast was over. When I questioned why they advertise breakfast all day, I was told it's over. Two workers came out to read the sign. The manager said she would buy me breakfast. By then, instead of a proud Vet, I felt like a panhandler. I refused breakfast but did order a coffee. I was told a lady (with a purple hat) two cars in front of me paid for my coffee.\nThank you to the manager for trying and thank you purple hat lady.\nBuzzy Gabelli\nVandergrift",

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) \nNEW YORK • McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.” He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom.",

      "text": "You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service 9 hrs ago ( … ) \nNEW YORK (AP) — McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom.",

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, File) ORG XMIT: NY107 ADVERTISEMENT Posted: Thursday, November 17, 2016 9:30 pm McDonald's expanding table service to more locations; already available at six Richmond-area stores From staff and wire reports Richmond Times-Dispatch \nMcDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores, including six in the Richmond region and one in Waverly. \nCustomers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction. \n“We began providing table service at our Chester location in early 2016 and due to the positive customer response, we expanded it to all five of our restaurants,” said Coleman Bishop, a local McDonald’s franchise owner who operates two locations in Hopewell and one each in Chester, Petersburg and Waverly. \n“We have found that table service provides McDonald’s customers with a different dining experience because they are able to enjoy their meals at a more relaxed pace. Once they place their order, they can immediately sit down and have their food brought to them when it is ready,” Bishop said. “We have found that table service is most enjoyed by families and seniors, but we have witnessed all customers reacting positively to it in our restaurants.” \nTwo McDonald’s locations in Richmond — at 5925 Hopkins Road and 6850 Forest Hill Ave. — also offer table service, although the one on Forest Hill Avenue offers it just for families. \nMcDonald’s said Tuesday that it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to remodel and add training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s attempts a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. \nDespite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement — including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu — customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.” He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. \nNext year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its U.S. sales at drive-throughs, the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. \nTable service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks also are intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald’s has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-through. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it also will be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. \nEasterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.",

(Source: WOIO) BEREA, OH (WOIO) - \nThere have been hundreds of water complaints against the city of Berea in the past five years, Cleveland 19's investigative team has discovered. And it wasn't just individual residents complaining. \nAfter Paul Orlousky’s investigation uncovered elevated levels of lead in one Berea home, Cleveland 19’s investigative unit filed a public records request for all water complaints submitted to the City of Berea’s Water Plant from January 2011 through November 2016. The city fulfilled the request, providing more than 400 pages from that five-year period. Water discoloration in Berea: No claims water leaving plant is bad \nThought there were some complaints were things like no water or leaking pipes, the majority were focused on \"dirty,\"\"brown,\" or \"black\" water. Several people also wrote the city complaining about their water having a bad or “metallic” taste. There were also several complaints about bad smelling water (water smelling like rotten eggs). \nThe majority of the complaints showed documentation that the city followed up with residents who complained. \nSometimes, the water in question would be tested for bacteria and other things, like pH levels. Other times, city representatives would bring out “Red B Gone,” an industrial rust remover, to multiple properties as an attempt to fix the problem of discolored or “rusty” water. As to the why, there was at least one instance where city officials emailed that they weren’t certain what caused a problem with the errant water. \nThe majority of the time, the city pointed to things like increased water usage in the area as being the cause of resident problems. Things like broken water mains and fire hydrants being used to douse fires were mentioned in clusters of complaints. \nIt wasn’t only individual residents who reported problems to the city -- businesses like McDonald’s and even the Cleveland Browns complained to the city at times. The Browns stated that there was discolored water and particulates in water in some pools at their Berea Facility. \nRELATED: ",

      "text": "A \nNEW YORK/LOS ANGELES: McDonald's, aiming to become more modern and nimble, is updating U.S. restaurants with self-service kiosk ordering, mobile payments, \"smart\" menu boards, custom sandwiches and table service, executives said on Thursday. \nThe 61-year-old fast-food company has been overhauling its food with simpler ingredients and selling breakfast items 24-hours a day, but it is playing catch up in the technology realm to early adopters such as Domino's Pizza, Starbucks Corp and Panera Bread. \nAbout 500 of McDonald's more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants have made the changes with Florida, New York and Southern California the first regions to adopt the new format. \nRestaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago and Seattle will start making the switch next year, according to the company, which declined to give a timeline for how long the changes will take to go nationwide. \nMcDonald's will pilot mobile ordering in the United States in the first half of 2017 and do a national rollout in the second half, Chris Kempczinski, a former Kraft Foods executive who will take over as McDonald's USA president on Jan. 1, told journalists at a press event in New York. Mobile ordering and payment will be added to the McDonald's app, which has been downloaded by 16 million people, he said. \nChief Executive Steve Easterbrook said the company was in the early stage of using technology. \"There is nothing more powerful than one-on-one customer experience\" such as smartphone apps, he said to Reuters. \nStill, some of McDonald's U.S. franchisees have chafed at the prospect of making significant investments at a time when labor costs are rising and restaurant sales growth is tepid. \nAnalysts note that just 50 percent of U.S. McDonald's restaurants have been recently renovated, and the company wants new food and tech elements in addition to the restaurant makeovers. \nThe cost of installing kiosks is between US$50,000 and US$60,000 and the company is willing to help with money or financing, McDonald's executives said. Eastbrook has said that equipment is not expected to reduce the number of workers in restaurants, since traditional order takers would be redeployed to help customers learn to operate kiosks and to deliver food to tables. \nDemonstrating returns is key to convincing franchisees to make the switch, executives said. In a video, one UK executive said sales grew 8 percent in downtown London as a result of the initiative. \n\"People may not always like to change, but people like to make money,\" Kempczinski told Reuters. \nMcDonald's USA draws on results from modernization projects in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada as it pushes the effort. \"We've worked a lot of the kinks out,\" Easterbrook told Reuters. \nKempczinski said McDonald's may also pick up the pace of its response to consumer demands for simpler, more natural food. \nMcDonald's USA already has switched to chicken raised without antibiotics important to human health, replaced margarine with butter in its Egg McMuffins, and swapped sugar for high-fructose corn syrup in its hamburger buns. \nMost recently, it said it would fully transition to cage-free eggs in the United States and Canada over the next decade. \n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Bernard Orr) - Reuters",

Puskar, File) NEW YORK (AP/MEDIA GENERAL) — McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. The world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction. McDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. The push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement – including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu – customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. CEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.” He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. Even though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. The kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald’s has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. In stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.

      "text": "Expanded table service breaks McDonald’s tradition By LESLIE PATTON AND CRAIG GIAMMONA Bloomberg News First Published 28 minutes ago • Updated 28 minutes ago Share This Article McDonald's Corp. plans to offer table service at all its U.S. restaurants, upending decades of fast-food tradition in a bid to placate pickier customers. Table service is currently in about 500 locations, but will be rolled out to the entire U.S. chain, McDonald's said Thursday at an event in New York. The company also is bringing mobile ordering and payments to the country in 2017, as well as more digital kiosks. McDonald's already has table service at some locations in New York, Florida and Southern California, as well as many places abroad. It's coming soon to markets such as Boston and San Francisco, the company said. New positions will be created at restaurants to serve food and help customers with touch-screen orders. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The shift is significant for a company most responsible for popularizing fast food -- along with a more stripped-down approach to restaurant service. But competition and the rise of fast-casual chains have elevated expectations. Customers also are looking to technology to help make restaurants more convenient. \"Customers are getting increasingly demanding, and their expectations will only grow,\" Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said at the event. A drop in the cost of groceries has added pressure to fast-food chains this year because it's increasingly cheap for customers to eat at home. Restaurant companies also have blamed anxiety around the presidential election for hurting results. McDonald's shares are up just about 1 percent in 2016, lagging behind the 7 percent increase for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The new approach may bring in the kind of customers who balk at lines, said Ivan Feinseth, analyst at Tigress Financial Partners. \"It will make it look less congested at the point of ordering,\" he said. \"Then people feel they won't have to wait that long.\" Earlier this month, the world's biggest restaurant chain said it was planning a \"significant\" boost in technology spending. The investment will help fund the new self-serve kiosks and mobile-ordering application. The plan includes expanding a smartphone ordering app across its 14,000 domestic locations, starting next year. McDonald's had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin' Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Illinois, is looking to grab some of those consumers with its own faster and more convenient service. For 60 years, McDonald's dictated how customers ordered and got food, Easterbrook said. \"That's changing now,\" he said. \"It's a totally different mindset.\"",

(Source: Reuters) A McDonald’s Corp shareholder is redoubling efforts to convince the fast-food chain to stop all of its global restaurants from serving the meat of animals raised with antibiotics that are vital for fighting human infections.\nMore than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant “superbug” infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health.\nThe Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, asked directors at McDonald’s to prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in its global poultry supply chain. McDonald’s already has adopted that policy for the chicken served in its US restaurants.\nThe group also asking the fast-food chain to set global targets and timelines for switching to pork and beef raised without the non-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics.\nJust over 20 percent of McDonald’s shareholders voted in favor of a similar proposal at this year’s annual meeting. The sisters pulled a prior resolution after McDonald’s announced its plans to change its policies on chicken in the United States. The sisters aim to have shareholders vote on the new proposal at McDonald’s 2017 annual meeting.\nMcDonald’s told Reuters it continues “to engage with key experts, including some who serve as advisors to the World Health Organization (WHO), to advance progress across the industry.”\nThe company said its current policy “provides guidance to our suppliers in parts of the world where the industry does not yet have systems in place that would allow them to verify compliance throughout the supply chain. “Sister Susan Mika said the resolution is part of an ongoing process.\n“I said we will be back,” Mika said in a phone interview. “We want them to set goals and to be moving in a certain direction. We expect them to be a leader in taking on these questions of our time.”\nThe sisters are part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), which along with ShareAction, Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative and As You Sow, also are targeting companies such as Sanderson Farms and Yum Brands Inc with similar campaigns aimed at preserving the efficacy of antibiotics.

      "text": "NEW YORK– McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook knows the business of food is changing.\nSo the fast food giant is rolling out self-order kiosks, mobile pay options, an updated interior design, even table service.\nThe changes are already starting to show up at locations in Florida, New York and Southern California, where 500 restaurants have been updated. Restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, D.C. and Seattle will get upgrades in early 2017.\nNow, McDonald’s loyalists will be able to place their customized order on a touch screen, take a seat and have their meal brought right over. Next year, they’ll even have the option of mobile ordering.\n“Customers have access to information that gives them much more control over their lives,” Easterbrook said in an interview with CNNMoney’s Cristina Alesci.\nThat’s pushing consumers to demand more, he says — especially in the way of personalized eating.\n“They’re expecting us to evolve and offer greater convenience,” Easterbrook said.\nThe move is the company’s latest attempt to win back the customers it’s lost to popular fast-casual joints like Shake Shack. When Easterbrook took the reins in March 2015, McDonald’s was suffering from falling sales and lousy earnings.\nSince then, McDonald’s has launched an all-day breakfast menu. It’s introduced more customizable sandwiches with fancier ingredients, and announced two new sizes of Big Macs. The chain is also trying to be healthier, cutting artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets and offering more wraps and salads.\nThe strategy is working. Revenue and profits for the third quarter topped forecasts.\nConsumer tastes aren’t the only thing changing the way companies operate.\nDonald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election has left many business executives wondering what his administration means for employment, trade and economic growth. In the meantime, Easterbrook and McDonald’s are sitting tight.\n“No one likes uncertainty,” he said. “The sooner we get through this period, and there’s some clarity as to the way things are going to go going forward, we’ll be able to make the long term decisions of business.”\n",

      "text": "\nA McDonald's restaurant logo in Chicago Thomson Reuters \nBy Lisa Baertlein \n(Reuters) - A McDonald's Corp shareholder is redoubling efforts to convince the fast-food chain to stop all of its global restaurants from serving the meat of animals raised with antibiotics that are vital for fighting human infections. \nMore than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant \"superbug\" infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health. \nThe Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, is asking directors at McDonald's to prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in its global poultry supply chain. McDonald's already has adopted that policy for the chicken served in its U.S. restaurants. \nThe group is also asking the fast-food chain to set global targets and timelines for switching to pork and beef raised without the non-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics. \nJust over 20 percent of McDonald's shareholders voted in favor of a similar proposal at this year's annual meeting. \nThe sisters aim to have shareholders vote on the new proposal at McDonald's 2017 annual meeting. \nMcDonald's told Reuters it continues \"to engage with key experts, including some who serve as advisors to the World Health Organization (WHO), to advance progress across the industry.\" \nThe company said its current policy \"provides guidance to our suppliers in parts of the world where the industry does not yet have systems in place that would allow them to verify compliance throughout the supply chain.\" \nThe sisters are part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), which along with ShareAction, Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative and As You Sow, also are targeting companies such as Sanderson Farms and Yum Brands Inc with similar campaigns aimed at preserving the efficacy of antibiotics. \n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Bernadette Baum) Read the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "You Deserve A Seat Today: McDonald's Expanding Table Service You Deserve a Seat Today: McDonald's Expanding Table Service Associate Press | Updated: November 18, 2016 15:23 IST Tweeter \nMcDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers , while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.

Reuters/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo A McDonald's Corp shareholder is redoubling efforts to convince the fast-food chain to stop all of its global restaurants from serving the meat of animals raised with antibiotics that are vital for fighting human infections. \nMore than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant \"superbug\" infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health. \nThe Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, asked directors at McDonald's to prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in its global poultry supply chain. McDonald's already has adopted that policy for the chicken served in its U.S. restaurants. \nThe group also asking the fast-food chain to set global targets and timelines for switching to pork and beef raised without the non-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics. Just over 20 percent of McDonald's shareholders voted in favor of a similar proposal at this year's annual meeting. The sisters pulled a prior resolution after McDonald's announced its plans to change its policies on chicken in the United States. \nThe sisters aim to have shareholders vote on the new proposal at McDonald's 2017 annual meeting. \nMcDonald's told Reuters it continues \"to engage with key experts, including some who serve as advisors to the World Health Organization (WHO), to advance progress across the industry.\"The company said its current policy \"provides guidance to our suppliers in parts of the world where the industry does not yet have systems in place that would allow them to verify compliance throughout the supply chain.\" \nSister Susan Mika said the resolution is part of an ongoing process. \n\"I said we will be back,\" Mika said in a phone interview. \"We want them to set goals and to be moving in a certain direction. We expect them to be a leader in taking on these questions of our time.\" \nThe sisters are part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), which along with ShareAction, Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative and As You Sow, also are targeting companies such as Sanderson Farms and Yum Brands Inc with similar campaigns aimed at preserving the efficacy of antibiotics.

      "text": "You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service - wistv.com - Columbia, South Carolina Member Center: Deals You deserve a seat today: McDonald's expanding table service \nNEW YORK (AP) - McDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement - including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu - customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — McDonald’s says it plans to offer table service across its U.S. stores to make the ordering process less stressful, but did not say when the overhaul will be complete.\nThe world’s biggest burger chain says about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores have been testing table service and ordering kiosks for people who do not want to wait for the cashier. People in those stores order at the counter or kiosks, then sit and wait for an employee to bring them their food.\nEarly next year, McDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C.\nThe push comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.",

      "text": "ASSOCIATED PRESS In a country in which “McDonald’s” is so difficult to pronounce that they instead settled on “Mac,” it’s Donald Trump’s good fortune that his last name is one of the easiest of English names for a Japanese to pronounce and one of the most familiar, for it is the word Japanese use, borrowed from the British, when referring to playing cards. For most Japanese it’s practically a Japanese word learned from childhood and as an American growing up in Japan it was a word I heard often. I spent most of the first 18 years of my life looking at America and American Presidents through the lens of the Japanese people and although many foreign policy watchers who monitor the U.S.-Japan relationship are deeply concerned by the prospects of a Trump presidency vis-a-vis Japan, I see opportunities.\nOver the last year I wrote extensively about the possibility , even the likelihood , of a Trump presidency and I shared that information with a number of Japanese friends including government officials. While my American friends thought I was merely crazy, my Japanese friends were simply dumbfounded that such a thing could even be remotely possible. For a nation run by the grandson of a Prime Minister, it is simply unthinkable that a pop culture figure like Trump could be elected President. I explained to them that he was akin to Tamori , a popular fixture of Japanese television for the last 35 years, and that he was likely to garner the votes even of people who disagreed with his politics because of his unorthodox message and familiarity and because we are living in a celebrity culture. After the election, I received more than a few emails from my Japanese friends who remembered my prediction and with a mixture of fear and amazement, wondered what comes next.\nIt’s a question I’ve had many opportunities to think about over the years in various capacities I’ve worked in in which I’ve often found myself explaining one side to the other. I spent the 1990s reporting daily from the U.S. for radio stations FM Yokohama and Tokyo FM and producing documentaries and hosting a television show for Japan’s flagship NHK TV Network. Although the express purpose of my show was for Japanese to learn English, I was hoping to give my viewers a window into the American soul, a window that was often fogged over by media in both countries which tended to report what was of interest to people in places like New York, Los Angeles Osaka and Tokyo, but didn’t reflect the rest of our respective countries. I spent dozens of episodes interviewing well known figures like Larry King, Jay Leno, Charlton Heston, Snoopy creator Charles Schulz and Japan historian Chalmers Johnson, but I also made it a point to interview farmers, preachers, city planners and firefighters so that my viewers could understand the real America by meeting Americans who didn’t make the news-the kind of people that elected Trump last week.\nAnother of those guests, the late researcher George Gallup Jr., became a friend and later, a collaborator. I had shared with him a desire to increase understanding between the two countries and we decided to team up and produce a documentary, Japan: Searching For The Dream.\nUtilizing George’s Gallup Organization, we conducted extensive research of the Japanese people and George later observed of our work: “In my 50 years of polling, there has been no study that I would consider as important as this one.”\nWhile my knowledge of Japan was instinctual, George’s was data driven and together we learned many interesting and surprising things about the Japanese people, about their hopes, dreams and fears for their future. And Japan has much to fear. A collapsing birthrate means that unless something radically changes, it will literally disappear, leaving one Japanese standing by the year 3000 . A steady and far too high suicide rate and the plight of Japanese youth, a million of whom are severely depressed enough to stay indoors, does not indicate a healthy future for a once thriving nation.\nBut another and very current fear among the Japanese is what a Trump presidency will mean for them. Will he withdraw American troops who have served as a stabilizing force in the region? Will he demand that Japan become a nuclear power, against a majority of its citizens as well as its neighbors’ wishes? Will he launch a trade war against Japan and China, with no distinction made between their respective statuses as a vibrant and stable democracy and friend to the U.S. and a repressive Communist regime hostile to American values and interests? These are the known unknowns that are on the minds of both ordinary Japanese and their leaders.\nAll of this comes on the heels of a Japan-U.S. relationship that has deteriorated over time not because of any overt action, but simply from atrophy. In the post World War II construct, Japan has always believed that it has a special relationship with the United States above all others, with the possible exception of the U.S.-British relationship. It had never been fully conquered by a foreign power and the dignified manner in which the United States conducted itself after Japan’s surrender was never forgotten and goodwill gestures like the return of the island of Okinawa, an unthinkable act in the context of world history, were duly noted and appreciated. I felt this gratitude firsthand as a child when on more than one occasion I was confronted by inebriated elderly men on trains who would commonly say things like “Thank you MacArthur,” a reference to General Douglas MacArthur who oversaw Japan’s rehabilitation.\nThat closeness reached its zenith in 1983 when Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Ronald Reagan began to call each other by their first names. I had a chance to hear the story first hand from Nakasone himself when I visited with him in connection with a film I’m producing.\nAt their first meeting Reagan asked Nakasone, “what does your wife call you at home?” to which Nakasone replied “Yasu.” “Well, Yasu, my name is Ron,” replied Reagan and with that, the fabled “Ron-Yasu” relationship, signaling a new era of closeness, was born. Although subsequent administrations on both sides continued a spirit of general cooperation, Japan’s never-ending recession and America’s involvement in the Middle East and its own economic malaise meant the two nations were preoccupied with other problems and were to some extent unable to focus on their relationship.\nBut like a marriage that is strained but never beyond renewal, the Japan-U.S. relationship can be fixed with more attention to the things the two nations have in common as well as the common challenges they face and a good place to start is to return to that winter day in 1983 when Reagan and Nakasone first met. Like them, Trump and Abe are powerful figures who share a goal of revitalizing their nations’ sagging spirits and creating a vibrant economy that will benefit both nations. Trump is no ideologue but a people person for whom policy follows relationships, and, by quickly establishing a firm “Donald-Shinzo” relationship, Abe may prove to be a strong partner for Trump on the world stage in much the manner Nakasone was to Reagan.\nAlthough he was known as a strong leader himself, recalling Reagan, Nakasone told me he considered Reagan to be a “leader of leaders” and at a particularly pivotal moment when many of the other leaders on the world stage were giving Reagan heartburn at the Williamsburg summit, Nakasone told Reagan that he would be the pitcher and Nakasone the catcher, but, he reminded him, sometimes pitchers have to take signals from the catcher. Reagan eagerly agreed with the proposition and Nakasone’s intervention in support of the U.S. determination to place Pershing II missiles in Europe helped Reagan’s argument win the day.\nIn that same spirit, a “Donald-Shinzo” relationship could revitalize the U.S.-Japan relationship that could provide a model for the rest of the world. The first task will be for Japan to realize that TPP (Trans Pacific Partnership) as we know it, is dead with no hope of salvage. But out of the rubble can grow a new bilateral agreement between the two nations that accomplishes many of the same objectives with the possibility of later allowing other nations to join it. That same bilateral spirit may lead the two nations to work more closely on the world stage to combat terrorism, perhaps joined at a later date by Russia to form a trilateral relationship that would focus on rolling back terrorism and later find other areas of common agreement.\nLike all good pitcher-catcher relationships, sometimes the pitcher accepts the catcher’s signals and sometimes he shakes them off and asks for another. Although it’s not likely that he’ll actually withdraw American forces from Japan or demand that she go nuclear, President-elect Trump has already sent some signals of this own―that he wants Japan to bear a greater share of the burden that it pays for the U.S. to defend her and that he wants as much access to Japan’s markets for American businesses as Japanese businesses have in the U.S. It will be incumbent on Abe to, like all good catchers, be prepared with a variety of signals as he meets with a President who has received a mandate from the American people that while they accept the unique American responsibility of protecting their friends around the world, they do not want to be taken advantage of. One symbolic but nonetheless important such signal of good will that Abe might send is to unilaterally announce that Japan will no longer charge the United States the modest rent it is said to charge for use of the property in Tokyo that houses the American embassy.\nIn the town I grew up in in Japan I had only one choice if I wanted to have friends in the neighborhood: to reach beyond the cultural divide, find common areas of interest and learn to speak to one another. Adult relationships and those of nations are much the same and the election of our most unlikely President combined with the presence of a strong Japanese leader provides unique opportunities for the American-Japanese relationship to thrive.\nAt the conclusion of my brief time with another of Japan’s consequential prime ministers, as we paused to have our photograph taken together, one of his aides showed the near centenarian Nakasone a copy of a letter to the editor I had written as a teenager in support of him.\n“During your most difficult days people like him were supporting you,” I heard his aide tell him, and at that moment he reached for my hand just as the photographer captured the moment. For me it was yet another reminder of the need for the United States and Japan to continue to support one another, hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, in a world filled with bad actors and hostile players and to face the future together.\nMore: Japan 896 K 92.6 K ",

      "text": "2866452 false IMAGE DISTRIBUTED FOR MCDONALD'S - A McDonald's crew member delivers a meal as part of the new table service feature at select restaurants, creating a relaxing dine-in experience on Thursday, November 17, 2016, at a McDonald's restaurant in New York. (Stuart Ramson/AP Images for McDonald's) 2866447 false McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook demonstrates an order kiosk, with cashier Esmirna DeLeon, during a presentation at a McDonald's restaurant in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016. On Thursday, the company said it wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Touchscreens and table service: enough to help McDonald’s? By Stephanie Strom / New York Times News Service Published Nov 18, 2016 at 12:00AM Welcome to McDonald’s! May I take your order — and bring it to your table? On Thursday, McDonald’s announced changes that could reshape the diner’s experience, saying it would expand its digital self-serve ordering stations and table service to all of its 14,000 American restaurants. The company said that once people order at one of the stations — sleek, vertical touchscreens — they will get a digital location device and can take a seat. When their burgers and fries are ready, the technology will guide a server to the table to deliver the food with a big smile and a thank you. “Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,” Steve Easterbrook, chief executive of McDonald’s, said at an event Thursday in a newly renovated and outfitted McDonald’s on Chambers Street in New York. Customers will still be able to order food the old-fashioned way, at the counter. But the move to self-order systems and table service is one way to address one of the biggest problems the company’s restaurants have faced in recent years: slower food delivery to customers, caused by more items on the menu. The thinking is that customers will be more willing to wait if they are sitting at a table instead of waiting at a counter. But it also raises some questions for the company: What does it mean for workers, and is the chain up for a change this big? Easterbrook said the new system would not reduce costs. But it would mean that workers might have slightly different jobs. “We’re not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them,” he said. McDonald’s has tested the order system in 500 revamped restaurants, or what it calls its “just-for-you experience,” in New York, Florida and Southern California and is now introducing them in Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston and Chicago. Around the globe, the new program is in some 2,600 McDonald’s restaurants. Many of the company’s customers, though, do not enter the restaurant. About 60 to 70 percent of sales come from its drive-thru lanes. “A lot of customers are never going to see this technology,” Dick Adams, a restaurant consultant, said. “It’s just not going to be that big a factor for most franchisees outside big cities.” The company also announced that it would roll out a mobile order-and-pay system that would also change the way customers get their orders, including customers ordering from their cars. How quickly the restaurants change remains to be seen. The vast majority of McDonald’s locations are owned by franchisees, and they will be responsible for paying for the changes. Equipment and installation of the eight order screens at the event Thursday, at a location in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York, cost $56,000, said Terri Hickey, a spokeswoman for McDonald’s. The costs for a store with lower sales volume would probably be about $28,000. Franchisees may be loath to make such investments at a time when restaurant sales are lackluster at best — same-store sales in McDonald’s U.S. restaurants rose a paltry 1.3 percent in the third quarter of this year. 15646738 ",

      "text": "Email \nNEW YORK — McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook knows the business of food is changing. \nSo the fast food giant is rolling out self-order kiosks, mobile pay options, an updated interior design, even table service. \nThe changes are already starting to show up at locations in Florida, New York and Southern California, where 500 restaurants have been updated. Restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, D.C. and Seattle will get upgrades in early 2017. \nNow, McDonald’s loyalists will be able to place their customized order on a touch screen, take a seat and have their meal brought right over. Next year, they’ll even have the option of mobile ordering. \n“Customers have access to information that gives them much more control over their lives,” Easterbrook said in an interview with CNNMoney’s Cristina Alesci. \nThat’s pushing consumers to demand more, he says — especially in the way of personalized eating. \n“They’re expecting us to evolve and offer greater convenience,” Easterbrook said. \nThe move is the company’s latest attempt to win back the customers it’s lost to popular fast-casual joints like Shake Shack. When Easterbrook took the reins in March 2015, McDonald’s was suffering from falling sales and lousy earnings. \nSince then, McDonald’s has launched an all-day breakfast menu. It’s introduced more customizable sandwiches with fancier ingredients, and announced two new sizes of Big Macs. The chain is also trying to be healthier, cutting artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets and offering more wraps and salads. \nThe strategy is working. Revenue and profits for the third quarter topped forecasts. \nConsumer tastes aren’t the only thing changing the way companies operate. \nDonald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election has left many business executives wondering what his administration means for employment, trade and economic growth. In the meantime, Easterbrook and McDonald’s are sitting tight. \n“No one likes uncertainty,” he said. “The sooner we get through this period, and there’s some clarity as to the way things are going to go going forward, we’ll be able to make the long-term decisions of business.” 40.712784 -74.005941 ",

People in those stores order at the counter or kiosks, then sit and wait for an employee to bring them their food. \nEarly next year, McDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. \nThe push comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes.

      "text": "McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook knows the business of food is changing.\nMcDonald’s customers will be able to place their customized order on a touch screen, take a seat and have their meal brought right over. (Credit: Rich Brooks/CNN)\nSo the fast food giant is rolling out self-order kiosks, mobile pay options, an updated interior design, even table service.\nThe changes are already starting to show up at locations in Florida, New York and Southern California, where 500 restaurants have been updated. Restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, D.C. and Seattle will get upgrades in early 2017.\nNow, McDonald’s loyalists will be able to place their customized order on a touch screen, take a seat and have their meal brought right over. Next year, they’ll even have the option of mobile ordering.\n“Customers have access to information that gives them much more control over their lives,” Easterbrook said in an interview with CNNMoney’s Cristina Alesci.\nThat’s pushing consumers to demand more, he says — especially in the way of personalized eating.\n“They’re expecting us to evolve and offer greater convenience,” Easterbrook said.\nThe move is the company’s latest attempt to win back the customers it’s lost to popular fast-casual joints like Shake Shack. When Easterbrook took the reins in March 2015, McDonald’s was suffering from falling sales and lousy earnings.\nSince then, McDonald’s has launched an all-day breakfast menu. It’s introduced more customizable sandwiches with fancier ingredients, and announced two new sizes of Big Macs. The chain is also trying to be healthier, cutting artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets and offering more wraps and salads.\nThe strategy is working. Revenue and profits for the third quarter topped forecasts.\nConsumer tastes aren’t the only thing changing the way companies operate.\nDonald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election has left many business executives wondering what his administration means for employment, trade and economic growth. In the meantime, Easterbrook and McDonald’s are sitting tight.\n“No one likes uncertainty,” he said. “The sooner we get through this period, and there’s some clarity as to the way things are going to go going forward, we’ll be able to make the long term decisions of business.”\n41.839787 -87.953553 ",

      "title": "Battle of Dividends: McDonald's Corporation vs. PepsiCo Inc.",
      "text": "McDonald's ( NYSE:MCD ) and PepsiCo ( NYSE:PEP ) have both been known as excellent dividend stocks for decades. McDonald's has paid a dividend each and every year since 1976, and Pepsi has paid dividends for 44 years straight. What's more, both companies are known for religiously increasing their dividends annually. But which stock's dividend is better?\nImage source: Getty Images.\nTo identify the better stock, here's a head-to-head comparison of McDonald's and Pepsi.\nMcDonald's Company\nDividend Yield\nPayout Ratio\n5-Year Dividend Compound Average Growth Rate\n5-Year EPS Compound Average Growth Rate\nMcDonald's\n3.2%\n66%\n8.8%\n0.1%\nData source: Reuters.\nOne of the first things dividend investors considering McDonald's stock will notice is that it has a very solid dividend yield of 3.2%. This yield easily exceeds the 2.2% average dividend yield of stocks in the S&P 500. Furthermore, it edges out Pepsi's dividend of 3%.\nLooking beyond the current dividend yield McDonald's stock offers today, there's a good chance dividend payouts will increase in the coming years. After all, the company has demonstrated both its willingness and ability to boost its dividend by increasing it at an average rate of 8.8% annually for the past five years.\nBut if McDonald's 5.6% dividend increase in 2016 and its 4.7% increase in 2015 are any indication of how annual dividend increases will trend in the coming years, investors shouldn't expect the fast-food giant to return to its average 8.8% dividend increase rate. McDonald's lower dividend increases lately are likely related to the company's anemic average annual EPS growth of 0.1% during the past five years.\nPepsiCo Company\nDividend Yield\nPayout Ratio\n5-Year Dividend Compound Average Growth Rate\n5-Year EPS Compound Average Growth Rate\nPepsiCo\n3%\n64%\n7.9%\n(1.3%)\nData source: Reuters.\nPepsi's dividend yield of 3% falls short of McDonald's 3.2% dividend yield, but the soft-drink and snack company's dividend stands out when it comes to growth prospects.\nSure, Pepsi's five-year average annual dividend increase of 7.9% is slightly behind McDonald's average increases during this period, but there are two good reasons Pepsi's dividend increases over the next few years may exceed McDonald's. First, Pepsi's payout ratio, or dividend payments as a percentage of earnings, is slightly lower than McDonald's, at 65%. Second, Pepsi's recent dividend increases have been more aggressive than McDonald's. In both 2015 and 2016, for instance, Pepsi increased its dividend by about 7%.\nBut, like McDonald's, Pepsi has struggled to grow its EPS during the past five-year period. During this time, EPS actually declined at an average annual rate of 1.3%. So, similar to what an analysis of McDonald's dividend revealed, Pepsi investors may not want to expect dividend increases to remain at these levels in the coming years.\nImage source: McDonald's.\nSo, which company's dividend is better? While Pepsi comes out slightly ahead of McDonald's on dividend growth prospects, McDonald's may be the better bet for dividend investors overall because of its higher dividend yield.\nFurthermore, as a nice bonus, McDonald's has been demonstrating promising improvements lately, suggesting its earnings growth could pick up. The fast-food giant's operating margin, for instance, increased 260 basis points year over year in its most recent quarter as the company benefited from improved restaurant efficiencies. Pepsi, too, has seen an upswing in operating efficiencies lately, with its operating margin on pace for a 50-basis-point improvement for the entire year of 2016 compared to 2015. But McDonald's higher dividend yield and sharp operational improvements lately give it the slight win over Pepsi, making it the better dividend stock.",

By Associated Press WRITE A COMMENT McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook demonstrates an order kiosk, with cashier Esmirna DeLeon, during a presentation at a McDonald's restaurant in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016. On Thursday, the company said it wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. CREDIT: AP Photo/Richard Drew Advertisement \nMcDonald's wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. \nThe world's biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald's says improves customer satisfaction. \nMcDonald's says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. \nThe push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald's tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement -; including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu -; customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. \nCEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald's is supposed to be fun, but \"the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.\" He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. \nEven though McDonald's Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people's perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. \nThe kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald's has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. \nIn stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth. \n ",

      "text": "McDonald's Is Planning to Bring Table Service to Each of Its Stores Nationwide “This is a significant step change for us as a business.\" Jackson Connor Image via Getty/Peter Kovalev \nOver the course of the last half-century, McDonald's has served as the quintessential fast-food chain: quick, mediocre, and more than a little depressing. But throughout 2016, the Golden Arches has been trying to step its game up, introducing never-frozen beef patties and preservative-free chicken nuggets. Now, in an attempt make its stores feel more like \"real\" restaurants, the company is gearing up to rollout table service at each of its 14,000 locations in the U.S. \nAccording to the Associated Press , McDonald's has already been testing table service at roughly 500 of its restaurants. Expanding the amenity to cities like San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, D.C.—before ultimately introducing it nationwide—could take years. Even so, ordering from a kiosk and then having a server deliver ones order is said to boost customer satisfaction, something McDonald's has been desperate to do amid slumping sales. \n“This is a significant step change for us as a business,” Steve Easterbrook, the company’s CEO, told Crain’s . “It's a totally different mindset to which we're adapting. [The overhauls] are not about being a different McDonald's, it's about being a better McDonald's that remains true to who we are and yet evolve with the times.” \nThough programs like all-day breakfast have generated some excitement stateside, table service and kiosks have successfully blistered sales overseas, according to the AP, and the idea is to compete with America's growing fast-casual trend. The so-called \"McDonald's of the Future\" will rely on a combination of technology, hospitality, and more trendy, McCafe-style snacks, despite the company currently earning a bulk of its revenue from drive-thru sales. \nThe real question, however, is will we have to tip?",

      "text": "McDonald''s Table Service: Fast Food Redefined  25:  McDonald's Table Service: Fast Food Redefined \nMore McDonald's Corp. customers across the U.S. will be able to choose table service inside restaurants, in an attempt to provide something beyond what a traditional fast-food chain offers. \nIt is part of an effort central to revive the burger giant's sales, which have flagged in recent quarters. Franchisees and analysts have been wondering what else McDonald's would do to drive interest in a brand that has been struggling to re-establish its relevancy in a market where consumers have more choices than ever to get food, including burgers. \nThe company that derives nearly 70% of its sales from the drive-through is hoping changes to the restaurants themselves will help lift sales, according to McDonald's USA President Chris Kempczinski. \nMcDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, speaking at a McDonald's in New York's Tribeca neighborhood on Thursday, said the company has long expected customers to adapt to its business model of ordering at the counter and then waiting to collect their own food. Now, he said, \"we're adapting our business around customers.\" \nAnalysts say there is little downside, since the cost is relatively low, but there are risks. If the restaurants aren't able to keep their stores clean and offer friendly service—two challenges that have plagued the company—having table service isn't going to enhance the experience, said Darren Tristano, vice president at restaurant consulting firm Technomic Inc. \nIn addition to table service, the company is also installing free-standing kiosks inside the restaurants, which have proven successful in overseas markets including the U.K., France and Australia, according to the company, which said people tend to order more food when they don't feel pressured to order at the counter. Customers can pay for their food at the kiosk and indicate whether they want table service. \nInstalling the kiosks themselves and rearranging the flow of the restaurant can range from about $28,000 to $60,000, depending on the volume of business the restaurant does. They will only be installed in restaurants that are remodeled to be more modern. Starting early next year, the kiosks and table service will be rolled out in Boston, Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and eventually the plan is to do it nationwide. \nMcDonald's said it is providing additional training to employees who will be interacting with customers more, including greeting them as they enter. \n\"The biggest risk is that traditional Boomer and GenX customers may not give them the permission to make these changes and rebel against them by opting to go to other competitors,\" Mr. Tristano said, citing an effort by Ruby Tuesday to upgrade their menus and interiors. \"Their customers saw them as a traditional casual dining chain that served food at the $14 check average and the new contemporary interiors failed to attract more affluent consumers and scared away their loyal customers.\" \nWrite to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 11-18-161025ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

      "title": "Pharrell Williams Talks New Hu Adidas Line: Serving Your Mind and Body While Being 'Cool as F—'",
      "text": "Pharrell Williams was an admittedly lazy employee mopping McDonald's floors as a teen in Virginia Beach, Va. And though he loved snacking on McNuggets more than he actually enjoyed the job, he does have fond memories of what he bought with the money he earned. \"I saved up my first check from working at McDonald's to buy a discounted pair of Adidas,\" recalls the 43-year-old acclaimed producer and designer. \"I'll never forget, they were the red and gold Instincts. After that was a [Los Angeles] Lakers-esque mustard and purple low-top pair. I didn't have enough money to buy clothes, so my mom still had to chip in and buy my clothes for the school year.\"\nFor every sentence that Williams utters while nestled here in the corner of the Adidas booth at the first annual ComplexCon - the expo set in Long Beach, Calif., that showcases and aligns music with fashion and pop culture - an audience of his fans and followers grows by two to four people. All are either trying to eavesdrop or aim to linger long enough to snag a picture. Amazingly, Williams keeps his focus on the conversation at hand and his eyes (hidden under white Chanel sunglasses) away from the 50 locked on him.\n\"I never ever dreamed in a million years that I would end up here,\" he says. Today, the kid who scraped together his cash for Adidas kicks is now promoting clothes and sneakers from his Hu collection , which is produced through his now two-year-old partnership with Adidas Originals. \"It's been crazy, having a brand with Adidas and doing things collaboratively with them,\" Pharrell says as he shakes his head in disbelief. Then he lists the good company he's in at Adidas: \"Kanye [West], Stella McCartney, Jeremy [Scott], Yohji [Yamamoto].\"\nRead more: Hollywood's Battles for the Best Bar Mitzvah: $5M Budgets, Justin Bieber and Camels\nWilliams' latest line is Hu Holiday, out in stores Thursday. It's the second iteration of Hu, which dropped at the end of September. This time, pieces that range from bucket hats to backpacks, tennis skirts to track jackets feature images of geometric triangle motifs and Japanese Katakana all-over prints.\nOverall, Williams' goal for Hu is simple: Galvanize. Throughout his more than 20-year career, Williams has been known as a purveyor of cool, seemingly able to make whatever he's wearing suddenly an \"It\" brand (the Smokey the Bear hat , for example) and providing the Midas touch to whichever artist he produced music for. Now his objective is to attach a greater message to his apparel. Pieces from the September line, which are still available online starting at $70, feature the phrase \"Human Race\" translated in English, French and Japanese languages on them.\nA photo posted by Pharrell Williams (@pharrell) on Nov 10, 2016 at 1:05pm PST\n\"There was an opportunity to use this moment - this agreement between Adidas and myself - to do something for other people,\" Williams explains, \"while we made creative, interesting, cool technology that services the body. That's what HU is. HU [stands for] Health Ultimatum. [I'm asking,] 'How can we strive for betterment in our work?' That's why you see all the different colors and languages. We're ultimately trying to bring people together.\"\nWhile crediting Adidas' Global Category Director, Statement Collaborations Rachel Muscat, who is sitting to his left, for bringing him on board, Williams says they're trying to promote messages of unity without \"sounding preachy. It can also just look cool as f - . It can feel cool as f - . It can sound cool as f - . That's what we're doing. What can I do to make your life better for your mind body and soul? And I'm not talking granola and shit. I'm talking about cool. Cool is healthy.\"\nAs far as ideal customers, Williams isn't targeting any specific race or age group, he says while scrunching his face in admonishment of such monotonous boardroom speak.\n\"We don't make anything for demographics as much as we make things for ambitions,\" Williams elaborates. \"If you've got the ambition to just do better, this is for you. [Hu] is not gender-specific. It's not sexually orientated. It's just for human beings with ambitions of better days.\"\nThis article first appeared on Billboard.com.",

      "text": "Since taking over as CEO of McDonald's in March 2015, Steve Easterbrook has set his sights on the company's food.\nOn his watch the fast food behemoth has committed to serving only cage-free eggs by 2025 , implemented a more stringent antibiotics policy for its chickens, removed high-fructose corn syrup from its buns, and cut out artificial preservatives from its McNuggets. And of course there's the big one--the launch of All Day Breakfast.\nBut on Thursday Easterbook signaled that he was turning his attention to how diners are served that food, continuing what he called the company's \"commitment to putting customers at the heart of everything we do.\"\nMcDonald’s announced that it would roll out digital self-order kiosks and table service in all of its 14,000 U.S. stores. Customers will be able to order at touch screens and then pick up a number with a digital locator, which will allow employees to serve them at their tables. Next year customers will also be able to order and pay on the company’s mobile app, which has 16 million downloads.\nRight now kiosks and table service are available in 500 McDonald's restaurants in Southern California, New York, and Florida. Next up are Boston, Washington D.C., Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco. Incoming U.S. president Chris Kempczinski said choosing those cities was \"very purposeful\" since they are “trendsetting” markets.\nWhile McDonald’s has touted its five consecutive quarters of same-store-sales growth--an important industry metric--there are signs that the turnaround has not completely taken hold. Internal emails obtained by Bloomberg last month showed that the company is facing its fourth-straight year of traffic declines in the U.S. This new initiative from McDonald’s is its latest attempt to increase customer visits and change perceptions.\nTable service and kiosks are more in line with how fast casual restaurants--think Panera Bread--have catered to customers. McDonald’s must walk a fine line between trying to capture a new group of diners without alienating its core, which Easterbrook seemed to acknowledge yesterday. “This is not being a different McDonald’s, but a better McDonald’s,” he said.\nThe shift is a massive one for the company, which built a business on speed and efficiency. The new service model is another sign that Easterbrook, who took the helm amid one of the most tumultuous times in the company's history as revenues, profits, and same-store sales were all slumping, is willing to turn the company on its head to revive the brand. Those shifts are also cultural: He has stripped out layers of management, brought in outsiders, and is moving the company’s headquarters from suburban Oak Brook, Ill., to Chicago.\nDuring a press event in New York Easterbrook said \"for the best part of our 60 years we've asked customers to fit around our business model.\" Now the company is adapting its \"business to fit around customers.\"\n\"We are putting more choice and control in the hands of customers,\" Easterbrook said, noting that the changes would impact how its patrons order, what they order, how they pay, and--most significantly--how they're served.",

      "text": "Posted November 18, 2016 10:56 am - Updated November 18, 2016 11:22 am By drew.dixon@jacksonville.com McDonald’s introduces digital kiosks at 8 First Coast area restaurants \nThis McDonald’s at 3552 Blanding Blvd. in Jacksonville is one of eight restaurants on the First Coast that began offering digital kiosks for automated ordering by customers Friday. (Florida Times-Union/Bruce Lipsky) \nTechnology and customer service merged Friday at eight McDonald’s fast food restaurants on the First Coast. \nAnd while the changes are designed to make it easier for customers to order their food, the move also poses a threat of reducing the workforce. \nAs part of a broader transformation at restaurants nationwide, McDonald’s officials announced in a prepared statement Friday that the restaurants are offering new digital kiosks within the restaurants that allow customers to self-order their food and pay the tab at the kiosks. Customers can still order at counters. Customers can also use Apple or Android pay mobile applications on mobile devices. \nAfter the order is placed from the kiosk, the food is delivered to the table of the customer by McDonald’s employees, or customers can pick up their order at the service counter. \nEventually there will be 69 McDonald’s restaurants that will be equipped with the digital upgrades in 2017. \nThe eight First Coast area McDonald’s restaurants that are currently offering the kiosks include: \n• 103 Tuscan Way, St. Augustine. \n• 10135 San Jose Blvd. \n• 1896 S. 8th St., Fernandina Beach. \n• 8570 Argyle Forest Blvd. \n• 435 Atlantic Blvd. in Atlantic Beach. \n• 51 S. 3rd St. in Jacksonville Beach. \n• 909 Dunn Ave. \nCandace Moody, vice president of communications of the workforce development organization CareerSource Northeast Florida, said digital kiosks at restaurants aren’t new. Restaurants such as Chili’s and Panera Bread already offer them. \nWhile McDonald’s may be the biggest fast food chain to implement them, digital kiosks are a growing trend that will eliminate many jobs, Moody said. \n“The online version or kiosk can give a lot more information than a human can, especially with a young worker, a teenager,” Moody said. \n“I do think it’s a disturbing trend for the service industry with young people finding jobs because there’s going to be fewer and fewer of them as technology takes over. But that’s a trend in everything,” Moody said. \nAs minimum wages increase, businesses will continue to seek ways to minimize hourly costs for workers, Moody said. \nIn Florida, for instance, the minimum wage has increased to $8.05 per hour under a state law that provides for cost-of-living increases. That accounts for the state minimum wage being more than the national minimum of $7.25 per hour. \nMoody said Florida’s minimum wage is about to increase to $8.10 per hour on Jan. 1 due to another cost of living adjustment. \n“The workforce that’s employed in the service industry has a lot of turnover and requires a lot of training and oversight,” she said. “It’s one of those things that technology is more reliable and less expensive in the long run.” \nBut reductions in human service at restaurants was already underway well before the incursion of digital kiosks. Moody said most fast food restaurants already have self-service drink fountains, which are designed to reduce the number of worker hours spent on pouring drinks; and customers bus their own tables. \nMoody said the demand for increased minimum wages sounds attractive. But the because of the impact on entry level jobs, increasing wages could be counterproductive. \nPersonal injury attorney John Morgan announced this week that he is considering a run for Florida governor in 2018. The Orlando Democrat and architect of the legalization of the medical marijuana referendum that was approved by voters said one of his main platforms would be to increase the state’s minimum wage to $15 per hour. \nMoody said such a pledge could certainly attract many voters. But she said boosting minimum pay that high during a time when technology is threatening the workforce could cost even more jobs. \n“That sounds really noble, but what it’s going to do is accelerate the pace of this technology taking over actual jobs,” Moody said. “I think that’s counterproductive and I’ve never been a fan of raising and raising the minimum wage because what it does is drive companies to look for other solutions other than entry-level labor.” \nDrew Dixon: (904)359-4098.",

      "text": "McDonald’s is Getting Table Service for When You Want Fast Food, But Without the Speed and Convenience by Dana Eisenberg | 10:31   \nMcDonald’s announced Thursday that it would be rolling out table service at all of its US locations. They’ll be adding digital kiosks as well. Once the system is implemented, you can place your order at the kiosk and then choose whether you’d like to take your food with you to go, or have it served to you at a table. So far, the service is offered in 500 stores in the United States but eventually it will extend to all 14,000 locations in the country. \nAccording to a report from Business Insider , CEO Steve Easterbrook said “For the best part of our 16 years, we’ve asked customers to work around our business model. But now, customers are more demanding, and we’re looking to evolve our business.” \nEasterbrook said that the change is part of an effort to make a “better McDonald’s.”“Taking your kids to McDonald’s should be a fundamentally… fun experience,” he said. “But, the initial stages of it can be quite stressful when you’re trying to place the order, you’re trying to get it right, you’re trying to get the drinks, you’re trying to search for a table, and your kids are running around.” \nThe chain will begin to test the service at the beginning of 2017 and will start implementing it during the second half of the year.

And every so often, the ubiquitous fast food chain looks to reinvent invent itself for the times. There’s the McCafe coffee shop-style restaurant that launched down under in Australia in the 90s and the Create Your Taste concept from a few years back designed the compete with Shake Shack. There was that weird take on the Hamburglar who looked like an amateur wrestler in a fedora. \nThe chain’s latest model is “Just For You,” which has rolled out at a number of international locations and is starting to trickle down to the US, including restaurants in California, Florida and New York, with San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, D.C. and Seattle getting their turn early next year. The key differentiator is a serious of big touchscreen kiosks that let customers customize their orders, coupled with table service and Apple or Android Pay. The interiors have gotten a bit of a facelift, as well. \nFor those poor souls unable to experience it in person, good news, the company has released a video designed for Google cardboard devices that simulates what it would be like to order a hamburger in a new McDonald’s location surrounded by attractive and stylish people who smile all the time. \nWhat a time to be alive. 0",

      "text": "Earlier this week, McDonald's ( MCD ) intrigued us with revelations that it is testing spicy, Sriracha sauce-laced burgers in Ohio, with the potential for these hipster-drawing delicacies to be rolled out nationwide at a later date.\nOn Thursday, the fast-food chain made the surprise announcement that it will be bringing table service to all its restaurants. It seems an unlikely move, but it should appeal to customers and investors .\nThe initiative is part of a larger effort to improve its products and services. The company's shares were roughly flat in Thursday trading.\nMcDonald's has long been the market leader when it comes to fast food. But changing tastes and preferences among consumers have forced the company to alter several aspects of its business.\nFirst, the fast-casual restaurant model, led by chains such as the now-beleaguered Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panera Bread , began to gain favor among American diners over traditional fast food. Fast casual offers the convenience of fast food, but with ingredients that are deemed healthier or more gourmet than what you'd get at McDonald's or Restaurant Brands' Burger King. The prices are steeper, as well, but fast casual chains have found that consumers are willing to pay for better quality.\nPANERA BREAD is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

People started eating out less, preferring to cook their own foods with produce and groceries bought at increasingly low supermarket prices. Meanwhile, some analysts blamed a decline in fast food sales on the fact that many Americans still feel cash-strapped. A few analysts have even gone as far as to declare the U.S. at the beginning of a \"restaurant recession.\"\nAgainst such a backdrop, McDonald's has had to retool both its products and its image to keep profits rolling in . Under new CEO Steve Easterbrook, the company has implemented big changes, such as the introduction of the all-day breakfast menu.\nTo appeal to the more health-conscious consumer whom the company was in danger of losing to fast casual, the company started to experiment with local specialties, cut artificial ingredients and preservatives and eliminated high-fructose corn syrup from some of its baked goods.",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nMcDonald’s announced a bold plan to roll out its “experience of the future” concept, including kiosk ordering and table service, to restaurants in Chicago and other big U.S. cities in an effort to better compete with “better burger” rivals. \nThe burger chain has nearly 500 redesigned restaurants around the country so far. \nThe world’s largest burger chain will first focus the rollout in its hometown of Chicago and a handful of other big U.S. cities, including Boston and Washington, D.C. But the company says it will eventually unveil the concept, which has already shown significant success in other countries like the U.K. and Australia, in all of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It didn’t offer a timeline or overall cost for the rollout. \n“Food ordering is one of the most enjoyable moments at restaurants, but at McDonald’s that can be one of the most stressful moments,” CEO Steve Easterbrook said. The aim is to eliminate that frustration, while also bringing employees out from behind the counter to interact with customers. With the ability to customize, upgrade and add-on items themselves, customers also tend to spend more per visit, Easterbrook said. \nThe plan to eventually redesign and upgrade all U.S. restaurants signals a significant change in the look and feel of eating at McDonald’s, and it also brings a great deal of risk. The ambitious remodeling effort was announced by Easterbrook and other company executives Thursday morning at a redesigned restaurant in New York City. \nThe redesigns will include the option of ordering at a bank of kiosks, though counter service also will be available for those who are paying with cash or prefer not to use the touch-screen machines. After using a kiosk, a customer takes a Bluetooth-enabled number placard to a table where an employee brings the food. Customers can pay at the kiosks using a credit or debit card, or Apple or Android pay. \n“Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,” Easterbrook said. \nThe changes will be funded in large part by the franchisees that operate McDonald’s restaurants, but the company said it will contribute in some ways as well. It’s not clear exactly how much the remodels will cost, and the price will vary depending on what technology the restaurant currently offers. Ordering kiosks alone can cost $60,000. \nEasterbrook said the new system would mean that workers might have slightly different jobs. \n“We’ve not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them,” he said. \nMcDonald's had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin' Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. \nIncoming McDonald’s U.S. President Chris Kempczinski said that while the plan is significant, he also promised further improvements in food quality and promotions like all-day breakfast, which have been the driver of more than a year of improving sales at the chain. \n“It’s a great start, a significant step forward, but it’s also a sign of things to come,” he said. \nThe New York Times and The Washington Post contributed. Steve Easterbrook, CEO of McDonald’s Corp., demonstrates the ease of placing an order at the self-order kiosk Thursday at a McDonald’s restaurant in New York.

      "text": "  NEW YORK \nMcDonald’s announced a bold plan to roll out its “experience of the future” concept, including kiosk ordering and table service, to restaurants in Chicago and other big U.S. cities in an effort to better compete with “better burger” rivals. \nThe burger chain has nearly 500 redesigned restaurants around the country so far. \nThe world’s largest burger chain will first focus the rollout in its hometown of Chicago and a handful of other big U.S. cities, including Boston and Washington, D.C. But the company says it will eventually unveil the concept, which has already shown significant success in other countries like the U.K. and Australia, in all of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It didn’t offer a timeline or overall cost for the rollout. \n“Food ordering is one of the most enjoyable moments at restaurants, but at McDonald’s that can be one of the most stressful moments,” CEO Steve Easterbrook said. The aim is to eliminate that frustration, while also bringing employees out from behind the counter to interact with customers. With the ability to customize, upgrade and add-on items themselves, customers also tend to spend more per visit, Easterbrook said. \nThe plan to eventually redesign and upgrade all U.S. restaurants signals a significant change in the look and feel of eating at McDonald’s, and it also brings a great deal of risk. The ambitious remodeling effort was announced by Easterbrook and other company executives Thursday morning at a redesigned restaurant in New York City. \nThe redesigns will include the option of ordering at a bank of kiosks, though counter service also will be available for those who are paying with cash or prefer not to use the touch-screen machines. After using a kiosk, a customer takes a Bluetooth-enabled number placard to a table where an employee brings the food. Customers can pay at the kiosks using a credit or debit card, or Apple or Android pay. \n“Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,” Easterbrook said. \nThe changes will be funded in large part by the franchisees that operate McDonald’s restaurants, but the company said it will contribute in some ways as well. It’s not clear exactly how much the remodels will cost, and the price will vary depending on what technology the restaurant currently offers. Ordering kiosks alone can cost $60,000. \nEasterbrook said the new system would mean that workers might have slightly different jobs. \n“We’ve not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them,” he said. \nMcDonald's had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin' Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. \nIncoming McDonald’s U.S. President Chris Kempczinski said that while the plan is significant, he also promised further improvements in food quality and promotions like all-day breakfast, which have been the driver of more than a year of improving sales at the chain. \n“It’s a great start, a significant step forward, but it’s also a sign of things to come,” he said. \nThe New York Times and The Washington Post contributed.

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) FILE - In this Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015, file photo, the sun sets behind a McDonald's in Ebensburg, Pa. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) NEW YORK (AP/MEDIA GENERAL) — McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. The world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction. McDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. The push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement – including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu – customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. CEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.” He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. Even though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. The kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald’s has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. In stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nMcDonald’s announced a bold plan to roll out its “experience of the future” concept, including kiosk ordering and table service, to restaurants in Chicago and other big U.S. cities in an effort to better compete with “better burger” rivals. \nThe burger chain has nearly 500 redesigned restaurants around the country so far. \nThe world’s largest burger chain will first focus the rollout in its hometown of Chicago and a handful of other big U.S. cities, including Boston and Washington, D.C. But the company says it will eventually unveil the concept, which has already shown significant success in other countries like the U.K. and Australia, in all of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It didn’t offer a timeline or overall cost for the rollout. \n“Food ordering is one of the most enjoyable moments at restaurants, but at McDonald’s that can be one of the most stressful moments,” CEO Steve Easterbrook said. The aim is to eliminate that frustration, while also bringing employees out from behind the counter to interact with customers. With the ability to customize, upgrade and add-on items themselves, customers also tend to spend more per visit, Easterbrook said. \nThe plan to eventually redesign and upgrade all U.S. restaurants signals a significant change in the look and feel of eating at McDonald’s, and it also brings a great deal of risk. The ambitious remodeling effort was announced by Easterbrook and other company executives Thursday morning at a redesigned restaurant in New York City. \nThe redesigns will include the option of ordering at a bank of kiosks, though counter service also will be available for those who are paying with cash or prefer not to use the touch-screen machines. After using a kiosk, a customer takes a Bluetooth-enabled number placard to a table where an employee brings the food. Customers can pay at the kiosks using a credit or debit card, or Apple or Android pay. \n“Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,” Easterbrook said. \nThe changes will be funded in large part by the franchisees that operate McDonald’s restaurants, but the company said it will contribute in some ways as well. It’s not clear exactly how much the remodels will cost, and the price will vary depending on what technology the restaurant currently offers. Ordering kiosks alone can cost $60,000. \nEasterbrook said the new system would mean that workers might have slightly different jobs. \n“We’ve not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them,” he said. \nMcDonald's had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin' Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. \nIncoming McDonald’s U.S. President Chris Kempczinski said that while the plan is significant, he also promised further improvements in food quality and promotions like all-day breakfast, which have been the driver of more than a year of improving sales at the chain. \n“It’s a great start, a significant step forward, but it’s also a sign of things to come,” he said. \nThe New York Times and The Washington Post contributed.

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nMcDonald’s announced a bold plan to roll out its “experience of the future” concept, including kiosk ordering and table service, to restaurants in Chicago and other big U.S. cities in an effort to better compete with “better burger” rivals. \nThe burger chain has nearly 500 redesigned restaurants around the country so far. \nThe world’s largest burger chain will first focus the rollout in its hometown of Chicago and a handful of other big U.S. cities, including Boston and Washington, D.C. But the company says it will eventually unveil the concept, which has already shown significant success in other countries like the U.K. and Australia, in all of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It didn’t offer a timeline or overall cost for the rollout. \n“Food ordering is one of the most enjoyable moments at restaurants, but at McDonald’s that can be one of the most stressful moments,” CEO Steve Easterbrook said. The aim is to eliminate that frustration, while also bringing employees out from behind the counter to interact with customers. With the ability to customize, upgrade and add-on items themselves, customers also tend to spend more per visit, Easterbrook said. \nThe plan to eventually redesign and upgrade all U.S. restaurants signals a significant change in the look and feel of eating at McDonald’s, and it also brings a great deal of risk. The ambitious remodeling effort was announced by Easterbrook and other company executives Thursday morning at a redesigned restaurant in New York City. \nThe redesigns will include the option of ordering at a bank of kiosks, though counter service also will be available for those who are paying with cash or prefer not to use the touch-screen machines. After using a kiosk, a customer takes a Bluetooth-enabled number placard to a table where an employee brings the food. Customers can pay at the kiosks using a credit or debit card, or Apple or Android pay. \n“Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,” Easterbrook said. \nThe changes will be funded in large part by the franchisees that operate McDonald’s restaurants, but the company said it will contribute in some ways as well. It’s not clear exactly how much the remodels will cost, and the price will vary depending on what technology the restaurant currently offers. Ordering kiosks alone can cost $60,000. \nEasterbrook said the new system would mean that workers might have slightly different jobs. \n“We’ve not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them,” he said. \nMcDonald's had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin' Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. \nIncoming McDonald’s U.S. President Chris Kempczinski said that while the plan is significant, he also promised further improvements in food quality and promotions like all-day breakfast, which have been the driver of more than a year of improving sales at the chain. \n“It’s a great start, a significant step forward, but it’s also a sign of things to come,” he said. \nThe New York Times and The Washington Post contributed.

McDonald's tested having employees bus out food at 500 locations. \nIt plans to expand to locations in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington D.C. before making a nationwide endeavor. \nCustomers will still order in the traditional way, but servers will bring orders to the table, where customers can wait after ordering. \nThe burger chain is also rolling out touch-screen ordering and mobile pay options. \nMcDonald's has 14,000 restaurants in the United States. \nCopyright 2016 CNN.

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nMcDonald’s announced a bold plan to roll out its “experience of the future” concept, including kiosk ordering and table service, to restaurants in Chicago and other big U.S. cities in an effort to better compete with “better burger” rivals. \nThe burger chain has nearly 500 redesigned restaurants around the country so far. \nThe world’s largest burger chain will first focus the rollout in its hometown of Chicago and a handful of other big U.S. cities, including Boston and Washington, D.C.

      "text": "McDonald’s to Expand Table Service in Break With Tradition Leslie Patton November 17, 2016 — 12:04 PM EST November 17, 2016 — 4:44 PM EST Jobs will be created to serve food and help with kiosk orders Company also adding mobile ordering in the U.S. next year \nMcDonald’s Corp. plans to offer table service at all of its U.S. restaurants, upending decades of fast-food tradition in a bid to placate pickier customers. \nTable service is currently in about 500 locations, but will be rolled out to the entire U.S. chain, McDonald’s said Thursday at an event in New York. The company also is bringing mobile ordering and payments to the country in 2017, as well as more digital kiosks. \nMcDonald’s already has table service at some locations in New York, Florida and Southern California, as well as many places abroad. It’s coming soon to markets such as Boston and San Francisco, the company said. New positions will be created at restaurants to serve food and help customers with touch-screen orders. \nThe shift is significant for a company most responsible for popularizing fast food -- along with a more stripped-down approach to restaurant service. But competition and the rise of fast-casual chains have elevated expectations. Customers also are looking to technology to help make restaurants more convenient. \n“Customers are getting increasingly demanding, and their expectations will only grow,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said at the event. Sluggish Stock \nA drop in the cost of groceries has added pressure to fast-food chains this year because it’s increasingly cheap for customers to eat at home. Restaurant companies also have blamed anxiety around the presidential election for hurting results. McDonald’s shares are up just 1.1 percent in 2016, lagging behind the 7 percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. \nThe new approach may bring in the kind of customers who balk at lines, said Ivan Feinseth, analyst at Tigress Financial Partners. \n“It will make it look less congested at the point of ordering,” he said. “Then people feel they won’t have to wait that long.” \nEarlier this month, the world’s biggest restaurant chain said it was planning a “significant” boost in technology spending . The investment will help fund the new self-serve kiosks and mobile-ordering application. The plan includes expanding a smartphone ordering app across its 14,000 domestic locations, starting next year. The kiosks cost about $7,000 each, and McDonald’s said it plans to help franchisees defer the costs. U.S. Remodeling Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

Part of the broader upgrade in the U.S. includes hiring more workers to ease the ordering process and deliver food to customers at their tables, Easterbrook said.\nThe hiring push comes amid a tighter U.S. job market, with low unemployment and rising minimum wages. In response, restaurant chains and retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. have boosted pay to attract workers. Last year, McDonald’s announced raises for employees at company-owned restaurants, which account for about 10 percent of the U.S. total. Lower Turnover \nEasterbrook said the higher pay has reduced turnover and improved service, benefits that the company has highlighted to its franchisees. \n“If you reduce your turnover, you get some stability,” Easterbrook said in an interview. “It makes us a more attractive employer, which helps the operators and the company.” \nMcDonald’s had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin’ Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. McDonald’s, based in Oak Brook, Illinois, is looking to grab some of those consumers with its own faster and more convenient service. \nFor 60 years, McDonald’s dictated how customers ordered and got food, Easterbrook said. \n“That’s changing now,” he said. “It’s a totally different mindset.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nMcDonald’s announced a bold plan to roll out its “experience of the future” concept, including kiosk ordering and table service, to restaurants in Chicago and other big U.S. cities in an effort to better compete with “better burger” rivals. \nThe burger chain has nearly 500 redesigned restaurants around the country so far. \nThe world’s largest burger chain will first focus the rollout in its hometown of Chicago and a handful of other big U.S. cities, including Boston and Washington, D.C. But the company says it will eventually unveil the concept, which has already shown significant success in other countries like the U.K. and Australia, in all of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It didn’t offer a timeline or overall cost for the rollout. \n“Food ordering is one of the most enjoyable moments at restaurants, but at McDonald’s that can be one of the most stressful moments,” CEO Steve Easterbrook said. The aim is to eliminate that frustration, while also bringing employees out from behind the counter to interact with customers. With the ability to customize, upgrade and add-on items themselves, customers also tend to spend more per visit, Easterbrook said. \nThe plan to eventually redesign and upgrade all U.S. restaurants signals a significant change in the look and feel of eating at McDonald’s, and it also brings a great deal of risk. The ambitious remodeling effort was announced by Easterbrook and other company executives Thursday morning at a redesigned restaurant in New York City. \nThe redesigns will include the option of ordering at a bank of kiosks, though counter service also will be available for those who are paying with cash or prefer not to use the touch-screen machines. After using a kiosk, a customer takes a Bluetooth-enabled number placard to a table where an employee brings the food. Customers can pay at the kiosks using a credit or debit card, or Apple or Android pay. \n“Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,” Easterbrook said. \nThe changes will be funded in large part by the franchisees that operate McDonald’s restaurants, but the company said it will contribute in some ways as well. It’s not clear exactly how much the remodels will cost, and the price will vary depending on what technology the restaurant currently offers. Ordering kiosks alone can cost $60,000. \nEasterbrook said the new system would mean that workers might have slightly different jobs. \n“We’ve not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them,” he said. \nMcDonald's had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin' Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. \nIncoming McDonald’s U.S. President Chris Kempczinski said that while the plan is significant, he also promised further improvements in food quality and promotions like all-day breakfast, which have been the driver of more than a year of improving sales at the chain. \n“It’s a great start, a significant step forward, but it’s also a sign of things to come,” he said. \nThe New York Times and The Washington Post contributed.

      "text": "  NEW YORK \nMcDonald’s announced a bold plan to roll out its “experience of the future” concept, including kiosk ordering and table service, to restaurants in Chicago and other big U.S. cities in an effort to better compete with “better burger” rivals. \nThe burger chain has nearly 500 redesigned restaurants around the country so far. \nThe world’s largest burger chain will first focus the rollout in its hometown of Chicago and a handful of other big U.S. cities, including Boston and Washington, D.C. But the company says it will eventually unveil the concept, which has already shown significant success in other countries like the U.K. and Australia, in all of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It didn’t offer a timeline or overall cost for the rollout. \n“Food ordering is one of the most enjoyable moments at restaurants, but at McDonald’s that can be one of the most stressful moments,” CEO Steve Easterbrook said. The aim is to eliminate that frustration, while also bringing employees out from behind the counter to interact with customers. With the ability to customize, upgrade and add-on items themselves, customers also tend to spend more per visit, Easterbrook said. \nThe plan to eventually redesign and upgrade all U.S. restaurants signals a significant change in the look and feel of eating at McDonald’s, and it also brings a great deal of risk. The ambitious remodeling effort was announced by Easterbrook and other company executives Thursday morning at a redesigned restaurant in New York City. \nThe redesigns will include the option of ordering at a bank of kiosks, though counter service also will be available for those who are paying with cash or prefer not to use the touch-screen machines. After using a kiosk, a customer takes a Bluetooth-enabled number placard to a table where an employee brings the food. Customers can pay at the kiosks using a credit or debit card, or Apple or Android pay. \n“Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,” Easterbrook said. \nThe changes will be funded in large part by the franchisees that operate McDonald’s restaurants, but the company said it will contribute in some ways as well. It’s not clear exactly how much the remodels will cost, and the price will vary depending on what technology the restaurant currently offers. Ordering kiosks alone can cost $60,000. \nEasterbrook said the new system would mean that workers might have slightly different jobs. \n“We’ve not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them,” he said. \nMcDonald's had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin' Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. \nIncoming McDonald’s U.S. President Chris Kempczinski said that while the plan is significant, he also promised further improvements in food quality and promotions like all-day breakfast, which have been the driver of more than a year of improving sales at the chain. \n“It’s a great start, a significant step forward, but it’s also a sign of things to come,” he said. \nThe New York Times and The Washington Post contributed.

You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground.\nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe.\n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around.\nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times.\nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city.\n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year.

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nMcDonald’s announced a bold plan to roll out its “experience of the future” concept, including kiosk ordering and table service, to restaurants in Chicago and other big U.S. cities in an effort to better compete with “better burger” rivals. \nThe burger chain has nearly 500 redesigned restaurants around the country so far. \nThe world’s largest burger chain will first focus the rollout in its hometown of Chicago and a handful of other big U.S. cities, including Boston and Washington, D.C. But the company says it will eventually unveil the concept, which has already shown significant success in other countries like the U.K. and Australia, in all of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It didn’t offer a timeline or overall cost for the rollout. \n“Food ordering is one of the most enjoyable moments at restaurants, but at McDonald’s that can be one of the most stressful moments,” CEO Steve Easterbrook said. The aim is to eliminate that frustration, while also bringing employees out from behind the counter to interact with customers. With the ability to customize, upgrade and add-on items themselves, customers also tend to spend more per visit, Easterbrook said. \nThe plan to eventually redesign and upgrade all U.S. restaurants signals a significant change in the look and feel of eating at McDonald’s, and it also brings a great deal of risk. The ambitious remodeling effort was announced by Easterbrook and other company executives Thursday morning at a redesigned restaurant in New York City. \nThe redesigns will include the option of ordering at a bank of kiosks, though counter service also will be available for those who are paying with cash or prefer not to use the touch-screen machines. After using a kiosk, a customer takes a Bluetooth-enabled number placard to a table where an employee brings the food. Customers can pay at the kiosks using a credit or debit card, or Apple or Android pay. \n“Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,” Easterbrook said. \nThe changes will be funded in large part by the franchisees that operate McDonald’s restaurants, but the company said it will contribute in some ways as well. It’s not clear exactly how much the remodels will cost, and the price will vary depending on what technology the restaurant currently offers. Ordering kiosks alone can cost $60,000. \nEasterbrook said the new system would mean that workers might have slightly different jobs. \n“We’ve not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them,” he said. \nMcDonald's had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin' Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. \nIncoming McDonald’s U.S. President Chris Kempczinski said that while the plan is significant, he also promised further improvements in food quality and promotions like all-day breakfast, which have been the driver of more than a year of improving sales at the chain. \n“It’s a great start, a significant step forward, but it’s also a sign of things to come,” he said. \nThe New York Times and The Washington Post contributed. Steve Easterbrook, CEO of McDonald’s Corp., demonstrates the ease of placing an order at the self-order kiosk Thursday at a McDonald’s restaurant in New York.

You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground.\nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe.\n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around.\nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times.\nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city.\n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year. Loved ones are dying because of this horrendous epidemic,\" Orzech said.\nRaw Video: \nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video ",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nMcDonald’s announced a bold plan to roll out its “experience of the future” concept, including kiosk ordering and table service, to restaurants in Chicago and other big U.S. cities in an effort to better compete with “better burger” rivals. \nThe burger chain has nearly 500 redesigned restaurants around the country so far. \nThe world’s largest burger chain will first focus the rollout in its hometown of Chicago and a handful of other big U.S. cities, including Boston and Washington, D.C. But the company says it will eventually unveil the concept, which has already shown significant success in other countries like the U.K. and Australia, in all of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It didn’t offer a timeline or overall cost for the rollout. \n“Food ordering is one of the most enjoyable moments at restaurants, but at McDonald’s that can be one of the most stressful moments,” CEO Steve Easterbrook said. The aim is to eliminate that frustration, while also bringing employees out from behind the counter to interact with customers. With the ability to customize, upgrade and add-on items themselves, customers also tend to spend more per visit, Easterbrook said. \nThe plan to eventually redesign and upgrade all U.S. restaurants signals a significant change in the look and feel of eating at McDonald’s, and it also brings a great deal of risk. The ambitious remodeling effort was announced by Easterbrook and other company executives Thursday morning at a redesigned restaurant in New York City. \nThe redesigns will include the option of ordering at a bank of kiosks, though counter service also will be available for those who are paying with cash or prefer not to use the touch-screen machines. After using a kiosk, a customer takes a Bluetooth-enabled number placard to a table where an employee brings the food. Customers can pay at the kiosks using a credit or debit card, or Apple or Android pay. \n“Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,” Easterbrook said. \nThe changes will be funded in large part by the franchisees that operate McDonald’s restaurants, but the company said it will contribute in some ways as well. It’s not clear exactly how much the remodels will cost, and the price will vary depending on what technology the restaurant currently offers. Ordering kiosks alone can cost $60,000. \nEasterbrook said the new system would mean that workers might have slightly different jobs. \n“We’ve not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them,” he said. \nMcDonald's had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin' Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. \nIncoming McDonald’s U.S. President Chris Kempczinski said that while the plan is significant, he also promised further improvements in food quality and promotions like all-day breakfast, which have been the driver of more than a year of improving sales at the chain. \n“It’s a great start, a significant step forward, but it’s also a sign of things to come,” he said. \nThe New York Times and The Washington Post contributed.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) NEW YORK (AP/MEDIA GENERAL) — McDonald’s wants to makes its fast-food outlets feel more like restaurants, with plans to eventually expand table service across its U.S. locations. The world’s biggest burger chain says it has been testing the service at about 500 of its more than 14,000 domestic stores. Customers in those stores order at the counter or at kiosks and sit down and wait for an employee bring out their food, a change that McDonald’s says improves customer satisfaction. McDonald’s says it will expand the offering in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C., early next year. Bringing the change to all its stores could take years, as it would require franchisees to invest in remodeling and more training for employees. The push to offer table service like some fast-casual chains do comes as McDonald’s tries to stage a comeback after losing customers in recent years, with executives conceding they failed to keep up with changing tastes. Despite a string of announcements intended to drum up excitement – including the introduction of an all-day breakfast menu – customer visits in the U.S. have not increased, the company said. CEO Steve Easterbrook said going to McDonald’s is supposed to be fun, but “the initial stages of it can be quite stressful.” He noted that customers are becoming more demanding, and the company is working on making visits to its restaurants more convenient. Next year, the company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option. Even though McDonald’s Corp. gets a majority of its sales at the drive-thru in the U.S., the company hopes having table service in restaurants helps improve people’s perceptions about the overall experience. Table service and kiosks have already been introduced in other parts of the world, including in the United Kingdom. The kiosks are also intended to give customers greater flexibility in customizing their orders with different buns and toppings for burgers, while reducing the chances for inaccurate orders. McDonald’s has said it is working on reducing inaccurate orders, such as by asking employees to repeat orders back to customers at the drive-thru. In stores that are remodeled to have the kiosks and table service, the company said it will also be more prominently featuring its McCafe drinks and baked goods. Those are intended to go after the growing snacking habit. Easterbrook said that the traditional three meals are making up less of the opportunity for growth.

      "text": "McDonald's on Thursday announced changes that could reshape the diner's experience, saying that it would expand its digital self-serve ordering stations and table service to all of its 14,000 American restaurants.\n Timely Tendings: Taking care of edibles in your garden\n1 Month Ago\nNotable: Sharpen your crayons\n1 Day Ago\nMcDonald's plans to remove more artificial ingredients from food\n3 Months Ago\nThe company said that once people order at one of the stations  sleek, vertical touchscreens  they will get a digital location device and can take a seat. When their burgers and fries are ready, the technology will guide a server to the table to deliver the food with a big smile and a thank you.\n\"Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,\" Steve Easterbrook, chief executive of McDonald's, said at an event Thursday in a newly renovated and outfitted McDonald's on Chambers Street in New York.\nCustomers will still be able to order food the old-fashioned way, at the counter. But the move to self-order systems and table service is one way to address one of the biggest problems the company's restaurants have faced in recent years: slower food delivery to customers, caused by more items on the menu. The thinking is that customers will be more willing to wait if they are sitting at a table instead of waiting at a counter.\nBut it also raises some questions for the company: What does it mean for workers, and is the chain up for a change this big?\nEasterbrook said the new system would not reduce costs. But it would mean that workers might have slightly different jobs.\n\"We've not cutting crew; we're redeploying them,\" he said.\nMcDonald's has tested the order system in 500 revamped restaurants, or what it calls its \"just-for-you experience,\" in New York, Florida and Southern California and is now introducing them in Washington, San Francisco, Seattle, Boston and Chicago. Around the globe, the new program is in some 2,600 McDonald's restaurants.\nEasterbrook and other company executives said some 44,000 customers have been served at tables using the new system in the United States. Families and groups have been the biggest users, but the company expects the screens to attract customers of all kinds as they become more widespread. The self-serve stations, the company says, make it easier to customize an order.\n\"This is a huge opportunity for us to personalize and elevate the experience of our customers in the United States,\" said Chris Kempczinski, the new president of U.S. operations.\nMany of the company's customers, though, do not enter the restaurant. About 60 to 70 percent of sales come from its drive-thru lanes.\n\"A lot of customers are never going to see this technology,\" Dick Adams, a restaurant consultant, said. \"It's just not going to be that big a factor for most franchisees outside big cities.\"\nThe company also announced that it would roll out a mobile order-and-pay system that would also change the way customers get their orders, including customers ordering from their cars.\nMuch of what is coming to the United States has been tried in markets like Canada, Australia and Britain, where roughly one-quarter of transactions are done on in-store screens.\nHow quickly the restaurants change remains to be seen. The vast majority of McDonald's locations are owned by franchisees, and they will be responsible for paying for the changes. Equipment and installation of the eight order screens at the event Thursday, at a location in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York, cost $56,000, said Terri Hickey, a spokeswoman for McDonald's. The costs for a store with lower sales volume would probably be about $28,000.\nFranchisees may be loath to make such investments at a time when restaurant sales are lackluster at best  same-store sales in McDonald's U.S. restaurants rose a paltry 1.3 percent in the third quarter of this year.\nMany of the company's stores in Britain have undergone such a reboot, and in a video, Paul Pomroy, chief executive of the business in Britain, said the investment was worth it.\n\"The customer's perception of the quality of the food has changed,\" Pomroy said. \"A Big Mac tastes better in a reimaged restaurant, it just does.\"\nWelcome to McDonald's! May I take your order ... and bring it to your table? 11/18/16 [Last modified: Friday, November 18, 2016 6:50am]\n© 2016 Tampa Bay Times\n ",

You can hear him yell for someone to call 911. One man is in the driver's seat while the other is on the ground.\nSeveral people tried to help, including a woman Wimbley said is a nurse. She was able to wake the one as the second man remained unconscious on the ground, gasping to breathe.\n\"He wasn't moving or responding or anything,\" Wimbley told Fox 8. He had his 4-year-old son in the car and was stopping to get a sandwich when he found the two men. Wimbley said he thought they were just goofing around.\nThe Facebook Live has been viewed nearly 50,000 times.\nThis week, Sandusky Police Chief John Orzech posted a rant on Facebook about the drug problem in his city.\n\"We have seen levels of overdoses in the last two weeks that are unprecedented. We have had as many as 20 plus overdoses and four suspected overdose deaths in the past two weeks. Sandusky Fire Department has administered Narcan over 170 times this year, up from 80 last year.

This means you will be able to either get your food fast — as it was meant to be, via the drive-thru — or take your time and have it brought to your table. \nMore: McDonald's McRib is back, and now there's an app to find exactly where \nThe idea, which is already in effect in the United Kingdom, is to have customers order at a touch screen kiosk where they can customize the order (think: different buns, no pickles) and then have it brought to their table by an employee. Mickey D's said this new method boosts customer satisfaction and reduces the odds of an inaccurate order. And any customization of a food order is something we can get behind. Image: Tim Boyle/Getty Images \nMcDonald's has already been testing out tableside service in about 500 of its U.S. locations, and plans to roll it out fully in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington D.C. early next year. \nHowever, expanding the service to all of its stores nationwide could take years, as it requires franchisees to invest in remodeling and additional training for employees. \nMore: 14 outrageous food combos you'd never suspect are better together \nThe company also plans to introduce a mobile order and pay option at some point in 2017. \nWhile we wait for this golden arches upgrade, we'll just enjoy a breakfast sandwich at noon on a Saturday after indulging in a little too much wine the night before.",

      "text": "  NEW YORK \nMcDonald’s announced a bold plan to roll out its “experience of the future” concept, including kiosk ordering and table service, to restaurants in Chicago and other big U.S. cities in an effort to better compete with “better burger” rivals. \nThe burger chain has nearly 500 redesigned restaurants around the country so far. \nThe world’s largest burger chain will first focus the rollout in its hometown of Chicago and a handful of other big U.S. cities, including Boston and Washington, D.C. But the company says it will eventually unveil the concept, which has already shown significant success in other countries like the U.K. and Australia, in all of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It didn’t offer a timeline or overall cost for the rollout. \n“Food ordering is one of the most enjoyable moments at restaurants, but at McDonald’s that can be one of the most stressful moments,” CEO Steve Easterbrook said. The aim is to eliminate that frustration, while also bringing employees out from behind the counter to interact with customers. With the ability to customize, upgrade and add-on items themselves, customers also tend to spend more per visit, Easterbrook said. \nThe plan to eventually redesign and upgrade all U.S. restaurants signals a significant change in the look and feel of eating at McDonald’s, and it also brings a great deal of risk. The ambitious remodeling effort was announced by Easterbrook and other company executives Thursday morning at a redesigned restaurant in New York City. \nThe redesigns will include the option of ordering at a bank of kiosks, though counter service also will be available for those who are paying with cash or prefer not to use the touch-screen machines. After using a kiosk, a customer takes a Bluetooth-enabled number placard to a table where an employee brings the food. Customers can pay at the kiosks using a credit or debit card, or Apple or Android pay. \n“Typically, the majority of our crew is behind the counter, and that counter literally has been a barrier between our crew and the customer,” Easterbrook said. \nThe changes will be funded in large part by the franchisees that operate McDonald’s restaurants, but the company said it will contribute in some ways as well. It’s not clear exactly how much the remodels will cost, and the price will vary depending on what technology the restaurant currently offers. Ordering kiosks alone can cost $60,000. \nEasterbrook said the new system would mean that workers might have slightly different jobs. \n“We’ve not cutting crew; we’re redeploying them,” he said. \nMcDonald's had fallen behind competitors in technology. Dunkin' Donuts and Taco Bell already allow diners to order via smartphones, and Starbucks Corp. boasts millions of active rewards members. \nIncoming McDonald’s U.S. President Chris Kempczinski said that while the plan is significant, he also promised further improvements in food quality and promotions like all-day breakfast, which have been the driver of more than a year of improving sales at the chain. \n“It’s a great start, a significant step forward, but it’s also a sign of things to come,” he said. \nThe New York Times and The Washington Post contributed.
