      "title": "LinkedIn Co-founder: Microsoft had made other attempts to buy LinkedIn in the past",
      "text": "\nBack in June, Microsoft acquired LinkedIn for a whopping $26.2 billion. There was a pretty big bidding war for LinkedIn, in which Microsoft went head-to-head with Salesforce. Today, Konstantin Guericke, one of the co-founders of LinkedIn stated that the software giant actually made previous attempts to acquire LinkedIn in the past. Guericke state:\n“Microsoft since the early days had a standing offer to our VCs (venture capitalists), saying look, if you want to sell the company talk to us, so it’s not a surprise that Microsoft ended up doing the deal,”\nIn the interview, Guericke revealed that he was “sad” about the acquisition — but he believes that Microsoft acquiring LinkedIn ultimately makes sense. Before the LinkedIn acquisition, Microsoft’s biggest acquisition was Nokia (for $7.2 billion) — and it was a pretty huge failure. When asked if the LinkedIn acquisition would work out for both of the companies, Guericke stated that the LinkedIn acquisition will be “handled differently” after what happened with Nokia:\n“I think it’s very different situation. Nokia was not exactly thriving at the time when this happened. LinkedIn was thriving and it’s kind of a career make-or-break for the Microsoft CEO (Satya Nadella) so I think it’ll be handled differently, partly because of the lesson of Nokia,”\nYou can watch Konstantin Guericke’s full interview with CNBC here.

      "text": "REDMOND, Wash. , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Speaking to shareholders at Microsoft Corp.'s annual meeting on Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella highlighted how digital technology is transforming people and organizations across the world, and the opportunity for Microsoft. \n\"Digital technology is impacting and transforming every human endeavor in every industry,\" Nadella said. \"Microsoft empowers our customers who want to harness new technology, like artificial intelligence, to transform their organizations and find solutions to the biggest challenges in healthcare, agriculture, finance, government — every sector.\" \nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood reported that Microsoft executed well in fiscal year 2016 and reported a strong start to the current fiscal year. Hood noted that Microsoft's innovation road map and disciplined investment expand addressable market opportunities and position the company for growth — an investment in the future that will deliver value for shareholders. \nThe following proposals were acted on by the company's shareholders at the meeting: \nRe-elected all 11 directors to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders. All director nominees received a vote of 98 percent of votes cast. Approved, on a nonbinding advisory basis, the fiscal year 2016 compensation of the company's named executive officers. The advisory measure received 95 percent of votes cast. Ratified the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the company's independent auditor for fiscal year 2017, with a vote of 98 percent of votes cast.

      "text": "Microsoft sold an Xbox One every 15 seconds on eBay on Cyber Monday This past holiday week-end has been exceptional for online retailers, with Cyber Monday 2016 claiming the title of the biggest online shopping day ever with $3.4 billion spent online on a single day. Electronics and gaming consoles were once again among the best selling products this year, and Microsoft’s Xbox outsold Sony’s PlayStation on Black Friday according to a recent report from Adobe Digital insights. Today, Polygon obtained additional data from eBay confirming that both next-gen consoles enjoyed great momentum in the US during this holiday week-end. According to the online retailer, the PlayStation 4 sold the fastest on Black Friday with one unit sold every 20 seconds, beating the Xbox One (one sold every minute) and Nintendo’s NES Classic (one sold every two minutes). However, Microsoft’s Xbox One quadrupled its selling speed on Cyber Monday with one unit sold every 15 seconds, which was twice as fast as Playstation 4 sales that day. eBay doesn’t have extensive sales numbers for the holidays weekend yet, though Polygon used eBay’s DataLabs website to found out that 13,353 new Xbox One consoles were sold beyond November 23: As a reminder, the Xbox One was the best-selling console for four months in a row in October but Sony is reportedly leading this month according to Adobe Digital Insights. That was to be expected, as the Japanese company launched its new PlayStation 4 Pro on November 10 with a heavy marketing campaign around bringing 4K gaming to consoles.",

      "text": "Microsoft's (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella Hosts Annual Shareholders Meeting Call (Transcript) Nov.30.16 Annual Shareholders Meeting Conference Call November 30, 2016 11:00 ET Executives Satya Nadella - Chief Executive Officer Amy Hood - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Brad Smith - President and Chief Legal Officer John Seethoff - Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary Bruce Herbert - New Ground Social Investments Chris Suh - Head, Investor Relations Anne Taylor - Windows and Surface Product Marketing Manager Analysts Catherine Neuweiler - Private Investor Operator Today’s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections or other statements about future events based on current expectations and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements because of a variety of risks and uncertainties about our business, which are discussed today or described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Form 10-K and 10-Q. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Please welcome John Thompson, Chairman of the Board of Microsoft Corporation. John Thompson Good morning and welcome. I am John Thompson, Chairman of the Board of Microsoft. For those of you here with us today at the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue, Washington, as well as those of you listening online, we welcome you to our shareholder meeting. We are streaming live today on our Investor Relations website. We strive to make this meeting as inclusive as possible and we are excited to offer our shareholders an opportunity to participate and vote via the virtual shareholder meeting. Our board values the ongoing feedback we get from you and we value the thoughtfully expressed and diverse opinions you provide us as we try to create real value for you, our shareholders. I would like to share with you the presenters and the structure for today’s meeting. I will be joined by Satya Nadella, our Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Brad Smith, President and Chief Legal Officer; and John Seethoff, our Deputy General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. John will address the business portion of that meeting, followed by Amy who will review Microsoft’s financial results and then Satya will talk about how Microsoft is uniquely positioned in this era of massive digital transformation. Following his remarks, we will show you some of the new devices and productivity offerings as well as examples of world class cross platform experiences. Then we will have plenty of time for Q&A. But first, let me address or attend to some of the formalities. Broadridge Financial has been appointed as the inspector of elections for this meeting. The inspectors are located at the reception table in the lobby. Most of you have already voted by proxy or your proxy votes, and your proxy votes have been tallied. If you are a shareholder of record or a beneficial shareholder holding a legal proxy from your bank or broker and you want to vote your shares now or change your vote, ballots are available from the inspectors that are at the reception table in the lobby. Filling out a ballot and giving it to the inspectors will revoke any earlier proxy you gave. If you are a beneficial shareholder with a voting instruction form, you also may submit those forms and use the computers at the reception table to cast a new vote. The polls are now open and will be open – or closed, I am sorry, in a few moments following the presentation of the business matters. As Satya said in his letter to you, we are proud of the progress we have made over the past year and equally excited about the opportunities ahead for our company. Over the past year, we’ve built momentum in each of the ambitions while investing in our future and positioning the company for new growth. We also remain committed to a strong corporate governance framework and routinely evaluate our governance practices to maintain strong accountability, shareholder rights and transparent policies. Acting in line with Microsoft’s commitment to best practices in corporate governance, the board is proposing changes to Microsoft’s articles of incorporation that would reduce the percentage of shares outstanding required to call a special shareholder meeting. We believe this step is in the best interest of our shareholders. Another significant development has been refining our executive compensation program, which continues to evolve to better align to Microsoft’s ambitions and reward the operating team for long-term business success. We have received favorable feedback from our investors on the new incentive compensation arrangement that tie more directly to performance or specific performance metrics. The program has been developed, incorporates performance elements directly linked to the results of our three strategic ambitions: reinvent productivity, building intelligent cloud and create more personal computing. The members of our Board of Directors reflect our continuous evolution as we bring together the most diverse board the company has ever had, creating a balance with different backgrounds and points of view. Now, I would like to introduce the members, the independent numbers of our Board of Directors who are here with us today. First, Teri List-Stoll is a member of our Audit and Governance and Nominating Committee; Mason Morfit is a member of our Audit and Compensation Committee; Chuck Noski is the chair of our Audit Committee and a member of the Governance and Nominating Committee; Dr. Helmut Panke is chair of the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee and a member of the Audit Committee; Sandy Peterson is a member of the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee; Charles Scharf is a member of the Compensation and Governance and Nominating Committee; John Stanton is chair of our Compensation Committee and a member of the Regulatory and Public Policy Committee; and Padma Warrior is a member of the Compensation Committee. Welcome to all of you. Also here with us today are Steve Sinwell, Chris Weber and Stacy Janiak representing Deloitte & Touche, our independent auditors. And now I would like to call the 2016 Annual Shareholder Meeting to order. I will be serving as the Chair of the meeting and John Seethoff will serve as of the Secretary. As Chairman of the meeting, I have adopted an agenda that will govern the order of business and the rules of conduct for this meeting. Copies of the agenda and the rules are available at the reception table outside the meeting room. The rules of conduct also govern the Q&A session. John, please report the notice of the meeting and proxies received and present the matters to be voted on. John Seethoff Thanks, John and good morning everyone. This morning, I will walk us through the short formal meeting and then as John said, you will hear from Satya and Amy, followed by a Q&A session. The notice of the meeting, and Internet availability of the proxy materials mailed by Broadridge Corporation beginning October18, 2016. They went to all shareholders of record as of September 30, 2016. As a result, the meeting is being held pursuant to proper notice. Proxies representing more than 88% of the approximately 7.8 billion shares of the company’s stock that are eligible to vote have been received. So, a quorum is present and the meeting is duly constituted and will proceed. This morning, we have five management proposals and one shareholder proposal for shareholders to consider. They were all described in the proxy statement. The first item is the election of directors. The following 11 people have been properly nominated by the board: William H. Gates III; Teri List-Stoll; G. Mason Morfit; Satya Nadella; Charles H. Noski; Dr. Helmut Panke; Sandra E. Peterson; Charles Scharf; John Stanton; John W. Thompson; and Padmasree Warrior. The board recommends a vote for each of the directors on the ballot. The second item is an advisory vote to approve the compensation of the company’s named executive officers as disclosed in our 2016 proxy statement. The board recommends approval of this proposal. The third item is the ratification of the company’s independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche, for fiscal year 2017. The board recommends approval of that proposal. The fourth item is the approval of the amendment to Microsoft’s amended and restated articles of incorporation. The board recommends approval of that proposal. The fifth item is the approval of the French Sub Plan under the 2001 Stock Plan. Finally, the sixth item is the shareholder proposal on enhancements to proxy access. The full shareholder proposal and its supporting statement are set forth in the proxy statement. The proposal has been submitted by Mr. James McRitchie. I recognize Mr. McRitchie’s representative, Mr. Bruce Herbert, with New Ground Social Investments for a period of 3 minutes. Bruce Herbert Thank you. I am Bruce Herbert of New Ground Social Investment, and I stand on behalf of Jim McRitchie to move Proposal #6 for proxy access. In response to shareholders, Microsoft has made substantial progress when it adopted a form of proxy access that made amendments to its bylaws. However, though headed in the right direction, what Microsoft implemented is a decidedly limited form of proxy access that only allows 20 shareholders to form what’s called a nominating group. Despite Microsoft’s assertions to the contrary, a limit of 20 is entirely unworkable because it sets the share threshold at stratospheric levels. To illustrate this, the Council of Institutional Investors, CII, whose members control over $3 trillion in investment assets, examined its members holdings and somewhat shockingly, they discovered that in the vast majority of cases, even if 20 of the very largest shareholders public pension funds were to aggregate their shares, they still could not meet the extraordinarily burdensome criteria set by Microsoft. So in light of this, we will gently say, shame on Microsoft for appearing to embrace reform, but then setting levels that are unobtainable. The company’s policies are neither practical nor in the spirit of the national movement to democratize and enliven Board representation through proxy access. Thus, the most important amendment requested by this proposal is to raise the limit that Microsoft has set on the number of shareholders that can form a nominating group. Similar to an SEC rulemaking that was passed but subsequently suspended for a review this proposal suggests that any number of shareholders be allowed to form a nominating group. In closing, as everyone knows, appearing in the proxy is not the same as winning a seat. All nominees need to be exceedingly qualified and must receive a majority of the votes cast. Proxy access is designed to breathe new life into the Board election process by driving competition, creating accountability and boosting shareholder value. Therefore, please cast your vote for proposal number six, proxy access. Thank you. John Seethoff Thank you, Mr. Herbert. The Board recommends the vote against the proposal for the reasons stated in the company’s proxy statement. The discussions of matters for shareholder consideration is now closed and the polls are also now closed. I will share with you now the preliminary voting tabulation. First, each of the 11 nominees on the ballot, to become a Director are elected with over 98% of votes cast to serve until the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until their successors are elected and qualified. Proposal two, the advisory vote on executive compensation, has been approved by more than 95% of votes cast. Proposal three, ratification of the company’s independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche has been approved by over 98% of the votes cast. Proposal four, the amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, has been improved by a majority of shares entitled to vote and more than 99% of votes cast. Proposal five, the French Sub Plan under the 2001 stock plan has been approved by 95% of votes cast. Finally, the shareholder proposal on proxy access enhancements was not approved. We expect to post the details of final voting results on all of these matters on our Investor Relations website later today. We will also report the results in a Form 8-K, which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days. With that, we have completed the formal portion of the meeting and the meeting is now adjourned. Let me hand the stage over to our Chief Financial Officer, Amy Hood. Amy Hood Thanks John. Hello everyone and thank you for being here or watching online today. I am going to briefly recap our past fiscal year results and then cover our progress so far this year. Last year was pivotal in our continued transformation and we executed well and finished fiscal year 2016 with $85.3 billion in revenue. We aggressively pursued new addressable market opportunities in growth areas like commercial cloud, hardware, search and gaming. We transformed our sales and go-to-market engines to be more agile and further unified our internal organization around One Microsoft. It enables a richer connection to the voice of the customer and our partners. And we completed 17 acquisitions across security, productivity, developer tools, gaming and analytics to reinforce our capabilities in those key growth areas. We balanced our investment in innovation with a continued commitment to shareholder return, increasing our total cash return to $26.1 billion, up 12% from last fiscal year. And in September, we announced an 8% increase in our quarterly dividends. We remain on path to complete our $40 billion share repurchase program by the end of this calendar year and announced a new $40 billion share repurchase program. Now a few highlights from our business in the past year. The Microsoft commercial cloud continued to gain broad based consumer and customer adoption with revenue and user growth across our services. And in response to customer demand, we introduced services and features across Office 365, Azure and Dynamics 365 in areas like security and in analytics. And our Office 365 consumer subscriber base grew to more than 23 million, with our rich office applications available across multiple platforms and multiple devices. Now let’s turn to our Windows business. This past year, we delivered Windows 10 and reinvented one of the most popular and successful operating systems. With over 400 million commercial and consumer devices upgraded to Windows 10, we opened new avenues of economic opportunity in areas like search and in gaming. And we made a commitment to search profitability and achieved that goal, being most profitable for the full fiscal year. In our gaming business, we grew our Xbox Live monthly users to 49 million. And in our devices business, we prioritized category innovation with Surface, which ended the year with more than $4 billion in revenue. Now just a few comments on our current fiscal year, first we updated key investor metrics. We added three new financial metrics to help on our financial reporting results and provide transparency into our progress against our key strategic initiatives. The new metrics are; commercial cloud gross margin percentage, total gaming revenue and Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue growth. In total, we now have 20 regularly disclosed metrics that reflect the evolution of our business and help our investor community track our performance trends. Second, we had a strong start to the year in Q1, exceeding our expectation across many of our businesses. Customers continued to adopt our commercial cloud services and we again saw increased user engagement in Windows ecosystem with key services like search and gaming. And looking ahead, our innovation roadmap and disciplined investment enable us to expand our addressable market opportunities and continue to position the company for growth. We believe the highest shareholder value is created by investing in our future, creating new scenarios that move us closer towards empowering every organization and person to achieve more. With that, please join me in welcoming our CEO, Satya Nadella. John Seethoff Thank you, Amy. Satya Nadella Thank you, Amy and thank you all for being here today and watching online. We greatly appreciate your commitment as shareholders of Microsoft. This last year has been a year of solid progress at Microsoft as well as with our customers and partners. For us, everything we do starts with our mission. Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We are a company that deeply cares about both people and the organizations people build. We think about our impact globally. In fact, my own story would not have been possible but for the democratizing force of Microsoft technology reaching me where I was growing up. But perhaps, what is most unique about our mission is our focus on our customers and our partners’ success and what they can do by building on our technology. I have had the opportunity to visit nearly 20 countries over the last year from Indonesia to Ireland, from Egypt to New Zealand. Every place I go, I see firsthand the impact we are having in large businesses with entrepreneurs, in public sector, with students and people pursuing their dreams and passions. Take Volpara, a New Zealand-based startup using our cloud to apply data and analytics to early detect breast cancer or Land O’Lakes using digital technology in Microsoft Cloud to advance sustainable agriculture in family-owned farms, or the Al Amal School in Sharjah, where I saw teachers using the familiar Office tools to provide access to education for students of all abilities. Celebrating their achievements is what really drives us. We empower people to get more out of every moment, creating, collaborating, learning and gaming and being mobile and staying secure. As I travel and talk to customers, one of the most profound changes that’s happening in the world today is that every organization is becoming a digital organization. That means that they are moving from just consuming technology to creating digital technology. At Microsoft, we enable organizations to digitally transform, to engage customers, empower employees, optimize operations, transform their products and business models, whether it’s Boeing or Rolls Royce, businesses want to empower their employees with analytical and predictive power. They want to transform their products and business models and their entire industries. At the heart of this transformation is a new technology of artificial intelligence. By 2025, our society will produce 180 zettabytes of data. In fact, we are running out of words to describe the number of bytes we are gathering. Our role is to ensure that the data is not just an exhaust, but is converted into actionable helpful insights and intelligence, as computing becomes more ubiquitous converting data into ambient intelligence that can fuel digital transformation is at the very core of our innovation agenda. The work we are doing today in AI across all our businesses positions Microsoft as a key partner to everyone wanting to harness the power of this new technology. In fact, AI is already working on your behalf to predict and automate tasks in many of the products you use today, such as handwriting recognition in Windows 10, the facial recognition in Windows Hello feature, voice recognition of Cortana, language translation in Skype and the input recognition in the SwiftKey keyboard on your iOS or Android devices. What makes our efforts unique though is how we take these AI capabilities that we built for our own first-party products and democratize the access to them to customers and partners to build solutions to the biggest challenges in healthcare, agriculture, finance, government, every sector of our economy and society. With that as the backdrop, now let me briefly expand on the progress Amy shared against our three interconnected ambitions. I will start with reinventing productivity and business process. With both Office 365 and Dynamics 365, we are helping individuals and teams manage their scarcest resource. That is time. Across devices and in organizations of all sizes, we are helping to change the nature of work. More than 85 million monthly active users of Office 365 Commercial rely on Office to get stuff done, including leading companies like Macy’s and eBay. Fortune 100 companies like energy leader, Exelon and Liberty Mutual Insurance have chosen Office 365 to help make their employees more productive and secure. Later in our demos, you will see how we are making people more productive by bringing cloud-powered intelligence to the familiar Office applications you use everyday. We also think about teams of people and what they can accomplish together. Office 365 is that universal toolkit that empowers individual teams as well as entire organizations with the broadest platform for creation, communication and collaboration in the market today. We are also removing the barriers between productivity, collaboration and business process applications. We integrated our best-in-class productivity tools with Dynamics 365 to transform how people work across finance, sales, marketing, manufacturing, customer service and positioning us to compete and grow our share in this very large market. Lastly, we have the opportunity to connect the world’s professional cloud and the world’s professional network with our pending LinkedIn acquisition. Now, let’s talk about our growth in the intelligent cloud platform. The Microsoft Cloud is winning significant customer support. Our commercial cloud annualized revenue run-rate exceeds $13 billion, and we remain on track to achieve our goal of $20 billion in fiscal ‘18. Azure revenue has grown triple-digits for the last seven consecutive quarters in constant currency and more than 60% of the Fortune 500 now have at least three of our cloud offerings. From day 1, we architected our cloud to give customers choice. Microsoft offers customers a trusted global hyperscale public cloud and true hybrid computing platform to meet their real world needs. Our high-value services enable organizations of all sizes to build their own digital capability and applications using IoT, advanced analytics, machine learning and AI. We continue to improve our global infrastructure across many dimensions and customers are experiencing the benefits. We have expanded our datacenter footprint to 38 regions across the globe. We are leading in security, privacy and compliance. Azure is the most trusted, most compliant cloud with 49 certifications, more than any other cloud provider. Our U.S. government cloud has the highest number of certifications in the industry. And the increasing richness and sophistication of our intelligence services and enabling scenarios that simply were not possible and driving new growth. Across industries, companies like Daimler Trucks, Uber, Lowe’s, are using Cortana intelligence and other Microsoft services to transform their businesses and build powerful new offerings for their customers. We are also creating new growth opportunities with a cloud that is open to all developers. It might surprise you to learn that Microsoft is one of the biggest contributors to open source today. We are bringing SQL server to Linux. We have open sourced many parts of .NET platform, which has got great amounts of activity in the open source community today. We also joined the Linux Foundation Board. Finally, we are building Azure as the world’s first AI supercomputer. Researchers at Virginia Tech are already using Azure to accelerate genome sequencing and we are just at the very beginning of the possibilities of advancements in AI and what they can bring about to customers. Now, let’s talk about how we are transforming Windows 10 in the ecosystem of devices in our pursuit of our ambition to bring about more personal computing. We continue to make progress on moving people from needing to choosing to loving Windows. We now have more than 400 million monthly active devices on Windows 10 and we are focused on offering new experiences to deepen our engagements with these users. Our focus on security has helped drive a 3x increase in Windows 10 enterprise deployments in the last 6 months, including the U.S. Department of Defense as well as Accenture. Customers experience the benefits of AI everyday with Windows 10 Cortana Search Box with over 141 million monthly active users and almost 13 billion questions asked to date. I have talked about how we can – how we are building Windows to be an operating system designed around you and your mobility, not just your device. One that pushes the boundaries on input and output modalities, enabling people to write, speak, see, touch and experience computing in new ways. With the Windows 10 creator’s update, we are empowering the creators of the world to unlock their ingenuity with new computers and new computing. With Surface Studio, we are creating a new category that transforms your desk into a creative studio. We are birthing a new medium with Windows Holographic and HoloLens, where you move from 2D to 3D, from 3D objects to holograms, and from holograms to complete mixed reality. These new experiences are generating enthusiasm for Windows 10 and the new forms of creativity and expression that it can unleash. In this holiday, you will see the widest range of Windows devices ever from our partners so you can be both creative and productive. In gaming, Xbox One has been the number one selling console in the United States for the past four months, and Xbox Live fans have enjoyed more than 20 billion hours of gameplay on Windows 10 PCs and tablets. And I am excited that we are bringing Minecraft into the classroom as a platform for learning to empower more students from all backgrounds to unleash their creativity and equip them with the skills needed to be successful in the future jobs. In closing, I want to reflect on the progress we have made in our cultural transformation over the past year. The most important job I do as CEO is to curate our culture on a daily basis. With the mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, we must strive to reflect the people we serve. That’s why diversity and inclusion is a foundation of the culture that we are building. Diversity has many dimensions and we think about it broadly, including accessibility, veterans, the representation of women and ethnic minorities, the LGBT community and many more. We took further steps this year to hold ourselves accountable, tying a portion of each of our senior leadership team members’ compensation to diversity progress, adding new training to help employees practice inclusive behavior and making advances in diverse representation in our university hiring programs. These are important steps, but we need to do more both at Microsoft and across our industry. And I have always said that each one of us shapes the culture through our mindset and our behaviors. We will continue to embrace the growth mindset and listen to learn from each other, from our customers, our partners, from the world in which we operate and to make Microsoft the place where everyone can do their best work. We will focus on designing and building products that our customers love and that are accessible to everyone and built for each of us. Beyond that, I am optimistic about our future and the role Microsoft can play in spreading economic opportunity more evenly throughout the world, helping to create a bigger, brighter future for people across the socioeconomic spectrum. When we build a culture in an organization that includes and empowers everyone, we will generate new growth and deliver long-term value to you, our shareholders. Now, I would like to invite Sean [ph] to the stage to show how our innovation comes to life in some of our new products, devices and services and then we will move to Q&A. Thank you all very much. Sean? Unidentified Company Representative Thanks Satya. Good morning, everybody. This year, we introduced two new additions to the Surface family Surface Studio and Surface Dial. Surface Studio is a beautiful 20 – has a beautiful 28-inch, higher than 4K display with 13.5 million pixels of true to life color and clarity. At just 12.5 millimeters thin, it’s a powerful and innovative device that brings a completely new experience to creators. The zero gravity hinge allows you to effortlessly turn your desk into a studio. Look at how easy this is. It has the perfect amount of resistance and I can position it with just one hand. And Surface Dial introduces a brand new type of user input that provides a truly uninterrupted experience. The Dial works contextually and in different ways with different apps. Here in Sketchable, I have imported a picture of a leaf and I can use the Dial as a palette for my pen so that I can adjust the color on the screen just by moving the Dial with my left hand. In a single stroke, you can see how truly powerful this tool is. This is Mental Canvas, a graphical design app that’s opening new opportunities for artists. Surface Studio is the perfect device for creating sketches like this 3D sketch of Grand Central Station. Surface Studio is also great for architects and engineers. In Blue Beam, I can use split screen zoom to navigate the map on the left side, zoom on the right side and edit in that particular area. Breakthroughs in interactions such as gesture, gaze, voice and pen are making computing so natural, so personal and predictive that it no longer feels like computing at all. Take, Cortana, open PowerPoint. Cortana is my personal digital assistant. She is built on Microsoft artificial intelligence and is available on over 400 million Windows 10 devices and has over 100 million monthly active users. We are also using AI to accelerate our investments in Office. I am going to show you how easy it is to create a beautiful PowerPoint presentation with just six clicks. Here is the slide with a quote from Teddy Roosevelt. When I insert a couple of images on this slide, you can see how PowerPoint uses machine learning to improve the design process and automatically chooses a variety of different layouts for me without me having to do anything. Think about what it would have taken for me to create this slide. I would have to crop photos, format text, change shapes. I really would have needed the precision of a mouse. Now anyone can use this tool to create professional looking slides with very little physical effort, something that would be great for users with mobility and vision impairments. We are focusing on accessibility and the needs of people with disabilities and have found that these features can make everyone more efficient. Last year, we showed you learning tools in OneNote, which was an add-in that helped people with learning differences like dyslexia or cognitive disabilities. Dyslexia affects 3% to 7% of the population and up to 20% of people may have some degree of symptoms. So what was once a product add-on will soon be fully built into Word to help everyone. Reading View now has a tool to sustain attention and improve reading comprehension. Separating the syllables can help with word recognition. Increasing the text spacing will shorten each line to reduce the visual crowding. Changing the page color can assist with limited visibility and where it can actually read content out loud to me to help me retain it. Now these improvements in accessibility extend to content creation and communication as well. We are extending our proofreading tools to improve the recognition of common patterns of dyslexia and phonetic misspelling. Here, the word approximately normally would have returned no suggestions, but now Word recognizes it and suggests the correct word. Here, even though the word effect is spelled correctly, it’s still identified as an error and suggests the correct word based on context. Now, some words look similar, but have different meanings and being able to see the synonyms can help choose the correct one. And if I am still unsure, being able to hear the words out loud can make a world a difference. Our goal is to help people write more clearly and effectively and use of plain language can help more writing more understandable to everyone. The phrase large in size can simply be written as large. Give consideration to is more easily read as consider. And it also suggests the use of inclusive language. So this should read as, first people with disabilities. Now these tools together really lower my anxiety about writing, allowing me to focus more on my ideas than misusing the words. Now, I would like to introduce you to one of our experts in accessibility, Anne Taylor. Good morning Anne. How are you? Anne Taylor Good morning, Sean. Good morning, everybody. In my role as a Senior Supportability Program Manager, I work closely with the various engineering teams across our company to help ensure that our products and services that we deliver are accessible to people with disabilities. Today, I would like to demonstrate to you how I stay productive using our own platform. Now since I am blind, I use screen reading technologies to access information on my PC. I am using Narrator today. What’s narrator, well, I am glad you asked. Narrator is the screen access program included in Windows 10 that will read content allowed to me. And here is how it sounds like. Well, I listen to the speech at a higher rate, so I will slow it down for our today’s demo. By the way, Narrator and Windows are not the only areas of investment in accessibility at Microsoft. We invest in accessibility to improve our products and services across platforms and across devices. Next, I would like to show you how the works that we have done to improve accessibility in Office empower me to stay engaged with my colleagues every day. Here, I have a Microsoft Word document open. I will use Narrator to read the content. I not only hear the content, but I also heard that someone has commented on this text. I want to know what was the comment, basically who said what. So, what I will do here is I will do Alt R, I press N. Now, Ken has a comment for me. Let’s find out what he says. Anne, can we use this phrasing? Anne, can we use this phrasing? Well, absolutely Ken, if that’s what you want to use. I am cool with it. So, I am now going to do Shift F10, arrow down, Reply, Type okay, I just replied to Ken’s comment. This is one of many examples of the work that we have done in accessibility areas. And there is still more to do. Our customers are counting on us. And as we pursue accessibility as one of the major priorities, we will keep delivering relevant, impactful technologies like this one, technologies that will empower people with disabilities to do more, to achieve more and to be independent. By the way, did you like those keyboard shortcuts? If you do, you can use it. If you don’t have, you mouse handy. At this point, I would like to turn the podium back to my colleague. And I thank you very much for listening. Sean? It’s all yours. Unidentified Company Representative Thanks, Anne. Thank you. So, accessibility is a priority as Anne just showed you. She was using Word and that’s just one of the many Microsoft apps that we are continuing to build accessibility on a cross-platform. Our goal at Microsoft is to deliver consistent experiences that extend to whatever device you happen to be using. We are driven by the mobility of the experience, not the device. Every app on my screen here was made by Microsoft and some of these are also available on Android and Windows. I have got my personal digital assistant, Cortana, the best of communications with Skype, and all the Office productivity applications. I have Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and I have one note at the bottom, because that’s my personal favorite. But the app that I use most on my phone is Outlook. I use it all the time. It drives my productivity throughout the day and it keeps me connected no matter where I am. And we find that users actually spend on average about 24 seconds inside Outlook on a mobile device, and our goal is to make those 24 seconds as productive as possible and it does that in a few different ways. For one, it actually consolidates all of my inboxes in one place, so I can access messages from different e-mail addresses at anytime. And we all use e-mail differently, so I love that Outlook personalizes the experience to me. I can set it, so that when I swipe in one direction, it deletes the message. And when I swipe in the other, it marks the messages unread so that I can go back and read it thoroughly from any device. It uses visual cues to communicate information like this flight confirmation, this coffee chat invite or this flag message for follow-up. I can even check in or RSVP directly from my inbox. Outlook intelligently prioritizes my inbox by looking at the content or people that I interact with most often, allowing me to focus on my most important messages in my focused inbox. Less important messages are still easily accessible, but are simply out of the way. For me, e-mail is extremely important, but it’s my calendar that really keeps me on task. And we have done some incredible work in the calendar app, which has made it more visual and connected than ever before. Like my e-mail, my calendar pulls in from multiple sources like Wunderlist from my sports team, like the Rutgers Scarlet Knights or from Facebook. Events now automatically get icons that associate with the type of meeting. So at a glance, I get a visual identifier of what that meeting will be, whether it’s in the gym, coffee, going to get lunch. As I type out the name of this new meeting, you can see that the icon changes depending on the context. Now, not only is it great at scheduling appointments for myself, but Outlook also does a great job of taking into account my coworker’s availability. So, when I go to schedule a meeting, I can be sure to pick a time, 2:30 works for everybody. Now, Outlook uses AI to help me manage my inbox. But now let me show you how we are bringing AI to photography. Microsoft Pix is an intelligent camera app that automatically optimizes settings, so that anyone can take better photos, especially of people. Let’s be honest. It’s hard to capture the perfect picture, right? Sometimes people’s eyes are closed. They are moving or the lighting isn’t right. Pix works to capture a burst of photos both before and after I press the shutter button and then uses all the data from those photos to give you one perfect shot. Let me show you an example. Here is a picture that I took – well, here’s a picture that [indiscernible] took of me earlier today. And when I hold down the compare button, you can see the image that he actually captured where my eyes were closed. That’s what he captured at the moment he hit the button. This is the picture that Pix generated using AI and taking all the data from those photos. Pix can also sense motion and it creates short looping video clips called Live Images when it recognizes interesting movement. Here is a picture from Thanksgiving when my aunt was making gravy on the stove. You can see the steam moving on top of the pot. Pix, allows me to enjoy the moment instead of struggling to capture it. And since I have my photos automatically backed up to OneDrive, I can access all of them from any device. Everyone gets 5 gigabytes of cloud storage when they create a Microsoft account. But with an Office 365 subscription, this increases to 1 terabyte. That’s 1,000 gigabytes. You can think about that as 300,000 pictures or 1 million documents. Now, let’s shift gears for a moment here and talk about something that’s been really exciting in stores. A little over 2 years ago, we acquired Mojang Studios, the makers of Minecraft. Minecraft is a game that is loved all around the world by people of all different ages. It provides an immersive experience that allows for learning and adventure in a 3D world. Since joining Microsoft, Minecraft has grown to new heights. In just the last 2 years, Minecraft sales have doubled. Over 100 million copies have been sold, and over 40 million people worldwide are using it every month. It’s added millions of new members to the Xbox LIVE ecosystem and over 50 billion views of Minecraft content have occurred online in just the past year. As we look to engage with fans in all the ways that we can, we recently launched Minecraft: Education Edition, which is the collaborative and versatile platform for learning. Teachers can use Minecraft across subjects to encourage 24th Century skills, like creativity, problem-solving and computational thinking. The game has become a true cultural phenomenon and is only continuing to grow. We have recently added VR, artificial intelligence applications, Hour of Code tutorials, and we are just getting started. And I have shown you a few of the ways that we have innovated in 2016. We have talked about new products, artificial intelligence, accessibility, cross-platform experiences and Minecraft. And we are really excited about gaming at Microsoft and we haven’t forgotten about our hardcore gamers. It’s been a great year for gaming with the release of Xbox One S. I am going to leave you all with a video to show you a little more. Thanks for your time and enjoy the rest of the meeting. [Video Presentation] Chris Suh Good morning. My name is Chris Suh. I am the Head of Investor Relations for Microsoft. I hope you enjoyed seeing a glimpse of the exciting new products and services we are bringing to our customers around the world. We are now going to move to the question-and-answer portion of today’s meeting. I would like to invite our speakers back on the stage to join me for the Q&A. I would also like to introduce Brad Smith, our – Microsoft’s President and Chief Legal Officer. Across the room, we have set up four microphone stand stations. If you would like to ask a question, we please ask that you make your way to one of the mics. Also, I have members of the IR team. Please raise your hands, who are in each of the stations, who can assist or answer any questions you may have. Question-and-Answer Session A - Chris Suh Okay. While we set up and make our way to the mics, I am going to start actually with the first question that was submitted from our virtual shareholder meeting. So the first question is around our cloud progress, so Microsoft seems to have made great progress in the cloud this year and moved to the cloud computing, can you tell me a little more about the progress and in particular, how do you feel about your competitive positioning? Satya Nadella Yes. Overall, I feel very good about both the progress and the long-term technology architecture path we have chosen and what that translates into it, which is in terms of our product differentiation and competitive differentiation. If you look at it, we are not building one cloud service. We are building a complete digital transformation cloud platform for our customers which has infrastructure elements, which has the application or SaaS services elements as well as client devices. In fact, one of the most used cloud service that we have is of the Windows Update cloud service. And now of course, we are adding even Advanced Threat Protection and security to it. But at the core of our cloud momentum is growth in Azure as the true hybrid cloud platform because we don’t think of our service as legacy, in fact we think of them as the edge of our cloud, whether it’s Windows Server or to our SQL Server. One of the other exciting areas of progress in the last year has been the application platform both on top of Azure and Office 365. So if you are using something like Power Apps, you can start building rapidly applications as a customer. Office 365 itself is something that we have grown our new capabilities like voice, the new Microsoft Teams product. We are very excited about what that does for our customers. And perhaps, the biggest change in the last year has been Dynamics 365. I mean it completely changes the game I believe in business applications. It’s more modular. It’s more modern. It’s more price competitive. It speaks to the needs of customers going forward. So the combination of Azure, Office 365, Dynamics 365 is pretty unparalleled when you look at it based on our competition and what customers want. Chris Suh Great. Thank you, Satya. Okay. Let’s start with microphone #1, please. Ken Copley Thank you. And to think of it, I could have stayed home today and had a root canal, I wouldn’t miss this for anything. Anyways, my name is Ken Copley, Capital Executive. I have been a shareholder since 1991. First of all, I would like to congratulate and commend you on your job that you have done, the entire Microsoft team, just a great job. To frame my argument, let me just pose it, the Microsoft, the business model is software and hardware development and the segments of market that we are serving is the enterprise and the consumer. We have already established a strategic goal of every person and every organization loves using a Microsoft product or service. This is a tough goal to accomplish when we occasionally create frustration in our users. Let’s look at Bill Belichick for example, I can’t think for a better ambassador for Microsoft, he is a user with demanding expectations and to many, many people, he personifies excellence. We want to develop a market, one way not to do it is to get the user to destroy a very important product on TV out of sheer frustration and we can issue a press release and stand behind the product and it’s a good product, I am using it right now. But the damage has been done to the Microsoft brand, let’s learn from the frustration of users like Bill Belichick, let’s parse the complaint and let’s figure out what he is really trying to say. In this case, he identified certain relationships that are critical in really creating a satisfying user experience. We have to accept responsibility for building the Microsoft brand and protecting it. We must assume greater relationship control in the critical services necessary to create genuine customer satisfaction. We can do that through an acquisition strategy. I know you guys have already got one. You practice it a lot. But the objective is to achieve organizational control. We can achieve organizational control by a, maybe buying just 51% of the organization or even less, if we develop shareholder alliances. Let’s look at the LinkedIn acquisition, you bought it 100% of it for $26 billion, great acquisition. But what are we really buying on that, we are buying the people, we are buying the intellectual capital of an organization. In this case, it includes Reid Hoffman and Jeff Weiner. We are talking about letting that operate as an independent organization, yet we roll it into the bureaucracy of Microsoft. And I don’t mean that negatively, all organizations have a bureaucracy. However, there is an alternative structure to making these types of acquisitions, one that would conserve a precious resource, in other words, our investment capital. It will achieve organizational control, but it will maintain an independent equity float of the target organization. If we do that, we can leverage the structural benefits of an acquisition like this. For example, we can create ownership incentives throughout the organization – I am making a presentation. Hey, it’s okay. I hope its okay. Anyway... Chris Suh Yes, if you do you have a question, Mr. Copley. Ken Copley Can I finish this or is it too time consuming or what? Chris Suh I think I would respect the time for other questioners, but it will be great if you get to your question. Ken Copley Okay. Well, here it is, we got $143 billion in investment capital within the organization. 84% of it is in cash U.S. securities. In my opinion, the portfolio is structured as if it were an organization and retirement. I can understand the human element of retirement planning, but my goodness gracious, why not put it to use, why not imagine the organization as a 20-year old, but with the collective wisdom of humanity. And if we do that, we could get into and make equity investments in organization and I am not talking about Empire Building or anything like, I am talking about developing deep strategic operating relationships with organizations so that we can build, but in time constraints, I will shorten this and I will just step back and I will say, can we consider other uses with the portfolio? Brad Smith I will say, before turning to Satya, someone who has lived here for 20 years, that is the most passionate statement I have ever heard in Greater Seattle on behalf of New England Patriots. But I think there was a question there. I would say a couple of things. One is, as far as your comments around quality and making sure, for example, in the case of the use of Surface in NFL, one of the big variables is in fact the Wi-Fi connectivity on the sidelines. And so for example, thinking about quality, not just of the device, but the end to end system, which has many, many variables. This is a very, very good point and that I think is capacity that we need to keep building, we need to take ownership, take responsibility for it. That’s well said. And I thought I will forget all the other comments you had. But quality is something we definitely are on a completely different frontier in terms of how the frequency, with which we are upgrading and updating and adding capability, but that doesn’t mean that the quality can regress. We are learning, improving and getting much better at it. And so keep pushing us. My inbox is always available to anyone of you. If you have any issues with Microsoft products and we will – you will have our commitment to keep getting better. Amy Hood And maybe I will just briefly talk about how we think about different structures in order to gain both alliances, as you have discussed, but also continue to further help customers is really the focus we have and so whether its acquisitions, in their completeness like LinkedIn or the 17 others that we completed last year, or whether it’s taking small stakes and making investments. We have actually started an MS Ventures fund, which has been really a terrific asset to us to build great connections globally to the start-up community is another terrific use of that capital base. We have done some really large alliances that take advantage of our capital structure, including being able to do big and ambitious projects with companies like Adobe or SAP to build on our cloud. And so I think obviously, we are open to anything that furthers our ability to achieve our mission, including, of course using the balance sheet to execute on that. Chris Suh Thank you. Let’s move to mic #2, please. Karen Prince Thank you. Let’s see, what was my question, no, who am I, I am Karen Prince, I live in Kenmore and I am happy to be a Microsoft shareholder with my husband. My question is, I need help, we had Windows 7 and now we have Windows 10, it was upgraded, I do not understand how the photos work and do you have a program tutoring where somebody can come help me in my home or somewhere, I just – I am completely – I don’t know what has happened to my photos, they used to be in one place and now – so I need help, that’s it? Satya Nadella Absolutely, in fact right here, I think there are folks from our store are here and they should reach out to you and make sure we book an appointment and really help you sort of understand Windows 10 and the migration from Windows 7 to Windows 10. And also the new capabilities, we hope you will get to use a lot of the new capabilities of Windows 10 and the cloud services that go behind it, for example, photos. And hopefully, you will get to enjoy that and without the pain of having to learn a lot of new things. Karen Prince",

      "text": "“Halo 5” Becomes An E-Sports Reality TV Series By - Wednesday, November 30th 2016 5:36 pm \nMicrosoft Studios’ 343 Industries, current developer of the “Halo” video game series, has done a deal with Pilgrim Media Group to develop a reality-competition eSports TV series based on the property. \nSpecifically the most recent title, “Halo 5: Guardians,” will serve as the basis for the project which is still in very early stages with no TV or digital distribution deals for the series at this point let alone a potential premiere date. \nThe “Halo” franchise has generated more than $5 billion in worldwide sales to date. Esports meanwhile is fast growing and will generate $493 million in revenue for this year, a figure expected to more than double in the next three years.",

      "text": "Microsoft Surface Studio Teardown Reveals It's 'Full Of Hot Air' And You Can Easily Upgrade Its Storage 30 November 2016, 10:45 am EST By Anu Passary Tech Times 3D Printing Technology And 3D Printers - How They Are Changing The World Now Playing A teardown from iFixit reveals that the all-in-one Surface Studio PC from Microsoft may not have memory that can be upgraded, but its on-board storage can be increased. The Surface Studio received a repairability score of 5 out of 10 from iFixit. ( iFixit ) Advertisement \nMicrosoft has started shipping its all-in-one PC targeted at creative users and even as the Surface Studio begins making its way to a lucky few, the folks at iFixit have taken apart the device and reveal that its disk is upgradable. \nThe iFixit team, true to its style, picked apart the Surface Studio from Microsoft and revealed that the PC generates a lot of heat, which is why the device packs in several vents. \n\"The Surface Studio is just full of hot air. Literally. And Microsoft had to pipe that air out somewhere. The Studio features acres of air vents, a beefy heat sink, and two fans-one each for the CPU and GPU. Plus, the power supply has its own internal fan. It looks like Microsoft is getting quite a bit cooler than its late 2000s \"I'm a PC\" reputation,\" notes the iFixit team in a blog post. \nThe team disclosed that the Surface Studio has plenty of soldered-down parts, as well as a custom motherboard. Microsoft has obviously designed the PC keeping the fact that in mind that it is not serviceable by the end-user. As a result, the Surface Studio's CPU and RAM are all soldered to the motherboard. \nSo basically, if one buys the base model with 8 GB of RAM, rest assured he will not be able to upgrade the same. However, even though the memory cannot be bumped up one could increase the disk size, one can add a bigger disk as the storage is upgradable. Upgradable Storage \nThe Surface Studio, as revealed by the teardown, apparently uses a hybrid storage system. It deploys an SSD in conjunction with a bigger spinning disk instead of using a hybrid drive that is integrated. \nThe device packs in a standard SanDisk 64GB Z400s M.2 SSD along with the standard SATA hard drive. Both of these are replaceable. \n\"If you happen to have a couple flash storage modules and a hot air rework station lying around, the SSD controller should happily take up to four NAND flash devices,\" notes the iFixit team. \nSo thanks to the presence of two empty solder pads on the Surface Studio (two of the four slots have 32 GB chips each), one can upgrade the storage of the PC easily. How Did The Surface Studio Score In Reparability? \nThe Surface Studio garnered a score of 5 out of 10 in repairability. This score is not bad considering the Microsoft Surface Book and 15-inch MacBook Pro Touch Bar 2016 received a 1 out of 10!  ",

      "text": "  21:02 PM EST Microsoft holds annual shareholder meeting \nREDMOND, Wash. , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Speaking to shareholders at Microsoft Corp.'s annual meeting on Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella highlighted how digital technology is transforming people and organizations across the world, and the opportunity for Microsoft. \n\"Digital technology is impacting and transforming every human endeavor in every industry,\" Nadella said. \"Microsoft empowers our customers who want to harness new technology, like artificial intelligence, to transform their organizations and find solutions to the biggest challenges in healthcare, agriculture, finance, government — every sector.\" \nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood reported that Microsoft executed well in fiscal year 2016 and reported a strong start to the current fiscal year. Hood noted that Microsoft's innovation road map and disciplined investment expand addressable market opportunities and position the company for growth — an investment in the future that will deliver value for shareholders. \nThe following proposals were acted on by the company's shareholders at the meeting: Re-elected all 11 directors to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders. All director nominees received a vote of 98 percent of votes cast. Approved, on a nonbinding advisory basis, the fiscal year 2016 compensation of the company's named executive officers. The advisory measure received 95 percent of votes cast.

Approved a French Sub Plan under the 2001 Stock Plan, with a vote of 96 percent of votes cast.

      "text": "November 30, 2016 9:03pm Comments Share: \nREDMOND, Wash. , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Speaking to shareholders at Microsoft Corp.'s annual meeting on Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella highlighted how digital technology is transforming people and organizations across the world, and the opportunity for Microsoft. \n\"Digital technology is impacting and transforming every human endeavor in every industry,\" Nadella said. \"Microsoft empowers our customers who want to harness new technology, like artificial intelligence, to transform their organizations and find solutions to the biggest challenges in healthcare, agriculture, finance, government — every sector.\" \nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood reported that Microsoft executed well in fiscal year 2016 and reported a strong start to the current fiscal year. Hood noted that Microsoft's innovation road map and disciplined investment expand addressable market opportunities and position the company for growth — an investment in the future that will deliver value for shareholders. \nThe following proposals were acted on by the company's shareholders at the meeting: Re-elected all 11 directors to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders. All director nominees received a vote of 98 percent of votes cast. Approved, on a nonbinding advisory basis, the fiscal year 2016 compensation of the company's named executive officers. The advisory measure received 95 percent of votes cast. Ratified the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the company's independent auditor for fiscal year 2017, with a vote of 98 percent of votes cast. Approved an amendment to Microsoft's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, with a vote of 99 percent of votes cast. Approved a French Sub Plan under the 2001 Stock Plan, with a vote of 96 percent of votes cast. Rejected a shareholder proposal to make amendments to the current Proxy Access for Director Nominations bylaw; the proposal received approximately 26 percent of votes cast. \nMicrosoft's board of directors consists of John W. Thompson , Microsoft independent chairman; William H. Gates , Microsoft founder and technology advisor; Teri List-Stoll , former executive vice president and chief financial officer of DICK'S Sporting Goods Inc.; G. Mason Morfit , president, ValueAct Capital; Satya Nadella , chief executive officer, Microsoft; Charles H. Noski , former vice chairman of Bank of America Corp.; Dr. Helmut Panke , former chairman of the board of management, BMW AG; Sandra E. Peterson , group worldwide chairman, Johnson & Johnson; Charles W. Scharf , chief executive officer, Visa Inc.; John W. Stanton , chairman, Trilogy Equity Partners; and Padmasree Warrior , chief development officer and U.S. chief executive officer, NextEV. Nine of the 11 board members are independent of Microsoft, which is consistent with the requirement in the company's governance guidelines that a substantial majority be independent. \nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. \nNote to editors: For more information, news and perspectives from Microsoft, please visit the Microsoft News Center at http://news.microsoft.com .

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows Surface Cell Pro, Bigger HD Screen, Apps Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows Surface Cell Pro, Bigger HD Screen, Apps \nThere’s been a lot of information being said about Microsoft’s latest Surface Phone \nProtos Display Size, processor, RAM, OS emerge from our sources. A bit of information about the latest Surface Phone photos emerge from our trusted sources yet again. There are more than one Surface Phone protos in testing at Microsoft and here is what we have learned, \nSurface Phone Specs & features: The protos that we have information about run Snapdragon 835 and support Quick charging 4.0 Windows 10 Mobile architecture on them is already 64-Bit and one of them has 6 GB RAM What is most interesting is the information that the one proto with 6 GB RAM can already run X86 apps in Continuum. We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps. The earlier reported Laptop Accessory is still a thing and we hear Microsoft is seriously purusing the 3-in-1 form factor. One of the Protos is said to have 4 GB RAM and still runs Snapdragon 835. It does have 64-Bit Windows 10 Mobile version but can’t run X86 apps in Continuum. That may be just a version thing or Microsoft may be planing one consumer and one enterprise-oriented Surface Phone variant. Display-size wise we hear both are said to have a 5.5-inch, QHD display, but this is just a guess having a look at the display and not actual measurement. \nRedstone 3 and Release Date: Protos of-course run a Windows 10 Mobile version from different branch. Redstone 3 will be relatively much bigger update than Redstone 2. For Redstone 3 development cycle Windows team is prioritizing Mobile as Windows 10 development target. Our sources have confirmed that Surface Phone launch is delayed now to late 2017. It will now come running Windows 10 Mobile focused Redstone 3 out of the box. \nThis info comes from one of our trusted sources with good accuracy. But Companies have been known to launch different configurations than seen on protos in retail products. Also features vary with OS versions and final release OS version may or may not have all the features seen in protos.",

But Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio , but new devices won’t ship until 2017. \nIf you’re shelling out $3000 or more for a new computer, you’re going to want to receive some pretty good customer service if something happens to goes wrong — and that’s exactly what Microsoft is hoping to deliver to Surface Studio owners with its new support hotline. \nCustomers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems. \nSo why are we only finding out about the new support platform now? Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

      "text": "Home Business Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Finding Microsoft Sales Following Holidays Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Finding Microsoft Sales Following Holidays Jennifer Hong Nov 30, 2016 Business Comments Off on Windows Surface Phone, Shoppers Finding Microsoft Sales Following Holidays 2 \nShoppers are still finding deals after Cyber Monday as they browse ads at Amazon.com and other online retail outlets. Far more Americans shopped online than in stores over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend. \nA survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that some 122 million Americans will shop online on Cyber Monday. That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy” button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

      "text": "Home Technology Windows Surface Phone, Snapdragon 835, Microsoft Quad HD Display Windows Surface Phone, Snapdragon 835, Microsoft Quad HD Display 2 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Windows Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Windows Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "Home Technology Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows 10 To Drop ‘Lumia’ To Compete With iPhone, Samsung Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows 10 To Drop ‘Lumia’ To Compete With iPhone, Samsung 1 \nMicrosoft has always treated its Windows Phone with many surprises, but now news has surfaced that points to rumors that the company itself is now planning to eliminate some devices with the official retirement of the Lumia lineup. \nWe recently reported news about the HP Elite X3, and users say it’s the best Windows phone to date, and not even a Lumia can match its performance. It’s kind of ironic that the number one Windows phone is not manufactured by Microsoft, but Redmond itself said on several occasions that it plans to work with partners on building “great devices.” \nBut despite the HP Elite X3 being a hardware monster, the software side of the device is simply dragging it down, and I’m saying this as a big fan of Windows phones. It’s nearly impossible to come from Android or iOS and be happy with Windows phones (although I’ve personally seen people doing this, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand), and there are three main reasons for this. \nSpoiler alert: Windows phone fans aren’t going to like this, but as always, head to the comment section if you think I’m wrong. I’m preparing my argument bag as we speak, so let’s have a conversation. \nNews of Buggy operating system \nWindows 10 Mobile phone has improved a lot since the first preview builds were released a long time ago, but after using it for so long on the Lumia 950 XL and then on the HP Elite X3, it’s more than obvious that it still has a long way to go before it becomes a strong rival to Android and iOS. \nBugs are still there, and it goes without saying that these easily ruin the experience with a powerful phone like the HP Elite X3. The “Resuming” bug is still there, and so are crashes that occur every once in a while when using various apps.",

      "text": "Windows Azure Storage Abstractions and their Scalability Targets –Microsoft \nA URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a sequence of characters that identifies a logical or physical resource. Universal Resource Identifiers are specified in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFC) 3986 and are summarized and extended in documentation for the W3C’s Web Architecture. According to the specifications, a resource can be anything that might be identified with an alphanumeric character string, and resources do not have to be accessible on the Internet. Examples of resources include electronic documents, elevator door sensors, XML namespaces , web pages and ID microchips for pets.

You also agree that your personal information may be transferred and processed in the United States, and that you have read and agree to the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy . \nThere are two types of URIs, Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URLs ) and Uniform Resource Names ( URNs ). Uniform Resource Locator (URL) – this type of URI begins by stating which protocol should be used to locate and access the physical or logical resource on a network. If the resource is a web page, for example, the URI will begin with the protocol HTTP. If the resource is a file, the URI will begin with the protocol FTP or if the resource is an email address, the URI will begin with the protocol mailto. It is important to remember that URLs are not persistent. This means that if the resource’s location changes, the URL also needs to change to point to the resource’s new location. Uniform Resource Locators are specified in the Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 1738. Uniform Resource Name (URN) – this type of URI does not state which protocol should be used to locate and access the resource; it simply labels the resource with a persistent, location-independent unique identifier . A URN will identify the resource throughout its lifecycle and will never change. Each URN has three components: the label “urn,” a colon and a character string that serves as a unique identifier. URNs are specified in the Internet Engineering Task Force RFC 2141. Every URL is also a URI, but not vice versa. \nURI Syntax The generic form of any URI is scheme:[//[user:password@]host[:port]][/]path[?query][#fragment] \nScheme: The scheme lays out the concrete syntax and any associated protocols for the URI. Schemes are case-insensitive and are followed by a colon. Ideally, URI schemes should be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), although nonregistered schemes can also be used. \nWhile the two slashes shown in the example above are required by some schemes, they are not required by all schemes, including authority components, which are described below. \nAuthority component: An authority component is made up of multiple parts: an optional authentication section, a host -- consisting of either a registered name or an IP address -- and an optional port number. The authentication section contains the username and password, which are separated by a colon and followed by the symbol for at (@). After the @ comes the hostname, which is in turn followed by a colon and then a port number. It is important to note that IPv4 addresses must be in dot-decimal notation, and IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in brackets. \nThe path, which contains data, is notated by a sequence of segments separated by slashes. The path must begin with a single slash if an authority part was present. It may also begin with a single slash even if there is no authority part, but it cannot begin with a double slash. Keep in mind that while this part of the syntax may closely resemble a particular file path, it does not always imply a relation to that file system path. \nQuery (optional): The query contains a string of nonhierarchical data. Although the syntax is not well-defined, it is most often a sequence of attribute value pairs separated by a delimiter, such as an ampersand or a semicolon. The query is separated from the preceding part by a question mark. \nFragment (optional): The fragment contains a fragment identifier that provides direction to a secondary resource. For example, if the primary resource is an HTML document, the fragment is often an ID attribute of a specific element of that document. If the fragment identifies a certain section of an article identified by the rest of the URI, a Web browser will scroll this particular element into view. The fragment is separated from the preceding part by a hash (#). URI resolution and references \nURI resolution is one of a few common operations performed on URIs that are also URLs. It involves determining the proper data access method and parameters needed to locate and retrieve the resource that the URI points to. \nA URI-reference is used to determine common usage for a URI. A URI reference may take the form of a full URI, a specific portion of a full URI or an empty string. If there is a fragment identifier, it will identify some portion of the resource referred to by the rest of the URI. \nA URI-reference can be a URI, but it can also be what is known as a relative reference. A URI is a relative reference if the URI-reference's prefix does not match the syntax of a scheme followed by its colon separator. In order to determine what components are present and whether the reference is relative, each of the five URI components are parsed for its subparts and their validation.

      "title": "CEO Nadella to Microsoft Shareholders: Not stepping away from mobile devices | Nokiapoweruser",
      "text": "December 1, 2016 0 At Microsoft’s annual meeting, shareholders raised some tough questions on Microsoft’s Mobile strategy under Satya Nadella. The CEO was asked to explain his future vision for mobile. He was also asked to explain why iOS and Android have Microsoft apps or apps’ features, which Windows Phone or Windows 10 Mobile doesn’t. Some of these shareholders are dedicated owners of Windows Phone and ill-fated Microsoft band devices. Satya Nadella’s reply was reassuring and on similar lines to what he has conveyed so far in his past interviews. While emphasizing that Microsoft is not stepping away from mobile devices, he reiterated focus on points of differentiation like “Continuum”. Nadella answered, “We think about mobility broadly. In other words, we think about the mobility of the human being across all of the devices, not just the mobility of a single device.”HP Elite x3 “That said, we’re not stepping away or back from our focus on our mobile devices,” Nadella said. “What we are going to do is focus that effort on places where we have differentiation. If you take Windows Phone, where we are differentiated on Windows Phone is on manageability. It’s security, it’s Continuum capability — that is, the ability to have a phone that can act like a PC. So we’re going to double-down on those points of differentiation.” He cited the HP Elite x3 device as an example of a Windows 10 phone that follows this strategy. “We will keep looking at different forms and different functions that we can bring to mobile devices, while also supporting our software across a variety of devices,” Nadella said. “So that’s the approach you will see us take. We are not stepping away from supporting our Windows Phone users. But at the same time we are recognizing that there are other platforms in mobile that have higher share, and we want to make sure that our software is available to them.” As mentioned earlier, this is not the first time however that Nadella has talked about bringing something category-defining even alluring to an “ultimate mobile device”. In a previous Interview he talked about creating Phone Categories with “some new form, new function, new value added”. We recently reported exclusive details including some specs and features of Microsoft’s upcoming flagship Surface Phone.

      "title": "CERT Disputes Microsoft on Windows 10 Security Without EMET",
      "text": "By Kurt Mackie 11/30/2016 \nSoftware security research organization CERT is disputing Microsoft's recent claim that Windows 10 has good enough security protections without using the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET). \nMicrosoft had announced earlier this month that it plans to deprecate its own EMET solution , a free software tool that works generally to ward off common software exploit attacks for Windows systems. EMET provides system-wide protections, as well as application-specific protections. It was first developed as project at Microsoft, but it later became a full-fledged Microsoft-supported tool. It's currently at version 5.5 . \nEMET will hit its product end-of-support phase on July 31, 2018. Microsoft indicated that EMET is being discontinued because it just wasn't up to the task of halting \"zero-day\" attacks, or attacks carried out on software flaws that are not understood by software publishers. Instead, Microsoft suggested that Windows 10 had some of EMET's capabilities built into the operating system, and organizations should move to using it, although some of those protections require using the Enterprise or Education editions of Windows 10. \nCERT mostly contradicted Microsoft's Windows 10 security claims this month. \"Windows 10 does not provide the additional protections that EMET does,\" the organization flatly stated in a Nov. 21 blog post . \nThe well-known research organization, which works with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and industry organizations to address software security issues, published the following table, which shows the protections afforded for Windows systems, both with and without EMET: [Click on image for larger view.] Security protections with and without EMET. Source: November CERT blog post . \nSpecifically, EMET has security benefits for organizations because it adds protections against application-specific exploits, CERT argued. \nWindows 10 version 1607, released this week for business use, does have some application protections, but not as many as EMET. The application protections in Windows 10 include Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Structured Exception Handler Overwrite Protection (SEHOP), Mandatory Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Bottom-Up Randomization (BottomupASLR), according to CERT's announcement. However, CERT's post noted that organizations have to make Group Policy changes to enable those Windows 10 application protections. \n\"Setting these application-specific mitigations requires calculating and setting a bit field value in the Windows registry for each process name that you would like to protect,\" CERT noted. \"Please see Override Process Mitigation Options to help enforce app-related security policies for more details.\" \nIn essence, organizations running Windows 10 will still need to use EMET, according to CERT. \n\"Microsoft strongly implies that if you are running Windows 10, there is no need for EMET anymore,\" the CERT blog stated. \"This implication is not true. The reason it's not true is that Windows 10 does not provide the application-specific mitigations that EMET does.\" \nEMET's end-of-support in 2018 implies that organizations have a timeline to ensure that the shields are up for the applications they use. CERT recommended that organizations should \"investigate all of the software that is currently outside of the support window before July 31, 2018.\" \nEMET's end will happen 1.5 years before the end of Windows 7 Service Pack 1. The end of \"extended support\" for Windows 7 SP1 is set to occur on Jan. 14, 2020. Consequently, EMET's early end might persuade some organizations to move to Windows 10 sooner than they might have planned. \nSo far, Microsoft has offered no response to CERT's claims about Windows 10 protections being inadequate without EMET. While many software security vendors raise alarming claims about Windows security on a regular basis, CERT is a division of the Software Engineering Institute, part of Carnegie Mellon University. It doesn't tend to ring the bell except when there's broad agreement on security issues. \nMicrosoft, though, appears to be sticking with its original EMET deprecation announcement, and offered no comment on CERT's claims when contacted on Wednesday.

      "text": "11/30/2016 \nMicrosoft added Office 365 end user feature improvements this month for desktop, browser and mobile apps. \nSome of the improvements are yet to come or are just available this month to \"first release\" Office Insider Program testers. Most of them, though, are available with the November update, which will roll out to Office 365 subscribers at various intervals. Microsoft doesn't specify the dates when Office 365 updates appear, as explained in this support document . \nIn general, Microsoft updated PowerPoint's and Outlook's collaboration capabilities. It also made it easier for users to get notified when documents get shared, among other improvements described in its announcement this week . The features are demonstrated in this Microsoft Mechanics presentation . \nPerhaps the highlight of this month's release is that PowerPoint now supports \"real-time\" coauthoring, where a shared presentation document can be edited by different users simultaneously. Microsoft Word already has this capability. The PowerPoint coauthoring capability is available now for Windows tablet users of the PowerPoint Mobile application. Windows desktop users can get a preview of it today if they are part of the Office Insider beta-testing program. \nThe November update is also bringing an easier way to transform a traditional attached document in an Outlook e-mail into a sharable document that's accessible from a cloud-based storage service. It still takes some steps to make that happen, though. The attachment needs to be uploaded to a OneDrive account or an Office 365 Group document library. Next, the user needs to \"specify sharing permissions for the email recipients.\" This shared document capability is available now for all Office 365 subscribers using the Windows desktop version of the Outlook application. It's also available now for users of the Outlook on the Web application, which is the one that runs in a browser. \nExcel, PowerPoint and Word now have a \"Shared with Me\" tab that will show the documents that other users have shared. It's available for Android, iOS, Mac and Windows users. It's still to come for the Windows Mobile platform. \nAlso added to Excel, PowerPoint and Word is a new \"Recent Folders\" list. It shows up under the \"Recent\" tab in those applications. However, this feature is just available now to Office Insider testers. \nMicrosoft has introduced a test version of document-sharing notifications in Excel, Word and PowerPoint, which alerts end users when document changes are made or when documents get shared. The feature's availability and capabilities vary. Android and Windows Mobile consumer users have access to it today if they are Office Insider participants. It'll be arriving next month for consumer iOS users, Microsoft promised. Business users won't see it this month, but it'll be available \"in the coming months\" on all mobile platforms, Microsoft indicated. \nOffice 365 business subscribers using the \"current channel\" or \"deferred channel\" to receive Office 365 updates can designate some users as part of the \"first release\" distribution cycle if they want to get early access to features at the beta-test level. The \"channels\" term is lingo that Microsoft adopted back in February to describe its various Office 365 releases.  ",

      "title": "Windows Containers Compared: WinDocks vs. Microsoft Cloud",
      "text": "WinDocks is an independent port of Docker’s open source to Windows. As a group of former Microsoft engineers we work to enhance the work of software developers, and released the industry’s first port of Docker’s open source for Windows in March of 2016. We’ve since fostered a technical community based on a free Community Edition.\nNow that Microsoft has released Windows Server 2016 with container support, many have asked for a detailed review of the differences between WinDocks and Microsoft’s implementation. The following observations are based on a public presentation by Microsoft to a group of SQL Server professionals, and through testing Microsoft’s containers on Windows Server 2016.\nContainers for Dev and Test Windows containers deliver similar benefits as on Linux, so we expect Windows containers to become the preferred infrastructure for support of Development, Test, and QA. In the near future, containers should lead to growth in Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps.\nWinDocks containers provide speed and efficiency, with each developer using isolated container environments on a shared VM, each instantiated in seconds. The average development team that used up to 20 VMs can use a single VM with containers. A 20:1 reduction in Microsoft Server licenses yields an immediate, significant ROI for WinDocks users (but perhaps not for users of Microsoft containers).\nWinDocks vs. Microsoft Built-in : Microsoft’s container support is included in Windows Server 2016, and is an add-on for Windows 10 Professional and Enterprise editions. Both provide customers with a single vendor to contact for support. While container support comes without added cost, they won’t necessarily be free in practical terms (read on for sources of cost).\nWinDocks Windows support : WinDocks adds container support to all editions of Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016, providing easy access to developers. Industry surveys indicate that customers plan  gradual migration to Windows Server 2016.  These surveys indicate that Windows Server 2012 will continue to expand share-of-usage through 2020, with Windows Server 2016 growing gradually during the same period.\nSQL Server support : WinDocks was founded to address developer needs for efficient SQL Server environments. Over 80% of organizations test  SQLServer only twice monthly.  WinDocks released with support for all editions of SQL Server 2008 onward, with automated workflow for SQL Server containers and images. WinDocks utilizes Microsoft’s proven shared DLL architecture, enabling current SQL Server licenses to be used in containers without changes in tooling or process.\nWindows Server 2016 was released without effective SQL Server support. Three months following release SQL Server image support is still limited to SQL Server 2014 Express and  SQL Server 2016 Express.  Other outstanding issues include lack of support for Windows Authentication for SQL Server Management Studio (currently limited to SQL sa authentication), and lack of IP loopback support. In short, Microsoft’s support for SQL Server can only be described as incomplete.\nThe larger issue that hasn’t been discussed is Microsoft’s undisclosed plans for new SQL Server license terms for future SQL Server container images. The new licensing has not been revealed, but given the reduction in VMs achieved with containers it’s unlikely to be “free.”\nApplication containers vs. Microsoft bloatware : WinDocks containers provide user and process isolation, with a process that “guards” containers and enforces resource limits. The design provides security similar to Microsoft’s Server core containers, for trusted workloads within an enterprise. The design is not intended for untrusted multi-tenant use, which explains why Microsoft offers Hyper-V container support.\nWinDocks application containers are significantly lighter-weight than Microsoft’s. Microsoft’s containers are burdened with significant Windows files, with base images that average >9 GB, compared to WinDocks average of 100 MB. Microsoft containers require 20 more additional processes, and 80 MB more RAM than WinDocks containers. A WinDocks .NET with IIS container uses 5 MB of RAM (a 16x differential), so the implications for system sizing are significant. If the average development team runs a mix of SQL Server and .NET, a Microsoft container host will need 2-4X more CPU and RAM than a WinDocks server!\nMicrosoft’s design also leads to added image maintenance, as Windows updates force images to be rebuilt (each image includes a substantial Windows footprint). The WinDocks design, in contrast, allows the host to be updated independently of the container image.\nImage support : in addition to supporting all editions of SQL Server 2008 onward, WinDocks also supports Java with Tomcat and Jetty, Nginx, and Node.js. As we’ve already pointed out, Microsoft lacks image support for most SQL Server releases and editions, and Java with Tomcat.\nLegacy application support : one advantage of Microsoft’s design is the ability to support Windows applications that require registry support. WinDocks support for SQL Server images involved significant engineering to support SQL Server use of the Windows registry. Microsoft’s design as better positioned to support a broad range of applications that use the Windows registry.\nContainer licensing : WinDocks utilizes locally installed .NET and SQL Server instances to support the creation of containers and images. This approach is simple to implement, efficient, and capitalizes on Microsoft’s proven shared DLL architecture. This approach also uses existing host or core based SQL Server licensing. Current SQL Server licenses allow multiple instances on a host, and WinDocks makes multi-instance use fast and practical. For open source images, such as Nginx, Node.js, or Java, WinDocks includes redistributable run time support.\nMicrosoft’s container support is based on a new design, with each container being a new install of the application, and container images are a new installation package. This explains the rationale within Microsoft for introducing new license terms.\nOther issues : Microsoft’s container support is progressing, but at the time of this article lacks support for IP loopback, mount support that isn’t tied to containers, and support for Windows Auth for SQL Server Management Studio.\nConclusions WinDocks is simpler to adopt, use, and support, by using existing systems and licensing. Developers can start on Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2016, with support for .NET, SQL Server, and Java. The software is in wide use, and developers are averaging a reduction in VM usage of 10:1, with big savings in Microsoft license costs.\nMicrosoft’s container story is incomplete, offers limited scalability, is a maintenance headache, and has large unanswered questions. Customers contemplating use of Microsoft containers should consider the pending new SQL Server image licenses, the need for more and larger systems, and on-going image maintenance.\nOur recommendation is to start your evaluation of Windows containers with WinDocks. WinDocks is available for free in a Community Edition, and commercial use licenses begin at just $99/month. A summary of WinDocks options for  getting started is here.",

      "title": "Workday - A Takeover Target",
      "text": "Workday is a potential acquisition target by Microsoft. \nWorkday Management is solid, but the firm needs help developing the financial space. \nBalance sheet is solid and cash flow burn is reasonable for a growth company. The SaaS space is a crowded one, and the story is DOA for 2017. The cycle has started to top, with M&A activity setting a record in October 2016 as the latest sign that companies are struggling to achieve organic growth ( Zero Hedge ). At this point, the large players like Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ), Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL ), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) have made large acquisitions while Workday (NYSE: WDAY ) was left at the altar. In today's global economy, Big Data and SaaS has to be a part of a large organization, and it appears that Workday will focus its attention on the public sector where they will focus their attention. The push into government entities and collegiate space is a red flag for a growth company. It indicates they are struggling to sell to the larger and more lucrative private sector. In fact, a review of the Workday press release web page shows most new clients so far in 2016 have been non-profits and colleges. Those accounts are amongst the most complex and least lucrative. I think Workday will soon exhaust their opportunities in this space, and it is only going to get more competitive for the next marginal customer. Don't wait for the stock price to go lower! It does not have to for it to get acquired by a competitor. The balance sheet has held up well, with $400M in cash and barely a cash flow burn ( Fiscal 2017 Second Quarter Financial Results ). They won't soon need more money. They had a successful IPO in 2012, a $600M note offering in June 2013 and a $600M secondary in January 2014 ( JMP Website ). Cash is not the problem for Workday, but rather a stall in how much further current management can take the firm. Clearly from the latest Workday Rising event, some competitor out there has very little respect for them. Sadly, they need an Angel, and now would be a great time. They have a nice product, especially in the HR space. Let's face it, the firm was founded by HR pioneers David Duffield and Aneel Busri in 2007 as their swan song after PeopleSoft was taken over by Oracle. I think they fit squarely as a Microsoft Subsidiary. This presser shows the strategic partnership that was formed during this quarter. In fact, after the LinkedIn acquisition, and the fact that Microsoft does not have a true financial accounting offering, I think the next big deal will be here. Workday Management will realize they do not have a good chance in the financial space on their own. For reasons best stated by Seeking Alpha author Mark Gomes titled \" Is This Workday Nearing An End? \" gaining new accounting clients is a challenging because of barriers to switching. At the end of the day, there may be a surprise in the earnings tomorrow due to a lack of adoption in the financial software, but this is not a company to short. The next big catalyst will be a merger with Microsoft. It is not the time to short anything, not even tech, because while the valuation is high for a firm without a profit, Workday is a takeover target, and takeovers have huge upside potential. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in WDAY over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Subscribe Rate Of Female Fund Managers Has Not Improved Since 2008 Financial Crisis Designs by Nick DeSantis, Forbes staff \nFor the new JUST 100 List of America’s Best Corporate Citizens, Forbes partnered with Paul Tudor Jones’ Just Capital to identify the companies in each industry that excel at serving all stakeholders, beyond just the bottom line. \nThe doctrine of maximizing shareholder return has become religion in most of Corporate America’s C-suites over the last half century or so, but the companies we highlight have found a way to deliver strong investor returns without giving short shrift to employees, customers, suppliers and the environment. \nThe JUST 100 List scores companies on a variety of components that feed into 10 drivers of corporate integrity, and 32 companies were named the leaders in their particular industry. Here’s what 8 of those CEOs had to say about how and why they act as good corporate citizens. \nAmong Ford Motor’s community outreach efforts: a Thirty Under 30 program that connects tech-minded millennial employees with nonprofits. \n\nEastman Chemical partners with societies for women and minority engineers; it also supports employees who serve in the armed forces, making up pay differences while reservists are on active duty. \nNVIDIA doesn’t just win high marks for favorable worker perks like generous vacation time, it also stands out for limiting its environmental impact in an industry not known for being especially green. \nVarian Medical Systems makes devices that help treat cancer patients, so it’s a natural fit for mission-driven employees with a charitable mindset, but the company also has an eye on sustainability. It plans to divert 80% of solid waste from landfills by 2020. \nColgate-Palmolive accounts for 40% of the toothpaste tubes sold in the world, so it’s little surprise that it targets dentistry for corporate philanthropy efforts. It has provided free dental screenings for 850 million children in 80 countries. \nAccenture PLC expects 40% of its North American new hires in 2017 will be women, and almost half of its workforce are minorities. The company held a company-wide town hall in July to discuss race amid the ongoing dialogue over police shootings, \nDiscovery Communications provides 12 weeks of paid family leave, reimbursement for adoption and surrogacy services and has an on-site health and wellness center to keep employees happy and productive. \n\nMicrosoft gets high marks for worker treatment and diversity, and Nadella particularly cares about enhancing opportunities for underserved groups. One unique effort is a hiring program for people with autism. \n",

      "text": "\nImage source: Microsoft.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) was late to the mobile party, to say the least. The company's mobile operating system was left in the dust by both Alphabet 's Android and Apple 's iOS. By the time Windows 10 Mobile showed up on devices last year, the battle was already over.\nMicrosoft's multibillion-dollar purchase of Nokia 's phone operations, meant to give the company a meaningful share of the mobile device market, turned out to be a disaster. A $7.6 billion write-off followed. Just 0.4% of smartphones shipped with Windows during the second quarter of this year, compared to 87.6% for Android and 11.7% for iOS.\n Rumors about a potential Surface Phone , sharing the name of Microsoft's successful line of tablets and convertibles, have been swirling for quite some time. Given the state of Windows on mobile devices, it's hard to imagine such a device being successful. But Microsoft might have one trick up its sleeve. The company is reportedly working on bringing x86 emulation to the ARM version of Windows 10 as part of its Redstone 3 update next year. If that turns out to be the case, a Surface Phone could actually work.\nA PC in your pocket ",

      "title": "Microsoft Antivirus Tied for Last in Malware Tests",
      "text": "Windows 10 added a lot of security enhancements to ordinary PCs, but perhaps it hasn't added enough. Most third-party antivirus software still does better than Microsoft's built-in defenses at protecting computers from new strains of malware, although Microsoft has caught up in stopping better-known bugs.\nCredit: Lisa S./Shutterstock \nThat's according to the latest results from German independent lab AV-TEST , released today (Nov. 30). Among 22 products tested, Microsoft's Windows Defender came in dead last at stopping new \"zero-day\" malware that had never been seen before. More than 10 percent of zero-day bugs slipped past Defender, while the average antivirus product let only about 1 percent pass.\nWindows Defender was much better at stopping regular kinds of malware, catching about 99.7 percent of it, a hair above average. Worst in that category was Comodo Internet Security, which stopped only about 93.5 percent of prevalent malware; every other product tested caught at least 99.5 percent.\nMORE: Best Antivirus Software and Apps \nAV-TEST's new rankings were topped by Avira Antivirus Pro and Kaspersky Internet Security , which scored a perfect 6 points each in three equally weighted categories: protection, performance (impact on a computer system's speed) and usability. Just behind were Bitdefender Internet Security , Quick Heal Total Security and Trend Micro Internet Security , which each got dinged half a point on system-performance impact. (Quick Heal licenses Bitdefender's malware-detection engine.)\nIn terms of protection against malware, three products scored perfectly, stopping 100 percent of all malware: Bitdefender, Trend Micro and Norton Security . Just behind them were Avira and Panda Security Free Antivirus , which each caught 100 percent of zero-day malware, but only about 99.6 percent of widespread malware.\nCredit: AV-TEST GmbH \nIn antivirus software, what matters isn't how much you stop, but how much you let through. A score of 95 percent isn't an A, but more like a C-plus, as it's 25 times worse than a score of 99.8 percent.\nThat makes Windows Defender's zero-day score of 89.0 percent a pretty bad F. Defender is included with Windows 8.1 and 10, and it has been slowly improving , but it's still a stop-gap solution aided greatly by under-the-hood Windows 10 security enhancements. Until Microsoft develops dynamic defenses against zero-day malware, Windows users will do much better to install and run third-party software that updates itself. \nIn Tom's Guide's own tests, we've found that Bitdefender generally has a smaller system impact than Kaspersky, although we're comfortable recommending either brand for Windows users. The same goes for Avira (which makes an excellent free product), Norton and Trend Micro. \nEach brand uses one malware engine for all its own Windows products. Those products differ on features, not protection, and are tailored to customers with different needs.

      "text": "It’s a difficult year for Windows Phone fans, as Microsoft itself hasn’t been very active in the hardware side of the market, while various sources indicated that the firm wanted to give up on the Lumia brand completely. It’s not surprising that many considered this to be the end of Windows phones, despite statements from Microsoft executives that the firm is still committed to Windows 10 Mobile. But here comes CEO Satya Nadella himself reiterating the company’s plans to invest in phones, explaining that the final goal is to switch the focus to some specific features. Speaking at the annual meeting with shareholders, Nadella pointed out that the firm is “not stepping away or back from mobile devices,” revealing that the firm aims to focus more on features that make a difference, such as Continuum.

      "text": "PR Newswire Nov30,20169:02PMEST REDMOND, Wash. , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Speaking to shareholders at Microsoft Corp.'s annual meeting on Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella highlighted how digital technology is transforming people and organizations across the world, and the opportunity for Microsoft. \"Digital technology is impacting and transforming every human endeavor in every industry,\" Nadella said. \"Microsoft empowers our customers who want to harness new technology, like artificial intelligence, to transform their organizations and find solutions to the biggest challenges in healthcare, agriculture, finance, government — every sector.\" Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood reported that Microsoft executed well in fiscal year 2016 and reported a strong start to the current fiscal year. Hood noted that Microsoft's innovation road map and disciplined investment expand addressable market opportunities and position the company for growth — an investment in the future that will deliver value for shareholders. The following proposals were acted on by the company's shareholders at the meeting: Re-elected all 11 directors to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders. All director nominees received a vote of 98 percent of votes cast. Approved, on a nonbinding advisory basis, the fiscal year 2016 compensation of the company's named executive officers. The advisory measure received 95 percent of votes cast. Ratified the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the company's independent auditor for fiscal year 2017, with a vote of 98 percent of votes cast. Approved an amendment to Microsoft's Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, with a vote of 99 percent of votes cast. Approved a French Sub Plan under the 2001 Stock Plan, with a vote of 96 percent of votes cast. Rejected a shareholder proposal to make amendments to the current Proxy Access for Director Nominations bylaw; the proposal received approximately 26 percent of votes cast. Microsoft's board of directors consists of John W. Thompson , Microsoft independent chairman; William H. Gates , Microsoft founder and technology advisor; Teri List-Stoll , former executive vice president and chief financial officer of DICK'S Sporting Goods Inc.; G. Mason Morfit , president, ValueAct Capital; Satya Nadella , chief executive officer, Microsoft; Charles H. Noski , former vice chairman of Bank of America Corp.; Dr. Helmut Panke , former chairman of the board of management, BMW AG; Sandra E. Peterson , group worldwide chairman, Johnson & Johnson; Charles W. Scharf , chief executive officer, Visa Inc.; John W. Stanton , chairman, Trilogy Equity Partners; and Padmasree Warrior , chief development officer and U.S. chief executive officer, NextEV. Nine of the 11 board members are independent of Microsoft, which is consistent with the requirement in the company's governance guidelines that a substantial majority be independent. Microsoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

Belfiore, who officially returned to Microsoft one month ago, will handle the consumer-focused Windows Shell, according to a report from Thurrott, and will be reporting directly to Terry Myerson, who is in charge of the operating system division at the company. And while seeing Belfiore back at the software firm is good news since he’s a true Microsoft man in all regards, his new job might involve activities whose outcome might actually become very frustrating for Windows 10 users.

      "text": "Windows 10 Updater Disabler is a new program for Microsoft's operating system that turns updates on or off reliably.\nWindows 10 offers less UI control over the updating behavior of the operating system than previous versions of Windows.\nIf you check the settings application for instance, you only get options to defer feature updates if you run Pro or Enterprise, but no longer an option to switch the updating process to manual, or to deactivate Windows Update.\n\nIf you want control over the update process, you have to look elsewhere for these settings. One reliable way of disabling updates is to disable the Windows Update service.\nThis requires that you open the Services manager, locate the service and change its startup parameter and status.\nYou would then have to enable the service again whenever you want the operating system to check for updates.\nWindows 10 Updater Disabler \nWindows 10 Updater Disabler is a program for Windows that installs a service that blocks Windows Update from installing updates on the computer.\nThe service does not make use of Registry options to block Windows Update, as they may be modified by updates eventually (e.g. reset).\nIt runs checks for Windows Update's status regularly and terminates it when found to be running.\nInstead, it uses an undocumented system call to check the current state of Windows Update and tries to terminate it immediately.\nThe service disables all scheduled tasks that are related to Windows Update on top of that when installed on the system.\nInstallation \nTo install the Service, do the following:\nDownload the Updater Disabler archive from the WinAero website, and extract it once downloaded. Open an elevated command prompt. Tap on the Windows-key, type cmd.exe, hold down the Ctrl and Shift keys, and hit the Enter-key. The title of the command prompt window begins with Administrator if it is elevated. Navigate to the folder you have extracted the Updates Disabler program to (use cd folder name for that, e.g. cd c:\\users\\martin\\downloads\\updaterdisabler Run the command updaterdisabler.exe -install. If things worked out fine, you should get the following echoes on the command line:\nUpdateDisabler is installed.\nService Start pending ...\nService started successfully.\nYou can verify this in the Services configuration interface as well.\n\nYou should see the Update Disabler Service listed in the interface when you open the Services management console. It should have the status of running, and the startup type of automatic.\nIf you try an update check after installing the service, you will get an error message which confirms that Windows Update is disabled: We couldn't install some updates because the PC was turned off.\nUninstallation \nUninstallation works pretty much like installation, only that you need to run the program with a different parameter.\nYou do need to open an elevated command prompt window again and navigate to the UpdaterDisabler directory.\nRun the command updaterdisabler.exe -remove The program echoes steps of the process that indicate that the service is stopped and then removed.\nTo verify that this is indeed the case, check Services. The service should not be listed there anymore. Also, you will notice that update checks are working again just like they did before.\nClosing Words Updater Disabler requires more testing on many more devices. It did work well during tests, but it is highly suggested you back up important data before you run the software.\nAnyway, the program offers another option to block Windows Update from doing its job. If you prefer to wait days, weeks or months before you install released updates, this is an reliable option to achieve that.\nYou can download the program from WinAero , but it has been published originally on the My Digital Life forum .\nGhacks needs you.

      "text": "Microsoft to raise prices by up to 22pc after slump in pound Microsoft is raising its prices in the UK Credit: Jacky Naegelen/Reuters James Titcomb 23 October 2016 • 9:11pm \nM icrosoft is to increase its prices by as much as 22pc in the UK because of sterling’s recent decline, a rise that is likely to affect thousands of businesses and could cost the Governments tens of millions of pounds. \nThe software giant is the latest big-name company to force through a post-referendum price rise, saying the move would “harmonise” its prices across Europe. \nThe value of sterling against the dollar, in which Microsoft books its revenues, has fallen by approximately 18pc since the EU referendum on June 23. \nMicrosoft’s move comes after the consumer goods giant Unilever attempted to pass on a 10pc price increase to British supermarkets, a move that to led to a stand-off with Tesco, resulting in what was dubbed “Marmitegate”, a 24-hour period during which many Unilever products disappeared from the retailer’s online store. Unilever's attempt to pass on price rises to UK consumers was dubbed 'marmite-gate' \nN estlé’s chief executive, Paul Bulcke said last week he was considering a range of options to mitigate the fall in sterling , such as increasing prices of its products, which include Kit Kat and Nescafe, and cutting costs. \nMark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, has said that food prices were likely to be hit by increased inflation as a result of sterling’s fall. \nCosts for Microsoft enterprise customers will increase by 13pc for computer software and 22pc for so-called online cloud services, where the company hosts a customer’s data in a virtual storage centre. \nMicrosoft is one of the biggest sellers of business software in the UK, led by its suite of Office programs such as Word, Powerpoint and Outlook. Its cloud service, Azure, sells access to vast computing power and is used by customers including the Ministry of Defence. \nThe price rise, which comes into effect at the start of next year, could cost the Government tens of millions of pounds a year. \nWhile the Cabinet Office did not comment on how much it spends on Microsoft contracts, it is believed to be at least £100m a year. The government spends a lot of money on contracts with Microsoft Credit: Getty \nT he intended price rise comes at a bad time for the Government, given a major effort in Whitehall to reduce IT spending as part of a wider focus on civil service costs. \nThe price rise will only apply to new purchases, rather than ongoing contracts, and Microsoft said it would not increase prices for consumers. \nHowever, the rise is likely to deal a blow to businesses, which may have to raise IT budgets or sacrifice other projects in order to pay for the increased charges. \nIn its accounts, Microsoft does not strip out UK revenues but they are believed to amount to billions of pounds each year. \nLast week, the Seattle-based technology giant reported quarterly sales of $20.5bn (£16.8bn). \nSoftcat, the British IT reseller, said last week it had seen several foreign suppliers raise prices, which it had been forced to pass on to consumers. \nMicrosoft said what it called “harmonisation adjustments” were similar to those it made to pricing in Norway and Switzerland, after movements in the krone and Swiss franc earlier this year. \nA Cabinet Office spokesman said: “We are constantly monitoring market and supplier pricing to ensure best value for our customers and the taxpayer. Where we are made aware of proposed price changes we will work closely with that supplier to identify ways to mitigate any increases in price.” Follow Telegraph Business ",

      "text": "Courtesy of Microsoft Studios November 30, 2016 | 10:00AM PT \nMicrosoft Studios’“ Halo 5 : Guardians” sci-fi video game is set to become the basis of a reality-competition eSports series. \nMicrosoft Studios’ 343 Industries , developer of the blockbuster “Halo” first-person shooter series, has struck a deal with TV production company Pilgrim Media Group to develop the show. The partners did not reveal an expected premiere date, nor have they lined up TV or digital distribution deals for the series at this point. \nThe deal for the “ Halo 5: Guardians ” show is the first project to emerge from the joint initiative of Pilgrim Media, Lionsgate and video-game league ESL to create and distribute original eSports entertainment content for TV and digital platforms. Previously, Lionsgate made an equity investment in Pilgrim Media last year . \nSince first launching in 2001, the “Halo” franchise has generated more than $5 billion in worldwide sales to date. According to 343 Industries, eSports is a key pillar of “Halo 5: Guardians,” featured in such events as the Halo World Championship and the Halo Championship Series (HCS), where top North American and European teams compete on a weekly basis. \n“We continue to be blown away by the sheer excitement surrounding eSports,” said Craig Piligian, CEO of Pilgrim. “Esports and ‘Halo’ fans are exceedingly passionate about gaming and devoted to their favorite titles and franchises — they are exactly the kind of audience we want to produce for.” \nKiki Wolfkill, 343 Industries’ studio head of Halo Transmedia, added that the reality series “will bring the intensity and extreme competition of ‘Halo 5: Guardians’ eSports to a television audience. There is no better partner than Pilgrim to give our fans insight into the world of ‘Halo’ eSports.” \nPeter Levin, Lionsgate president of interactive ventures and games, and Steven Roberts, executive chairman of ESL North America, helped broker the deal with 343 Industries. \nEsports has been a fast-growing and exceedingly popular pastime for video-game fans worldwide. The segment is projected to generate $493 million in revenue for 2016, growing to $1.1 billion by 2019, according to research firm NewZoo. The number of eSports enthusiasts is expected to grow from 148 million this year to 345 million by 2019, NewZoo predicts. \nCompanies that have made moves to capitalize on the popularity of eSports include Turner and WME-IMG, which teamed up to form ELeague; Amazon, which acquired video-game internet broadcaster Twitch; and Activision Blizzard, which bought Major League Gaming earlier this year .

      "text": "up vote 1 down vote accepted \nWhen Microsoft Structured Query Language (SQL) says it needs 3.25 GB of free memory it is talking about RAM (Random Access Memory) or volatile memory. \nWhen you say you have 283.4 GB of memory free you are talking about non-volatile memory aka Hard Disk storage or Solid State Disk (SSD) storage. \nAlthough they are both \"memory\" you are comparing apples to oranges which are both \"fruit\". \nTo see how much RAM you have available use the command free from the Terminal. ie: $ free total used free shared buff/cache available Mem: 8031732 1614708 4377704 750208 2039320 5357500 Swap: 8191996 0 8191996 \nThe first row \"Mem:\" refers to RAM. The second row \"Swap\" refers to hard disk swap space which we'll call \"backup RAM\" for lack of a better term. \nThe first column is your total installed RAM / Swap (in this case 8 GB each), the second how much is used and the third how much is \"free\". In this case 4 GB of RAM is free and 8 GB of Swap is free. \nTo increase your free RAM you can close your web browser, music players, videos, etc.",

      "text": "Microsoft pulled support for Windows XP in April 2014, and yet, the operating system that turned 15 earlier this year is still being used by way too many people across the world. And what’s worse is that Windows XP’s market share is even increasing these days. A quick look at the statistics provided by NetMarketShare for the month of November 2016 shows that Windows XP is not declining, but actually improving, which is not only surprising, but also worrying given the fact that it’s no longer supported software. At this point, Windows 7 is the market leader with 47.17 percent share, followed by Windows 10 with 23.72 percent. Windows XP, which was launched 15 years ago, is the third most-used desktop operating system worldwide with 8.63 percent, even ahead of Windows 8.1, which is now running on 8.01 percent of computers. Windows XP started the year with 11.42 percent market share and then it dropped gradually to eventually reach 9.78 percent in July. The OS then i...",

      "text": "By Cage Appleby Neowin LLC · 5 seconds ago with 0 comments \nMicrosoft executives met with some of the company’s shareholders on Wednesday morning; a large majority of attendees were a legion of Windows Phone fans. \nEveryone clumped into attendance waiting to hear and question Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. You can assume these Windows Phone supporters, as a united front, were slowly grinding their teeth as they waited for the opportunity to ask what his vision for the company's mobile division is. \nThe meeting kicked off with executives asking attendees to “Silence all Windows Phones and other devices,” you could be forgiven to think this was a cruel joke, perhaps even Microsoft being rather cheeky at its own expense, and in any other setting, you’d probably be right. \nFollowing the Redmond giant's ill-fated acquisition of Nokia’s phone division , Microsoft has drastically reduced its own smartphone hardware, almost fading out the Lumia brand completely, and while there is a certain amount in circulation, there has been no successor to flagship devices, the Lumia 950 and 950XL, as of yet. \nThe company’s project lab, Microsoft Garage , also has a pronounced library of iOS and Android applications, most which have not yet crawled its way over to Windows 10 Mobile. Despite how small Microsoft's mobile market may be, there are still supporters of the platform who are clamoring to know why there's a lack of support, and they have every right to be frustrated. \nMicrosoft Shareholder Dana Vance stated he received an email about the Microsoft Pix app and was quite shocked to learn that it was only available to iPhone and Android users. Vance also stated that he felt the company is slowly distancing themselves from the Microsoft band, to which Nadella responded, \n“We think about mobility broadly. In other words, we think about the mobility of the human being across all of the devices, not just the mobility of a single device. That said, we’re not stepping away or back from our focus on our mobile devices. What we are going to do is focus that effort on places where we have differentiation. If you take Windows Phone, where we are differentiated on Windows Phone is on manageability. It’s security, it’s Continuum capability — that is, the ability to have a phone that can act like a PC. So we’re going to double-down on those points of differentiation.” \nSatya Nadella also noted the company will continue to differentiate themselves from what is currently available in the market right now, while also supporting other platforms so that a there is coherent access across the board. \n“We will build devices that are unique and differentiated with our software capability on top of it — whether it’s Surface or Surface Studio or HoloLens or the phone — and also make our software applications available on Android and iOS and other platforms. That’s what I think is needed in order for Microsoft to help you as a user get the most out of our innovation.” \nThe Surface Pro, the Surface Book, and the newly released Surface Studio are an example of this vision, this continued refinement and re-imagination of hardware categories. It could prove very interesting if Microsoft applies this strategy somewhere else, ala Surface Mobile? \nUnfortunately both Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer were absent from the meeting due to other commitments.",

      "text": "Network Drive Control is a free program for Microsoft Windows devices to configure network-specific drive mappings.\nOne of the issues that you may experience when it comes to mapped network drives on a Windows machine is that Windows tries to connect to all on start if configured this way.\nThere is no network-specific option that would attempt to map a network drive only when the device is connected to a specific network.\nThis results in time being spend waiting for network drives to connect, especially on devices with mapped network drive configurations of different computer networks.\nNetwork Drive Control \nThe author of Network Drive Control created the application to do away with the frustrating experience.\nWhat it does at its core is map only drives that it is configured to map so that it does not iterate through all mapped drives to find out whether they are connectable or not.\nThis works similarly to how Windows handles printers as it uses network-specific settings for those.\nThe program is relatively easy to use. You need to install it first, and make sure it starts with the Windows operating system as you won't benefit from the functionality that it makes available if that does not happen.\nAutostart is enabled by default, but you may disable it in the program interface should you want to disable it temporarily.\nFirst thing you may want to do is start adding network drives. Click on the \"add drive\" button to start the process.\n\nFor each drive, you are asked to select the network, drive letter and path, user ID and password. Once you have added one drive, you may use the clone option to clone it. This is useful if most parameters are identical, e.g. only the drive path is different for instance.\nYou may map different network drives to the same drive letter if they are in different networks.\nAll drives are listed with their parameters in the program interface. That's all there is to the process.\nYou may edit or delete drives at any point in time, and may show passwords as well. Note that the program itself does not offer password protection before its interface is shown. This means that anyone with access to the PC may reveal the passwords.\nNetwork Drive Control lets you connect and disconnect drives manually as well.\nThe only other option provide is to change the delay period before the networking mapping begins after system start. This is set to 1 minute by default, but you may change that in the program interface to increase the time before that happens.\nClosing Words Network Drive Control is a handy program for Windows. While it is probably more interesting to business users who connect their laptops to different network environments regularly, it may also be of interest to home users depending on how they use their devices.\nNow Read : Create multiple network profiles with Advanced Network Configurater \nGhacks needs you.

Basically, you can make Mozilla Firefox look just like Microsoft Edge, all by installing a simple theme file and without feeling like losing anything from the browser. “Firefox Edge is a theme for Mozilla Firefox that closely replicates the look of Microsoft Edge (both light & dark themes) without losing any features of Firefox. The theme is applied only to the top level visuals, meaning that context, popup etc. menus will keep their default look,” the developer of the theme says in a post on Github.

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft is doubling down on corporate diversity just in time for the New Year (or the new Trump presidency, depending upon how you look at it). \nWhile most companies answer the need for greater diversity with New Year’s resolutions to revamp hiring quotas, review corporate culture and restructure talent searches (all of which Microsoft has undertaken in the past), the company is looking at a new approach this time. And it may just offer the incentive needed to finally change those diversity numbers. \nThe solution? The software giant plans to link diversity stats to corporate bonuses. \nMicrosoft revealed earlier this month that while diversity in its workforce is increasing, its female representation slipped last year — for the second year in a row. Gwen Houston, Microsoft’s chief diversity and inclusion officer, blamed the shift on restructuring efforts in its phone hardware business, where there was a higher representation of women employees than in other parts of the company. But she acknowledged that the loss called for new approaches and a “deepening commitment” to increasing diversity in the company’s ranks. \nMicrosoft’s proposed strategy, which includes making diversity gains a requirement for senior management compensation, isn’t an entirely new idea. \nThe United Kingdom launched a charter in May to inspire banks to increase gender diversity in senior positions. The program is voluntary, but has already been adopted by many of the U.K.’s largest banks. And some 60 companies pledged to fill a third of their management positions with women by 2021. \nBut Microsoft’s diversity plan goes further than that: The company’s targets include ensuring the workplace is not only diverse in talent, but also inclusive in nature, Houston said. Ongoing internal diversity training programs and new strategies to broaden the net for diverse talent will complement the mandatory requirements for senior management. \nI wondered whether this new approach could also help to test the boundaries of what is called “diversity.” Will managers be required to ensure disabled workers are part of that definition? Granted, the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires employers to make “reasonable accommodations” for disabled workers. How will departments be required to meet (and hopefully improve against) that challenge? And while Microsoft has been actively working to expand its hiring of minorities and women, are there other ways it can help broaden society’s appreciation of and respect for multiculturalism in the workplace? \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told Fortune he is already thinking about the broader landscape of diversity and inclusion. Nadella has a child with special needs and appreciates the challenges that accessibility needs can create, both in and outside of the workplace. He said he knows diversity isn’t defined by numbers or federal census, but by human experience. \nWith the anticipated changes to federal priorities in Washington, Microsoft’s innovative approach to diversity and inclusion couldn’t come at a better time.",

      "text": "Q. Microsoft hasn’t updated Windows Movie Maker in years. I have it on my Windows 10 PC from when I upgraded the computer from Windows 8, but will there ever be a proper app version for Windows 10?\nA. Windows Movie Maker has been around for more than 15 years, but it has not been updated since the version that was included with the Windows Essentials 2012 software suite. The program is still available for download from Microsoft’s site for some versions of Windows, but not for much longer: The company says it will stop supporting the software on January 10.\nThe same page of release notes for Windows Essentials 2012 also says Movie Maker will soon be available from the Windows Store for Windows 10 users. At the moment, however, the Windows Store has Microsoft’s Movie Moments app for 60-second creations and several similarly named moviemaking apps, but no new edition from Microsoft — yet.\nIf you do not want to use the outdated version of Windows Movie Maker and do not see any apps in the Windows Store that fit your needs, you can find several open-source video-editing programs and alternative applications for Windows around the web. Free editing programs save money, but they may require more expertise to install and may not include dedicated technical support (aside from web documentation). Some free apps may also be ad-supported.\nCommercial video-editing tools for Windows can cost hundreds of dollars, but several consumer-oriented programs cost much less. For example, the standard edition of Pinnacle Studio 20 has a regular price of $60 (with slightly more expensive versions that include more features). Adobe Premiere Elements 15 costs around $100, but it is on sale for $60 until Tuesday. You can also download a free trial version from Adobe’s site first. Magix Movie Edit Pro, normally $120, is on sale for $50 until the end of the month. \nUsing Twitter’s new mute powers\nQ. I thought Twitter already allowed you to mute people who were being obnoxious online, so what exactly have they done that is supposed to make it easier to fight abuse now?\nA. Twitter has had a mute function since 2014 that lets you filter out a particular user account from your timeline without blocking or unfollowing that account.\nLast week, Twitter went a bit further with the mute function and announced on its company blog that people could now use the tool to filter out specific keywords, phrases, hashtags, emoji characters and even entire conversations from account notifications that come by email, text or app alerts. (The new mute powers work only within notifications, however, and the original tweets will still be visible in your timeline or by searching.)\nTo mute words or phrases in the Android Twitter app, tap the bell-shaped Notifications icon, and on the Notifications screen, tap All. Select the Notifications Settings icon in the corner. On the next screen, Tap Muted Words and then the plus icon. Enter the hashtags, words and other material you do not wish to see in your notifications and tap Save.\nIn the iOS Twitter app, tap the Notifications icon at the bottom of the screen and then tap the gear icon in the top-left corner. Select Muted Words on the next screen and tap “+Add muted word or phrase” so you can make your list. When you are finished, tap Save and then Done.\nYou can also build a muted-words list on your account page at twitter.com. From the menu under your profile photo at the top, select Settings, then Notifications and finally “Mute specific words from your notifications.”\nThe article “Advanced Muting Options on Twitter,” in the site’s Help Center, explains how to set up your list of words and other content to filter out of your notifications. If you change your mind, you can also unmute the same words by returning to your settings.\n_ New York Times",

Recent rumors have indicated that Microsoft was working on an emulator that would make Continuum capable of running x86 apps on fut… ( read more ) Related Posts You Might Like",

      "text": "Microsoft, Intel, IBM Push Back on China Cybersecurity Rules  55:  \nBEIJING—Tough new Chinese cybersecurity rules are providing a rare, behind-the-scenes look at a regulatory skirmish between U.S. technology companies and Beijing. \nChina is moving to require software companies, network-equipment makers and other technology suppliers to disclose their proprietary source code, the core intellectual property running their software, to prove their products can't be compromised by hackers. \nTech companies are loath to offer up their source code, saying this will heighten the risk of their code falling into the hands of rivals or malefactors—and may not guarantee it is hack-proof. Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. are among those filing objections. \nIntel said a rule forcing chip makers to disclose the details of their products \"would hurt technological innovation and decrease the security level of products.\" \nThe comments were made in a discussion log made public by Technical Committee 260, the national cybersecurity standards maker, as it released technical parameters of its omnibus cybersecurity law adopted Nov. 7. \nThe committee is rolling out standards for operating systems, microprocessors, office software and other products to comply with the regulations when they go into force in June 2017. \nChinese authorities have said these measures are necessary to guard against foreign espionage tools being embedded in software used here. They frequently cite claims by former U.S.National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that such back doors were routinely built into U.S. technology products sold overseas. \nMicrosoft, Intel and IBM were the largest U.S. firms to respond to the draft regulations, joining dozens of Chinese companies, government agencies and security experts. \nThe three U.S. tech giants declined to comment beyond their written statements. All three have multiple China ventures with local partners and are typically reluctant to publicly challenge Chinese policy. As such, their written comments, made in Chinese, offer a rare glimpse into how they parry over regulations with Beijing authorities. \nAmong other things, tech companies are bristling at the level of detail they would be forced to disclose to have their proprietary technologies rated \"secure and controllable.\" \nMicrosoft wrote that it believed allowing visitors to view code at its new \"Transparency Center\" in Beijing should suffice, rather than having to \"share source code.\" Technical Committee 260 staffers disagreed, maintaining the original wording and marking the comment \"not accepted.\" \nMicrosoft and Intel also raised questions over one security standard that gives a higher ranking to products whose development and delivery can't be disrupted by \"politics,\" with Intel requesting clarification. \nThat complaint was marked \"partially accepted,\" although political consideration is still in the most recent draft. \nIBM said that distinctions should be made between computing services for commercial use, versus services for government applications. \n\"Computing rooms used purely for commercial cloud computing purposes shouldn't have to be located within China's borders,\" wrote IBM. \nIn a written response, Technical Committee 260 staffers said that many sectors touch upon social stability and the public interest. \"It's not only a pure commercial question.\" \nJeremie Waterman, senior director for Greater China at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said there is \"deep concern about the IP disclosure requirements.\" But it isn't clear what recourse U.S. tech companies might have. \nDespite any objections, U.S. firms are unlikely to leave China over the cybersecurity requirements because of the importance of the mammoth Chinese market, said James Gong, a senior associate at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills LLP who works with western clients in navigating Chinese law. \n\"I don't think they will pull out,\" said Mr. Gong. \"I haven't heard of any company that has decided to leave.\" \nChina has long had cybersecurity standards that weren't vigorously enforced—but that is likely to change when the nationwide cybersecurity law goes into effect next summer, he said. \nBeijing maintains that its security rules apply to domestic and foreign companies equally. When China passed the cybersecurity law last month, a spokesman for the internet regulator said foreigners who thought the law would favor domestic firms had a \"misunderstanding, a biased view.\" \nBut in Technical Committee 260's discussions, certain government officials argued for the standards to be drafted to favor domestic companies. \n\"The big trend is called shifting to domestic production,\" wrote Guo Qiquan, chief engineer at the China Ministry of Public Security'sNetwork Security Bureau, in a suggestion that the committee marked \"approved.\" \"But it can't be written that way, so one calls it independent and controllable.\" \nYang Jie, Rachael King and Don Clark contributed to this article. \nWrite to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com  160555ET   Technology",

      "text": "In celebration of The Game Awards 2016, Microsoft is hosting a sale featuring each of the titles to be nominated including Doom , Dark Souls III , and Battlefield 1 . The Game Awards wouldn’t be half of what it is without the sponsorship and support of several major publishers, many of which contribute world premieres to debut during the event . It’s an excellent opportunity to celebrate the great games of the year while also looking forward to 2017. Microsoft, among others, likes to go a step further and pass on the celebration to Xbox players, and tonight marks the start of the Xbox One sale for The Game Awards 2016, which highlights various nominees with big discounts.\nMicrosoft has gone out of the way this year to provide sales for a good number of nominees, along with very solid discounts. They may not compare to some of the best Black Friday deals, but for viewers of The Game Awards seeing some of the nominees for the first time, it’s a great opportunity to turn around and pick up a great game for cheap. It also helps that a lot of nominees this year are available on Xbox One, which Microsoft is certainly very proud of.\nThe highlight of the sale is of course for the The Game Awards 2016’s Game of the Year nominees , three of the five represented:\nDoom – $30.00 (Save $29.99) Inside – $13.39 (Save $6.60) Titanfall 2 – $35.99 (Save $24.00) Also worth noting is that both Doom and Titanfall 2 also have their Deluxe Editions on sale , and EA has even put together a Battlefield 1 + Titanfall 2 Deluxe Edition bundle with a big discount. Those looking for the best deal should keep an eye open for special editions while they’re looking through the Microsoft or Xbox stores. The two nominees unrepresented are Uncharted 4 (a PS4 exclusive) and Blizzard’s Overwatch .\n\nIt isn’t just the Game of the Year nominees that have been discounted, however; discounts have been added for games in a number of other categories, including: Best Narrative, Best Art Direction, Best Independent Game, Best Action Game, Best RPG, and more. There are well over two dozen discounts to be found, but here are some highlights:\nBattlefield 1 – $40.19 Dark Souls III – $47.99 Dishonored 2 – $49.79 Firewatch – $11.99 Forza Horizon 3 – $44.99 Gears of War 4 – $35.99 Hyper Light Drifter – $13.39 Mafia III – $41.99 The Witness – $26.79 There are, of course, plenty of other sales, including discounts on FIFA 17 , Fallout 3 , NBA 2K17 , Overcooked , PES 2017 , The Banner Saga 2 , and XCOM 2 . There are even discounts on some non-nominee games like The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim and The Elder Scrolls Online , among others. Consider this to be Microsoft’s post-Black Friday sale on top of its Game Awards 2016 sale.\nThe Game Awards 2016 will air on December 1 at 6:00pm PT, with a pre-show starting at 5:30. It will air live via a dozen different platforms including in VR.\nSource: Microsoft Store \n",

      "text": "\"When I worked at Microsoft for nine years and didn’t have kids, I would often stay late, polishing some presentation for the next day. My best friend had two kids at the time, and she had to go home for dinner—she didn’t have a choice. If you have to be home, you squeeze a lot into the last hour. Being a parent taught me to task-shift very quickly. But it also taught me to take pauses.\n[Cinemagraph: Chloe Aftel ] Secrets Of The Most Productive People: 2016 Ten top performers reveal how they squeeze the most out of every day. \"Six or seven years ago, I felt like I loved the philanthropy work, but I was going trip to trip and meeting to meeting and then I would rush home and be with my kids, and I’d rush back and get on email at night and then back to the office. I finally just thought, ‘I don’t want to live this way. And I’m not sure I’m doing my best work.’ I stopped trying to clear out my inbox every day. Some of those emails needed to gel for a while before I replied, and some maybe didn’t need a reply. So now it’s only on select evenings that I go back to my computer. These are big issues we’re trying to tackle, whether it’s malaria or reproductive health. Our cotrustee, Warren Buffett, said to me, ‘Remember, Melinda. You’re taking on the problems that society has left behind, and they’ve left them behind because they’re hard problems.’ And it just reminded me that I have to take that time to fill my own joy bucket if I’m going to be good at this work. I build in 15-minute breaks so that I can take some quiet time and close on one meeting before I go to the next. I’m a big believer in taking time to pause and reflect, particularly when you’re working on some of the big challenges in the world.\"",

      "text": "December 01, 2016 6:00am Comments Share: \nREDMOND, Wash. , Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- On Thursday, Microsoft Corp. renewed its Affordable Access Initiative grant fund for a second year. The fund assists companies working to bring internet access and new technologies, services and models to underserved markets. The application process is now open for a new set of partners. \n\"The social enterprises we support have inspired us with practical, high-impact and scalable approaches to help close the digital divide,\" said Microsoft Affordable Access Initiatives Director Paul Garnett , writing in NextBillion . \"It's a privilege to see these solutions take shape, and to play a role in helping local entrepreneurs spur job creation and economic growth.\" \nIn the fund's first round of investments, Microsoft awarded grants to 12 businesses offering affordable internet access or cloud-based services in fields such as power generation, health, education, finance and agriculture. \nAirJaldi , a 2016 grant recipient, provides high-quality Wi-Fi broadband connectivity at reasonable rates to more than 90,000 public- and private-sector clients in rural India . Vista Africa , another recipient from last year, is a cloud-based software platform that helps healthcare providers more easily screen, track and treat patients' health in areas where connectivity is limited. \nIn addition to receiving funding and software to help power and develop their businesses, grant recipients will join a growing ecosystem of other grantees and funders to further increase their impact. \nThis initiative is also connected to the work of Microsoft Philanthropies , which is helping to bring technology's benefits to those who need them most. Microsoft Philanthropies is making its digital literacy, online safety and computer science education programs available to grant recipients and the communities they serve. \n\"Too many people around the world lack internet connectivity and the educational, commercial and economic benefits of cloud-based services,\" said Mary Snapp , corporate vice president and head of Microsoft Philanthropies. \"Affordable Access Initiative grants, and the technology ecosystems they help support, empower entrepreneurs to provide connectivity, which then enables the creation of critical services for those who need it most.\" \nHow to apply \nApplicants must be commercial organizations with two or more full-time employees and have a prototype of a working solution and preferably paying customers. Such products and business models might combine new cloud services and applications, low-cost forms of internet connectivity, and new payment mechanisms designed for consumers and smaller businesses in underserved markets. A list of criteria, and the application, can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/affordable-access-initiative/home . Applications will be accepted until midnight PST on Jan. 31, 2017 . \nMicrosoft (Nasdaq \"MSFT\" @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.",

      "text": "December 01, 2016 at 01:00 AM EST Microsoft Offers Grants to Organizations Working to Improve Affordable Internet Access \nSOURCE: Microsoft Philanthropies DESCRIPTION: \nREDMOND, Wash., December. 1, 2016 /3BL Media/ — On Thursday, Microsoft Corp. renewed its Affordable Access Initiative grant fund for a second year. The fund assists companies working to bring internet access and new technologies, services and models to underserved markets. The application process is now open for a new set of partners. \n“The social enterprises we support have inspired us with practical, high-impact and scalable approaches to help close the digital divide,” said Microsoft Affordable Access Initiatives Director Paul Garnett, writing in NextBillion . “It’s a privilege to see these solutions take shape, and to play a role in helping local entrepreneurs spur job creation and economic growth.” \nIn the fund’s first round of investments, Microsoft awarded grants to 12 businesses offering affordable internet access or cloud-based services in fields such as power generation, health, education, finance and agriculture. \nAirJaldi , a 2016 grant recipient, provides high-quality Wi-Fi broadband connectivity at reasonable rates to more than 90,000 public- and private-sector clients in rural India. Vista Africa , another recipient from last year, is a cloud-based software platform that helps healthcare providers more easily screen, track and treat patients’ health in areas where connectivity is limited. \nIn addition to receiving funding and software to help power and develop their businesses, grant recipients will join a growing ecosystem of other grantees and funders to further increase their impact. \nThis initiative is also connected to the work of Microsoft Philanthropies , which is helping to bring technology’s benefits to those who need them most. Microsoft Philanthropies is making its digital literacy, online safety and computer science education programs available to grant recipients and the communities they serve. \n“Too many people around the world lack internet connectivity and the educational, commercial and economic benefits of cloud-based services,” said Mary Snapp, corporate vice president and head of Microsoft Philanthropies. “Affordable Access Initiative grants, and the technology ecosystems they help support, empower entrepreneurs to provide connectivity, which then enables the creation of critical services for those who need it most.” \nHow to apply \nApplicants must be commercial organizations with two or more full-time employees and have a prototype of a working solution and preferably paying customers. Such products and business models might combine new cloud services and applications, low-cost forms of internet connectivity, and new payment mechanisms designed for consumers and smaller businesses in underserved markets. A list of criteria, and the application, can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/affordable-access-initiative/home . Applications will be accepted until midnight PST on Jan. 31, 2017. \nMicrosoft (Nasdaq “MSFT” @microsoft) is the leading platform and productivity company for the mobile-first, cloud-first world, and its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. \n\nFor more information, press only: \nMicrosoft Media Relations, WE Communications, (425) 638-7777, \nNote to editors : For more information, news and perspectives from Microsoft, please visit the Microsoft News Center at http://news.microsoft.com .Web links, telephone numbers and titles were correct at time of publication, but may have changed.

      "text": "December 1, 2016 0 Nokia today announced closure of the deal between HMD, FIH and Microsoft. This eventually means Nokia Phones are back to Nokia official site and under HMD as the new home. Keep in mind that only Nokia feature Phones are back to HMD and Nokia Site. Lumia devices remain with Microsoft. You can also subscribe at official Nokia Phones site to keep yourself posted about Nokia Android Phones. It is now official that Nokia will return to smartphones in 2017 . It also seems we can expect Nokia releasing Android Phone and Tablets at MWC 2017. We earlier reported about two high-end Nokia Android Nougat Phones in works as a part of upcoming Nokia Android portfolio. We have also reported some exclusive information about upcoming Nokia Android smartphone Nokia D1C, which is quite interesting.You can read our full Nokia D1C coverage by clicking here. Full Press Release: Espoo, Finland – Nokia confirms that the strategic agreement covering branding rights and intellectual property licensing with HMD Global Oy (HMD), originally announced on May 18, 2016 has come into force. HMD has today announced the completion of transactions between HMD, FIH Mobile Limited (a subsidiary of Hon Hai Precision Industries trading as Foxconn Technology Group) and Microsoft, which means that HMD can begin operations as the new home of Nokia phones, under an exclusive global brand license1 for the next ten years. Nokia branded feature phones remain one of the most popular choices of mobile phone in many markets around the world today and HMD will continue to market them as part of an integrated portfolio, alongside a new range of smartphones and tablets to be announced later by HMD. Under the agreement, Nokia will receive royalty payments from HMD for sales of every Nokia branded mobile phone and tablet, covering both brand and intellectual property rights. Nokia is not an investor or shareholder in HMD. Brad Rodrigues, interim president of Nokia Technologies, said: “We’ve been overwhelmed by the enthusiasm shown around the world for the return of the Nokia brand to smartphones. The HMD Global team has the ambition, talent and resources to bring a new generation of Nokia branded phones to market, and we wish them every success. I’m sure our millions of Nokia fans will be excited to see their new products!” Today also sees the return of Nokia branded phones to the Nokia website at www.nokia.com/phones . The website for Nokia phones is operated by HMD. 1 Excluding Japan Read our Full Nokia Phones coverage: ",

      "text": "$3.8 billion Slack just poached a high-ranking Dropbox exec as it faces a new threat from Microsoft Published by Business Insider on Thu, 01 Dec 2016 Slack has hired Dropbox's Kevin Egan as itsnewhead of North America sales, bringing in a seasoned veteran with over 10 years of enterprise sales experience, a source with knowledge of the matter told Business Insider.Egan, who served as Dropbox's head of North America sales for the last fouryears, is the second high-profile sales hire this year for Slack, the $3.8 billion startup best known for its viral messaging app.Earlier this year, it hired away Robert Frati from Salesforce as its first sales chief, after relying mostly on word-of-mouth without a big sales team to achieve its rocketship growth during its early years.Prior to Dropbox, Egan worked at Salesforce for over 10 years in various sales positions. He will be reporting to Frati at Slack once he joins the company in January.Both Slack and Dropbox declined to comment on this story.Stiff competitionThe move comes just as Slack faces stiffer competition from the likes of Microsoft, Facebook, and Atlassian.Microsoft just launched a Slack-like messaging app called Teams last month, while Facebook came out withits own workplace service in October. Atlassian, the maker of another business messaging app HipChat, went public last year.Egan's hiring should help Slackbetter-position itself in selling to the bigger enterprise companies. Although Slack likes to brag about its growth without a dedicated sales team, it's nearly impossible to sign big contracts unless you have direct salespeople on your team.It's also a signal that Slack's long-awaited enterprise productmay be getting closer to launching. The enterprise version of the service has been in development for two years, and is being tested among some large customers. But there havesome question marks around its statusand Slack's homepage still says its enterprise product is \"coming soon.\"Slack has over a million paid users and over four million daily active users. It said it's on track to generate $100 million in annual recurring revenue this year.It's unclear what exactly made Egan want to leave Dropbox. But according to an article by The Information last year, Egan was demoted to a smaller role after the hirings of COO Dennis Woodside and global VP of revenue Thomas Hansen, as the company shied away from traditional enterprise sales tactics for a more reseller-focusedapproach.SEE ALSO:An ill-informed salesperson sent this email pitch to Amazon's CTOJoin the conversation about this storyNOW WATCH: The 3 worst things you do when you wash your face ' according to a dermatologist",

      "text": "\nBack in September, Microsoft launched new data centers in the UK for Azure and Office 365. Today, the London Metropolitan Police Service has announced that it will be using Microsoft Azure to store data coming from the recently deployed by Body-Worn Video cameras. The Metropolitan Police Service actually started rolling out 22,000 body-worn cameras (aka Body-Worn Video) developed by Microsoft’s partner Axon. Apparently, twenty-two thousand police offers from the 32 boroughs in London will be wearing the cameras. The video evidence coming from these cameras will be stored in Microsoft’s Azure which will allow police offers to watch the footage whenever they want. Police officers will apparently record their entire shift using the BWVs, and all the footage will be uploaded to Microsoft Azure when the BWV is docked a policed station. The leader of Mobile Technology at the Metropolitan Police, Adrian Hutchinson\n“We wanted to store the data in the UK so we can provide transparency around our data and where it is kept, and Microsoft is a long-term trusted supplier to the Met. We have extensive data security requirements and they [Microsoft] satisfied all our necessary audits and we have no concerns.”\nThe London Metropolitan Police Service has deployed 3,500 cameras so far, and it hops to finish deploying all of the 22 thousand units by July 2017. The project is apparently costing £10 million.\n",

      "text": "Microsoft Experts Launch Anti-Recon Tool for Windows 10, Server 2016 By Eduard Kovacs on December 01, 2016 Tweet \nItai Grady and Tal Be’ery of the Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) research team have released a new tool designed to help security teams harden the Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 machines on their network against reconnaissance attempts. \nDubbed “ SAMRi10 ” (pronounced Samaritan), the tool is a simple PowerShell script that changes the default Security Account Manager (SAM) access permissions on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 in an effort to prevent attackers from collecting potentially valuable recon information. \nWhen attackers breach a single endpoint in an organization’s network, they need to identify other machines they can move to, preferably the ones of privileged users. Penetration testing tools such as PowerSploit and BloodHound are often used for this task. \nAttackers can obtain information on domain and local users remotely via the Security Account Manager Remote Protocol (SAMR). Local credentials, particularly ones belonging to administrators, can be more valuable to attackers as they are less managed (i.e. passwords are not complex and there is no change policy) and less monitored. \nIn versions prior to Windows 10, any domain user can query local users via the SAMR protocol. This is a default setting and it cannot be changed. In Windows 10, any domain user can query local users by default, but the configuration can be changed by making modifications to a specific registry entry. \nIn Windows 10 Anniversary Update, remote SAM access is limited to local administrators, and the setting can be changed via both the registry and Group Policy settings. \nThe SAMRi10 tool aims to harden remote SAM access on Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10 by giving access only to “Administrators” and a newly created group named “Remote SAM Users.” Users who need SAM access can be added to this special group via the native net localgroup command or the Computer Management (compmgmt.msc) tool. \nEach device can be hardened by executing the SAMRi10.ps1 file on it. The changes can be reverted by executing the script with the .\\SAMRi10.ps1 -Revert option. \n“A Windows 10 machine, hardened by the SAMRi10 tool, will respond to a remote SAM access, based upon the requesting user account type, similar to a hardened 2016 domain controller,” Grady and Be’ery explained. \n“Remote execution of PowerSploit’s Get-NetLocalGroup method against a SAMRi10 hardened computer, using an unprivileged user will result with an ‘Access is denied’ error,” the researchers said. “Executing the same method, with an administrative account or a member of the local ‘Remote SAM Users’ on the remote machine, will be completed successfully.” \nThe tool can be efficient as long as the credentials of “Remote SAM Users” group members are not compromised, the experts told SecurityWeek . \nThis is not the only anti-reconnaissance tool released by Grady and Be’ery . In October, they launched NetCease , a PowerShell script that changes NetSessionEnum function permissions in order to make it more difficult for attackers to obtain information that would allow them to move laterally within a network.",

      "text": "Twitter \nWith Skype and Microsoft under one roof, there’s no reason to maintain multiple logins. Rather than try to keep track of multiple logins, you can actually use one password for both Microsoft and Skype. Here’s how to do that. \nGo to account.microsoft.com . If you’re already logged in with your Microsoft account, you will need to log out and the log back in with your Skype account details. After you sign in, you may be prompted to update your account with a backup email address for account recovery. \n\nMicrosoft will suggest the email address associated with your Skype account. To use that address click the Next button. Alternatively, you can add a new email address if you prefer. \nIf you don’t already have a Microsoft account, all you need to do is verify your backup email address and your Skype account will be updated to a Microsoft account. If you already have a Microsoft account, you will be prompted to enter your Microsoft account password, after which you can go ahead and confirm that you want to merge both accounts. \nAnd if you don’t want to mess with accounts at all — you can actually start Skype conversations without the need to log in How to Start Skype Conversations Without an Account or App How to Start Skype Conversations Without an Account or App Ever wanted to talk or chat on Skype without installing the app or creating an account? Now you finally can. Read More at all. \nDo you have any tips and tricks on how to cut down on email and chat clutter? Let us know in the comments. \nImage Credit: Castleski via Shutterstock",

      "text": "Nokia \nNokia has been through the wash a bit recently, with Microsoft buying its phone business and Chinese companies using the Nokia name to sell devices by. The Finnish company announced a return to the tablet market in May, and now it is announcing it will return to smartphones in 2017, along with manufacturing partner HMD Global. \nA new section devoted to phones has appeared on Nokia's website - you'll see that the website is operated by 'HMD Global Oy,' which is now the exclusive licensee of the Nokia brand. HMD Global is also Finnish, so the company remains in Finland, although it's not clear if the devices themselves will be manufactured in Finland. In May, HMD Global said that the Nokia tablets would be manufactured in a plant in Vietnam. It's not clear if the same is going to happen with the new phones, although it would seem likely. Anyhow, the licensing deal will last for ten years, and is wholly exclusive. \nThe website encourages everyone to sign up for more news on the phones, which will be released sometime in 2017. Until then, we just have to wait and see if the dreams of a solidly built Nokia phone running Android will come true. Via:",

Packed attachments reduce the size of PST / OST storage files and improve Outlook performance. Compressed attachments in mailboxes and Exchange Server public folders speed up message loading process and increases the overall messaging system efficiency. Working with attached archives provides more features: ability to open blocked attachment types is just one of them. Placing executables inside the archives eliminates the possibility of accidental .exe launches. The utility packs attachments to ZIP archive and removes original files from Outlook elements. Several attachments can be compressed to the one common ZIP file or to a separate archive for each of the attachments. Attachment name patterns can be specified for selective compression. For instance, only Microsoft Word documents can be packed by specifying *.doc* pattern. Tight integration with MS Outlook enables packing attachments of selected elements, folders or even whole storages. Standalone launcher allows to compress attachments without need to have Outlook running. Price",

      "text": "Security news , Technology Hackers can access Windows 10 Command Line Interface with root access as well as bypass BitLocker by pressing Shift + F10 during Windows 10 update \nNext time, if you keep your Windows 10 PC/laptop unattended while it is updating, your PC/laptop can get hacked. Thanks to Microsoft’s very poor bug management, getting administrator privileges on a Windows 10 computer no longer requires complex tactics and malware. A potential hacker has to just press the Shift + F10 keys during the update process to gain full root access to a Windows 10 run computer. \nWindows security expert Sami Laiho has discovered a simple method to gain root access to the Windows Command Line Interface and bypass BitLocker protection during the Windows 10 update procedure. Laiho says that by holding SHIFT + F10 while a Windows 10 computer is installing a new OS build, an attacker can open a command-line interface with SYSTEM privileges. \nThe problem with this bug is that the CLI debugging interface grants the hacker full access to the computer’s hard drive and total control of the PC/laptop. The bug is possibly a backdoor for kept open while testing the Windows 10 update by Microsoft Engineers, which they forgot to close. In the event of a Windows 10 update being installed, the OS disables BitLocker to facilitate Windows PE (Preinstallation Environment) to read/write the disk and install new image of the main Windows 10 operating system. \nMany tech companies have such backdoors for their software products while testing updates, fixes, and patches. In most cases, the companies release the final product after closing such backdoors but Microsoft simply forgot to close this hack window which could lead to disastrous results. \nLaiho says that he informed Microsoft of the issue and the company’s engineers are working on a fix. Now the problem for Microsoft engineers is to release a patch to close this backdoor for millions of Windows 10 users. \nLaiho says he successfully brought up the CLI troubleshooting interface while his PC was updating from Windows 10 RTM to version 1511 (November Update) or version 1607 (Anniversary Update). His further research found that he could access the CLI during updates to any newer Windows 10 Insiders Build version, up to the end of October 2016. \nTill the time Microsoft patches this Shift + F10 bug, Laiho recommends that users should not leave their computers unattended during a Windows 10 update. “The LTSB-version of Windows 10 is not affected by this as it doesn’t automatically do upgrades,” Laiho says. \nFurthermore, Laiho says that Windows SCCM ( System Center Configuration Manager ) can block access to the command-line interface during update procedures if users add a file named DisableCMDRequest.tag to the %windir%\\Setup\\Scripts\\ folder.",

      "text": "25 Wilkinson Healthcare launches ecommerce site following deployment of Microsoft Dynamics NAV New web shop, developed by The NAV People, provides incontinence and stoma customers with a direct and discreet service tailored to their needs \n• Newbury - Berkshire - UK NEWBURY, U.K.   Medical appliance wholesaler, Wilkinson Healthcare, has selected Microsoft Dynamics NAV from The NAV People to support all central business functions and provide a flexible and scalable platform giving the company a progression path as its operations grow. Dynamics NAV has helped to contain headcount costs by eliminating the need for manual order entry of approximately 650 orders daily and radically improved the level of visibility across the company, delivering real-time data on number of orders, stock levels and invoicing. Additionally, the increased functionality provided by Microsoft Dynamics NAV has enabled Wilkinson Healthcare to develop a new channel to market. The recently launched web shop offers people affected by incontinence or who have a stoma a direct and discreet facility to service their needs.Wilkinson Healthcare supplies stoma, continence and wound care products to UK Dispensing Alliance Contractors and the 9,500 pharmacies within the UK pharmacy network. The company holds approximately 4,500 lines of stock at any one time and receives between 500 and 800 orders daily. The prescription line items are sent to Wilkinson Healthcare via an interface developed by The NAV People, which integrates the pharmacy wholesalers system with Dynamics NAV. As soon as the warehouse team at Wilkinson Healthcare pick and pack the items, a notification is sent via the system confirming the order fulfilment.Accurate visibility of stock is vital; Dynamics NAV is used to keep track of stock levels and interfaces with the wholesaler's system to provide real-time notifications every 15 minutes. By integrating the systems, Wilkinson Healthcare has significantly capped headcount costs by eliminating the need for manual order entry of hundreds of orders each day. Also by integrating the web shop into Dynamics NAV the company has created a single repository of information that has streamlined operations.Russ Melrose, Interim MD and IT Director at Wilkinson Healthcare comments: 'The NAV People took the time to understand our requirements and delivered the solution not only within budget but also in the tightest of timescales. We are a small company with a high order throughput; the solution underpins our business and enables us to be incredibly efficient. The Dynamics NAV solution has put us on the path to optimisation, enabling us to further improve our business processes and providing the functionality in which to do this ourselves.'Ian Humphries, Managing & Product Director at The NAV People commented; 'The key objective for Wilkinson Healthcare was a solution that had the flexibility to scale with their growth plans. By deploying Microsoft Dynamics with the nHancement workflow module created by The NAV People, the company has the functionality and flexibility to create dashboards and make changes, without the services of a developer. This level of autonomy has put Wilkinson Healthcare in the driving seat of their IT business environment.'A full case study is available: www.thenavpeople.com/",

      "text": "Wielding Their Windows Phones, Microsoft Shareholders Grill CEO Satya Nadella On Device Strategy Published by Slashdot on Thu, 01 Dec 2016 At a meeting with shareholders Wednesday, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was asked numerous times what the company is doing about Windows Phones, and why do they keep hearing that Microsoft is abandoning smartphone manufacturer business. The stakeholders also asked why the company is seemingly focusing more on Android and iOS rival platforms instead of its own. From a report on GeekWire: Microsoft shareholder Dana Vance, owner of a Windows Phone and a Microsoft Band, said he received an email about the Microsoft Pix app but was surprised to learn that it was available for iPhone and Android but not Windows Phone. Ditto for Microsoft Outlook. He also alluded to reports that Microsoft has put the Band on the back burner. Given this, he asked Nadella to explain the company's vision for its consumer devices. As part of his response, Nadella said Microsoft's Windows camera and mail apps will include the same features as in Microsoft's apps for other platforms. \"When we control things silicon-up, that's how we will integrate those experiences,\" Nadella said. The company will \"build devices that are unique and differentiated with our software capability on top of it -- whether it's Surface or Surface Studio or HoloLens or the phone -- and also make our software applications available on Android and iOS and other platforms. That's what I think is needed in order for Microsoft to help you as a user get the most out of our innovation.\" Another shareholder, who says he uses his Windows Phone \"18 hours a day,\" said he has heard Microsoft is \"stepping away from mobile.\" He asked, \"Can you calm me down ... and tell me what your vision is for mobile'\" Nadella answered, \"We think about mobility broadly. In other words, we think about the mobility of the human being across all of the devices, not just the mobility of a single device. That said, we're not stepping away or back from our focus on our mobile devices,\" Nadella said. \"What we are going to do is focus that effort on places where we have differentiation. If you take Windows Phone, where we are differentiated on Windows Phone is on manageability. It's security, it's Continuum capability -- that is, the ability to have a phone that can act like a PC. So we're going to double-down on those points of differentiation.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

Other requirements to download apps without an account is that the app doesn’t have specific age restrictions and that Windows 10 update KB 3200970 is installed. \nThe German website Heise tested the download of free apps without a Microsoft account and found it to work on a Lumia 550 with Windows 10 Mobile and, despite other reports, also on a desktop running Windows 10 Home Edition. \nAs mentioned, downloading apps without a Microsoft account does have some restrictions. In a short test, a Microsoft account was still required to download apps with an age rating of 16-18 years and older. Users also need to login when downloading paid apps and for in app purchases in free apps. \nIn case data is not synchronized through e.g. a Google or Facebook account, app data is not synchronized between multiple devices. \nHeise also mentions that the test failed on a computer where an user previously logged in to the store with a Microsoft account and then logged out. Even removing the Microsoft account in the settings (Accounts -> Email and App accounts) didn’t solve it, a Microsoft account was still required even for downloading free apps. \nThe required KB 3200970 was released on the 8th of November and fixed several security issues.

      "text": "Firefox Edge Theme Makes Firefox Browser Look like Microsoft’s Edge Get the Windows 10 browser look in Mozilla Firefox Dec 1, 2016 09:22 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​Windows 10 users who want the simple look of Microsoft Edge but can’t get rid of Mozilla’s Firefox can now combine the two with a free theme that customizes the interface of the browser. Basically, you can make Mozilla Firefox look just like Microsoft Edge, all by installing a simple theme file and without feeling like losing anything from the browser. “Firefox Edge is a theme for Mozilla Firefox that closely replicates the look of Microsoft Edge (both light & dark themes) without losing any features of Firefox. The theme is applied only to the top level visuals, meaning that context, popup etc. menus will keep their default look,” the developer of the theme says in a post on Github . The theme has already been tested on Windows 10 and Firefox 50 , but it should work flawlessly on the latest versions of the browser and the newer builds of Microsoft’s operating system. If you want to install the theme on your computer, what you need to do is to install the Stylish addon for Firefox and then go to the Firefox Edge userstyles page. Choose between light or dark (check out the screenshots below to see what they both look like) and then click the “Install with Stylish” button. It goes without saying that this theme is completely free, so give it a try right now to see if the minimalistic look of Microsoft Edge matches your own Firefox style. This is what the theme looks like in dark mode And this is the light version that looks like the default Edge CHECK OUT THE GALLERY (3 Images)",

      "text": "Joe Belfiore’s Return to Microsoft Could Lead to More Ads in Windows 10 - Report GO He'll be in charge of the consumer-focused Windows Shell Dec 1, 2016 06:46 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: ​Joe Belfiore, the one who most Microsoft fans know as the man behind Windows Phone (although he had some other responsibilities as well), is back at Microsoft and he’s in charge of something totally different from what he was doing before his 1-year holiday. Belfiore, who officially returned to Microsoft one month ago, will handle the consumer-focused Windows Shell, according to a report from Thurrott , and will be reporting directly to Terry Myerson, who is in charge of the operating system division at the company. And while seeing Belfiore back at the software firm is good news since he’s a true Microsoft man in all regards, his new job might involve activities whose outcome might actually become very frustrating for Windows 10 users. The source notes that Belfiore’s main responsibility is to “find new ways to make money with Windows 10,” mostly because the traditional licensing model that the operating system is still using is losing ground. More “tips,” anyone? In case you’re wondering what this means, “new ways to make money” could represent “a way to introduce more advertising directly into Windows,” as the source puts it, and this is a thing that Microsoft has been doing since the official debut of the operating system. Microsoft calls these ads “tips” or “suggestions,” and while it gives some options to disable them, we’ve seen more and more complaints from users who are annoyed with getting all kinds of recommendations to switch from third-party to Microsoft apps. Edge browser is one of the apps that Microsoft is promoting with these tips, and most recently, users have started seeing popups coming out from the browser icon in the taskbar . It goes without saying that more ads in Windows 10 cannot be good news for Windows 10 consumers, so Joe Belfiore might actually have a harder job than before. Finding a way to make money with Windows 10 without actually causing frustration in the Windows community will certainly be a tough challenge.",

      "text": "Microsoft CEO: We’re Not Giving Up on Windows Phones GO Nadella says Microsoft will continue investing in phones Dec 1, 2016 05:37 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: It’s a difficult year for Windows Phone fans, as Microsoft itself hasn’t been very active in the hardware side of the market, while various sources indicated that the firm wanted to give up on the Lumia brand completely. It’s not surprising that many considered this to be the end of Windows phones, despite statements from Microsoft executives that the firm is still committed to Windows 10 Mobile. But here comes CEO Satya Nadella himself reiterating the company’s plans to invest in phones, explaining that the final goal is to switch the focus to some specific features. Speaking at the annual meeting with shareholders, Nadella has pointed out that the firm is “not stepping away or back from mobile devices,” revealing that the firm aims to focus more on features that make a difference, such as Continuum. Recent rumors have indicated that Microsoft was working on an emulator that would make Continuum capable of running x86 apps on future devices. “We think about mobility broadly. In other words, we think about the mobility of the human being across all of the devices, not just the mobility of a single device,” Nadella explained . “That said, we’re not stepping away or back from our focus on our mobile devices. What we are going to do is focus that effort on places where we have differentiation. If you take Windows Phone, where we are differentiated on Windows Phone is on manageability. It’s security, it’s Continuum capability - that is, the ability to have a phone that can act like a PC. So we’re going to double-down on those points of differentiation.” Why Microsoft is investing in Android and iOS apps Additionally, Nadella acknowledged that there are other platforms with bigger market share (Android and iOS), and this is why the company is investing in building apps for them, as Microsoft users here need access to their services as well. “We will keep looking at different forms and different functions that we can bring to mobile devices, while also supporting our software across a variety of devices. So that’s the approach you will see us take. We are not stepping away from supporting our Windows Phone users. But at the same time we are recognizing that there are other platforms in mobile that have higher share, and we want to make sure that our software is available to them,” he said. Nadella hasn’t commented on the possibility of giving up on the Lumia brand, which, according to people with knowledge of the matter, should happen as soon as this month.",

      "text": "Close Description \nToday's project is from the awesome Microsoft community on hackster.io and while includes complete instructions and parts list, is for the advanced hardware hacking... Posture Recognition using Kinect, Azure IoT, ML and WebVR The Idea \nWith the recent success of depth cameras such as Kinect, gesture and posture recognition has become easier. Using depth sensors, the 3D locations of body-joints can be reliably extracted to used with any machine learning framework, specific gestures or posture can be modelled and inferred. Real world applications in Virtual Reality can be used for Yoga, Ballet training, Golf, anything related to activity recognition and proper postures. I also see application of it in the Architectural, Engineering, Construction and Manufacturing Industry by sending depth sensor data to the cloud to identify correct configurations. It could be used for quality control, anomaly detection and part recognition \nThis is a proof of concept to detect pose \"Y\", \"M\", \"C\" , \"A\" and stream the result back to the browser. \n.... Posture Recognition Device in Virtual Reality \nCapturing the Kinect Skeletal Data, Visualize it in Virtual Reality and send it to Azure IoT for Machine Learning. \nIf this project made you interested in Kinect, LattePanda board, Johnny-Five, Azure Services, please click \"Respect Project\" button and follow me. Feel free to contact me, if you have questions. Kinect \nKinect is an awesome input device for our Internet of Things world. It is a motion sensing input device that has RGB camera, depth sensor, multi-array microphone. I'm currently using it as a motion capture device viewable in Virtual Reality. I bought this adaptor so I can use it on a windows 10 device, Now I can plug it into a USB port. \n... \n... \nThis is where I believe the strength of Azure services in IoT space. Being able to collect telemetry data, pass to streaming analytics, split the data into outputs. Gathering Training Data to feed your machine learning model With captured telemetry data, use it to call a predictive analytics function and transform the output streaming data. \nWhen I realized this, now I see what Internet of Things is all about. It's not just a building a device, It's adding the Smarts to it. The Predictive Analytics part, it's the real-time data processing and the flexibility of the cloud. Something clicked, MIND-BLOWN. \nIf this project made you interested in Kinect, LattePanda board, Johnny-Five, Azure Services, please click Respect Thumbs Up button and follow me. Feel free to contact me, there's a lot to digest on this one. \nProject Information URL: https://microsoft.hackster.io/en-US/RONDAGDAG/posture-recognition-using-kinect-azure-iot-ml-and-webvr-e9c4f7",

Subscribe \nMicrosoft announced the gorgeous Surface Studio all-in-one desktop PC last month, to much fanfare. I lauded the Surface Studio’s design and killer screen , but disliked the use of previous-generation technologies at the heart of the machine. One of the benefits of using tried-and-true hardware, however, is reliability – Intel’s Skylake and NVIDIA’s Maxwell-based parts are known quantities at this point – which bodes well for Microsoft considering how difficult it would be to repair a Surface Studio. A look inside the Microsoft Surface Studio. \nAs is typically the case when a hot new piece of hardware hits the scene, iFixit ripped apart a brand new Surface Studio and gave it a relatively low “repairability score” of 5 out of 10. Why such a low score for a desktop PC, when desktops are usually easier to disassemble and repair than other systems? Because the Surface Studio’s memory, CPU, and GPU are all soldered down on the motherboard, similar to an Ultrabook or non-upgradeable laptop. Should any one of those components fail, the entire motherboard will most likely have to be replaced. \nDisassembling the Surface Studio proved to be fairly straightforward. There are some screws hidden underneath its rubber feet, which is common. Remove those screws and disengage a few clip points, and users can gain access to the system’s internals. Once inside, many items are serviceable or replaceable – like the cooling fans, hard drive, and SSD. But the major components mentioned earlier are not. Technically speaking, skilled service professionals could remove faulty chips or components from a PCB (printed circuit board) and install a replacement, but it is far more common – and quicker – to simply replace the entire board, which means much higher hardware costs for out-of-warranty repairs. The Surface Studio’s Motherboard. \nUltimately, this isn’t a major issue though. Most notebooks, laptops, and small form factor systems have many of their major components soldered in place as well. And it’s increasingly less common for anyone to repair individual components anyway. Hopefully, Microsoft has done extensive qualification on the Surface Studio and reliability isn’t an issue, and problems similar to those that plagued early Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book systems don’t crop up on the Surface Studio.

      "text": "BEIJING—Tough new Chinese cybersecurity rules are providing a rare, behind-the-scenes look at a regulatory skirmish between U.S. technology companies and Beijing.\nChina is moving to require software companies, network-equipment makers and other technology suppliers to disclose their proprietary source code, the core intellectual property running their software, to prove their products can't be compromised by hackers.\nTech companies are loath to offer up their source code, saying this will heighten the risk of their code falling into the hands of rivals or malefactors—and may not guarantee it is hack-proof. Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. are among those filing objections.\n\"Sharing source code in itself can't prove the capability to be secure and controllable,\" Microsoft wrote in comments released by a government cybersecurity committee in November. \"It only proves there is source code.\"\nIntel said a rule forcing chip makers to disclose the details of their products \"would hurt technological innovation and decrease the security level of products.\"\nThe comments were made in a discussion log made public by Technical Committee 260, the national cybersecurity standards maker, as it released technical parameters of its omnibus cybersecurity law adopted Nov. 7.\nThe committee is rolling out standards for operating systems, microprocessors, office software and other products to comply with the regulations when they go into force in June 2017.\nChinese authorities have said these measures are necessary to guard against foreign espionage tools being embedded in software used here. They frequently cite claims by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that such back doors were routinely built into U.S. technology products sold overseas.\nMicrosoft, Intel and IBM were the largest U.S. firms to respond to the draft regulations, joining dozens of Chinese companies, government agencies and security experts.\nThe three U.S. tech giants declined to comment beyond their written statements. All three have multiple China ventures with local partners and are typically reluctant to publicly challenge Chinese policy. As such, their written comments, made in Chinese, offer a rare glimpse into how they parry over regulations with Beijing authorities.\nAmong other things, tech companies are bristling at the level of detail they would be forced to disclose to have their proprietary technologies rated \"secure and controllable.\"\nMicrosoft wrote that it believed allowing visitors to view code at its new \"Transparency Center\" in Beijing should suffice, rather than having to \"share source code.\" Technical Committee 260 staffers disagreed, maintaining the original wording and marking the comment \"not accepted.\"\nMicrosoft and Intel also raised questions over one security standard that gives a higher ranking to products whose development and delivery can't be disrupted by \"politics,\" with Intel requesting clarification.\nThat complaint was marked \"partially accepted,\" although political consideration is still in the most recent draft.\nIBM said that distinctions should be made between computing services for commercial use, versus services for government applications.\n\"Computing rooms used purely for commercial cloud computing purposes shouldn't have to be located within China's borders,\" wrote IBM.\nIn a written response, Technical Committee 260 staffers said that many sectors touch upon social stability and the public interest. \"It's not only a pure commercial question.\"\nJeremie Waterman, senior director for Greater China at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said there is \"deep concern about the IP disclosure requirements.\" But it isn't clear what recourse U.S. tech companies might have.\nDespite any objections, U.S. firms are unlikely to leave China over the cybersecurity requirements because of the importance of the mammoth Chinese market, said James Gong, a senior associate at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills LLP who works with western clients in navigating Chinese law.\n\"I don't think they will pull out,\" said Mr. Gong. \"I haven't heard of any company that has decided to leave.\"\nChina has long had cybersecurity standards that weren't vigorously enforced—but that is likely to change when the nationwide cybersecurity law goes into effect next summer, he said.\nBeijing maintains that its security rules apply to domestic and foreign companies equally. When China passed the cybersecurity law last month, a spokesman for the internet regulator said foreigners who thought the law would favor domestic firms had a \"misunderstanding, a biased view.\"\nBut in Technical Committee 260's discussions, certain government officials argued for the standards to be drafted to favor domestic companies.\n\"The big trend is called shifting to domestic production,\" wrote Guo Qiquan, chief engineer at the China Ministry of Public Security's Network Security Bureau, in a suggestion that the committee marked \"approved.\" \"But it can't be written that way, so one calls it independent and controllable.\"\nYang Jie, Rachael King and Don Clark contributed to this article.\nWrite to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com\n 05:55 ET (10:55 ",

      "text": "By Eva Dou\nBEIJING--Tough new Chinese cybersecurity rules are providing a rare, behind-the-scenes look at a regulatory skirmish between U.S. technology companies and Beijing.\nChina is moving to require software companies, network-equipment makers and other technology suppliers to disclose their proprietary source code, the core intellectual property running their software, to prove their products can't be compromised by hackers.\nTech companies are loath to offer up their source code, saying this will heighten the risk of their code falling into the hands of rivals or malefactors--and may not guarantee it is hack-proof. Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. are among those filing objections.\n\"Sharing source code in itself can't prove the capability to be secure and controllable,\" Microsoft wrote in comments released by a government cybersecurity committee in November. \"It only proves there is source code.\"\nIntel said a rule forcing chip makers to disclose the details of their products \"would hurt technological innovation and decrease the security level of products.\"\nThe comments were made in a discussion log made public by Technical Committee 260, the national cybersecurity standards maker, as it released technical parameters of its omnibus cybersecurity law adopted Nov. 7.\nThe committee is rolling out standards for operating systems, microprocessors, office software and other products to comply with the regulations when they go into force in June 2017.\nChinese authorities have said these measures are necessary to guard against foreign espionage tools being embedded in software used here. They frequently cite claims by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that such back doors were routinely built into U.S. technology products sold overseas.\nMicrosoft, Intel and IBM were the largest U.S. firms to respond to the draft regulations, joining dozens of Chinese companies, government agencies and security experts.\nThe three U.S. tech giants declined to comment beyond their written statements. All three have multiple China ventures with local partners and are typically reluctant to publicly challenge Chinese policy. As such, their written comments, made in Chinese, offer a rare glimpse into how they parry over regulations with Beijing authorities.\nAmong other things, tech companies are bristling at the level of detail they would be forced to disclose to have their proprietary technologies rated \"secure and controllable.\"\nMicrosoft wrote that it believed allowing visitors to view code at its new \"Transparency Center\" in Beijing should suffice, rather than having to \"share source code.\" Technical Committee 260 staffers disagreed, maintaining the original wording and marking the comment \"not accepted.\"\nMicrosoft and Intel also raised questions over one security standard that gives a higher ranking to products whose development and delivery can't be disrupted by \"politics,\" with Intel requesting clarification.\nThat complaint was marked \"partially accepted,\" although political consideration is still in the most recent draft.\nIBM said that distinctions should be made between computing services for commercial use, versus services for government applications.\n\"Computing rooms used purely for commercial cloud computing purposes shouldn't have to be located within China's borders,\" wrote IBM.\nIn a written response, Technical Committee 260 staffers said that many sectors touch upon social stability and the public interest. \"It's not only a pure commercial question.\"\nJeremie Waterman, senior director for Greater China at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said there is \"deep concern about the IP disclosure requirements.\" But it isn't clear what recourse U.S. tech companies might have.\nDespite any objections, U.S. firms are unlikely to leave China over the cybersecurity requirements because of the importance of the mammoth Chinese market, said James Gong, a senior associate at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills LLP who works with western clients in navigating Chinese law.\n\"I don't think they will pull out,\" said Mr. Gong. \"I haven't heard of any company that has decided to leave.\"\nChina has long had cybersecurity standards that weren't vigorously enforced--but that is likely to change when the nationwide cybersecurity law goes into effect next summer, he said.\nBeijing maintains that its security rules apply to domestic and foreign companies equally. When China passed the cybersecurity law last month, a spokesman for the internet regulator said foreigners who thought the law would favor domestic firms had a \"misunderstanding, a biased view.\"\nBut in Technical Committee 260's discussions, certain government officials argued for the standards to be drafted to favor domestic companies.\n\"The big trend is called shifting to domestic production,\" wrote Guo Qiquan, chief engineer at the China Ministry of Public Security's Network Security Bureau, in a suggestion that the committee marked \"approved.\" \"But it can't be written that way, so one calls it independent and controllable.\"\nYang Jie, Rachael King and Don Clark contributed to this article.\nWrite to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com\n 05:33 ET (10:33 ",

      "text": "December 1, 2016 at 12:09 am \nI’ve been using windows phones for about two years now and that was out of necessity due to office suite running better on these phones than any other and the price was better, I don’t like paying 700 for a phone, I got my windows phone from Microsoft for 150, does everything I need it to do. App’s? Apps seem to be dying, I use apps less and less, most websites are mobile optimized and I can get full function on my windows phone and I see that trend continuing. Plus apps just cram up your storage and drag your battery down. I do hate to see that Microsoft will eliminate the lumia phones that were affordable, as mentioned I don’t like to pay 700 for a phone but if I have to I will because I have never been a fan of Apple, and Samsung just got to be more than I needed with their Galaxy phones which I used for many years starting with the first Galaxy which I purchased when I left being a Blackberry user. Why didn’t Microsoft buy Blackberry instead of Nokia? That seems like a better fit since Microsoft is largely an enterprise level company and Blackberry to this day is still a champion of governments for their encryption abilities and they were synonymous with productivity prior to Apple dominating the smartphone landscape but Apple in my opinion is not a business or government phone its a fancy consumer device as is most Android devices although the higher end Android devices in combination with Google Docs is a fairly productive and worthy business phone, especially with their mapping. But I’ll stick with Windows phones now, I like the simple OS, three main screens makes it easy to navigate, Android is hit or miss depending on the manufacturer and what their spin on the OS is, I particularly dislike several major brands versions of Android and the calling features some of them use make it difficult to simply answer the phone. I hope Microsoft doesn’t allow other manufacturers to start screwing with their OS for phones when it has taken them forever to finally get this close to being where they should have been ten years ago when the then CEO was not Bill Gates that much is obvious, the new CEO of Microsoft has a good vision for the company and their productivity suite is still the best although google docs will get the job done for most people it is as far behind Office as Windows phones OS is behind Android in terms of absolute ability. But the new surface phone looks like it will erase that divide in one fast swoop, but I do not see the surface phone or Microsoft ever gaining more than 10% of the market without an entry level phone to attract young users and indoctrinate them to the Microsoft universe.",

      "text": "Cloud Computing Features Met police chooses Microsoft Azure for storing body-worn camera data Cloud from Microsoft allows for automatic uploading of video evidence and the ability to keep it forever and ever Tamlin Magee \nTamlin is online editor at ComputerworldUK and Techworld. He has previously covered a wide range of beats at a variety of publications, from European channel markets, enterprise cloud and privacy to architecture, design, film and music. He is particularly interested in the intersection between technology, the political sphere and the day-to-day. Follow: LinkedIn Google Plus \nThe Metropolitan Police in London has chosen Microsoft Azure as the cloud platform to store video evidence from body-worn cameras, manufactured by Taser, in a programme that will be rolled out in all London boroughs. \nFollowing a trial programme that equipped 3,500 police officers with the technology, the Met now intends to provide every front-line member of the Met with a Body-Worn Video (BWV) camera. The cameras themselves can record roughly 12 hours of footage. When an officer returns to the station, they place the camera in a docking point and the contents of the camera are automatically uploaded. \nDuring this upload, the officer decides whether the video is useful – and if so, categorises it, where it can be stored for an indefinite amount of time. Otherwise, video is automatically deleted after 31 days. Taser subsidiary and camera provider Axon supplies the management software. \nThe servers are hosted on UK soil, and in line with UK data guidance, according to Superintendent Adrian Hutchinson, the lead on mobile technology for the Met and one of the programme’s earliest advocates. \nRead more: Met police picks to store body camera data indefinitely in Microsoft cloud \n“Microsoft is a long-term MPS trusted partner,” says Hutchinson. “They approached us with Axon Taser, with an almost seamless opportunity to store our data securely within the UK. It’s made life a lot easier for the first 3,500 cameras that have been rolled out.” Related GLA chairman wants body worn cameras for front line workers \nHutchinson says that although the data can be stored indefinitely, the Met follows “all the UK guidelines around data storage and work with a lot of people like the Office of the Surveillance Commission”. \n“We’ve engaged with [NGOs] Big Brother Watch and Liberty, so we follow the standard,” he says. “But [if the video is] for murder, for instance, it could be for life – we have an active weeding policy and we don’t record and retain everything.” \nHowever, Microsoft was recently embroiled in a spat with the American government over access to date from its Outlook.com service in Ireland – despite the servers being located in Ireland. The Justice Department argued that although the data was local, because Microsoft is an American company, it should be allowed access anyway. \nThe courts ruled in Microsoft’s favour, but the Justice Department could still appeal. \nRegardless, Hutchinson says the MPS carried out its due diligence. “Let’s not forget that we use Microsoft products and we have done for many years in sensitive policing operations,” he says. “It’s a UK-based policing operation with a long-term supplier, so we did our due diligence and we’re completely comfortable with Microsoft in their UK base. We are happy with UK legislation and UK storage, which is what we’ve got.” \nRead next: Microsoft Azure vs Amazon AWS public cloud comparison: Which cloud is best for the enterprise?

To try it, put your Surface Studio in Studio Mode (flat down), select the ruler in Windows Ink Workspace, and then place Surface Dial on the screen. The ruler snaps to the position of Surface Dial wherever you place it. Turn Surface Dial to rotate the ruler. \nThe way the options appear on the screen will look a little different depending on whether your Surface Dial is on your desk or on the display, but they work in the same way: press down to see the tools, and rotate to select the one you want.",

      "text": "Bitnami has included  Code Dx  in the first wave of applications published to Microsoft’s Azure Government Cloud Marketplace. Code Dx provides comprehensive tools for software development professionals and quality assurance experts to test applications for vulnerabilities, pinpointing issues in the actual code.\n\nWith the recent attention and focus on application security—along with the tools Code Dx provides to ensure software development compliance with standards found in regulations like the DISA-STIG —government and eligible private entities alike will benefit from the greater availability and utility offered by the Azure Government Cloud platform.\n\nWith lightweight, secure access to cloud-based, physically isolated instances of Code Dx, users can quickly aggregate the results of multiple analysis tools, compare them to a wide range of industry security standards (such as OWASP Top 10), and triage identified vulnerabilities based on severity. With deployment on the Azure Government Cloud Marketplace, both new and existing users can access Code Dx on this new platform in addition to the various other deployment options already available. \n\nFor government and government-affiliated agencies, this represents a secure solution to a complex problem, but private entities also have to contend with vulnerability identification, management, and remediation, as well as ensuring compliance with regulations like HIPAA . Deployment on the Azure Government Cloud Marketplace platform gives these users the same benefits of security and cloud-based access. \n\nTo spread awareness about application security—what developers, government organizations, and security professionals need to know about it, how it’s different from network security, and what needs to be the focus in the future—and to explain some of the highlights of Code Dx’s utility, Bitnami and Code Dx are hosting a webinar on December 6, 2016, at 10 AM PST.

      "text": "December 1, 2016 at 12:09 am \nI’ve been using windows phones for about two years now and that was out of necessity due to office suite running better on these phones than any other and the price was better, I don’t like paying 700 for a phone, I got my windows phone from Microsoft for 150, does everything I need it to do. App’s? Apps seem to be dying, I use apps less and less, most websites are mobile optimized and I can get full function on my windows phone and I see that trend continuing. Plus apps just cram up your storage and drag your battery down. I do hate to see that Microsoft will eliminate the lumia phones that were affordable, as mentioned I don’t like to pay 700 for a phone but if I have to I will because I have never been a fan of Apple, and Samsung just got to be more than I needed with their Galaxy phones which I used for many years starting with the first Galaxy which I purchased when I left being a Blackberry user. Why didn’t Microsoft buy Blackberry instead of Nokia? That seems like a better fit since Microsoft is largely an enterprise level company and Blackberry to this day is still a champion of governments for their encryption abilities and they were synonymous with productivity prior to Apple dominating the smartphone landscape but Apple in my opinion is not a business or government phone its a fancy consumer device as is most Android devices although the higher end Android devices in combination with Google Docs is a fairly productive and worthy business phone, especially with their mapping. But I’ll stick with Windows phones now, I like the simple OS, three main screens makes it easy to navigate, Android is hit or miss depending on the manufacturer and what their spin on the OS is, I particularly dislike several major brands versions of Android and the calling features some of them use make it difficult to simply answer the phone. I hope Microsoft doesn’t allow other manufacturers to start screwing with their OS for phones when it has taken them forever to finally get this close to being where they should have been ten years ago when the then CEO was not Bill Gates that much is obvious, the new CEO of Microsoft has a good vision for the company and their productivity suite is still the best although google docs will get the job done for most people it is as far behind Office as Windows phones OS is behind Android in terms of absolute ability. But the new surface phone looks like it will erase that divide in one fast swoop, but I do not see the surface phone or Microsoft ever gaining more than 10% of the market without an entry level phone to attract young users and indoctrinate them to the Microsoft universe.",
