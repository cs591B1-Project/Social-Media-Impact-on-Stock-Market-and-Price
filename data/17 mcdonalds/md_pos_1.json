      "text": "Exciting news for Nutella lovers! McDonald's Italy introduced the \"Sweety con Nutella\" to its menu and it's basically a Nutella hamburger. Fair warning: If you hate Nutella, you're going to hate this.\nMade up of lots of gooey and delicious Nutella wedged between burger buns — it (thankfully) doesn't involve any meat. Just Nutella and carbs. The dream, IMO.\n The good news for those who hate this is that it's only available at McCafé's in Italy.\nIf you love it, though, bad news: It doesn't look like the Sweety con Nutella is coming to the United States any time soon, so you're going to have to fake it. Get hamburger buns from McDonald's and then add ~all~ of the Nutella to DIY. How's that for a McDonald's menu hack ?\nAdd this to the list of things that need to come to American McDonald's.\nFor more food news and magical recipes, follow Cosmo Bites on Facebook !\nFollow Danielle on Instagram and Twitter .\n ",

(McDonald's) \nMcDonald’s has released a new sweet burger oozing with the popular hazelnut and chocolate spread, Nutella. \nUnlike the fast-food chain’s iconic Big Mac, the “Sweety con Nutella” has no meat, no cheese and no pickles. \nInstead, a soft roll is filled to the brim with the creamy and indulgent spread manufactured by Italian company, Ferrero. \n“You will not be able to resist,” the official announcement on Facebook teased. \nDespite a limited launch to McDonald’s franchises in Italy, the new burger has captured the attention of sugar fiends world-wide. \nMore than 71,000 people have “liked” the post on social media. \nMcDonald's is yet to announce whether the burger will reach Australian shores. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2016 ",

      "text": "FarkIt \nFor the first time ever McDonald’s is testing a new style of Big Mac: Sriracha style. \nThe golden arches will be adding a spicy Sriracha sauce option to the burger, but as of right now, it is only available at 126 restaurants in Columbus, Ohio. \nCustomers will also be able to sample the Srircha Mac sauce as a dip for their fries and McNuggets, because McDonald’s really does think of everything. \nFranchise spokeswoman Becca Hary labelled this a “milestone for McDonald’s.” \nIf the taste test is successful in Ohio, the franchise will expand the new burger to restaurants across North America. \n— McDonald's SoCal (@McDonalds_SoCal) July 26, 2016 \nMeanwhile, all the way over in Italy, the chain has latched onto yet another food trend with their new Nutella burger, dubbed the “Sweety con Nutella.” \nWhile the burger has the usual baby soft buns, instead of any meat between them, you’ll find nothing but a gooey slab of Nutella hazelnut and cocoa spread.

      "text": "@ Schlemazel : McDonald’s is not worth billions by selling quality food \nI remember saying something similar to this to my mother once, only to have her tell me how wrong I was. She said you don’t appreciate how good McDonald’s is because you never ate at any of the really awful places there used to be until the big chains put them out of business. The mass produced stuff isn’t great, but it effectively puts a floor on how bad everyone else can be. Mom and pop can’t compete with McDonald’s on price, so the only way they can stay in business is by charging more for better quality. \nThere’s something similar with the music business. A small-time act can’t compete with the big pop acts by promoting themselves better or having better production values; they can only compete by being better musicians and writers. Actually, that’s not quite true; they can also compete by charging less, playing in smaller venues, etc. Your local coffee shop/bar/tiny night club probably has some local musicians trying to work their way up that way. Some of them may be better than the mass produced stuff, but you can sure as hell find a lot worse there, too. Reply",

      "text": "McDonald's said Tuesday it is expanding a test of fresh beef burgers after a trial run in Texas got a positive response. The world's largest burger chain's experimentation is part of its effort to change the public's perception of its food quality and freshness.\nThe fresh beef test, which had been at 55 restaurants across the Dallas-Fort Worth area, now has expanded to include 75 restaurants across northeast Oklahoma. The test of never-frozen beef only includes Quarter Pounder patties, not the smaller patties that come on hamburgers and Big Macs. \nFresh beef represents a huge opportunity for McDonald's but also a substantial risk. It means a big change to the process of food delivery and preparation. But McDonald's has shown willingness over the last two years to make big changes to its food to improve still-sluggish foot traffic, and to draw in a younger crowd that prefers \"better burger\" rivals like Shake Shack, Epic Burger or Five Guys. Wendy's also has been ramping up marketing efforts recently behind its own fresh beef. \nMcDonald's has made other changes to its food, including removing high fructose corn syrup from its buns, swapping margarine for butter on its Egg McMuffins, moving toward chicken without antibiotics, and stripping out preservatives from its chicken nuggets. It's also changed the way its food is prepared in order to improve the taste, such as toasting buns and searing beef differently. \nIt's not clear how long the fresh beef test will last before the chain will consider offering it at restaurants nationwide, or if that will happen at all. \nMcDonald's always does a trial run when it makes changes to its food or adds new menu items to make sure customers respond before a national rollout. The Oak Brook-based burger chain tends to favor Texas to start tests involving beef because burgers make up a bigger percentage of average sales at restaurants there. It tends to focus on spots like Atlanta for chicken, the Northeast for coffee and California for salads. \nsbomkamp@chicagotribune.com \nTwitter @SamWillTravel \n  McDonald's",

      "text": "Home > News > Quick Service > McDonald’s expands fresh beef test McDonald’s expands fresh beef test 75 locations in Oklahoma will now try fresh Quarter Pounders   \nMcDonald’s Corp. is expanding its fresh beef test to 75 locations in the Tulsa, Okla., area, as the burger giant takes increasingly aggressive steps to improve its reputation. \nThe 75 locations will now get quarter pound burgers made with fresh beef cooked when ordered, including the Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Quarter Pounder Deluxe and Bacon Clubhouse Burger. \n“These burgers are hotter and juicer than our previous quarter pound patties and are made with fresh, 100-percent North American beef that’s simply seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper,” McDonald’s chef Chad Schafer said in a statement. \nThe company started testing fresh beef patties at restaurants in the Dallas market earlier this year. The expansion of that test suggests McDonald’s is getting more serious about the strategy. \nMcDonald’s is working to burnish its quality credentials as it seeks to reverse a traffic slump dating back years amid intense competition from convenience stores and fast-casual chains. \nMcDonald’s routinely finishes last in various customer surveys about quality. In Nation’s Restaurant News’ annual Consumer Picks survey this year, for instance, McDonald’s finished 110th out of 112 quick-service chains. \nThe company is intent on changing that under CEO Steve Easterbrook. The chain removed antibiotics from its chicken and started using cage-free eggs. It expanded all-day breakfast, which gets high marks from customers. It’s planning a promotion next year offering different sizes of Big Mac and is testing Big Macs made with Sriracha sauce. \nMcDonald’s removed high fructose corn syrup from its buns and switched to using butter instead of margarine. In addition, McDonald’s is offering a menu of customizable sandwiches at an expanded number of locations, called TasteCrafted. \nFresh beef would be a significant change for a chain that has been primarily designed around cooking flash-frozen beef patties that are pre-made and then held in warming bins to be used on demand. \nPreparing fresh beef patties to order could improve the flavor of the burgers while also giving McDonald’s a way to market its quality improvement. \n“These new fresh beef Quarter Pounder burgers are one of the ways McDonald’s is continuing to test updates to our menu and focus on quality preparation,” Lance Richards, vice president of menu strategy for McDonald’s, said in a statement. \nYet the switch would be a dramatic change for the chain’s operators that would have to adapt to cooking patties to order. And it could be a major change for a supply chain that currently delivers frozen beef patties to 14,000 U.S. restaurants. \nDoing so could risk the speed so important to the chain, especially the 70 percent of customers who go through the drive thru. It could also increase complexity, and only some of its burgers — and not its iconic Big Mac — will be made with fresh beef. \nThere’s also some concern this move to fresh beef could put the company at a greater risk of a foodborne illness outbreak, though numerous other chains like rival Wendy’s have long used fresh beef. \nAnd Wendy’s, like McDonald’s, gets much of its business through the drive thru. \nWendy’s, for its part, has been highlighting its use of fresh beef in videos in recent weeks. \nContact Jonathan Maze at Follow him on Twitter at @jonathanmaze \n​Photo courtesy of McDonald's",

      "text": "Q. My boyfriend of one year and I have an apartment together. He works at McDonald's. I have a job basically guaranteed there, and have had trouble finding work elsewhere. I'm already friends with almost everybody there. They always come to our place after work. I've never had a job before. I've heard so many horror stories about couples working together, especially if they also live together.\nShould I work with him, or would it be a bad idea for our relationship? He's about to be made a manager, so he'd be my boss. Could that make a difference?\nA. You may not have work experience, but you have good instincts on relationships. It is somewhat risky to join the workplace where your boyfriend would be your boss.\nKeep looking elsewhere for a job, or ask if you can be recommended to another McDonald's location.\nIf you do end up working together, set up some agreed boundaries beforehand, e.g. no personal arguments on the job, no sharing personal details about each other with colleagues, and definitely no put-downs or work criticisms delivered in front of others.\nQ. I'm a male, 19, finished my first year of university.\nA student I befriended, \"X,\" had endured physical and emotional abuse from family who don't accept his sexual orientation.\nI opened up to him, became his friend, tried to help him. A mistake.\nHe's become very demanding. If I don't respond to a text quickly enough, he writes long, vague Facebook posts, explaining how horrible \"J\" is, among other mind games. He jumps to irrational conclusions about me. I know this \"J\" is me, as he's told me so.\nIf he's upset with me, he goes behind my back and tells people secrets I've told him — secrets that have damaged relationships.\nI'm pretending to still be his friend. I want to move on, but have no choice. He has dirt on me, and I fear if I cut ties he'll ruin my current relationship.\nA. \"Dirt\" doesn't harm you for long, when you confront it. Be open with your current relationship, tell him that \"X\" is likely to try to come between you, and why.\nIf this affects things between you, at least you have nothing more to fear. Since you'll be sincerely trying to save the relationship, you may be able to make up.\nX's bullying will continue unless you head him off this way. He'll eventually sense your disinterest in the friendship, and ramp up the pressure.\nBetter to be upfront with close people, and also try to avoid sharing \"secrets\" with people who are emotionally needy.\nQ. I recently moved back home after graduating university. My mother's redecorating, with horrible taste. She's also very indecisive.\nBeing an artist, I have an eye for these things. She asks me for decorating advice, but never agrees.\nIf I tell her the truth about her choice, she gets upset. I told her I'm not going to take part in the decorative process because we clearly have different taste, and she doesn't like when I'm honest.\nBut she still asks me for my opinions!\nA. Her house, her rights to decorate, as she will.\nThis is a mother-daughter power struggle dressed up in new materials.\nShe's indecisive, that's her nature. She asks your input as a gesture to acknowledge your artist's \"eye.\" However, it doesn't change her personal taste or her indecision.\nWhen you eventually move out, your own place — decorated by you with your own money — will look very different from hers.\nFeedback\nRegarding the issue of whether to visit people with dementia in nursing homes.\nReader: \"A few years ago, I met an elderly gentleman who came to visit his friend at a palliative care home where I worked.\n\"I got to know him and one day asked why he was rushing off back to Toronto. He said, \"Every day I visit my wife at the nursing home. I've been married to her for over 60 years and we're still very devoted to one another but she suffers from dementia.\"\n\"I asked if she still remembers him and knows who he is. He responded, 'No, but I still know her.' \"\nEllie: Once, when I'd gone for a walk with my mother, who was in similar condition, she said, \"You're such a nice girl. Whose daughter are you, dear?\"\nIt was enough to know she was enjoying herself, whoever I was.\n ",

He got to go behind the counter and make his own cheeseburger, which is his absolute favorite menu item. \nRonald McDonald was on hand to greet Jude as well. \nJude has overcome lots in his 7 years on earth: he suffered a stroke before he was even born, and doctors weren't sure he'd ever walk or talk, much less make his own cheeseburger! \nHappy birthday, Jude!",
