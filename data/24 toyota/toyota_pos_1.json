      "text": "Daniel Suarez celebrates in Victory Lane after winning the NASCAR Truck Series Lucas Oil 150 at Phoenix International Raceway Photo by Blaine Ohigashi/Getty Images Daniel Suarez, Toyota wins first career NASCAR Trucks race at Phoenix Mexican driver now has wins in both the Trucks and Xfinity Series \nNovember 12, 2016 Pinterest Email \nWilliam Byron’s bitter disappointment proved a boon for two of his Kyle Busch Motorsports teammates in Friday night’s Lucas Oil 150 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race at Phoenix International Raceway.When the engine in Byron’s No. 9 Toyota expired on Lap 141 of 150 – ending the championship run for the series’ most prolific winner this year – Kyle Busch Motorsports teammate Daniel Suarez took over the race lead and went on to score the first NCWTS victory of his career.Byron’s elimination from the inaugural Camping World Truck Series Chase also helped teammate Christopher Bell, who claimed the last berth in the Championship 4 with a seventh-place finish. Bell joins second-place finisher Johnny Sauter, third-place Matt Crafton and fifth-place Timothy Peters with a chance to win the title next Friday at Homestead-Miami Speedway (8 p.m. ET on FS1).Suarez pulled ahead of Sauter after a restart with four laps left and led by .510 seconds when he crossed the finish line for the final time.“He was running a perfect race and things like this happen,\" Suarez said of the demise of his teammate, who had led 112 of the first 137 laps before his engine began to fail. \"The first victory in any series is always the most difficult to get.\"I'm just very proud of this team for their effort. They've done a really good job all year. I’m very happy that we were able to get the win for KBM and Toyota.\"Byron’s engine issue was sudden and unexpected.“We had been running hot a little bit the last run – kind of all night,” Byron said. “It stayed within 10 (degree) range, but it started to vibrate, maybe the lap before… but it didn’t seem like a big deal, then it sputtered and flames came out from underneath the truck.”And now Bell will race for the championship instead of the 18-year-old Byron, who has posted a series-best six victories in his rookie season.Seeking a sweep of the Round of 6 after victories at Martinsville and Texas, Sauter couldn’t catch Suarez in the four-lap run to the finish.“We had a great truck, especially on the long runs,” said Sauter, whose No. 21 Silverado is the only Chevrolet in the Championship 4. “Unfortunately, I just could not get going in the short run. I was just extremely loose…“I knew at the end there I needed to get a really, really good restart, and I didn’t get the restart I needed. I’ve got nobody to blame but myself for that. But I’m just proud of everybody’s effort. We just needed to keep pushing. Even though everybody says there’s no pressure, there’s always pressure – this is racing.”Crafton and Peters were one point apart entering the race and battled in close quarters for most of the race. Until Byron’s engine blew, they were contesting the final position at Homestead until Bell fell back on a late restart.“There wasn’t a lap that wasn’t tense,” Crafton said. “We just raced hard from the beginning to the end.”Note: Toyota clinched its ninth manufacturer’s championship in 13 seasons since entering the Truck Series in 2004. \nResults \n1.

REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen/File Photo \nNovember 17, 2016 \nTOKYO (Reuters) – Toyota Motor Corp said on Thursday it would create a new in-house team to develop electric vehicles as the Japanese automaker speeds up its efforts to develop more of the lower-emission cars. \nToyota said the team would consist of four people – one each from the automaker, machine manufacturer Toyota Industries Corporation, and parts suppliers Aisin Seiki Co and Denso Corp. \nThe automaker, which has invested heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles as the most promising “green” alternative to conventional cars, this month said it would like to have the option of developing full-sized electric vehicles. \n(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)",

      "text": "TOKYO: Toyota Motor Corp is setting up a new in-house unit to develop electric cars, offering its strongest endorsement yet of a technology it has not embraced wholly, as take up of a rival technology it pioneered remains slow.\nJapan's biggest automaker said on Thursday it will launch next month a unit that will start with four persons and be responsible for planning a strategy for developing and marketing electric cars to keep pace with tightening global emissions regulations.\nThe unit will expand by drawing upon engineers, designers and other personnel from various sections of the company as needed.\nThe announcement comes after Toyota, which has invested heavily in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), this month said it would like to have the option of developing full-sized electric vehicles.\nEven as rivals such as Nissan Motor Co, Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, Toyota had said it would reserve electric vehicles for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times.\nToyota has been developing ultra-compact electric vehicles for years. But by adding longer-range models to its product range, it would be changing its tune from promoting FCVs and plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars as the most promising alternative to conventional cars.\n\"The company's position is changing. They still talk about hybrids and fuel cells but I think there is a recognition that battery electric cars are getting a lot of traction right now,\" CASA analyst Chris Richter said.\n\"It's going to take an awful long time before fuel cells are a competitive alternative to electric vehicles. In the meantime, a lot of things are going on right now (with battery electric cars) and they need to be there,\" Richter said.\nThe new unit would initially consist of one person each from the automaker and three group companies. These are machine manufacturer Toyota Industries Corporation, and parts suppliers Aisin Seiki Co and Denso Corp.\n\"Regulations on lower emissions vehicles are changing very quickly, so we also have to respond quickly,\" spokesman Itsuki Kurosu said.\n\"With its small size, the new venture will be able to be more nimble in its planning and decision making, to speed up the process to develop electric cars.\"\nToyota has pledged to make all of its vehicles essentially emissions-free by 2050.\n(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n ",

      "text": "By : Graham King , Editor The Japanese automaker has formed a new 'venture' company that will lead its new EV strategy. \nToyota has announced it will set up an “in-house venture company” to lead its accelerated push to launch an electric car. \nThe Japanese automaker led the industry with hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, but has been a firm sceptic about pure electric vehicles. Last week it was reported a major change of strategy will see a Toyota EV launched by 2020. \nThe task force will be staffed by one person from each of the four Toyota companies: Toyota Industries Corp., Aisin Seiki Co. Ltd., Denso Corp., and Toyota Motor Corp. The company will operate independently of other management structures within the Toyota Group, enabling it work quickly and nimbly. \nThe venture company’s “small organizational structure is meant to enable it to implement unconventional work processes, leading to accelerated project progress and, thus, fast-to-market products,” Toyota said in a statement. \nJapanese newspaper Nikkei reported last week that Toyota has formed a new research and development team tasked with creating an EV capable of driving 300 kilometers (186 miles) on a single charge. The first car is anticipated to be ready by 2020, initially going on sale Japan before being rolled out to other EV-centric markets like California and China. \nToyota remains committed to fuel cell vehicles like the Mirai, which it describes as “the ultimate eco-car”. However, it concedes that market demands mean a pure EV is now necessary. \n“Differing energy and infrastructure issues around the world and the rapid strengthening of regulations aimed at increasing the use of zero-emissions vehicles have heightened the need for product lineups that can respond to various situations,” Toyota said. \nToyota Motor president Akio Toyoda said of the new outfit: “As a venture company that will specialize in its field and embrace speed in its approach to work, it is my hope that it will serve as a pulling force for innovation in the work practices of Toyota and the Toyota Group.” \nToyota closed its underperforming association with Tesla in 2014. The project led to the production of 2,000 electric RAV4s . Be part of something big About this article",

      "text": "Toyota confirms it will develop electric vehicles A team of four employees from across its businesses will work on creating an electric vehicle. Share Save \nToyota's still adamant that it's going to get the world hooked on hydrogen-powered cars in our (hopefully) green future. But in the meantime, it's decided to dive head-first into building its first all-electric vehicle to take on Tesla. The carmaker has announced that it's launching a \"virtual\" company to examine and develop EVs. The business will have four employees, each one from a different part of the Toyota Group's various subsidiaries and suppliers. \nThis sort of startup-within-a-corporation model is often used by companies that are struggling to innovate. After all, big ideas can often be crushed by layers of middle management, budget concerns and a desire to protect the status quo. The four-person team will include a warm body from Toyota Motor, Aisin Seiki, Denso and Toyota Industries, with the instructions to develop an EV that'll give Tesla nightmares. \nThe company is also admitting that it may be -- slightly -- swimming against the tide when it comes to promoting the fuel cell . In its release, the firm admits that hydrogen is the superior technology for range, refueling and convenience. But, it concedes that global \"energy and infrastructure issues\" as well as a governmental push for cleaner cars, means that it can't wait around. So, it'll develop and sell battery-powered vehicles that'll work in markets where hydrogen's a no go.",

      "text": "By : Chris Bruce , Editor Can the company overcome the engineering hurdles of adapting hydrogen fuel cells for heavy-duty hauling? \nToyota is announcing a feasibility study for a hydrogen fuel-cell-powered semi truck in California. Unfortunately, the company isn’t willing to offer any further information about the project at this time. “Additional details on the study, and the continued evolution of a hydrogen society, will be announced in the coming months,” the green-minded automaker wrote in its announcement. \nThis new project might use an evolution of the FCEV powertrain that Toyota is building for its hydrogen bus in Japan because this is also a commercial vehicle application for the technology. The 600-liters of hydrogen only provides about 124 miles of range, which couldn’t cut it for long-hauling duty. Plus, the system produces 306 horsepower (228 kilowatts) and 494 pound-feet (670 Newton-meters), which far less than half of the torque of what some semi trucks produce. \n\n\nHowever, this existing hydrogen drivetrain would be a place for the development to start. None of these hurdles are impossible to overcome; they merely require smart engineering for finding a solution. We look forward to Toyota releasing more details about the project soon and clarifying what its goals are for making a hydrogen big rig. \nToyota wants to sell at least 100 examples of the hydrogen fuel cell bus at about $1 million each before the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Two of them begin servicing routes there next year. \nMaking this project somewhat more confusing is that neither Toyota nor its Hino commercial truck division currently offers a Class 8 semi in the United States. The company might need a partner for this development if it is serious about putting a hydrogen-fueled big rig on the road. \nToyota is also working on new fuel cell vehicles for buyers who don’t have a commercial driver’s license. For example, it looks like the next-gen Lexus LS could be available with an optional hydrogen powertrain. Just look at the the LF-FC concept for an idea of what to expect. \nSource: Toyota Be part of something big Hide press release Show press release \nToyota Explores Heavy-Duty Hydrogen Fuel Cell Application \nFurthers Commitment to Hydrogen SocietyNovember 17, 2016Toyota has long maintained that hydrogen fuel cell technology could be a zero emission solution across a broad spectrum of vehicle types. The scalability of this technology is enabling the automaker to explore a semi-trailer truck application for a California-based feasibility study.The Toyota Mirai will continue to provide a zero emission driving solution for global customers; a heavy-duty truck sized fuel cell vehicle creates a potential zero-emission freight transportation solution for the future.Additional details on the study, and the continued evolution of a hydrogen society, will be announced in the coming months.

      "text": "Toyota set to win first manufacturers' championship Toyota is essentially locked to win the manufacturer's title in its 10th try.   at 9:55a ET 0Shares \nRegardless of who wins Sunday’s Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway, at least one championship is virtually certain to change hands when the checkered flag drops. \nIf one of the Toyotas in the race — any of the Toyotas — finishes 26th or better, Toyota will take it first NASCAR Sprint Cup Manufacturers’ Championship in its 10th try. \nSignificantly, if Toyota does win, this will be the first season since 2002 that Chevrolet hasn’t won the award. \nIn an exclusive interview with FOXSports.com Thursday, Toyota’s U.S. racing boss said that while winning the manufacturers’ title will be an important milestone for the company and its employees, what he really wants is a second consecutive driver championship. \n“I would without hesitation trade all the manufacturers’ championships in the world for a driver’s championship,” said David Wilson, the president of TRD, U.S.A. “Because that’s what this sport is.” \nAs for the manufacturers’ title, Wilson said, “I would love that to be the icing on the cake, with the cake being another driver’s championship.” Photo: Chris Trotman \nIn that respect, Wilson said, the team title is very different in NASCAR than in Formula One or IndyCar, which are less driver-centric. \nThe manufacturers’ title will come in Toyota’s 10th season of trying and with only two fully funded teams — the four cars from Joe Gibbs Racing and one from Furniture Row Racing. \n“What I’m most proud of is that we’re going to do it having basically five cars on the track capable of winning,” said Wilson. “That’s hard to do.” \nAnd with Kyle Busch and Carl Edwards still in the field, there’s a 50-50 chance of getting another driver title, too. \n“What’s good about having two drivers (in the final) is you have two bullets in your gun,” said Wilson. “If something happens — if Kyle loses a tire or something unexpected happens, then you have another shot at it. Certainly, we’re excited.” \nSunday’s championship race will feature the Toyotas of Busch and Edwards, Joey Logano’s Team Penske Ford and Jimmie Johnson in a Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet. \n“It’s great that all three manufacturers are going to be able to fight for a championship,” said Wilson. “If we are fortunate enough to win a championship this year, it will mean even more because we beat not just Chevy but we beat Ford as well.” 0",

      "text": "Daniel Suarez won at Homestead-Miami Speedway on Saturday to cap his second season in the NASCAR Xfinity Series with a championship.   Daniel Suarez, Toyota make history with NASCAR Xfinity Series championship Mexican driver is first Latin American driver to win major NASCAR title \n  \nDaniel Suarez made history on Saturday by winning the Ford EcoBoost 300 and capturing the NASCAR Xfinity Series championship. \nWith the accomplishment, Suarez became the first foreign born driver to capture a NASCAR national toruing championship. The 24-year-old was the championship control driver for a large majority of the race and survived a restart with three laps to go to capture the crown. \nThe race was not without controversy as Cole Whitt elected to stay out on old tires and led the field to the green. Whitt spent the entire race outside the top-15 prior to that point and could not get his car rolling in front of Erik Jones and Justin Allgaier. \nWhitt fell all the way back to 18 th by the end of the race, essentially where he would have started had he pitted alongside the rest of the field. \nThis decision essentially allowed Suarez to surge ahead of Elliott Sadler and run away with the race and the championship. He won three races this season for Joe Gibbs Racing and will return to defend his crown next season. Daniel Suarez celebrates his victory on Saturday in Florida.   \nBy Matt Weaver",

      "text": "Saturday, Nov 19th, 2016 @ 4:44 pm Toyota has created a skunkworks team focused on bringing an electric vehicle to market. The Aichi-based company has been an EV holdout for decades, throwing their lot in with hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. However, it announced this week that it was building an \"in-house venture company responsible for developing electric vehicles\" and will consist of only four people. Toyota has kept the group small so that it can be flexible and work with unconventional methods compared to those in traditional Toyota system, which the company hopes will lead to accelerated progress and products that come quickly to market. The quartet will consist of one individual each from Toyota Motor Corporation, Toyota Industries Corporation and suppliers Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd. and Denso Corporation. While Toyota maintains that fuel cell vehicles are the \"ultimate eco-car\" due to cruising ranges and fill-up times comparable to gasoline cars, it says it must develop EVs as a result of varying energy infrastructures found throughout the world. After many years of reluctance, it seems the company is admitting that there are many paths to zero-emissions cars. \n ",

      "text": " Evergreen\nSince 2000 this innovative program has helped connect 1.2 million students to nature\nTORONTO , Nov. 21, 2016 /CNW/ - One of Evergreen's longest standing partnerships and largest educational initiatives, the Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds (TELG) program continues to help Canadian students and teachers transform their school grounds into healthy places to learn, play and connect with nature. This year, the national program led by Evergreen with support from Toyota Canada and its dealerships, helped 559 schools with their efforts to green their outdoor spaces, engaging 48,245 students and staff.\nThe TELG program is at the forefront of the school ground greening movement. Since 2000, the partnership has provided millions of dollars of support through hands-on expertise, training, publications and grants to over 6,000 schools across Canada , reaching close to 1.2 million elementary and secondary school students and 96,000 teachers and school staff. The scope of the TELG's impact inspired Evergreen to cofound the International School Ground Alliance in 2011.\nGreen school grounds aim to inspire discovery and learning, increase physical activity, motivate teachers and students, and support environmental awareness and stewardship.\nEach project offers a unique opportunity for schools to engage with the greater community, including the active support role many Toyota dealerships have played in their local service areas.\n\"Through this innovative long-standing initiative, students and staff each year have access to expert hands-on environmental learning and the unique opportunity to design and create their school's new outdoor space,\" says Geoff Cape , Evergreen CEO. \"Toyota's incredible commitment to this work continues to encourage a life-long passion for play and learning in nature that builds a caring relationship with the natural world – a foundation for building sustainable and flourishing cities.\"\n\"Toyota's commitment to enriching communities and establishing a future society in harmony with nature is at the core of our collaboration with Evergreen,\" says Larry Hutchinson , President and CEO, Toyota Canada Inc. \"Toyota Canada is proud of the impact the Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds program has had over the past 16 years, providing everyday opportunities for students to engage with nature on Canada's school grounds.\"\nThis year, for its 25 th anniversary, Evergreen launched the Evergreen City Builders Awards and partnered with Toyota to recognize outstanding innovation in children's nature playgrounds with the Toyota Playground Placemaker Award. The award recipient, Sandy Clee , Senior Planner at the Simcoe County District School Board in Midhurst, Ontario supported the transformation of 87 early year schoolyards from barren outdoor expanses to dynamic natural play and learning spaces.\nSchools participating in the 2015-2016 TELG program have realized their greening goals with a wide variety of outdoor improvements such as a year-round outdoor classroom in North Vancouver , a food and pollinator garden for kindergarten students in Montreal , and an edible garden in Saskatoon to help students and families to learn about and participate in sustainable food growing practices.\nSome of the 2015-2016 schools that have received grants to green their outdoor spaces: (For a link to the full list of schools funded in 2015-2016, visit: https://www.evergreen.ca/get-involved/funding-opportunities/school-ground-grants/ )\nÉcole Rockingham School, Halifax, NS\nÉcole Rockingham School has been funded three times through the Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds program. Each year building on the previous year's work, with newest features including native species of trees for shade, shrub gardens, raised beds for food gardening, stump seating and a log walk under the shade of the existing mature trees. Students held the original vision for the space, and the wider community helped make it a reality. The entire school takes part in lessons outdoors in the shaded seating area lovingly named \"The Grove.\"\nService de garde de l'école St-Zotique , Montréal, QC\nThe École St-Zotique's new school ground addresses the pressing issue of food insecurity in the community. Building from a successful food garden project funded in part by the TELG program in 2015, the daycare, with the help of community parents, plans to create a green corridor of edible native shrubs and plants, pollinator-friendly plants and raised vegetable beds. The school has partnered with the éco-quartier Sud-Ouest (an environment and action program introduced by the city of Montréal) to assist with plant selection and guiding their community planting events.\nRockwood Pubic School, Pembroke, ON\nRockwood Public School's new outdoor space features a unique natural wetland, lovingly called \"The Swamp.\" New seating and shade trees will improve access and usability to this dynamic outdoor learning space. The new outdoor classroom, developed in collaboration with Rockwood students and Algonquin College , was the site of a recent Earth Day bio blitz, where different species of wildlife were identified, counted and catalogued.\nConfederation Park Community School, Saskatoon, SK\nConfederation Park Community School has a six-year history of school food gardening. Twenty raised garden beds, eight in-ground garden beds, an edible food forest and other initiatives teach pre-kindergarten to grade 8 curriculum, including a Nêhiyâwiwin Cree Language and Culture Program. TELG funding this year helps students and their families learn about food sustainability practices and engage in life-long learning.\nHighlands Elementary, North Vancouver, BC\nTeachers at Highlands Elementary have created an outdoor learning space with new native species of trees for shade and plants that have a long history of being used by First Nations in the area. The long-term vision includes installing natural stone boulders and logs for seating and play, and a dry river bed to facilitate teaching around water ecosystems. Youth groups in the neighbourhood such as Girl Guides and Scouts will also access the space for their activities.\nApplication deadlines for the 2016-2017 TELG program are February 10 and April 13, 2017 .\nFor more details and how to apply visit: https://www.evergreen.ca/get-involved/funding-opportunities/school-ground-grants/\nAbout Evergreen: Since 1991, Evergreen, a not-for-profit, has provoked bold action in transforming public landscapes into thriving community spaces.

      "text": "Electric car range to increase 15% with breakthrough Toyota battery discovery Japanese carmaker discovers why batteries hold less charge as they age. November 24, 2016 10:25 GMT Toyota discovers why batteries become worse with age Reuters \nToyota hopes to improve its electric-car range by 15% by the end of the decade, thanks to a breakthrough in observing how batteries work. \nThe company has, it what it claims to be a world-first, discovered how to observe the behaviour of lithium ions in an electrolyte when a battery charges and discharges. As a result, Toyota believes it has found out why batteries age and lose their ability to charge fully as they get older. \nSpeaking to a media briefing at its Tokyo headquarters on 24 November, Toyota said it believes the discovery will lead to a \"10-15%\" increase in electric-car range within the next \"two to three years\". \nThis coincides with when the company is expected to reveal its first all-electric car, which is being developed alongside its hybrid and hydrogen vehicles. \nThe ability to observe the movement of ions within a battery has taken three years of work, Toyota has said, according to Forbes . The process involved the Spring-8 synchrotron , a ring with a 5,000-foot diameter and built around a hill in Japan; inside, scientists bombarded batteries with radiation a billion times stronger than an X-ray to create images captured by a high-speed camera. \nStudying how ions move from the negative to the positive side of the battery over multiple charges, drains and recharges, Toyota found the ions could \"no longer flow freely, they get blocked, and battery performance decreases,\" said Hisao Yamashige, from the carmaker's research and development division. \nYamashige added: \"Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward, for improving this technology and its performance even more.\" \nThe current limit for electric range of production cars is between 200 and 290 miles, as achieved by Tesla and its range of Model S and Model X cars. A 15% increase would see the upper end jump to just over 330m per charge, bringing the electric car ever closer to its internal combustion competitors. More car technology news from IBTimes UK ",

      "text": "Go Toyota's battery 'breakthrough' can lead to more range, longer life All it needs now is a battery-electric vehicle that can use the fruits of Toyota's labor. David Dewhurst \nThe closest thing Toyota has to an EV is the 2017 Prius Prime plug-in hybrid. I don't count the Mirai since it's impossible to own in much of the world. Photo by Toyota \nToyota believes it's found a way to create more efficient EV batteries. \nToyota calls its method, which allows a free flow of lithium ions from the cathode to the anode, the \" world's first behavior observation method for lithium ions in electrolyte .\" \nCharging and discharging batteries can create lithium ion deviation. Some of these ions can get bunched up, which can affect a battery's performance over time. In order to help reduce that bunching, scientists need to see what's happening as the ions flow through the battery's electrolyte. That observation wasn't possible until now. \nToyota made has replaced the phosphorous in a traditional lithium-ion battery electrolyte with heavier elements. These heavier elements, which ferry the ions through the electrolyte, are then bombarded with powerful x-rays, which allows researchers to observe how the ions flow through. \nSo what does this all mean? By observing the lithium ions in the electrolyte, research and development dollars can be spent on preventing the bunching that degrades battery performance. Toyota believes its breakthrough can improve electric vehicle range by up to 15 percent and improve the battery's life simultaneously. \nRight now, Toyota doesn't have a battery electric to which it could apply this knowledge. The company only recently started using lithium-ion batteries in lieu of older, more traditional nickel metal hydride batteries. The company reportedly cut back on hydrogen vehicle development in favor of working on battery-electric vehicles, so these R&D efforts won't go straight to the competition. \nThe science behind battery technology might be enough to put most people to sleep, but it's a vital component for ushering in batteries that have enough charge and a long enough life to appeal to a wide swath of buyers around the world. 30 Funky Prius Prime boasts a charging port, 25 miles electric range Share your voice",

      "text": "By : Graham King , Editor The automaker has been able to observe a phenomenon that limits range and battery life in EVs. \nToyota has made a potentially huge breakthrough in battery technology that it claims will lead to improved range in hybrid and electric vehicles, and longer battery life. \nThe vast majority of hybrids and electric vehicles now use lithium-ion batteries. The lithium ions are contained in the battery’s electrolyte, flowing between the cathode and anode, producing an electric current flow - from the cathode to the anode while charging, and from the anode to the cathode while discharging, \nWhile lithium ions are much more efficient than other substances, they are prone to “deviation” - moving unevenly and clumping - which disrupts the ion flow, limiting range and reducing battery life. \nThough the phenomenon is well known, it had never been observed. Until now. \nWorking with a publically-funded laboratory and four universities in Japan, Toyota has been able to observe and analyze ion deviation. \n“Lithium-ion battery is a key technology for electrifying cars, and there is a clear need, going forward for improving this technology and its performance even more,” Hisao Yamashige, a researcher at Toyota, said at a briefing reported by Automotive News Europe . \nToyota believes it can apply the lessons learned from the observations to improve the range and battery life of electrified vehicles by as much as 15 percent. \nThe limited range they offer has been a major stumbling block in the mass take-up of electric vehicles. \nToyota resisted developing pure electric vehicles for years, preferring to push on with hybrids and fuel cell vehicles. But it recently changed tack, announcing a major push to develop an EV that will hit the market in 2020 . A range of more than 186 miles (300 kilometers) is targeted but, armed with its new knowledge, Toyota may well revise that figure upwards. \nThe automaker has not indicated a timeline for applying its findings, or whether or not it intends to share them.

      "text": "By : Jeff Perez , Editor A new face and a new range of engines will be on display come January. The current-generation Toyota Camry has been on the market since 2011. In 2014, it received a pretty significant facelift for the North American market. But at the 2017 Detroit Auto Show, we’ll see a brand-new example take center stage. The new Camry – which we've seen testing previously – will be just one feature in a trio of exhibits the automaker will have in Detroit. Along with the Toyota display, that triage will include a Lexus press conference and a \"tech showcase,\" though, we’re still not entirely certain what that last one means exactly. With little to no detail to work with in the way of visual cues, outside of the single teaser image seen here, previous spy shots and renders give us our most accurate look as to the proposed new design. A polarizing fascia, more aggressively-styled headlights and taillights, and quad exhaust tips are the most significant revisions. Under the hood, a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is expected to be offered as the base, while a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder will optional, possibly for a performance variant . No word on whether the V6 will carry over, but we expect Toyota to continue to offer the hybrid powertrain. The 2018 Toyota Camry will go on sale late in 2017 for the 2018 model year, but not before it makes its debut in Detroit at the North American International Auto Show. We’ll know more details closer to the official release. Read also:",

      "text": "Honda outselling Toyota in China, sets up photo finish for 2016 \nDecember 2, 2016 \nBy Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu \nBEIJING (Reuters) – Honda Motor Co’s sales in China surpassed those of Toyota Motor Corp for the first 11 months of 2016 as fresh models lured consumers and set the Japanese rivals up for a photo finish for full-year sales ranking in the world’s top auto market. \nChinese consumers have flocked to Honda’s raft of new models, including a new version of the staple Civic sedan as well as particularly strong offerings in the booming sport-utility vehicle (SUVs) segment. \nTo meet rising demand, Japan’s No. 3 automaker plans to break ground on Dec. 8 on a new factory in central China’s Wuhan, according to a media invitation Honda has sent out. \nAuto sales in China remain under pressure from slowing economic growth, with analysts predicting weak growth next year despite a rebound in 2016 thanks to tax incentives. SUVs, though, have been a major exception, with the segment growing 45.6 percent year-to-date, as Chinese warm to larger cars. \nA Beijing-based Toyota spokesman declined to comment on its sales performance vis-à-vis rivals. \n“We don’t have a blind focus on boosting sales,” he said. “Our main objective in China is to achieve steady growth of our business, by focusing on customer satisfaction, including creating a quality sales and service environment.” \nHonda sold roughly 14,500 cars more than Toyota for January to November to surpass it for the first time this year, according to sales reports released by the two firms on Friday, potentially setting up the Tokyo-based company to narrowly overtake Toyota in full-year sales if the trend continues. \n“Beating a particular rival brand isn’t our business objective in China,” a Beijing-based Honda spokeswoman said. “We focus on Chinese consumer needs and feel the strong sales momentum we have in China now is evidence that our strategies are working.” \nHonda has recorded nine consecutive months of double-digit sales growth in China and is nearing its sales target of 1.18 million vehicles, which it revised upward by roughly 100,000 units in October. \nToyota, Japan’s top automaker, met its 1.1 million vehicle sales target as of November. The automaker has traditionally lead its rival in the Chinese market, selling 240,000 cars more than Honda as recently as 2014. \nThe Japanese automakers still trail far behind market leaders General Motors Co and Volkswagen AG <VOWG_p.DE>, which both sold around 3.6 million vehicles last year in China. \n(Reporting by Jake Spring and Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)",
