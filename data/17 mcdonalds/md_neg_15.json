More >> By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.  ",

      "title": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies",
      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. \nThe Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago has died. Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti was 98. \nMcDonald's spokeswoman Kerry Ford confirmed that Delligatti died at home surrounded by his family on Monday night. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown when he invented the chain's signature burger with two all-beef patties, \"special sauce,\" lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions on a sesame seed bun. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \nBut Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger burger and it went over so well it spread to the rest of Delligatti's 47 stores, then went national in 1968.

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies Posted:   2:00 PM EST 2016-11-30 19:00:38  57  43   Wednesday, November 30 2016 1:27 PM EST 2016-11-30 18:27:39   12:  By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.  ",

      "text": "Fight for $15 activists protest outside a Los Angeles McDonald’s. Photo by David McNew/Getty Images The Fight for $15 movement has notched a string of victories over the past couple of years, getting higher minimum wage legislation passed in the states of California and New York as well as several cities. And earlier this month, McDonald’s announced that it was going to begin installing touchscreen ordering kiosks in its restaurants, which should allow restaurants to serve more customers with fewer workers. And in a post for Forbes , former McDonald’s CEO Ed Rensi argues these two trends are connected. “I told you so,” he writes. “In 2013, when the Fight for $15 was still in its growth stage, I and others warned that union demands for a much higher minimum wage would force businesses with small profit margins to replace full-service employees with costly investments in self-service alternatives.” This article is part of New Money , a new section on economics, technology, and business. Now, Rensi says, his prediction is coming true. McDonald’s is just one of several restaurants around the country that are experimenting with automated restaurant technologies. If jurisdictions continue to push up the minimum wage, more and more businesses will look for ways to automate their operations in order to avoid having to pay higher wages. The economic logic of Rensi’s argument is impeccable. If you make the minimum wage high enough, businesses will look for more opportunities for automation and hire fewer workers. The question is whether a $15 minimum wage is high enough to induce a lot of employers to switch to more automated systems. No one knows the answer to this question. Indeed, when I asked two economists on opposite sides of the debate to predict the effects of California’s minimum wage hike earlier this year, they actually had the same response: The increase was so large that we don’t know what’s going to happen. “This will be a big experiment,” economist Arindrajit Dube told me. “It's far outside of our evidence base.\"“ The McDonald’s experiment with touchscreen ordering systems illustrates the potential problem with making high minimum wages effective across big states like California and New York — both of which passed minimum wage increases this year. If McDonald’s automates its locations in Manhattan, San Francisco, and Silicon Valley, displaced workers shouldn’t have too much trouble finding alternative work in the booming economies of these cities as barbers, servers at full-service restaurants, nannies, and so forth. With lots of wealthy customers around, there’s a robust demand for unskilled service workers there. But the outlook might not be so rosy in cities like Fresno, California, or Rochester, New York, where the economy is not booming and average wages are much lower. If a $15 minimum wage causes fast-food jobs to be automated in these cities, workers may not be able to find alternate work. A law designed to put more money in workers’ pockets could wind up putting a lot less money in their pockets instead. It’s easy to get people fired up about an alliterative slogan like “Fight for $15.” But alliteration isn’t necessarily a good way to choose a policy goal. The implicit idea here — that people everywhere should get the same minimum wage whether they live in a booming, expensive metropolis or a struggling town with a low cost of living — doesn’t make a lot of sense.

Michael “Jim” Delligatti was 98.\nMcDonald’s spokeswoman Kerry Ford confirmed that Delligatti died at home surrounded by his family on Monday night.\nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown when he invented the chain’s signature burger with two all-beef patties, “special sauce,” lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions on a sesame seed bun.\nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\nBut Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger burger and it went over so well it spread to the rest of Delligatti’s 47 stores, then went national in 1968.",

However, Delligatti — who went on to own and operate 47 McDonald’s locations — never gave up; and after a little bit of pushing, the Big Mac became a national sensation in 1968 after it was introduced to restaurants all over the U.S. Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you. pic.twitter.com/wmEFrmazdn — McDonald's (@McDonalds) November 30, 2016 \nOn Wednesday, McDonald’s paid tribute to Delliganti via the company’s official Twitter account, writing: “Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael ‘Jim’ Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you.” The fast food chain shared a photo and quote from the fast food inventor, saying: “I never would have dreamed that my creation would turn into a piece of Americana.” \nCan't get enough of Us ?

      "title": "WHOA: McDonald's makes HARDCORE move in response to 'Fight for $15' movement...",
      "text": "There was once a time when conservatives had the luxury of criticizing the minimum wage by stretching it to its logical extremes. In response to someone calling for a $9 or $10 minimum wage (as Obama has in the past), we could say “well, if $9 or $10 is so great, why not $15, $20 or $100 an hour?” There was a time you could stretch that number high enough and liberals would eventually realize there’d be consequences to such a high minimum wage. Unfortunately, we now live in a world where caricatures have become reality. Sen. Elizabeth Warren wonders why we don’t have a $22 minimum wage (see why she doesn’t have much to ponder here ), while former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has rallied behind the “Fight for $15” cause.\nFor the moment, let’s set aside the economic debate over whether the minimum wage costs jobs. (The CBO , majority of economists and majority of empirical studies pretty much say it all.)\n WHOA: McDonald's makes HARDCORE move in response to 'Fight for $15' movement... Quite possibly the BEST news for Christians in some time... OUT\nInstead, let’s take a look at how business is reacting to higher minimum wages nationwide. As Ed Rensi, former president and CEO of McDonald’s USA writes for Forbes Magazine : As the labor union-backed Fight for $15 began yet another nationwide strike on November 29, I have a simple message for the protest organizers and the reporters covering them: I told you so.\nIt brings me no joy to write these words. The push for a $15 starter wage has negatively impacted the career prospects of employees who were just getting started in the workforce while extinguishing the businesses that employed them. I wish it were not so. But it’s important to document these consequences, lest policymakers elsewhere decide that the $15 movement is worth embracing.\nEarlier this month, McDonald’s announced the nationwide roll-out of touchscreen self-service kiosks. In a video the company released to showcase the new customer experience, it’s striking to see employees who once would have managed a cash register now reduced to monitoring a customer’s choices at an iPad-style kiosk.\nIt’s not just McDonald’s that has embraced job-replacing technology. Numerous restaurant chains (both quick service and full service) have looked to computer tablets as a solution for rising labor costs that won’t adversely impact the customer’s experience. Eatsa, a fully-automated restaurant concept, now has five locations—all in cities or states that have embraced a $15 minimum wage. And in a scene stolen from The Jetsons, the Starship delivery robot is now navigating the streets of San Francisco with groceries and other consumer goods. The company’s founder pointed to a rising minimum wage as a key factor driving the growth of his automated delivery business.\nBelow is a photograph of four McDonalds workers earning $15 an hour:\nWell, not really, but you get the point.\nAnd is it really unrealistic to expect other industry leaders can’t help but follow McDonald’s lead? Of course not. In fact, it would be naive to expect otherwise.\nThen again, naivety seems to be a core driver of the “Fight for $15” movement.\n[Note: This post was authored by Matt Palumbo.

      "text": "PITTSBURGH (AP) -- You probably don&apos;t know his name, but you&apos;ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.\nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald&apos;s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98.\nDelligatti&apos;s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain&apos;s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti&apos;s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain&apos;s national menu in 1968.\n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said.\nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald&apos;s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then.\nMcDonald&apos;s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald&apos;s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said.\n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald&apos;s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\"\nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh&apos;s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti&apos;s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.\n\"In franchising, there&apos;s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald&apos;s) listened, and the rest is history.\"\nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald&apos;s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald&apos;s in Pittsburgh&apos;s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh&apos;s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities.\nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald&apos;s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said.\nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti&apos;s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph&apos;s Parish in O&apos;Hara Township.\n ",

Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said.\n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.”\nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.\n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.”\nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities.\nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said.\nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.",

However, people should hold off on sending in-kind donations such as water, food, clothing and the like, for now. \nSkip Tate, spokesman for the Red Cross in Dayton, said those wanting to help can give money by donating online at the Red Cross website . \nDayton Red Cross is accepting small donations of water and food. \nTate said the Red Cross is currently in “response” mode of finding people in need, before shifting to “recovery” mode that includes dispersing the in-kind donations. \nLATEST ON GATLINBURG, TENN. WILDFIRES Photo courtesy of Getty Images \nLocally in the Miami Valley, Baker Salvage Co. on South Saint Clair Street in Dayton is taking donations that a group will drive down to Gatlinburg on Friday evening. The business has a sign out front “Pray for Tennessee.” \nOwner Jake Baker said he just got back from a weekend trip to Gatlinburg in which he saw some devastating images. \n“We’ve all gone down there for years,” Baker said. “Pretty much everybody I’ve talked to, at least 90 percent of the people have gone down there or had some kind of personal touch to the area or nature or something like that. Just kind of breaks your heart to see all that nature and stuff just kind of devastating and burnt to a crisp within minutes.” \nBaker Salvage Co. is seeking donations of water, canned food, pet food and animal kennels of any size. \nMeanwhile, people in Darke County are coming together to help the wildfire victims. \nSgt. Tim Zellers, of Arcanum police, said he and his family often vacation in Tennessee and he is now collecting non-perishable items through Friday to take down. \nThe items can be dropped at several locations, including the Arcanum, Ansonia and Union City police departments, Tri-Village Rescue service station and Milton-Union High School. “Every day basic non-perishable stuff,” Zellers said. “People have lost pretty much everything except the clothes on their back. If you run into a police officer and you give them money we will take that down with them.” Related McDonald's franchisee who created Big Mac dies \nUpdated: Wednesday, November 30, 2016 @ 2:24 PM Published: Wednesday, November 30, 2016 @ 1:31 PM By: WPXI.com In this Aug. 21, 2008 file photo Big Mac creator Jim Delligatti sits behind a Big Mac birthday cake at his 90th birthday party in Canonsburg, Pa. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar/File) \nIt’s the end of an era, and the beginning of a new one for one of the world’s most famous sandwiches. \nThe Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago died Monday. Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti was 98. >> Read more trending stories \nMcDonald's spokeswoman Kerry Ford confirmed that Delligatti died at his Fox Chapel home surrounded by his family. \nHis death comes after the recent announcement that McDonald’s is introducing two new versions of his famous burger. \nDelligatti was one of the original McDonald’s franchisees and operated several restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. \nHis franchise was based in Uniontown when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967. The classic Big Mac includes a pair of beef patties, “special sauce,” lettuce, cheese, onions and pickles on a sesame seed bun, with an extra bun segment sandwiched between the two patties. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's resisted the idea at first, because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. But Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger burger, and it went over so well it spread to the rest of Delligatti's 47 restaurants. The sandwich went national in 1968. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Related Ohio State attack: 1 bystander was shot in the foot, officials say \nUpdated: Wednesday, November 30, 2016 @ 2:23 PM By: Jeremy P. Kelley, Laura A. Bischoff, Max Filby \nA suspect is confirmed dead and multiple people are hospitalized after an attack on Ohio State’s campus. Here’s what we know: \nPHOTOS: Ohio State Shooting \nUPDATE@1:45 p.m. (Nov. 30) \nOne person who was present during the Ohio State attack Monday was shot in the foot, officials said during a press conference Wednesday. The officials said it’s likely that the victim was accidentally struck while Officer Alan Horujko shooting the attacker. \nThe FBI is currently leading the investigation, although several law enforcement agencies are involved. They said this afternoon that they continue to investigate the attack to determine a motive, and they believe Abdul Razak Ali Artan acted alone. \nAlthough ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, it’s too soon to determine if it was a terrorism act, an FBI spokeswoman said. She noted that ISIS has a history of claiming responsibility for such attacks when the assailant isn’t alive to refute it. \nHowever, she said, investigators believe Artan was inspired by ISIS and Anwar al-Awlaki, a Muslim cleric with ties to terrorism who was killed by the U.S. \nInvestigators have discovered that Artan purchased a knife hours before the attack, but they haven’t determined if the same knife was used in the attack, officials said. Investigators have executed search warrants on the attacker’s car and home, and are asking that anyone with information about his whereabouts prior to the attack to call 1-800-CALL-FBI (225-5324). \nUPDATE @ 3:56 p.m. \nWilliam Clark, an Ohio State professor and attack victim who talked to the media Tuesday, said the attack occurred about 40 minutes after he taught a class. He was about to get some coffee when the fire alarm of the building he was in sounded. \nEveryone exited the building and were standing outside as firefighters responded to the fire alarm, Clark said. About 15-20 minutes later the firefighters said the building was safe, and as everyone was walking in, he heard some shouting and a crash. he said. \nAbdul Razak Ali Artan , the attacker, had rammed his car into the crowd and he struck a large concrete barrier. Artan then exited the vehicle and started attacking students, the professor said. Clark, who had been clipped by the attacker’s vehicle and slammed to the ground, got up and started to get to the building quickly, he said. \nMoments later he heard three shots. Horujk had killed the attacker, said Clark, who suffered two cuts near his ankles. \nHe said the attack was an isolated incident at a university of more than 50,000 students, and it does not define the school. “We’re a great university, we still beat Michigan,” he said. \nClark commended the officer for shooting Artan, saying Horujk had no choice and if the concrete barrier hadn’t stopped the attacker’s car, much more people could have been injured. \nLaw enforcement is investigating if the attack was terrorism-related, and the Islam State has reportedly claimed responsibility. But Clark said he’s not ready to jump to those conclusions just yet. \n“Before I pass judgement on this young man, I’d like to see exactly what the circumstances were,” he said. \nUPDATE@3:15 p.m. \nOfficer Horujk who engaged the attacker is doing well and is on administrative leave, which is procedure. \nAndrew Thomas, chief medical officer for OSU hospital said one of the patients has been discharged, a professor who is at the press conference discussing the ordeal with reporters. Five other patients are still hospitalized, Thomas said. \nThey are all doing well, and they all still are working through the trauma, Thomas said, adding that he expects all the victims to make a full recovery. \nIt’s fortunate that the concrete barrier was there to stop the car. Had it not been there the attack’s car would have likely struck more people, said OSU Professor William Clark. He said he heard people screaming when the attack plowed into them. He did not hear the attacker say anything. \nUPDATE@2:40 p.m. (Nov. 29): \nThe Islamic State is claiming responsibility for the knife attack on the OSU campus, Reuters news service is reporting. No other information about the terrorist group’s involvement was immediately available. However, Ohio State office have planned a 3 p.m. news conference today. Watch it here live. \nUPDATE @ 10:10 p.m. (Nov. 28): \nThe Ohio State University student who carried out a knife attack on campus Monday said in a Facebook post he was “sick and tired” of seeing fellow Muslims “killed and tortured,” CNN is reporting, as according to federal law enforcement officials. \nAccording to CNN, investigators are examining Abdul Razak Ali Artan’s Facebook page to determine whether the attack was terrorism, though law enforcement officials said it will take time to ascertain motive. \nIn a Facebook post shortly before the Monday morning rampage, the Somali immigrant urged America “to stop interfering with other countries, especially the Muslim Ummah,” a term for Muslim people at large. \n“By Allah, we will not let you sleep unless you give peace to the Muslims. You will not celebrate or enjoy any holiday.” \nFULL REPORT \nA Somali-born attacker who appeared to be acting alone drove his car into a crowd of Ohio State University students and staff Monday morning, then got out and started swinging a butcher knife, injuring at least 11 people before he was shot and killed by a campus police officer. \nAndrew Thomas, chief medical officer at OSU’s Wexner Medical Center, said the 11 injuries were a mix of stab wounds and injuries from being hit by the car. None were life-threatening. \nThe attacker was identified as 20-year-old OSU student Abdul Razak Ali Artan . Columbus police Chief Kim Jacobs said late Monday afternoon that police were waiting on a search warrant for Artan’s home and were trying to talk to people who knew him. Law enforcement officials did not comment on a possible motive, saying the investigation was ongoing. \nWATCH OSU Student: “It was pretty crazy” \nArtan was featured in OSU’s “The Lantern” student newspaper in late August. In that “Humans of Ohio State” feature, he was described as a third-year student in logistics management who had just transferred from Columbus State. He was quoted as saying he was nervous about saying his Muslim prayers in public, and blamed the media for creating a certain image of Muslims. \nOSU President Michael Drake praised the quick response of law enforcement and urged people to let the investigation move forward without jumping to conclusions. \n“We don’t know anything that would link this to any community. We certainly don’t have any evidence that would say that’s the case,” Drake said. “What we want to do is really unify together, support each other, do our best to support those who were injured in their recovery, and then allow the investigation to take place, and not jump to conclusions that could in fact create a bad situation where one doesn’t exist.” \nDrake and others thanked campus police officer Alan Horujko , 28, who responded immediately. OSU Police Chief Craig Stone said Horujko, who has been with OSU police for almost two years, was already outside Watts Hall, where the incident occurred, because of an apparently unrelated fire alarm. Stone said the attack “happened right before his eyes.” \nRELATEDKasich, other politicians weigh in on attack \nColumbus Mayor Andrew Ginther thanked Horujko and others in law enforcement for their work, saying, “It’s never been a more dangerous, complicated, challenging time to be a police officer.” \n“Today is one of those days you’re grateful for good training and great people across the board,” Ginther said. President Drake and I had the opportunity to meet with the outstanding young law enforcement officer this afternoon. … We had a dynamic, well-trained professional today save the lives of many of our residents and students.” \nHow it happened \nShortly after 9:30 a.m., students in Watts Hall on the north side of campus were evacuated because of a fire alarm. Stone said there was a report of a gas leak in the building. \n“The whole class was like, is this a drill? And someone came in and said, this is real, we have to evacuate,” said Jared Crandall, an OSU junior materials science major who recently transferred from the University of Dayton. “We were just standing outside talking amongst ourselves. … Then I heard the car. It turned the corner really fast and jumped on the curb and that was all I heard.” \nThe car was a silver Honda sedan that turned west off of College Road onto 19th Avenue, a street that narrows as it runs between multi-story science and engineering buildings. Stone said police have reviewed camera video that proves Artan was in the car by himself. \nRELATED MAP: Scene of shooting at Ohio State University \nCrandall said at first he wasn’t sure why the car went onto the sidewalk, adding that Artan had to go around a public safety vehicle to get there. \n“He comes onto the curb and he’s headed toward all of us. He’s almost directly in the line of path to me and some friends. Luckily we took a couple steps to the side, and he happened to swerve a bit the other way, so we were fine,” Crandall said. “Someone behind me got hit a little bit and hurt her ankle but she’s OK. He kept going and … I saw him after he was out of the car. I turned and saw what was happening. I saw this guy with this knife and he was just swinging it around.” \nBoth Crandall and Monica Moll, OSU’s director of public safety, said the incident happened in a flash. \n“At 9:52, the officer involved called (to the dispatch center) that a car had hit about seven to eight pedestrians,” Moll said. “Just a few seconds later, also at 9:52, the officer made a call that indicated officer in trouble, that there was a man with a knife. At 9:53 that same officer called out that there were shots fired and that he had one person down. That’s when the officer … used deadly force to stop the threat.” \nWATCH OSU student say he “heard shots” \nTense morning \nPolice officials now say Artan acted alone, and the threat was over in two minutes. But police, students and the city as a whole didn’t know that at the time. The first alert from university officials went out at 9:55 a.m., saying, “Active Shooter on campus. Run Hide Fight. Watts Hall. 19th and College.” \nThe campus was on lockdown for about 90 minutes, as authorities checked for a possible second attacker. People who were outdoors ran, and students and staff indoors followed instructions to shelter in place, locking themselves in classrooms and offices. Some students tweeted pictures of the mountain of chairs they had used to barricade their doors. \nRELATEDOhio State athletes share status as campus deals with attack \nLaw enforcement officials surrounded and searched the Lane Avenue parking garage, at one point handcuffing two people. But police eventually established that there was no second attacker, and said once they identified the pair from the garage, they were released. \nDrake cancelled classes for the rest of the day, but the university will resume its normal schedule on Tuesday. \n“We live in an unstable world unfortunately, and we have to continue to do our best to protect ourselves,” he said.

      "text": "PITTSBURGH — You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. Michael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98.\nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968.\n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said.\nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then.\nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said.\n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\"\nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.\n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\"\nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities.\nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said.\nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.\nJoe Mandak, The Associated Press",

Puskar/File In this Aug. 21, 2008 file photo Big Mac creator Jim Delligatti sits behind a Big Mac birthday cake at his 90th birthday party in Canonsburg, Pa. Related By WPXI.com PITTSBURGH — \nIt’s the end of an era, and the beginning of a new one for one of the world’s most famous sandwiches. \nThe Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago died Monday. Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti was 98. >> Read more trending stories \nMcDonald's spokeswoman Kerry Ford confirmed that Delligatti died at his Fox Chapel home surrounded by his family. \nHis death comes after the recent announcement that McDonald’s is introducing two new versions of his famous burger. \nDelligatti was one of the original McDonald’s franchisees and operated several restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. \nHis franchise was based in Uniontown when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967. The classic Big Mac includes a pair of beef patties, “special sauce,” lettuce, cheese, onions and pickles on a sesame seed bun, with an extra bun segment sandwiched between the two patties. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's resisted the idea at first, because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. But Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger burger, and it went over so well it spread to the rest of Delligatti's 47 restaurants. The sandwich went national in 1968. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies Posted:   By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.  ",

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably haven't heard his name, but you likely have devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh surrounded by his family, family spokeswoman Kerry Ford said Wednesday. Delligatti was 98. \nUntil his health trailed off the last couple of years, Delligatti ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week, his son Michael said. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. \nMichael Delligatti said McDonald's executives told his father he could experiment with a bigger burger but only using products the restaurant already stocked. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \"But it went over so well in Uniontown that we were allowed to bring it to two stores in Pittsburgh for a couple of weeks.\" \nDemand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. Get news headlines sent daily   \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Tags",

      "text": "Big Mac Creator Jim Delligatti Dies at 98 More If you drive by a McDonald’s and see its trademark red-and-yellow flag flying at half-staff today, there’s good reason. Michael “Jim” Delligatti, the man credited with creating the fast food giant’s Big Mac sandwich, has died, the Associated Press reports. He was 98. A spokesman for McDonald’s told the AP that Delligatti died Monday night at home, surrounded by his family — so call off the APB for the Hamburglar, because it appears he wasn’t involved. Also Read: 'The Founder' Review: Michael Keaton McDonald's Biopic Needs More Salt Delligatti created the sandwich –famously consisting of two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions on a sesame-seed bun — nearly half a century ago while running a McDonald’s franchise in Uniontown. Pennsylvania, south of Pittsburgh. According to Delligatti, McDonald’s was initially resistant to his idea for a bigger burger, reasoning that its basic menu was already selling well. However, after Delligatti’s creation proved a hit in his franchises, the Big Mac went national in 1968. “Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael ‘Jim’ Delligatti,” McDonald’s tweeted on Wednesday. “Jim, we thank and will forever remember you.”",

Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \n• PHOTOS: In quest for a bigger sandwich, he created the Big Mac \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” Advertisement \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.",

Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich.

In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. \n  Photos",

      "title": "Creator of McDonald’s Flagship Sandwich, the Big Mac, Dies",
      "text": "PITTSBURGH — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.\nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98.\nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968.\n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said.\nHowever, McDonald’s in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company’s advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination.\nJim Delligatti’s family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn’t immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday.\nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then.\nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said.\n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.”\nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.\n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and [McDonald’s] listened, and the rest is history.”\nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities.\nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said.\nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.\nFollow @CBSDC on Twitter \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "McDonald’s Has a Secret Gold Membership for the World’s Billionaires The Daily Meal 4 hrs ago Joanna Fantozzi © The Tonight Show McDonald’s Has a Secret Gold Membership for the World’s Billionaires\nYou might brag about your Starbucks gold card, but when it comes to chain restaurant membership perks, nothing beats the secret McDonald’s gold card. The McGold — which allows the recipient free McDonald’s anytime — can’t easily be bought, and is usually given to high-profile celebrities or people with connections to big-time franchisees.\nWarren Buffet had a gold card that allowed him to order any McDonald’s food anytime at a McDonald’s location in Omaha , according to CNBC . Comedian Rob Lowe got a gold card from a friend whose father, David Peterson, invented the Egg McMuffin.\nPeterson’s son actually wields the power to give out gold cards to anyone he wants. He usually gifts them to friends, celebrities, and everyday people who did heroic deeds, like Charles Ramsey, the man who dropped his Big Mac to rescue three kidnapped woman in 2013.\nIn most instances, these gold cards have a time limit, only granting the recipient a year or six months of free food. But in some rare cases, the card is for life. Mitt Romney has often told the story that his father had a “little pink card” that awarded him free McDonald’s, given by owner Ray Croc himself.\nNow Watch This Airline is About To Start Serving McDonald’s:\nClick to expand Replay Video Victoria's Secret Angel Workout: 4 Boxing Moves For Angels Work your arms and abs with these four boxing-inspired exercises.

      "text": "PITTSBURGH - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.\nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98.\nFILE - In this Aug. 21, 2008, file photo, Big Mac creator Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti sits behind a Big Mac birthday cake at his 90th birthday party in Canonsburg, Pa.

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File)\nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968.\n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said.\nHowever, McDonald's in 1985 honoured Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the bestselling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company's advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination.\nJim Delligatti's family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn't immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday.\nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then.\nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said.\n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\"\nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.\n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\"\nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities.\nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said.\nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.\n ",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald’s flagship Big Mac dies at 98 By Joe Mandak, Associated Press Posted: # Comments In this Aug. 21, 2008, file photo, Big Mac creator Michael “Jim” Delligatti sits behind a Big Mac birthday cake at his 90th birthday party in Canonsburg, Pa. Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \n• PHOTOS: In quest for a bigger sandwich, he created the Big Mac \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” Advertisement \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.",

McDonald’s released an email statement of his passing.\nDelligatti first introduced the famous burger at his Uniontown, Pennsylvania franchise in 1968. Forty years later, McDonald’s was selling 550 million of the burgers a year. The Big Mac did not catch on nationally, though, until after other franchises in Toledo, Ohio started selling them, Bloomberg noted.\nDelligatti was also a pioneer in selling breakfast. He sold hotcakes and sausages to steel workers. The World War II veteran owned over 40 franchise locations in western Pennsylvania.\nA point of pride for Delligatti was that he never made his famous secret sauce recipe public. The recipe for the Big Mac–two beef patties, cheese, lettuce, onions, pickles, and special sauce in a sesame seed bun–has not changed since he first introduced it nearly a half century ago.\n  Culture and tagged Small Business  ",

      "title": "Big Mac Inventor Jim Delligatti Dies At 98",
      "text": "\nThe inventor of the McDonald’s signature or iconic Big Mac, Michael James “Jim” Delligatti, has died in Pittsburgh at the age of 98.\nJim Delligatti, a longtime Pennsylvania McDonald’s franchisee, is credited with creating the Big Mac menu item about 50 years ago. Delligatti opened his first (of many) McDonald’s fast-food restaurants in 1957 in the Pittsburgh area. He passed way Monday night at home surrounded by family.\nDelligatti, a World War II veteran, is also credited with participating in the creation of the McDonald’s equally popular breakfast menu, specifically the hot cakes and sausage meal originally created for third-shift steelworkers.\nThe Big Mac, which was sold for 45 cents at the time of its creation, famously contains two all-beef patties, plus a special sauce and lettuce, cheese, pickles, and onions, on a sesame seed bun. Each one now sells for about $5.00.\nThe Associated Press provided this background on the creation of the Big Mac, which it described as possibly the most well-known fast-food sandwich on the planet, and for which McDonald’s was initially reluctant to give Delligatti permission.\n“Delligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968…Jim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.”\nToday, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you. pic.twitter.com/wmEFrmazdn \n— McDonald's (@McDonalds) November 30, 2016 \n\nBig Mac inventor Delligatti received zero royalties from the McDonald’s corporation for his creation, however. “‘All I got was a plaque,’ he once said,” the Wall Street Journal recalled . About 10 years ago, the Delligatti family opened a Big Mac museum in suburban Pittsburgh, the WSJ added. Delligatti also co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald house in 1979.\nNext year, McDonald’s plans to introduce some Big Mac variations, the Inquisitr previously detailed . The Grand Mac and the Mac Jr. are coming to a burger franchise near you soon. McDonald’s hopes that the new Macs will regenerate interest in the 50-year-old burger. Studies have apparently shown that a significant cohort of millennials have never even tasted a Big Mac despite growing up in the Happy Meal era. The Big Mac is reportedly still responsible for 20 percent of McDonald’s revenue.\nMcDonald's franchisee, who created the \"Big Mac\" nearly 50 years ago, has died at age 98. https://t.co/H2x0lU9uZU pic.twitter.com/Qimd7Qj7ms \n— NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) November 30, 2016 \n\nIn a statement , McDonald’s had this to say about passing of Jim Delligatti.\n“Jim was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand. We will remember Jim as an insightful franchisee, a knowledgeable businessman, and an honorable gentleman who left a legacy of four generations of family members running great restaurants in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.”\nThe Big Mac inventor ate one of his creations at least once a week for many years, the Daily Mail claimed .\nUpon the burger creation’s 40th anniversary, McDonald’s indicated that it was selling a staggering 550 million Big Macs each year in restaurants in the U.S. and around the world.\nThe guy was modest: “This wasn’t like discovering the lightbulb,” he said. https://t.co/ieEPXUnyzA via @WSJ \n— bob davis (@bobdavis187) November 30, 2016 \n\nJim Delligatti had an unassuming analysis of his role in creating the Big Mac, the WSJ further recalled.\n“Mr. Delligatti acknowledged that the Big Mac was derived from double-deck hamburgers made popular by rival fast-food restaurants. ‘This wasn’t like discovering the lightbulb,’ he told the Los Angeles Times in 1993. “The bulb was already there. All I did was screw it in the socket.’ Even so, his initiative helped launch McDonald’s on a long-running diversification of a menu once limited to little more than basic hamburgers, fries, shakes and soft drinks.”\nThe funeral for Big Mac inventor Jim Delligatti is scheduled for Saturday near Pittsburgh.\nAre you a fan of the McDonald’s Big Mac?\n[Featured Image by Gene J.

      "text": "By JOE MANDAK\nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.\nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98.\nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968.\n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said.\nHowever, McDonald's in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company's advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination.\nJim Delligatti's family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn't immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday.\nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then.\nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said.\n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\"\nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.\n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\"\nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities.\nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said.\nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.\n ",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald's in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company's advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti's family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn't immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald's in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company's advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti's family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn't immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.  ",

      "title": "Bust to keeper? 49ers’ McDonald making big plays in contract year",
      "text": "Photo: Marcio Jose Sanchez, Associated Press Bust to keeper? 49ers’ McDonald making big plays in contract year 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nORLANDO — Vance McDonald has played in 16 games, a full NFL season, since the 49ers traded Vernon Davis a year ago and made him their primary tight end. \nThis week, McDonald said he’s often thought about the moment he went from second-stringer to starter. \n“I just always look back at the opportunity when Vernon went to (Denver),” McDonald said. “Just being able to have the trust and the opportunity to start games and play every down.” \nThe 49ers did show faith in McDonald, but has it been rewarded? \nIn his last 16 games, McDonald has 45 catches for 663 yards and seven touchdowns, which are decent figures. In fact, they’re probably better than most expected given the unsightly start to his career. The 2013 second-round pick had struggled mightily to replace Delanie Walker , who finished his rookie contract in 2012 and signed with Tennessee, where he’s flourished. \nNow, nearly four years later, McDonald is playing the final season of his rookie contract and it will be interesting to see how the 49ers value him in the offseason. \nThe bad: He’s had puny production (63 career catches) for a No. 55 overall pick. The good: Most of that production has come since he’s been given a larger role. \nNot surprisingly, 49ers general manager Trent Baalke , whose shaky job security is heavily tied to the success of his draft picks, recently hailed McDonald’s development. \n“He’s really coming along and developing into the player we always thought he would,” Baalke said Sunday on KNBR. “He’s gotten much more consistent. He’s doing a good job blocking. He’s a good all-around football player and he has a chance in this scheme to do some things … because the matchups are favorable.” \nMcDonald has certainly improved at one of his primary job responsibilities: catching the football. \nThis season, he’s dropped two of 24 catchable passes, according to Pro Football Focus, and his drop percentage (8.3) is easily a career-best. In his first three seasons, McDonald dropped nine of 49 catchable passes (18.3). \nHe’s had just 22 catches in nine games in 2016, but he’s made the most of them. He became the first tight end since 1997 to have two touchdowns of 65-plus yards in a season and his 17.4 yards per catch average ranks second among tight ends with at least 20 catches. \nMcDonald has the team’s two longest receptions and four of their nine catches of at least 32 yards. He said Chip Kelly ’s offense has created chances for explosive plays. \n“It provides the tight end the opportunity to be a big playmaker,” McDonald said. “I’ve welcomed that idea. I’ve embraced that role this year and it’s been a lot of fun.” \nSince Week 8, McDonald has had 14 catches for 220 yards, which are the best four-game totals of his career. On Sunday, however, he couldn’t hang on to a difficult would-be touchdown when safety Michael Thomas drilled him in the back of the end zone. \n“I think Vance is a tough matchup athletically for guys that are covering him,” offensive coordinator Curtis Modkins said. “I think he’s a tough matchup for zones because of his athleticism. For that position, I think Vance can really run and he’s proven that with some of the explosive plays that he’s made. So we look for that to continue. We need it to.” \nMcDonald’s performance in the final five games could influence the size of his next contract, whether it’s with the 49ers, or elsewhere. \nBaalke said Sunday McDonald is finally becoming a front-line starter. If Baalke is still on the job after the season, it will be interesting to see if the 49ers offer a contract that reflects that belief. \nEric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies 2:08 p.m. 2:08 p.m. 0 \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald's in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company's advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti's family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn't immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday.

      "text": "JOE MANDAK, Associated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.\nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98.\nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968.\n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said.\nHowever, McDonald’s in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company’s advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination.\nJim Delligatti’s family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn’t immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday.\nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then.\nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said.\n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.”\nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.\n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.”\nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities.\nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said.\nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.\n(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "McDonald's Chicken McNuggets come in four different shapes The restaurant said that 'dipability' is the reason behind the varying sizes A patron of the food chain asked a spokesperson on its official website The spokesperson said the nuggets are made with kids and fun in mind \nBy Simon Holmes For Mailonline \nPublished: 09:54 EST, 30 November 2016 | Updated: 11:36 EST, 30 November 2016 \nMcDonald's has revealed that their Chicken McNuggets come in four different shapes - shattering the illusions that the shapes are simply random. \nA video released by McDonald's Canada showed the nuggets being processed in a factory - with each shaped deliberately into one of four natural-looking forms. \nAnd a spokesman for the company has revealed the reasoning behind the varying shapes, explaining that they were designed deliberately and that each nugget actually has a name. \nScroll down for video \nThe crunchy bites are known as either the 'ball,' the 'boot,' the 'bow-tie' and the 'bell' \nThe crunchy treats are known as either the 'bell,' the 'boot,' the 'bone' and the 'bell' although the nuggets seem to have slightly different names in different countries. \nOn a Q&A forum on McDonald's website one patron of the restaurant, called Stew from British Columbia, Canada, asked the company: 'Why do your Chicken McNuggets only come in four shapes?' \nThe spokesman replied: 'The four shapes we make Chicken McNuggets in was the perfect equilibrium of \"dipability\" and fun. \n'Three would've been too few. Five would've been, like, wacky.' \nA video from McDonald's Canada showed the process of how McNuggets are made \nThe question has finally been answered. Nuggets come in different shapes and sizes for 'dipibility' \nOn a different occasion a spokesman again stressed that the nuggets are designed for dipping and to be fun for kids. \n'Our Chicken McNuggets are shaped uniquely for kids and kids at heart. Plus, we think it makes dipping all the more fun,' the representative said. \nThe nuggets are made from chicken meat in a factory, shaped into the four different forms and battered. \nThey are then frozen and distributed to individual restaurants where they are deep-friend and served to customers.",

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) Associated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald’s in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company’s advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. The Big Mac | YOUTUBE \nJim Delligatti’s family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn’t immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township. \nJOE MANDAK, Associated Press ",

Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" Delligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. Delligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. In addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. The Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.",

      "text": "McDonald’s franchisee who created Big Mac dies By JOE MANDAK The Associated Press First Published 44 minutes ago • Updated 44 minutes ago Share This Article The Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago has died. James Delligatti was 98. McDonald's spokeswoman Kerry Ford confirmed that Delligatti died at home Monday night surrounded by his family. Delligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, about 40 miles south of Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger with two all-beef patties, \"special sauce,\" lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun. Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's resisted the idea at first, because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes were selling well. But Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger burger and it went over so well it spread to the rest of Delligatti's 47 stores, then went national in 1968. VIDEOS",

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \n• PHOTOS: In quest for a bigger sandwich, he created the Big Mac \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” Advertisement \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years.

It was Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti who dreamed up the iconic burger , and who just died at the age of 98. Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you. pic.twitter.com/wmEFrmazdn — McDonald's (@McDonalds) November 30, 2016 \nDelligatti was a franchise owner in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, when he invented the two-tier sandwich with its special sauce in 1967. It was such a hit, it went nationwide just a year later. Today, McDonald's sells over 900 million Big Macs in over 100 countries worldwide. They've never changed the recipe. \nNow sing with us:",

In his last 16 games, McDonald has 45 catches for 663 yards and seven touchdowns, which are decent figures. [...] they're probably better than most expected given the unsightly start to his career. The 2013 second-round pick had struggled mightily to replace Delanie Walker, who finished his rookie contract in 2012 and signed with Tennessee, where he's flourished. [...] nearly four years later, McDonald is playing the final season of his rookie contract and it will be interesting to see how the 49ers value him in the offseason. Not surprisingly, 49ers general manager Trent Baalke, whose shaky job security is heavily tied to the success of his draft picks, recently hailed McDonald's development. Since Week 8, McDonald has had 14 catches for 220 yards, which are the best four-game totals of his career. On Sunday, however, he couldn't hang on to a difficult would-be touchdown when safety Michael Thomas drilled him in the back of the end zone. \"I think Vance is a tough matchup athletically for guys that are covering him,\"...",

      "text": "  \nChicken nuggets are great – I think we’ve been through this before – and McDonald’s Chicken McNuggets are a perfect example of this. Just delicious, especially with that BBQ sauce. Featured Image VIA \nNormally when I’m eating Chicken McNuggets though, I’m too busy scoffing them down to realise that they come in four distinct shapes. Sure, I know that they’re in different sizes and shapes from each other, but I never actually noticed that there were four of these. \nIt turns out that the four shapes are called the ball, the boot, the bone and the bell. Here’s what they look like: \nYeah, I bet you’re thinking exactly what I thought when I saw that: that this makes a hell of a lot of sense. Of course that’s the boot and that’s the ball. Image VIA \nAccording to the McDonald’s website: \nOur Chicken McNuggets are shaped uniquely for kids and kids at heart – it makes dipping more fun. \nThe four shapes we make Chicken McNuggets in was the perfect equilibrium of dipability and fun. \nThree would’ve been too few, five would’ve been wacky. We also make them similar in size to ensure consistent cooking times for food safety. \nWell, I don’t really know if any of that makes any sense – why the hell would five be wacky? – but it’s nice to know that there’s some method behind the madness there. On the other hand, I’m not really sure if there was any method behind the madness of creating this giant chicken nugget , but I want one anyway.",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald’s flagship Big Mac dies at 98 By Joe Mandak, Associated Press Posted: # Comments In this Aug. 21, 2008, file photo, Big Mac creator Michael “Jim” Delligatti sits behind a Big Mac birthday cake at his 90th birthday party in Canonsburg, Pa. Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \n• PHOTOS: In quest for a bigger sandwich, he created the Big Mac \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” Advertisement \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.",

      "text": "PITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.\nSlideshow Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon\nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98.\nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968.\n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said.\nHowever, McDonald's in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company's advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination.\nJim Delligatti's family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn't immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday.\nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then.\nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said.\n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\"\nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.\n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\"\nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities.\nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said.\nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.",

      "text": "McDonald's To Install Ordering Kiosks Instead Of Paying People $15/Hour Share Share Tweet \nA former McDonald's CEO is laying the blame on the \"Fight for $15\" movement as for why the company is embracing automation in its restaurants. McDonald's will install self-serve kiosks in its restaurants around the country to replace human cashiers. \nLet’s start with automation. In 2013, when the Fight for $15 was still in its growth stage, I and others warned that union demands for a much higher minimum wage would force businesses with small profit margins to replace full-service employees with costly investments in self-service alternatives. At the time, labor groups accused business owners of crying wolf. It turns out the wolf was real. \nEarlier this month, McDonald’s announced the nationwide roll-out of touchscreen self-service kiosks. In a video the company released to showcase the new customer experience, it’s striking to see employees who once would have managed a cash register now reduced to monitoring a customer’s choices at an iPad-style kiosk. \nPersonally, I have mixed feelings about a kiosk at McDonald's. As someone who eats at McDonald's more frequently than I'd like to admit, I like the idea of being in control of my own order and ensuring that it is entered correctly into the system. However, I recognize that for many people (myself included), their first jobs are at fast-food establishments. These jobs are important for building an employment foundation, and they could be going away due to it simply being financially unwise to hire someone at a higher wage than they are worth. People who would only be employable (at least, initially) at a place like McDonald's or Walmart (full disclosure: I worked at one for a total of six months during college) would not be hired due to the need to have a more selective application process due to the higher cost of labor. These are facts, and they don't bode well for the lower-skilled economy.",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nMcDonald’s employee Richard Eiker was the last of 108 people raised by police from the pavement Tuesday night at Meyer and Troost after a Fight for $15 sit-in. \nEiker, a leader in the Stand Up KC worker advocacy organization, and other protesters were arrested and charged with failure to obey a lawful order. \nThose who participated in blocking the intersection were taken to four area police stations in vans and patrol cars, and it was nearly 5 a.m. Wednesday before the last of those arrested were released. \n“Despite the cold pavement, people felt great about standing up for something they believe in,” said Rachel Hogan, a spokeswoman for the labor movement in Kansas City. \nLow-wage fast-food workers, janitors, and child and elder care workers were joined by members of the Kansas City-area clergy and labor unions in a national day of protest about pay and civil rights. \nParticipants who were arrested included members of the United Auto Workers, the Communications Workers of America and the Service Employees International Union, Hogan said. \nLabor unions back the Fight for $15 movement, which also focuses on the right of workers to unionize without retribution. \nProtest organizers arranged “walk-back” assistance for workers who struck their jobs Tuesday. That involves accompanying employees back to their workplaces and informing their managers that the absences were protected activities under federal labor law and the workers should return to work without retribution. \nLora McDonald, executive director for the Metro Organization for Racial and Economic Equity, chose to participate in Tuesday’s sit-in for her mother. \n“I was getting arrested for moms like my mom,” she said Wednesday. “For my mom, who worked two minimum-wage jobs.” \nMcDonald was in one of the last groups of people arrested Tuesday night. Earlier that day, she had attended a training in civil disobedience, as did the more than 100 people who were arrested for sitting in the middle of the road outside of a Kansas City McDonald’s. \nAfter standing in a parking lot for more than an hour waiting for a transport van, McDonald was moved with another group to the East Patrol station, where it took more time to be processed, take a mugshot and get fingerprints taken. \n“For me, it’s a badge of honor,” she said about being arrested. “ It’s something you have to do, if you feel compelled to do it. The consequences of not acting are so much greater than the consequences of having some kind of misdemeanor.” \nJudy Ancel, director of the worker education and labor studies program at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, was among those arrested. She said lack of adequate transportation and booking delays at different police stations kept many of the protesters outside in the cold for a couple of hours after the sit-in ended. \n“The police were pretty decent. Nobody was abusive,” Ancel said. \nProtest organizers had bail bondsmen waiting when the participants were released on $100 bail bonds. \nA spokesperson for Kansas City Municipal Court said 108 people were charged with failing to comply with police for not vacating a public street. \nOf the 108, three were also charged with placing an obstruction on the street, while another was also charged with hindering the arrest of another for locking arms with someone being arrested. Another person was also charged with obstructing a street, obstructing and resisting arrest. \nCourt dates were set for January. \nThe Kansas City demonstrations, which began at 6 a.m. and ended about 8 p.m., were mostly peaceful. Tuesday’s arrests were the second time in the 4-year-old Fight for $15 movement that Kansas City participants intentionally blocked streets in front of a McDonald’s restaurant in acts of civil disobedience. \nEiker said the actions were necessary to show that “we stand united” as working Americans.

      "text": "PITTSBURGH (AP) -- You probably don&apos;t know his name, but you&apos;ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.\nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald&apos;s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98.\nDelligatti&apos;s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain&apos;s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti&apos;s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain&apos;s national menu in 1968.\n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said.\nHowever, McDonald&apos;s in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company&apos;s advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination.\nJim Delligatti&apos;s family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn&apos;t immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday.\nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald&apos;s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then.\nMcDonald&apos;s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald&apos;s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said.\n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald&apos;s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\"\nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh&apos;s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti&apos;s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.\n\"In franchising, there&apos;s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald&apos;s) listened, and the rest is history.\"\nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald&apos;s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald&apos;s in Pittsburgh&apos;s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh&apos;s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities.\nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald&apos;s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said.\nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti&apos;s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph&apos;s Parish in O&apos;Hara Township.\n ",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald’s flagship Big Mac dies at 98 By Joe Mandak, Associated Press Posted: # Comments In this Aug. 21, 2008, file photo, Big Mac creator Michael “Jim” Delligatti sits behind a Big Mac birthday cake at his 90th birthday party in Canonsburg, Pa. Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \n• PHOTOS: In quest for a bigger sandwich, he created the Big Mac \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” Advertisement \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.",

      "text": "McDonald's franchisee who created Big Mac dies \nby: WPXI.com Updated: Nov 30, 2016 - 12:31 PM PITTSBURGH - It’s the end of an era, and the beginning of a new one for one of the world’s most famous sandwiches. The Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago died Monday. Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti was 98. McDonald's spokeswoman Kerry Ford confirmed that Delligatti died at his Fox Chapel home surrounded by his family. His death comes after the recent announcement that McDonald’s is introducing two new versions of his famous burger. Delligatti was one of the original McDonald’s franchisees and operated several restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. His franchise was based in Uniontown when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967. The classic Big Mac includes a pair of beef patties, “special sauce,” lettuce, cheese, onions and pickles on a sesame seed bun, with an extra bun segment sandwiched between the two patties. Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's resisted the idea at first, because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. But Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger burger, and it went over so well it spread to the rest of Delligatti's 47 restaurants. The sandwich went national in 1968. The Associated Press contributed to this report. ",

Puskar/AP The creator of the McDonald's Big Mac has died. Michael \"Jim\" Dellgatti was 98.\nGene J. Puskar/AP You might not know his name but you undoubtedly know his famous sandwich, and many of us us remember singing its ingredients along with a commercial in the 1970's: \"Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles onions on a sesame seed bun.\"\nYouTube Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac, died Monday. He was 98.\nDelligatti was one of McDonald's earliest franchise holders, opening his first restaurant in Pittsburgh in 1957. He eventually owned and operated 47 additional McDonald's locations in Western Pennsylvania, making him one of the single largest franchise holders in company history.\nEnlarge this image Big Mac creator Jim Delligatti attends his 90th birthday party in 2008. Gene J. Puskar/AP   Gene J. Puskar/AP Big Mac creator Jim Delligatti attends his 90th birthday party in 2008.\nGene J. Puskar/AP The menu was pretty simple back in those early days - hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes. But Delligatti saw that his customers wanted something bigger, so in 1967 at his restaurant in Uniontown, Pa., he put together two hamburger patties, topped it with cheese, lettuce, onions, and pickles, and he developed a special sauce for the burger. He called it the Big Mac.\nIn a 1993 interview with the Associated Press, he said McDonald's initially rejected the burger.\n\"I tried for two years to have McDonald's let me try to make this Big Mac and they said no,\" Delligatti said, adding, \"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\"\nSo Delligatti made and sold Big Macs in his Pittsburgh-area restaurants, experimenting with the special sauce along the way, until eventually, McDonald's executives came around and began selling the Big Mac nationally. Now, almost 50 years later, the Big Mac is sold in more than 100 countries and has become the most popular sandwich on the planet, according to the fast food chain.\nArticle continues after sponsorship An obituary put out by his family notes that Delligatti was a true innovator in the fast food industry, instrumental in introducing breakfast at McDonald's, making the hotcakes and sausage meals for hungry steel-mill workers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills.\nDelligatti co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House and supported many other charities in Western Pennsylvania. He also served in the Army in World War II.\n\"Jim was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" reads a statement from McDonald's corporate headquarters. \"He is an exemplary individual who embraced the community and championed many causes and organizations that benefitted children. We will remember Jim as an insightful franchisee, a knowledgeable businessman, and an honorable gentleman.\"",

Puskar/AP You might not know his name but you undoubtedly know his famous sandwich, and many of us us remember singing its ingredients along with a commercial in the 1970's: \"Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles onions on a sesame seed bun.\"\nYouTube Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac, died Monday. He was 98.\nDelligatti was one of McDonald's earliest franchise holders, opening his first restaurant in Pittsburgh in 1957. He eventually owned and operated 47 additional McDonald's locations in Western Pennsylvania, making him one of the single largest franchise holders in company history.\nEnlarge this image Big Mac creator Jim Delligatti attends his 90th birthday party in 2008. Gene J. Puskar/AP hide caption \ntoggle caption Gene J. Puskar/AP Big Mac creator Jim Delligatti attends his 90th birthday party in 2008.\nGene J. Puskar/AP The menu was pretty simple back in those early days - hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes. But Delligatti saw that his customers wanted something bigger, so in 1967 at his restaurant in Uniontown, Pa., he put together two hamburger patties, topped it with cheese, lettuce, onions, and pickles, and he developed a special sauce for the burger. He called it the Big Mac.\nIn a 1993 interview with the Associated Press, he said McDonald's initially rejected the burger.\n\"I tried for two years to have McDonald's let me try to make this Big Mac and they said no,\" Delligatti said, adding, \"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\"\nSo Delligatti made and sold Big Macs in his Pittsburgh-area restaurants, experimenting with the special sauce along the way, until eventually, McDonald's executives came around and began selling the Big Mac nationally. Now, almost 50 years later, the Big Mac is sold in more than 100 countries and has become the most popular sandwich on the planet, according to the fast food chain.\nArticle continues after sponsorship An obituary put out by his family notes that Delligatti was a true innovator in the fast food industry, instrumental in introducing breakfast at McDonald's, making the hotcakes and sausage meals for hungry steel-mill workers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills.\nDelligatti co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House and supported many other charities in Western Pennsylvania. He also served in the Army in World War II.\n\"Jim was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" reads a statement from McDonald's corporate headquarters. \"He is an exemplary individual who embraced the community and championed many causes and organizations that benefitted children. We will remember Jim as an insightful franchisee, a knowledgeable businessman, and an honorable gentleman.\"",

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \n• PHOTOS: In quest for a bigger sandwich, he created the Big Mac \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” Advertisement \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.",

Since then the company says it has received positive feedback from customers and franchisees. \nDespite the expanded test and apparent acceptance of the fresh patties, taking the option nationwide could prove to be difficult, Business Insider reports. \nWhile the concept of serving fresh meat might appeal to customers, it could open the company up to a slew of food safety issues, as franchisees pointed out in a recent survey . The franchises also noted that it could be arduous to serve customers quickly with fresh meat — which would need to cook longer to an appropriate temperature. ",

      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies at 98   4:46 PM By JOE MANDAK, The Associated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald's in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company's advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti's family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn't immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. About Us",

      "text": "Enlarge Image Photo by McDonald's Billions have been sold, but in these days of design by committee, it's still hard to believe McDonald's Big Mac sandwich actually had a single inventor. Back in 1967, Michael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, a Pennsylvania franchisee of the fast-food chain, thought his customers wanted a bigger sandwich, so he came up with the double-pattied burger.\nDeligatti died on Monday at age 98 , a pretty long life for a man who reportedly ate at least one of his 540-calorie inventions each week for decades.\n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti told the AP. Gd pnt!\nRelated eats McDonald's Italy is now serving up a Nutella burger Pickle, bacon, gravy and coffee candy canes? That's twisted National Junk Food Day trends: Hope you like s'mores! The burger Delligatti popularized is heaven to some and horrific to others, but whatever you think of it, it's made a memorable, meaty mark on our culture. Here are six cheesy memories.\nThe all-Big Mac diet Morgan Spurlock made a name for himself by eating at McDonald's for 30 days straight in the 2004 Oscar-nominated documentary \" Super Size Me .\" To no one's surprise, he gained 24 pounds and suffered numerous other health problems due to the diet.\nBut one of the most memorable characters in the film, Don Gorske , seems to suffer no ill health from his practically-all-Big-Mac diet. Gorske tells Spurlock he ate nine Big Macs on the day he discovered the burger in 1972. He's even written a book about his obsession, titled \" 22,477 Big Macs .\"\nTwoallbeefpattiesspecialsauce... Back when everyone in the United States watched the same handful of TV channels, it sometimes seemed as if the entire country knew every commercial jingle. And few burrowed into America's collective brainstem more than McDonald's 1974 musical Big Mac ad.\nIf you're of a certain age, you can still sing it: \"Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame-seed bun.\" I should maybe be embarrassed that I didn't have to look up one word of that, yet still cannot translate Fahrenheit to Celsius without the internet.\nBig Kahuna burger as last meal In Quentin Tarantino's 1994 hit movie \" Pulp Fiction ,\" Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) commandeers a Big Kahuna burger from poor Brett -- or is it Brad, as in \"check out the big brain on Brad\"? It's not a Big Mac -- Jules acknowledges it's not from \"Mac Donald's\"-- but it's pretty much a stand-in for one, even down to the \"Big\" in its name. It's just one more delicious element in a torturous, drawn-out scene of the type Tarantino does so well, where the suspense is as tasty as Brett's Sprite.\nHey, let's go to the theater for a long commercial So, there was this movie, \" E.T .,\" that was mega-popular in 1982, and somehow someone at McDonald's decided the fast-food giant needed its own version of the film. Only instead of E.T., the character's initials were M.A.C., or MAC, and it stood for Mysterious Alien Creature, because there's no way Spielberg will sue a tiny little family business like McDonald's, right?\nMany considered \" Mac and Me \" to be one of the worst movies ever made, although a main character uses a wheelchair, which was pretty innovative for 1988. But it might take falling into a meat coma to forget this 99-minute, big-screen commercial.\nThe Big Mac Index Those big smarties at The Economist needed a way to measure purchasing power between different currencies, and they turned to Delligatti's sandwich as a solution. They invented the Big Mac Index in 1986 as a lighthearted, easy-to-understand way to compare purchasing power, and it's nothing if not educational. In 2015, for example, the cheapest Big Macs were in Venezuela, the priciest in Switzerland, and it would take a Kenyan 172 minutes of work to be able to afford one. How come our economics professors never explained things this way?\nAfter-dinner mint Give the last word to The Onion , which has poked fun at the Big Mac more than once, but never better than this: \" McDonald's Announces New Spearmint After-Dinner Big Mac .\"\n ",

      "text": "PITTSBURGH ( AP ) — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.\nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98.\nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968.\n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said.\nHowever, McDonald’s in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company’s advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination.\nJim Delligatti’s family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn’t immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday.\nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well.\n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then.\nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said.\n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.”\nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger.\n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.”\nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities.\nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said.\nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.",

      "text": "McDonald's franchisee who created Big Mac dies \nby: WPXI.com Updated: Nov 30, 2016 - 1:31 PM PITTSBURGH - It’s the end of an era, and the beginning of a new one for one of the world’s most famous sandwiches. The Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago died Monday. Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti was 98. McDonald's spokeswoman Kerry Ford confirmed that Delligatti died at his Fox Chapel home surrounded by his family. His death comes after the recent announcement that McDonald’s is introducing two new versions of his famous burger. Delligatti was one of the original McDonald’s franchisees and operated several restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. His franchise was based in Uniontown when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967. The classic Big Mac includes a pair of beef patties, “special sauce,” lettuce, cheese, onions and pickles on a sesame seed bun, with an extra bun segment sandwiched between the two patties. Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's resisted the idea at first, because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. But Delligatti wanted to offer a bigger burger, and it went over so well it spread to the rest of Delligatti's 47 restaurants. The sandwich went national in 1968. The Associated Press contributed to this report. ",

Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \n• PHOTOS: In quest for a bigger sandwich, he created the Big Mac \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” Advertisement \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.",

In many cities the protesters blocked busy intersections. \nIn Chicago, hundreds of protesters at O'Hare International Airport chanted outside terminals: \"What do we want? $15! When do we want it? Now!\" Police gated an area to allow travelers room to walk. As many as 500 workers at the airport participated in an unfair labor practices strike, according to officials from Service Employees International Union Local 1 who have been organizing the workers. \n\"We're not asking for special treatment, we're asking for decent treatment. We're asking for decent wages,\" said Kisha Rivera, an airplane cabin cleaner at O'Hare. \"We're demanding respect.\" \nThousands planned to walk off the job at McDonald's restaurants, organizers said. The efforts are part of the National Day of Action to Fight for $15. \nIn New Jersey, airport workers marched between two terminals at Newark Liberty International Airport. Democratic Mayor Ras Baraka has called on the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport, to raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour at its facilities and take steps to hire more Newark residents. \nAt a McDonald's in Denver, about 100 people, including about 60 striking fast food workers from around the metro area, picketed. Protesters briefly shut down a downtown St. Louis McDonald's restaurant, blocking the drive-thru for about 30 minutes. In Massachusetts, a state senator was among nearly three dozen people arrested after they sat down on a Cambridge street during a demonstration. \nAbout 25 of the 350 protesters in New York City were arrested. One protester, Flavia Cabral, 55, struggles to make ends meet with two part-time jobs. Get breaking news sent instantly   Breaking News   \n\"All these people don't have savings because we're working check to check,\" Cabral said. \"We have to decide what we are going to get: We're going to pay rent or we're going to put food on the table or we're going to send my child to school.\" \nDetroit police say they arrested about 40 protesters who blocked traffic. In the San Francisco Bay Area, ride-hailing drivers, fast-food employees, airport workers and others shut down an Oakland intersection. \nRaising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $12 would lift pay for 35 million workers, or 1 in 4 employees nationwide, according to the liberal Economic Policy Institute. \nThe conservative-leaning, nonprofit Employment Policies Institute think tank said it believes minimum wage increases will result in lost jobs, reduced hours and business closures.

      "text": "View Comments Mention a Big Mac and anyone would know what it is. The burger that went on to become one of the most popular fast foods in the world was created by Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti, a McDonald's franchisee. “I would never have dreamed that my creation would turn into a piece of Americana,” Delligatti once said about his two-tiered burger created 49 years ago. The creator who ran his restaurant in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was said to have eaten at least one Big Mac every week for decades. But he’s not the only one – worldwide, McDonald's sells 900 million Big Macs a year. The fast food joint today have announced the creator had sadly passed away at 98 years of age, at his Pittsburgh home on Monday. But what’s certain is that he will leave a legacy through his seven-ingredient burger, concocted with his \"special sauce.\" The burger – two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun – is now available in 100 countries – and McDonald's hasn't changed its recipe since 1967. When asked why he named his creation the Big Mac, Delegatti’s son said his father replied because “Big Mac sounded too funny”. Delligatti was also one of McDonald's largest franchise holders, owning 48 restaurants. \"Jim was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" McDonald's said in a statement. Meanwhile on Twitter, many have also called Delligatti a \"legend\" and thanked him for his creation. Today, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti. Jim, we thank and will forever remember you. pic.twitter.com/wmEFrmazdn",

      "text": "Fast food giant McDonald's is rolling out self-service kiosks in restaurants across China that allow customers to order, customise and pay for their food by just tapping a digital screen.\nTo promote the new service, it has launched ‘Technology, is there for life more than you think’ campaign, through a combination of online videos and in-store experience events, that brings McDonald’s latest concept an ‘Experience of the future’ platform to life.\nThe 45-second online video shows a real McDonald’s customer, who is actually a game planner and operator, ordering his choice of burger just the way he wants it at a self-ordering kiosk late at night.\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a8KOIP924A&feature=youtu.be[/embed]\nThe video highlights the outcome of some McDonald’s consumer insights. The fast food chain discovered that young consumers don’t like wasting time standing in queues, they love mobile pay and sometimes they like taking their time thinking about what to order. So, McDonald’s created self-ordering kiosks where customers can choose exactly what they want and customise their choice. The service also includes options such as no ice in a drink, or less ice.\nLeo Burnett, is the lead creative agency behind the campaign.\n(Gallery available on web )\nChristine Xu, CMO of McDonald’s, says the self-ordering kiosks are just one step on this journey to the future.\n\"McDonald’s is a modern, and highly progressive company. We are dedicated to continuous innovation, and providing convenient, customised, and welcoming dining experiences for our customers. We are a place where customers can experience the future of fast food dining.\"\nOn 30 November, Publicis's shopper marketing agency Publicis Vivid also helped McDonald’s to launch the first ever ‘No-crew store’.\nFrom 2-4pm, McDonald’s ordering-staff disappeared behind the sales counter in 41 McDonald’s selected stores in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Chengdu, and Shenzhen leaving customers to order everything on the self-ordering kiosks by themselves.\nAngie Wong, general manager of Leo Burnett Shanghai, says, “With digital now dominating all our lives, we found a nice halfway point, which is the slogan we use for the campaign: ‘Technology, is there for life more than you think’. A digital McDonald’s store and the customised services at the self-ordering kiosk’s will definitely strengthen consumers’ sense of belonging with the brand.”",

Zachary Harris Image via Flickr/rob_rob2001 \nMichael ‘Jim’ Delligatti, fast-food legend and creator of the Big Mac, passed away this past Monday at the age of 98. \nDelligatti owned 47 McDonald's franchises, but his biggest contribution to the company came in 1967. That was the year he not only devised the secret sauce, but also came up with the idea to include an additional 'buffer' bun inbetween patties, a signature characteristic that made the Big Mac so famous. \nToday, we celebrate the 98 inspirational years of Big Mac inventor, Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti . Jim, we thank and will forever remember you. pic.twitter.com/ wmEFrmazdn — McDonald's (@McDonalds) November 30, 2016 \nDespite its iconic status, getting the three-bun burger onto McDonald's menus was harder than it sounds, thanks to an executive board that didn't want to stray too far from the classic burger and fries formula. In order to test the waters, the Big Mac was exclusively served at Delligatti's franchise locations first before picking up steam and hitting menus nationwide. Almost 60 years later, the Big Mac is still one of fast-food's most recognizable items. \nBig Mac Museum will mark Pittsburgh-area inventor's death with 'a quiet respect' https://t.co/ sZ8xnRsTGw via @theinclinepgh — PA Museums (@PA_Museums) November 30, 2016 \nAfter the runaway success of the burger, Mickey D's helped Delligatti open a Big Mac Museum restaurant in North Huntingdon, PA. If you'd like to pay your respects to the burger genius, the shrine to Delligatti's invention would be a pretty good place to start.",

By JOE MANDAK Associated Press Share Read Article \nPITTSBURGH — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame-seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. Big Mac creator Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti ate at least one of the sandwiches each week for decades, his son says. Associated Press/Gene J. Puskar Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald’s in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company’s advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti’s family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn’t immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” Share",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 \nMichael “Jim” Delligatti, the inventor of McDonald’s ( MCD - Free Report ) famous Big Mac sandwich, died Monday night in Pittsburgh at 98 years old. He was one of the iconic burger chain’s first franchisees. \nBorn in 1918 in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, Delligatti first entered the hamburger business after he moved to Southern California, managing a drive-in restaurant in Long Beach. But 1955 is when the magic began: Delligatti bought his first McDonald’s franchise for $1,500, and went on to operate 47 additional locations throughout Pennsylvania. \nDelligatti first offered the Big Mac in 1967 at his Uniontown McDonald’s, wanting to introduce a bigger burger on a menu that specialized in simple burgers, fries, and shakes. Though it seems absurd today, McDonald’s was hesitant to the idea of the Big Mac because its basic menu was selling well. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , Delligatti was eventually given the go-ahead to make the burger—despite having to go out and buy the double-sliced buns himself—creating a hit at his restaurants. \nThe recipe hasn’t changed since, with two all-beef patties, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, and “special sauce” on a sesame bun, even though the price has. The Big Mac originally sold for 45 cents. Today, you can get the burger for $3.99 (or $5.69 if you make it a meal). The burger is sold in more than 100 countries around the world. \n“Jim was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" McDonald's said in a statement on Delligatti's death. \"We will remember Jim as an insightful franchisee, a knowledgeable businessman, and an honorable gentleman who left a legacy of four generations of family members running great restaurants in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.\" \nIn addition to creating one of the most famous sandwiches ever, Delligatti played a crucial role in developing McDonald’s breakfast menu. He would feed steel workers hotcakes and sausage at the end of their overnight shifts, in effect creating the popular Hotcakes and Sausage menu item, according to a family obituary. \nStocks that Aren't in the News…Yet \nYou are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 \"Strong Buys\" free of charge.

      "title": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies",
      "text": "Creator of McDonald's flagship sandwich, the Big Mac, dies By JOE MANDAKAssociated Press \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald's in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company's advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti's family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn't immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township.  ",

(AP) – McDonald’s is testing the use of fresh, never frozen beef for its Quarter Pounder hamburgers. \nThe fast food giant says the tests are being carried out in 75 of its restaurants in the Tulsa, Oklahoma-area. It says Quarter Pounders in the restaurants will be made with fresh beef that’s cooked when ordered. \nOak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s says it got positive feedback recently from a similar test in the Dallas/Fort Worth-area. \nMcDonald’s says it has made “significant enhancements” to its food.

He was 98. The death was confirmed by his son Michael. Mr. Delligatti, who opened the first McDonald’s in western Pennsylvania in 1957, owned about a dozen franchises in the Pittsburgh area by the mid-1960s, but he struggled to compete with the Big Boy and Burger King chains. He proposed to company executives that they add a double-patty hamburger to the McDonald’s menu, something along the lines of the Big Boy, that could put a dent in sales of Burger King’s Whopper.\"",

Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH — You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald's in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company's advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti's family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn't immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Tags",

Delligatti, the Pittsburgh-area McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac in 1967, has died. He was 98. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar, File) \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nJim Delligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" Enjoy food?

He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. Tags",

      "text": "Creator Of McDonald’s Big Mac Dies At 98 Wednesday, November 30, 2016 Photo by Gene J. Puskar AP The creator of the McDonald's Big Mac has died. Michael \"Jim\" Delligatti was 98. Photo by Gene J. Puskar AP Big Mac creator Jim Delligatti attends his 90th-birthday party in 2008. \nYou might not know his name but you undoubtedly know his famous sandwich, and many of us remember singing its ingredients along with a commercial in the 1970s: \"Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun.\" \nMichael \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac, died Monday. He was 98. \nDelligatti was one of McDonald's earliest franchise holders, opening his first restaurant in Pittsburgh in 1957. He eventually owned and operated 47 additional McDonald's locations in Western Pennsylvania, making him one of the single largest franchise holders in company history. \nThe menu was pretty simple back in those early days — hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes. But Delligatti saw that his customers wanted something bigger, so in 1967 at his restaurant in Uniontown, Pa., he put together two hamburger patties, topped it with cheese, lettuce, onions and pickles, and he developed a special sauce for the burger. He called it the Big Mac. \nIn a 1993 interview with the Associated Press, he said McDonald's initially rejected the burger. \n\"I tried for two years to have McDonald's let me try to make this Big Mac and they said no,\" Delligatti said, adding, \"They figured, why go to something else if [the original menu] was working so well?\" \nSo Delligatti made and sold Big Macs in his Pittsburgh-area restaurants, experimenting with the special sauce along the way, until eventually, McDonald's executives came around and began selling the Big Mac nationally. Now, almost 50 years later, the Big Mac is sold in more than 100 countries and has become the most popular sandwich on the planet, according to the fast-food chain. \nAn obituary put out by his family notes that Delligatti was a true innovator in the fast-food industry, instrumental in introducing breakfast at McDonald's, making the hotcakes and sausage meals for hungry millworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the steel mills. \nDelligatti co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House and supported many other charities in Western Pennsylvania. He also served in the Army in World War II. \n\"Jim was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" reads a statement from McDonald's corporate headquarters. \"He is an exemplary individual who embraced the community and championed many causes and organizations that benefitted children. We will remember Jim as an insightful franchisee, a knowledgeable businessman, and an honorable gentleman.\" \nCopyright 2016 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.

      "text": "Prev post Next post Use   \nLast year, protesters across the country took to the streets to demand that cities and states raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Now, fast food goliath McDonald’s has schooled “Fight for $15” supporters on market forces by deploying self-service machines where jobs once stood. \nEarlier this month, McDonald’s announced plans to roll out digital ordering stations and table service to every single one of its 14,000 American restaurants. \nWhile these are not intended to replace the traditional line-to-order format, McDonald’s claims that some employees will be retrained to help customers operate the kiosks. \nHowever, analysts have pointed to the lessons of Economics 101 to explain why automation will ultimately thwart the Fight for $15 crowd. If the costs of hiring human employees rise while the costs of installing machines and computers to replace them fall, any corporation is going to opt to slice its margins. \nSome experts predict that a $15 minimum wage would ravage small businesses by forcing them to either hire fewer workers or to move locations in order to keep their doors open. In California, where the minimum wage will climb by $1 per year until it reaches $15 in 2021, a slew of companies have already announced their intention to move low-paying jobs out of the state. \nCheck out McDonald’s job-destroying automated kiosks below:  ",

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) \nPITTSBURGH ( AP ) — You probably don’t know his name, but you’ve almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James “Jim” Delligatti, the McDonald’s franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti’s franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain’s signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti’s sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain’s national menu in 1968. \n“He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,” his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald’s in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company’s advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti’s family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn’t immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald’s resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n“They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?” Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald’s has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald’s estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n“Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald’s system who made a lasting impression on our brand,” the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac “has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.” \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh’s Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti’s genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n“In franchising, there’s always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,” Dugan said. “He persevered and (McDonald’s) listened, and the rest is history.” \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald’s franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald’s in Pittsburgh’s North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh’s Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald’s, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti’s funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph’s Parish in O’Hara Township.
