      "text": "Amazon Ordered to Refund Kids' In-App Purchases By PC Mag ME Team Nov. 13, 2016, 5 p.m. Amazon now requires a password for all in-app purchases. \nAmazon must offer refunds to parents whose children made in-app purchases on Amazon devices without their permission, a federal judge ordered this week. \nA US District Court in Seattle issued the order in a case brought by the Federal Trade Commission against Amazon in 2014. The order requires Amazon to set up a claims process beginning early next year to alert parents of their eligibility for refunds, Reuters reported. \nThe court rejected the FTC's request for a $26.5 million lump-sum payout, however, agreeing with Amazon that that amount might have taken into account unauthorized purchases that were not made by children. \nThe original FTC complaint cites internal communications from Amazon employees when in-app purchases were first introduced in Dec. 2011. They wrote that the lack of a password requirement was \"clearly causing problems for a large percentage of our customers.\" \nThe company first required passwords for purchases over $20 in March 2012, and the Amazon Appstore now requires passwords for all in-app purchases. Related Articles Facebook Offering Refunds for Kids' In-App Purchases \nAn Amazon spokesperson did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment on the ruling, which is the latest of several court decisions that have required Amazon's rivals to reimburse similar purchases. \nIn 2014, Google agreed to refund up to $19 million to customers whose children accidentally racked up in-app purchase charges via their Android devices. It later removed the word \"free\" from any app that included in-app purchases. \nFacebook in July settled a class-action lawsuit covering users who made any kind of purchase through their Facebook accounts between February 2008 and March 2015. They can now request refunds for purchases they believe are unauthorized.",

      "title": "Newswire: Amazon renews Tig Notaro’s One Mississippi",
      "text": "Nov 14, 2016 8:46 AM Screenshot: One Mississippi/Amazon Prime Share Tweet \nTig Notaro recently laid bare her grief in One Mississippi , playing a version of herself that, while slightly fictionalized, nonetheless still loses her mother. It wasn’t the first time Notaro had gone to this particular well, but it was still a poignantly funny series. And Notaro will keep mining that tragedy for dramedy, as Amazon Studios just announced that One Mississippi will be back for season two. In sharing the news, Amazon Studios’ head of comedy and Drama, Joe Lewis, commended the show’s nuanced take on its difficult subject matter. \n“Making a show as comic and tragic as One Mississippi is a risk. Pulling it off with such intelligence and nuance is rare. We’re grateful for the audience response and we’re excited to bring them more of Tig and Kate’s brilliance in season two.” \nOne Mississippi comes from Notaro, who executive produces with Diablo Cody and Louis CK. The series made a good impression in its first season, though it had some trouble balancing its frequent trips to the past with expanding its characters in the present, resulting in some actors getting the short shrift (cough, Casey Wilson, cough). Here’s hoping that the show’s able to keep those surreal segues while also giving us more grounded moments in the present. \nSend your Newswire tips to",

      "text": "On Air: Nov 4, 2015 - Present Network: Amazon \nThe Tig Notaro comedy will return for Season 2. \nNovember 14, 2016 \nAmazon announced this morning that One Mississippi has been renewed for a second season. The freshman comedy, which premiered its pilot episode one year ago, released its full first season of six episodes in September that has been well-received by both critics and viewers. \nLoosely-inspired by comedian Tig Notaro's life, One Mississippi stars Notaro, who also co-created the series with Diablo Cody, as a woman who returns to her childhood hometown of Bay Saint Lucille after the unexpected passing of her mother. The show follows Tig's personal struggles as she deals with the complexities of re-acquainting with her past. \nLook for Season 2 to release in 2017.",

But that didn't stop us from putting him through the paces of a job interview. Unsurprisingly, Reiser turned out to be a likably surly candidate with an oddly charming affinity for being annoyed by everyone.",

That way you have just the right tools for the job, whether it’s getting an early jump on holiday gift-giving or getting a little something for yourself.\nrguzman@express-news.net",

      "text": "These are difficult, trying times for all of us. It's perfectly understandable and justifiable if you're looking for a brief escape, which \"Titanfall 2\" wonderfully provides. \nIt's an ultra-fun single  and multiplayer experience with acrobatic movement, great shooting and all of the explosive giant robot action you could ever want. Most importantly, Amazon Prime has it for the amazing price of $30 right now! \nUpdate : Well, it did. Not long after this article was published, the Amazon Prime price for \"Titanfall 2\" reverted back to $50. It's worth noting that \"Titanfall 2\" is still  totally worth full price.\nRespawn Entertainment \nFor the uninitiated, \"Titanfall 2\" is the newest game from some of the people who made \"Call of Duty\" great, who broke off and formed a new studio a few years ago. It plays like \"Call of Duty\" except you can rocket boost, run on walls and, most importantly, call down and pilot your own customizable giant robot friend.\nRunning around the environment with all of these outlandish, acrobatic movement abilities feels buttery smooth. The single-player campaign is deliciously creative and the multiplayer has a great selection of modes and customization options to keep you coming back for more. \nIn a world where this year's \"Call of Duty\" isn't so good and \"Battlefield 1\" took that series into the past, \"Titanfall 2\" offers a sci-fi action experience like none other. \nNOW WATCH: Elon Musk just unveiled something that could revolutionize how you power your home \n",

      "text": "In a relationship … with Alexa Ideation for a better interaction experience with Amazon Echo Dot\nThe place I go … when I need to think….. F or those of you that have read my previous post, you know I went through an emotional rollercoaster ride during the onboarding process when I first received my All-New Amazon Echo Dot. It’s been more than 3 weeks since I got into a relationship with Alexa and I am still not quite convinced if we are a good fit.\nLike any of my past relationships, I first hesitate to try, then once I am in a relationship, I wanna try to make it work. So here I am, trying to figure out what I can do to make things better for me and for Alexa, for now and perhaps for a long term.\nI remember growing up, watching sci-fi movies, thinking to myself that all these artificial intelligence only exists in the movies and they are simply the products of cinematic techniques. But guess what, now we are living in it! It’s no longer a fictional world but reality. Then I thought to myself, what can the advancement of artificial intelligence bring us? Endless possibilities! But first, we have to get people to want to use them, so we can get feedbacks and improve on the products. It is my belief that you don’t design a product, you design a solution. But what is the problem out there that we’re trying to solve here with artificial intelligence? How might we get more people to be onboard, so we can design a better AI product? And what problems are people facing in the process of adopting such “new” technology? What stops people from trying it? And…more and more questions in my head that I desperately want answers.\nFor me, the reasons for my hesitation of trying new technology are usually because 1) I think they’re too expensive, 2) I don’t know how reliable the software is yet, and 3) I ask myself do I need it or do I want it? In an attempt to understand this problem more objectively, I subscribed to Alexa Skills Kit to see what kind of skills do people want to develop for Alexa; I skimmed through a few research papers on ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) 2016 to see if there are interesting research topics people are already doing; I talked to a few folks that have had Amazon Echo products to understand their experience.\nBased on my short research, I think this is the problem I want to solve\nHow might we make the onboarding process less intimidating so that people would be more open to adapt to change? I gave myself a brief timeline as seen below to try to come up with a solution for this problem that I observed. I plan to utilize Alexa through my Echo Dot to tackle the design issue here.\nProject Timeline If you have seen the movie, Robot and Frank , you’d know that it’s never easy to get someone onboard with a new gadget but once they’re hooked, it becomes their daily routine…and part of who they are.",

      "text": "BII \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here.\nAmazon is increasingly positioning its popular Echo product line to be utilized throughout the home, rather than simply in one central location.\nTwo recent moves reinforce this market strategy by the online retail giant:\nThe Echo Dot is now available in a three-pack bundle, giving buyers a $20 discount off the retail price. Upon releasing the revamped Echo Dot earlier this year, the company announced the Dot would be available in six- and twelve-pack bundles for slight discounts, so this falls in line with these earlier offerings. The company will be discounting the original Echo and the Dot as a centerpiece of its Black Friday sales, according to Mashable . The original device will have its price lowered from $179.99 to $139.99, while the Dot will be priced at $39.99 for the day, down from $49.99. The discount of the Echos will begin November 20 , several days before Black Friday . The company likely hopes to allow consumers to use their newly purchased Echo devices to increase their spending in the holiday season. Amazon is lowering the price of these products in part to incentivize consumers to place Echos around their home. When Amazon first released the Echo in 2014, the company positioned it as a portable device that could be transported throughout the home. Without a built-in battery, however, it seems consumers haven't adapted to this usage model. Now, though, it appears that the company is trying to leverage the revamped Dot to encourage Echo users to integrate the Alexa voice assistant that powers the devices throughout the home.\nThe retail giant is counting on its Echo Spatial Perception (ESP) to allow these duplicate devices to coexist. The ESP system allows multiple Echo devices to be in contact with one another, so that when a user starts talking to the device, the nearest Echo unit activates and responds, rather than multiple units reacting simultaneously. With this technology in place, Amazon can move to take advantage of it through Echo Dot multipacks.\nBI Intelligence expects that companies will follow Amazon’s lead, eventually offering voice control as a platform within the smart home space. The popularity of the Echo prompted Alphabet to release the Google Home earlier this year, while Samsung and Apple are also reportedly working on competing devices. Apple, through its recent revamp of HomeKit, already offers voice control throughout the home, though it's through its mobile devices rather than through a speaker. While voice control throughout the home will not likely represent a huge monetization opportunity for Amazon in itself, it gives the company a way  to enhance its existing revenue streams, namely selling goods.\nThe U.S. smart home market has yet to truly take off. At its current state, we believe the smart home market is stuck in the 'chasm' of the technology adoption curve, in which it is struggling to surpass the early-adopter phase and move to the mass-market phase of adoption.\nThere are many barriers preventing mass-market smart home adoption: high device prices, limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles. However, the largest barrier is the technological fragmentation of the smart home ecosystem, in which consumers need multiple networking devices, apps and more to build and run their smart home.\nJohn Greenough, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on the U.S. smart home market that analyzes current consumer demand for the smart home and barriers to widespread adoption. It also analyzes and determines areas of growth and ways to overcome barriers.\nHere are some key takeaways from the report: \nSmart home devices are becoming more prevalent throughout the US. We define a smart home device as any stand-alone object found in the home that is connected to the internet, can be either monitored or controlled from a remote location, and has a noncomputing primary function. Multiple smart home devices within a single home form the basis of a smart home ecosystem. Currently, the US smart home market as a whole is in the \"chasm\" of the tech adoption curve. The chasm is the crucial stage between the early-adopter phase and the mass-market phase, in which manufacturers need to prove a need for their devices. High prices, coupled with limited consumer demand and long device replacement cycles, are three of the four top barriers preventing the smart home market from moving from the early-adopter stage to the mass-market stage. For example, mass-market consumers will likely wait until their device is broken to replace it. Then they will compare a nonconnected and connected product to see if the benefits make up for the price differential. The largest barrier is technological fragmentation within the connected home ecosystem. Currently, there are many networks, standards, and devices being used to connect the smart home, creating interoperability problems and making it confusing for the consumer to set up and control multiple devices. Until interoperability is solved, consumers will have difficulty choosing smart home devices and systems. \"Closed ecosystems\" are the short-term solution to technological fragmentation. Closed ecosystems are composed of devices that are compatible with each other and which can be controlled through a single point.

      "text": "1 of 2 | License Photo LOS ANGELES, Nov. 14 (UPI) -- Comedy series One Mississippi from creators Tig Notaro and Diablo Cody has been renewed for a second season at Amazon.\nAccording to Variety , the series will return to Amazon's Prime Video streaming service in the U.S.,U.K., Germany, Austria and Japan in 2017.\n\"Making a show as comic and tragic as One Mississippi is a risk. Pulling it off with such intelligence and nuance is rare,\" said Amazon Studios' head of comedy and drama Joe Lewis. \"We're grateful for the audience response and we're excited to bring them more of Tig and Kate's brilliance in Season 2.\"\nThe series follows a fictionalized version of Notaro as she returns home to Mississippi following the unexpected death of her mother.\nNoah Harpster, John Rothman, and Stephanie Allynne also star. Notaro, Cody and Louis C.K. will also serve as executive producers for Season 2 alongside Robin, M. Blair Breard and Dave Becky.\n Woody Allen's Amazon series debuts trailer with Miley Cyrus Jeremy Clarkson's 'Grand Tour' gets Amazon premiere date David E. Kelley on new Amazon drama 'Goliath': 'It's a whole new and unknown journey for me'",

      "text": "By Paul Hill Neowin LLC @_paulh93 · 15 minutes ago with 0 comments \nAmazon has launched its Music Unlimited service in the UK, just a month after the US launch . Regular prices start at £7.99/month or £79/year for Prime members and £9.99/month for non-Prime customers. The company said that a subscription plan for individual Echo devices is available for just £3.99/month. \nAccording to Amazon, Music Unlimited is: \n“An on-demand music service that redefines music streaming by putting a catalogue of over 40 million songs and thousands of hand-curated playlists and personalised stations not just at the tips of your fingers, but also on the tip of your tongue. Amazon Music Unlimited makes discovering new music or listening to favourites easier and more fun than ever with the recently redesigned Amazon Music app as well as with innovative new Alexa voice controls.” \nFor users who buy the “for Echo”£3.99/month subscription, you’ll be able to listen to behind-the-scenes artist commentary about their music, which is called Side-by-Side. The service is available exclusively on Amazon Music with commentaries from famous artists including Emeli Sandé, The Chainsmokers, Sting, Two Door Cinema Club, Madness, Norah Jones, The Shires and Michael Buble, with more being added all the time. \nEarlier this month it was reported that Apple Music may see price drops across its service to better compete against Amazon. We could see a decision from Apple as soon as Christmas.",

      "text": "Enlarge Image Amazon says some of its most popular services are TV wall-mounting, house cleaning and furniture assembly. \nPhoto by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images Not into DIY? Amazon is ready to help you install and assemble all the things you buy from its site.\nThe e-commerce company said Monday it will expand Amazon Home Services -- its hub for hiring plumbers, painters and electricians through its website -- to 20 more metropolitan areas, including Indianapolis, Las Vegas and San Antonio. Amazon launched Home Services in 2015, and has since expanded it to more than 50 metro areas.\nAmazon Home Services works as a middleman to link customers with contractors. Amazon makes its money by taking a 10 percent to 20 percent cut from each sale. When a customer buys something from Amazon that needs to be installed or assembled -- say a new shower head or futon -- they can include that service during the checkout process. \n\"Today, customers can search over 1,200 unique services from pros in over 60 professions - from house cleaning, to lawn work and beyond,\" said Nish Lathia, general manager of Amazon Home Services in a statement Monday. \"The availability of Home Services in more cities means that more customers can quickly find and schedule the help they need around the house heading into the holiday season.\"\nHere are the new cities in which Home Services is available:\nSanta Rosa, Calif. Ventura County, Calif. Boulder, Colo. Greater Bridgeport, Conn. New Haven, Conn. Brevard County, Fla. Cape Coral, Fla. Sarasota, Fla. Indianapolis, Ind. Ann Arbor, Mich. Raleigh, N.C. Trenton, N.J. Las Vegas, Nev. Cleveland, Ohio Allentown, Pa. Lehigh Valley, Pa. San Antonio, Texas Milwaukee, Wis. Richmond, Va. Hampton Roads Va./N.C.",

      "text": "AMEX Gold Rewards Card : Earn up to 25,000 bonus points \nSpend at Amazon \nSpend $25 on more, after taxes and shipping, at Amazon.ca , and you will get a $25 statement credit! \nThe purchase(s) must be made in full with the registered AMEX, and during the period of November 14 and December 31. There doesn’t seem to be anything in the terms and conditions that limits Amazon Gift Card purchases from qualifying, so that would be the easiest way to grab the statement credit if you don’t have anything to buy from Amazon at the moment. \nThe statement credit should post within five days of the qualifying spend but may take up to 90 days after the offer period ends (that would mean around March 2017). There are several other terms and conditions that you should be aware of.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray The decline in fortunes since Wednesday’s upset victory in the U.S. presidential election by Donald Trump is just a part of the overall clearing out of a “crowded trade” in large-cap tech, writes Morgan Stanley strategist Adam Parker , along with colleagues, in a note to clients today.\nRegarding the drop in tech names in the past several sessions, Parker and company note “ Apple ( AAPL ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), and Amazon ( AMZN ) are among the 10 worst performing mega-caps relative to what our model would have expected given broader macro moves.”\nIn part, he writes, this reflects that “mega-cap tech stocks where hedge fund clients were broadly overweight appear to have been viewed as ‘safe’ and are being used as a source of funds for the rotation into financials, health care and industrials, where investors were not positioned.”\nIt’s not just portfolio rotation, though, for Parker continues “we are underweight technology, viewing the crowding as an issue and concerned about the ability of the group to expand margins, an important element of multiple expansion in tech stocks.”\nLater in the note, parker notes the firm prefers biotech names to software specifically, as biotech is “is quite cheap for its underlying growth rate.”",

      "text": "Home » Amazon invades Angie's List home turf with contractor services Amazon invades Angie's List home turf with contractor services November 14, 2016 Largest Indianapolis-Area Mechanical Contractors - PDF \nInternet giant Amazon announced Monday that it's expanding its home services offerings to 20 new markets including Indianapolis, intensifying the competitive landscape for locally based Angie's List. Amazon Home Services debuted last year and allows people ordering products through its website to book a contractor to install or mount those items—for example, a sink, gameroom table or bedroom suite—as part of its checkout process. Like Angie's List, it also is offerring to connect consumers to independent firms for common services such as home improvement, automotive repair and yard work. The expansion now brings Amazon's home services footprint to 50 U.S. cities. Angie's List currenty operates in 253.\"We're thrilled to be offering more Amazon customers access to our network of trusted pros throughout the U.S.,\" Nish Lathia, general manager of Amazon Home Services, said Monday in a press release. Although Amazon is a behemoth in Internet retail, its professional services network likely pales in comparison to Angie's List, which has nearly 56,000 service professionals in more than 700 service categories.\"The home services space is a $400 billion marketplace, so it’s not surprising that more companies are trying to get into it,\" Angie's List spokeswoman Cheryl Reed said in an email on Monday.\"We're laser-focused on delivering the best service we can to our members—giving them high quality and fair prices and ensuring they can easily connect to the best local service companies and remove some of the stress of home maintenance and improvement. We’re better positioned than most to actually deliver—and even expand—on that.\" Amazon, Google and even Facebook have made clear their intentions in recent years to invade the home services space and connect consumers and service professionals. Angie's List executives have said they are paying attention, but that the new competition has not had a material impact on the company's business.\"In terms of the competitive landscape, it is intensifying and that's a good validation of the attractiveness of the space,\" Chief Financial Officer Tom Fox said during the company's first-quarter earnings call in April. \"And even though it is intensifying, ... we still don't see that impacting us adversely in terms of where our consumers or service providers are going. We watch it really, really closely.\" Angie's List is undergoing a turnaround that included ditching is \"paying members only\" subscriber model in favor of a freemium model in June. Members can pay for can pay for premium features including fair price guarantees, but basic services are free. Its rationale is to rapidly grow its 4.5 million-member user base so that service providers would be more inclined to advertise on the platform. Service provider revenue growth has been tepid in recent quarters, and the company has been under pressure to accelerate revenue growth. Earlier this month, CEO Scott Durchslag announced that the company was pursuing strategic alternatives. That could include a sale, but could also include other partnerships or investments that could help the company speed up its turnaround efforts.",

Since the service launched in March 2015 , it has widened its reach to include 50 metro areas in the US. Recent additions include Indianapolis, San Antonio, Ann Arbor, Las Vegas, and Cleveland. The number of services available has also increased from 700 to over 1,200. The number of services available has increased to over 1,200 The announcement took place not long after Amazon announced job openings for “Amazon Assistants,” which was picked up by The Seattle Times a week ago. Potential recruits were to be “experts in helping Amazon customers keep up their home,” which includes providing assistance to its customers with “tidying up around the home, laundry, and helping put groceries and essentials like toilet paper and paper towels away,” according to The Seattle Times . Amazon Home Services is one of the many initiatives that the company has introduced to improve its in-home shopping and services. Other initiatives that the company has introduced include Dash Buttons and Dash Replenishment Services , which automatically orders detergent or soap for you when it is in need of replacement.

      "text": "November 14, 2016, 12:30 PM TechSpot \nAmazon on Monday morning announced the expansion of Amazon Home Services , the service that lets shoppers hire local professionals to help out with all sorts of around-the-house tasks. \nAmazon in late 2014 quietly launched a service that would let shoppers hire installation professionals when purchasing applicable products (hire someone to mount that new TV on the wall, for example). The company rebranded the service in 2015 and expanded its reach to include handyman-type jobs in a bid to compete with similar offerings from Angie’s List, HomeAdvisor, Handy, Thumbtack, Facebook Professional Services and others. \nToday's expansion brings Amazon Home Services coverage to these additional 20 metro areas: Santa Rosa, CA; Ventura County, CA; Boulder, CO; Greater Bridgeport, CT; New Haven, CT; Brevard County, FL; Cape Coral, FL; Sarasota, FL; Indianapolis, IN; Ann Arbor, MI; Raleigh, NC; Trenton, NJ; Las Vegas, NV; Cleveland, OH; Allentown, PA; Lehigh Valley, PA; San Antonio, TX; Milwaukee, WI; Richmond, VA and Hampton Roads VA/NC. \nAngie’s List is considered to be the market leader in the local professional-for-hire industry but as TechCrunch highlights , the company has found itself in choppy waters as of late. After turning down a $512 million acquisition offer from IAC subsidy HomeAdvisor last year, Angie’s List is now laying off employees and considering alternative strategies. \nThe e-commerce giant hasn’t poured a lot of marketing dollars into its Home Services division, instead electing to more or less let it grow organically – a strategy that appears to be paying dividends. \nSince the rebrand last year, Amazon says the number of service providers it has attracted has increased more than 1,500 percent. Nish Lathia, General Manager of Amazon Home Services, says customers can now search over 1,200 unique services from qualified handymen in more than 60 professions. Image courtesy Angie's List",

      "text": "Amazon Has to Pay You Back for Purchases Your Kids Made Without Permission Kate Storey From Good Housekeeping Good news for any parents who've gotten a credit card bill chock-full of purchases from games their kids were playing on the iPad or smart phone. On Thursday, a federal judge ruled Amazon has to reimburse parents for purchases kids made in-app without permission, according to NBC News . The case was brought by the Federal Trade Commission, which accused Amazon of making it too easy for kids to rack up charges while playing games like \"Pet Shop Story\" and \"Ice Age Village\" on mobile devices. The FTC estimated a whopping $86 million of unauthorized charges. Amazon will start the year-long reimbursement process early next year by alerting parents of their eligibility for refunds and then reimbursing them. According to the report, Amazon has already improved password protocols and other controls to stop unauthorized purchases. Hooray!

      "text": "Reuters \nLooks like Amazon could be the next huge company to give up an employee review process that forces managers to rank employees against each other, making job performance all about survival of the fittest.\nAmazon tells Geekwire's Taylor Soper and Todd Bishop that it plans to overhaul the worst part of the review process , although it has not offered details on the revisions. \nA spokesperson confirmed the change to Business Insider saying:\n\"We're launching a new annual review process next year that is radically simplified and focuses on our employees' strengths, not the absence of weaknesses. We will continue to iterate and build on the program based on what we learn from our employees.”\nRank and yank Amazon has been using a review process known as \"stack ranking\" or \"rank and yank\" in which employees are rated against each other as opposed to how well they meeting their job requirements.\nReuters The idea is that the lowest-rated employees will be continuously eliminated, creating a company of only highly productive employees. It came to fame in the 1980s and was made popular by GE's Jack Welch.\nThe problem is that it's really only valuable for a short- ime, such as when a company is reorganizing, stack ranking experts say . Using it long-term tends to create a dog-eat-dog kind of culture.\nOne HR expert on CNN compared Amazon's review process to \"The Hunger Games.\"   In a New York Times story about the company's \"bruising workplace\" that went viral last year, the review process was described like \"choosing sacrificial lambs to protect more essential players.\"\nThe review process isn't just a trendy tactic. It has been a core part of founder CEO Jeff Bezos philosophy, reported Bloomberg's Brad Stone.  Bezos believed managers needed to raise the performance bar with every new hire so that the only employees that rise through the company would be the ones considered exceptional.\nHated for years Amazon employees have been complaining about the review process for years on Glassdoor. In one of the most popular reviews, written in 2013, one software development manager wrote:  \n\"Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five ago will get you canned today. It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.\"\nAmazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. And the complaints have continued ever since. Just last month, a former software development employee wrote:\n\"Aggressive stack ranking comes with its own host of problems related to employee dissatisfaction, lack of team productivity, lack of trust among peers.\"\nThis person advised the company to, \"Eliminate or at least change the stack ranking system so that people can comfortably collaborate effectively instead of sabotaging each other's work.\"\nThese days, stack ranking has generally gone out of favor, especially in the tech industry. After years of complaints by employees, Microsoft ditched it last year. Yahoo also faced criticism when CEO Marissa Mayer  tried to implement it in her turnaround efforts. \nAnd now, it looks like Amazon wants to treat employees in a less cutthroat way, too.\nNOW WATCH: FORMER WALL STREET EXEC: The right way to invest in the chaos after Trump’s win \n",

      "text": "print Amazon's Jeff Bezos Reuters \nLooks like Amazon could be the next huge company to give up an employee review process that forces managers to rank employees against each other, making job performance all about survival of the fittest. \nAmazon tells Geekwire's Taylor Soper and Todd Bishop that it plans to overhaul the worst part of the review process , although it has not offered details on the revisions. \nA spokesperson confirmed the change to Business Insider saying: \n\"We're launching a new annual review process next year that is radically simplified and focuses on our employees' strengths, not the absence of weaknesses. We will continue to iterate and build on the program based on what we learn from our employees.” Rank and yank \nAmazon has been using a review process known as \"stack ranking\" or \"rank and yank\" in which employees are rated against each other as opposed to how well they meeting their job requirements. \nYouTube screencap \nThe idea is that the lowest-rated employees will be continuously eliminated, creating a company of only highly productive employees. It came to fame in the 1980s and was made popular by GE's Jack Welch. \nThe problem is that it's really only valuable for a short- ime, such as when a company is reorganizing, stack ranking experts say . Using it long-term tends to create a dog-eat-dog kind of culture. \nOne HR expert on CNN compared Amazon's review process to \"The Hunger Games.\" In a New York Times story about the company's \"bruising workplace\" that went viral last year, the review process was described like \"choosing sacrificial lambs to protect more essential players.\" \nThe review process isn't just a trendy tactic. It has been a core part of founder CEO Jeff Bezos philosophy, reported Bloomberg's Brad Stone. Bezos believed managers needed to raise the performance bar with every new hire so that the only employees that rise through the company would be the ones considered exceptional. Hated for years \nAmazon employees have been complaining about the review process for years on Glassdoor. In one of the most popular reviews, written in 2013, one software development manager wrote: \"Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five ago will get you canned today. It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.\" Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. \nAnd the complaints have continued ever since. Just last month, a former software development employee wrote: \n\"Aggressive stack ranking comes with its own host of problems related to employee dissatisfaction, lack of team productivity, lack of trust among peers.\" \nThis person advised the company to, \"Eliminate or at least change the stack ranking system so that people can comfortably collaborate effectively instead of sabotaging each other's work.\" \nThese days, stack ranking has generally gone out of favor, especially in the tech industry. After years of complaints by employees, Microsoft ditched it last year. Yahoo also faced criticism when CEO Marissa Mayer tried to implement it in her turnaround efforts. \nAnd now, it looks like Amazon wants to treat employees in a less cutthroat way, too.

      "text": "Amazon Stock Is Down, but We're Still Bullish By Diane Alter , Contributing Writer , Money Morning   Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter \nAmazon stock is down 12.49% this month as the war of words between President-elect Donald Trump and CEO Jeff Bezos continues. \nBut despite the pullback in Amazon stock today , we remain bullish on AMZN. \nBefore we get into our bullish stance on Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN ), here are some details regarding the acrimonious exchange between Trump and Bezos. Why Amazon Stock Is Down This Month \nTrump's beef with Bezos, and Amazon, has a lot to do with the president-elect's disdain for The Washington Post . Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, is also the owner of The Post . \nTrump thinks Bezos bought The Post in 2013 to persuade Washington politicians to keep Amazon's taxes low and help the company skirt antitrust scrutiny. \nTrump has said that since he would be tough on Amazon, Bezos was using The Post to write ugly articles about the Republican candidate to keep him out of the White House. \n\"This is owned as a toy by Jeff Bezos who controls Amazon,\" Trump told FOX News in May. \"Amazon is getting away with murder tax-wise. He's using The Washington Post for power so that the politicians in Washington don't tax Amazon like they should be taxed.\" \nThe slide for Amazon stock has continued into this week already. Today, Amazon stock is down more than 2.5% to below $720 per share. \nTrending: Are you doing everything you can to grow your retirement \"nest egg\"? You can start today with our top 5 money-making investment reports – they're absolutely free … \nClashes between corporate America and politicians are nothing new. Still, Bezos took the high road after Trump's win. He extended his congratulations to the 45th president of the United States and tweeted: \"I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\" \nWhile politics has pressured Amazon stock recently, this is just a short-term reaction from investors. We have been and remain bullish on AMZN stock, and view the recent pullback as a buying opportunity… Why We're Bullish on AMZN Stock in 2017",

      "text": "He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick \nInvesting geniuses Tom and David Gardner have spent a long time beating the market no matter who's in the White House. In fact, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor , has tripled the market.* \nDavid and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and Amazon.com wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. \nContinue Reading Below \nClick here to learn about these picks! \n*Stock Advisor returns as of November 7 , 2016 \nThis podcast was recorded on Nov. 4, 2016. \nDaniel Sparks: As far as Amazon Web Services, that was another interesting area during the call. Of course, it always is. I think investors think of Amazon as this e-commerce company. At the end of the day, a huge chunk of theiroperating profits comes from Amazon Web Services,even though it's only about 10% of revenue. This was an area that investors should always make sure and turn to, even though they might not have experience with Amazon Web Services. The fact is, Amazon Web Services is a big deal. We can call it AWS for short. \nDylan Lewis: Yeah. That is really a cash cow for the business.I love the statistic. The division's $861 million operating profit was more than 3 times larger than the North America retailing profits, which is bananas, and gives you an idea of how crucial it is to the business, despiteonly being 10% of the top line. Certainly something to be mindful of. That segment inparticular had 55% year-over-year sales growth, and 101% higher operating profits. Those are two things that are trending very nicely for them. the_motley_fool has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon.com.

      "text": "U.S. Internet companies including Facebook fb and Amazon amzn have sent President-elect Donald Trump a detailed list of their policy priorities, which includes promoting strong encryption, immigration reform, and maintaining liability protections from content that users share on their platforms.\nThe letter sent on Friday by the Internet Association, a trade group whose 40 members also include Alphabet’s Google googl , Uber, and Twitter twtr , represents an early effort to repair the relationship between the technology sector and Trump, who was almost universally disliked and at times denounced in Silicon Valley during the presidential campaign.\n“The Internet industry looks forward to engaging in an open and productive dialog,” reads the letter, signed by Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, and seen by Reuters.\nSome of the policy goals stated in the letter may align with Trump’s priorities, including easing regulation on the sharing economy, lowering taxes on profits made from intellectual property and applying pressure on Europe to not erect too many barriers that restrict U.S. internet companies from growing in that market.\nOther goals are likely to clash with Trump, who offered numerous broadsides against the tech sector during his campaign.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's daily technology newsletter. \nThey include supporting strong encryption in products against efforts by law enforcement agencies to mandate access to data for criminal investigations, upholding recent reforms to U.S. government surveillance programs that ended the bulk collection of call data by the National Security Agency, and maintaining net neutrality rules that require internet service providers to treat web traffic equally.\nThe association seeks immigration reform to support more high-skilled workers staying in the United States. Though Trump made tougher immigration policies a central theme of his campaign, he has at times shied away from arguing against more H-1B visas for skilled workers, saying in a March debate he was “softening the position because we need to have talented people in this country.”\nWhile urging support for trade agreements, the letter does not mention the Trans Pacific Partnership, which Trump has repeatedly assailed with claims it was poorly negotiated and would take jobs away from U.S. workers. The technology sector supported the deal, but members of Congress have conceded since the election it is not going to be enacted.\nTrump’s often-shifting policy proposals on the campaign trail frequently alarmed tech companies and sometimes elicited public mockery, such as when Trump called for closing off parts of the internet to limit militant Islamist propaganda.\n\nTrump has also urged a boycott of Apple aapl products over the company’s refusal to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlock an iPhone associated with last year’s San Bernardino, Calif. shootings, threatened antitrust action against Amazon, and demanded that tech companies such as Apple manufacture their products in the United States.",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft and Amazon are in a battle for cloud supremacy and while both platforms offer compelling services, the real winner the past couple of years has been the user. Today, Amazon is announcing a further reduction in pricing and if history is any judge of what will happen next, expect Microsoft to follow close behind with price cuts.\nThe cuts announced today , which Amazon says is their 53 rd price reduction, drops pricing up to 25% but the reductions are dependent on your location. The new pricing, for the C4, M4 and T2 tiers is below.\nC4 – Reductions of up to 5% in US East (Northern Virginia) and EU (Ireland) and 20% in Asia Pacific (Mumbai) and Asia Pacific (Sydney). M4 – Reductions of up to 10% in US East (Northern Virginia), EU (Ireland), and EU (Frankfurt) and 25% in Asia Pacific (Singapore). T2 – Reductions of up to 10% in US East (Northern Virginia) and 25% in Asia Pacific (Singapore). With more companies moving to the cloud each quarter as it’s easier, and often less expensive, to utilize cloud infrastructure than build out your own data center, these price reductions will only fuel the growth in this sector.\nEach quarter, Microsoft and Amazon continue to show positive trends in the cloud segments and its one of the contributing factors to why both of their stock prices continue to climb. The opportunity in the cloud segment, with primarily Amazon and Microsoft competing ( although Google is finally starting to make a move in this segment too ) means that each stand to grab a significant portion of the global IT spend each year.\nEven if Google does eventually build out a cloud service that competes seriously with Amazon and Microsoft across all metrics, the market options will still be small for the dollars at stake.\nThe post Amazon Cuts Cloud Costs Up To 25%, Adds Fuel To The Cloud Race appeared first on Petri .\n",

      "title": "Win an Xbox One S With Forza Horizon 3 and Amazon’s ‘The Grand Tour’",
      "text": "RandomCarGuy17 takes a familiar GT-R for a spin: could you have a chance of joining the Horizon festival yourself?\nThe launch of the Xbox One S has been a resounding success for Microsoft. In the UK, the console has outsold the PS4 for the past 4 months despite Sony’s stronghold on the home console market. Had your eye on the HDR-ready Xbox revision? A promotion between Forza Horizon 3 and Amazon’s The Grand Tour may be able to help if you live in the US of A.\nThe — deep breath — ‘Xbox Live and Amazon Original “The Grand Tour” and “Forza Horizon 3″ Sweepstakes’ competition will give everyone the chance to win a neat selection of prizes. The grand prize winner will be awarded a 2TB Xbox One S, a 55” 4K Ultra HDTV, an Xbox One Lab customized controller, a racing wheel and a $100 Amazon gift card.\nFive secondary prize winners will also get the console, custom controller and a $40 Amazon voucher. Ten further winners will receive an Amazon voucher to the above value. Quite the selection of prizes on offer, then.\n\nThere are two ways to enter the sweepstakes. Firstly, if you own an Xbox One and Forza Horizon 3: Navigate to the Amazon landing page on the Xbox Live dashboard and click the promotional area. Once this step is completed, go onto Forza Horizon 3 and complete “The Grand Tour Rivals Event” to secure your entry.\nIf you don’t own either the console or the game, you can also enter via e-mail. Simply send a mail to AmazonGrandTour@xboxpromotions.com with “Xbox Live Amazon Original Sweepstakes” as the subject. In the body of the message, include your name, address, city, state, zip code, daytime phone number, and e-mail address. After completing this, you’re in with a chance.\nThe Grand Tour is due to start this Friday and this Sweepstakes could point toward an extended partnership between the show and the Forza franchise. Fans of the series will know that Hammond, May and Clarkson’s old treading ground ‘Top Gear’ was heavily affiliated with the series with the Top Gear Test Track and in-game commentary being a few of the featured elements from the show. Perhaps The Grand Tour will follow suit.\nThe Grand Tour looks to host the ultimate hypercar showdown.\nThe competition closes on February 3, 2017 with the winner being drawn on the 27th of the same month, so there’s plenty of time to enter whether you already have the console or not. Full Terms and Conditions are located here , for all those entering…good luck!\nThanks to Northstar for the heads up! \n",

      "title": "What? Amazon carries Beats Solo3 at $220 full price",
      "text": "Amazon has just launched sales of the Beats Solo3 wireless headphones , something previously touted an Apple Store exclusive. But while Beats is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apple , its consumer-facing side shows itself at multiple retailers like Best Buy, Target and even Amazon. And apparently, it still has rebel blood in itself to stick out from Apple.\nSo, it’s Amazon where we find a $300 pair of wireless headphones with the Apple W1 chipset introduced at a very low $219.99. $80 off? Really, Amazon? And that’s a full price listing — no “original price” tags or anything.\nOf course, the catch is that you’ll have to pick up the black version of the headset. The silver version starts selling on November 17 for the whole $299.95. Gold, Rose Gold and glossy white and black versions are on sale for $249.99.\nThe post What? Amazon carries Beats Solo3 at $220 full price appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

The on-demand service, brimming with over 40 million songs and thousands of new playlists, was delivered to the U.S last month and is now here in all it's innovative glory. \n\"We’ve been thrilled with customer reaction to the launch of Amazon Music Unlimited in the U.S. last month and we're excited to quickly bring the service to customers in the UK,\" said Steve Boom, Vice President Amazon Music. \"Starting today, Amazon Music Unlimited offers our UK customers playlists and stations curated by our music experts in the UK, featuring leading British and international artists – we think customers are going to love it.\" \n\"Amazon Music Unlimited brings real value to the millions of people in the UK who are already Prime members, with a choice of subscribing for only £7.99 a month or even £79 per year,\" said Jeff Bezos, Amazon Founder and CEO. \"And if you want a sense of the future of voice-controlled music, go ahead and ask Alexa for a free Amazon Music Unlimited trial, and play around on your Echo. If you don’t know the name of a song but know a few lyrics, if you want to hear songs from a specific decade, or even if you’re looking for music to match your mood, just ask.

      "text": "Amazon has leased the entirety of this office building in Seattle’s Denny Triangle neighborhood. Credit: Trammell Crow Co. Amazon just opened the second building of its new Seattle headquarters last week, but that hasn’t stopped the online retail giant from gobbling up office space all over the region.\nAmazon has inked a lease at Midtown21 , a 21-story office tower just a few blocks away from its new campus in the Denny Triangle neighborhood, that covers the entirety of the office space, about 365,000 square feet, the developer Trammell Crow Co . and its partner MetLife announced Monday. The building is under construction now and is scheduled to open next month. Amazon will move in next year.\nAmazon’s growth continues to amaze. Last month, it announced plans to lease five floors of the old Tommy Bahama headquarters in the South Lake Union neighborhood, where Amazon first planted its flag in 2007 . That came just a couple weeks after news that the online retail giant is opening a new office across Lake Washington in Bellevue, where it recently completed a lease for 354,000 square feet of office space .\nAll this activity comes as Amazon continues to build out its new campus. As the second building opened last week, crews were already working on the third block, which temporarily housed the company’s Prime Now rapid delivery hub. The company also has a fourth block in the neighborhood, where permit records show it is planning to build approximately 860,000 square feet of office space.\nEarlier this year, Amazon Director of Global Real Estate and Facilities John Schoettler said by 2022 the online retail giant could take up close to 12 million square feet across 40 buildings in Seattle. All this space is necessary to house the company’s rapidly-growing workforce, now totaling more than 35,000 people in Washington state , and 306,000 worldwide .",

      "text": "AWS to Adjust Computing Capacity Pricing Downward Dec. 1 \nAmazon on Nov. 14 announced its 53rd price reduction in its web services business. The company's Elastic Compute (EC2) team will adjust pricing downward beginning Dec. 1, \"just in time to make your holiday season just a little bit more cheerful,\" evangelist Jeff Barr wrote in his corporate blog. \n\"Our engineering investments, coupled with our scale and our time-tested ability to manage our capacity, allow us to identify and pass on the cost savings to you,\" Barr said. \nMost of AWS's price reductions have come from its S3 storage (Simple Storage Service), which was instituted in 2006. \nThis one, however, is about cloud computing capacity. AWS is reducing the On-Demand, Reserved Instance (Standard and Convertible) and Dedicated Host prices for C4, M4, and T2 instances by up to 25 percent, depending on region and platform (Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE, Windows, and others). \nDetails: \nC4: Reductions of up to 5 percent in U.S. East (Northern Virginia) and European Union (Ireland) and 20 percent in Asia Pacific (Mumbai) and Asia Pacific (Sydney). \nM4: Reductions of up to 10 percent in U.S. East (Northern Virginia), EU (Ireland), and EU (Frankfurt) and 25 percent in Asia Pacific (Singapore). \nT2: Reductions of up to 10 percent in U.S. East (Northern Virginia) and 25 percent in Asia Pacific (Singapore). \n\"You do not need to take any action in order to benefit from the reduction in On-Demand prices,\" Barr wrote. \"If you are using billing alerts or our newly revised budget feature, you may want to consider revising your thresholds downward as appropriate.\"",

      "text": "A screen shot of the Diversity at Amazon web page where Affinity Groups and who and what they represent are listed. (Via Amazon.com) Jeff Bezos has responded to what he called a “heartfelt email” from an employee representing Amazon’s Affinity Group Leaders who were seeking a message of support from the company’s leadership in the wake of Donald Trump’s presidential victory.\nJeff Bezos. (Kevin Lisota / GeekWire) Anthony Little, a senior vendor manager at Amazon, emailed Bezos on Friday on behalf of the leaders of nine groups within the company whose focus is on providing insight and opportunity to diverse voices. Groups include Women@Amazon, Asians@Amazon, Black Employee Network, GLAmazon (for LGBQT issues and opportunities) and more.\nLittle said that “groups represented by our memberships were undeservingly pulled into the spotlight” during the divisive presidential campaign and many employees felt deeply affected by the outcome. His hope was that “a nonpartisan message expressing Amazon’s continued support of diversity and inclusion” would help to reassure employees.\nBezos replied on Sunday afternoon, saying that Amazon “has always been, and always will be, committed to equal rights, tolerance and diversity. And we firmly reject, and have zero tolerance for, harassment of any kind.”\nThe CEO said nothing will change the company’s enduring values of diversity and inclusion, and he welcomed Little to share his response with his colleagues. Both emails were shared with GeekWire on Monday.\nBezos himself congratulated Trump last Wednesday in a tweet in which he wished the president-elect “great success.”\nCongratulations to @realDonaldTrump . I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.\n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 10, 2016 \nTrump has previously made threats against Bezos and Amazon as a business, and Bezos once joked about reserving the billionaire businessman-turned-politician a seat on one of his Blue Origin rockets to space. In May, Bezos also said Trump’s accusations against Amazon were “not an appropriate way for a presidential candidate to behave.”\nHere is the full email to Bezos on behalf of the Affinity Group Leaders:\nHello Jeff,\nThe US has just concluded two years of the most divisive presidential campaigning many of us can remember with an unexpected result. The groups represented by our memberships were undeservingly pulled into the spotlight, and as such many of us feel deeply affected by the outcome.\nAs leaders, we understand the importance of our company’s commitment to bring diverse backgrounds and points of view to inventing on behalf of our customers. We believe diversity underscores everything we are and do, and when we look to our principles we are comforted to see diversity consistently represented in Invent & Simplify, Are Right A Lot, and Learn and Be Curious.\nIn order to reinforce our commitment to diverse perspectives, we believe a message from our leadership delivering a nonpartisan message expressing Amazon’s continued support of diversity and inclusion as well as reiterating that Amazon does not support workplace harassment of any kind, would provide much needed reassurance to employees during this uncertain time.\nYour consideration is greatly appreciated. Please let us know if you need any help or have any questions.\nBest,\nAmazon Affinity Group Leaders\nAmazonPWD@\nAsians@\nAWE@\nBEN@\nglam azon@\nLatinos@\nWarriors@\nWiFi@\nWomen@\nHere is Bezos’ full reply to Anthony Little and the Affinity Group Leaders:\nDear Anthony and all of our affinity groups,\nThank you very much for your heartfelt email. As you note, the importance of diversity is represented in our Leadership Principles. Amazon has always been, and always will be, committed to equal rights, tolerance and diversity. And we firmly reject, and have zero tolerance for, harassment of any kind.\nWe’re a company of builders whose diverse backgrounds, ideas, and points of view are critical to helping us invent on behalf of all our customers. But it’s not only that diversity and inclusion are good for our business. It’s more fundamental than that — it’s simply right. These are enduring values for us—and nothing will change that.\nPlease feel free to share my note with your colleagues.\nThank you,\nJeff\n",

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Amazon rolls out Home Services in 20 new markets First launched in 2015, Amazon Home Services is an Angie's List-style, hyper-local marketplace that connects consumers with service providers. \nAmazon's Home Services business is now available in 20 additional markets , the company announced Monday.   \nFirst launched in 2015, Amazon Home Services is an Angie's List-style, hyper-local marketplace that connects consumers with service providers. Amazon aims to simplify the process by handling many of the backend details that come with hiring a skilled laborer, such as vetting background checks and references, assuring the maintenance of proper licenses, and verifying service quality. \nHome Services also removes much of the price bartering that can come with hiring a skilled worker. All of the billing and payments run through Amazon, and worker aren't compensated until a project is completed. \nAs a bonus to consumers, the professionals using the service are required to offer the same price on Amazon as they would if called directly -- even though Amazon takes a cut of between 10 percent and 20 percent of every service arranged through its site. Amazon is also guaranteeing customer satisfaction, offering a redo or a refund in instances where the service failed to meet expectations. \nAt launch the service was available in roughly 30 markets, and with today's announcement it moves into cities including Boulder, Colorado; New Haven, Connecticut; Indianapolis, Indiana; Trenton, New Jersey; and San Antonio, Texas. \n\"We're thrilled to be offering more Amazon customers access to our network of trusted pros throughout the US,\" said Nish Lathia, GM of Amazon Home Services. \"The availability of Home Services in more cities means that more customers can quickly find and schedule the help they need around the house heading into the holiday season.\" \nAmazon faces a growing number of competitors in the on-demand labor space. Angie's List and HomeBuilder are among the more prominent players, and younger startups such as Handy are also making plays for market share. Join Discussion",

Amazon sues alleged counterfeit sellers 0 Share: Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images \nAmazon filed two lawsuits Monday in a Washington state court against sellers of alleged counterfeit products. \nThis appears to be the first time the internet retailer has filed suits against merchants involving counterfeit issues. \nAmazon declined to comment on the suits Monday. \nIn one suit, Amazon claimed ToyNet of California, Disk Vision of Florida and 10 unknown individuals supplied and sold on Amazon bogus Forearm Forklift furniture moving straps, which are trademarked and patented by Above All Co. \nIn another suit, Amazon claimed Cheng Hak Yung, also known as Joana Wong Ferreira, and Man Hong Chau, both of New York, as well as 10 unknown defendants made and sold fake TRX workout gear. \nAs of September, Amazon has blocked all these alleged counterfeit sellers from its site and removed all their listings from Amazon.com. \nAmazon claimed breach of contract and false advertising in the suits, and asked the court to allow it to permanently ban the defendants and their employees from selling on Amazon's websites. \nThis is a developing story.",

      "text": "November 14, 2016 12:00 AM Good news for CBS, HBO and Amazon: Several new shows renewed By CHRIS BARTON AND LIBBY HILL Los Angeles Times Order Reprint of this Story \nMonday morning brought good news for a number of new television series on various networks. \nCBS announced that it was giving full-season orders to the new sitcoms \"Man With a Plan\" and \"The Great Indoors,\" which means five of the network's newcomers will endure through the fall. \n\"The Great Indoors\" stars Joel McHale in a workplace comedy that mines the generational divide between Generation X and millennials, and \"Man With a Plan\" marked the much-publicized return of Matt LeBlanc from \"Friends\" to a network sitcom. Both shows debuted in late October and have earned respectable ratings. \"The Great Indoors\" was touted by CBS as the No. 2 new comedy of the season, averaging more than 8 million viewers. \nThe new CBS shows \"Bull,\"\"MacGyver\" and \"Kevin Can Wait,\" which stars Kevin James in the season's top-rated new sitcom, were also given full orders by the network early in the fall. \nThe network also ordered three additional episodes of the medical drama \"Code Black,\" which is in its second season. \nHBO announced Monday that it was renewing its three fall series for second seasons. \n\"Westworld,\" a futuristic drama that explores sin and the complexities of consciousness, has proved a ratings hit for HBO, averaging a gross audience of 11.7 million viewers through its first seven episodes. \nThe renewal also includes critically acclaimed comedy series \"Insecure.\" Created by and starring Issa Rae, \"Insecure\" examines the difficulties of navigating the modern world as a young black woman. \nAlso scoring a second season is \"Divorce,\" the series that brought \"Sex and the City\" star Sarah Jessica Parker back to the network and digs into a marriage as it falls apart. \nCompleting the renewal trifecta was Amazon, which announced Monday a second season renewal for Tig Notaro's semi-autobiographical series \"One Mississippi,\" a dark comedy about the intricacies of family and making peace with the past. \nThe second season of \"One Mississippi\" will air exclusively on Amazon in 2017.

And while, unfortunately, there&apos;s no spell to put the country back together again ( Accio love and tolerance??), there is a new Amazon hack that will allow you to cast certain Harry Potter spells IRL. Here&apos;s the deal...\nIn a promo for the HP prequel, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (in theaters this Friday), Amazon has turned its search bar into a magic wand of sorts. If you type one of these five spells into the search field on Amazon.com (either on your phone or computer), magical results will fill up your screen. Unfortunately, none of the spells will make a coffee appear (because #Mondays), but they are still really cool to watch.\nAguamenti will flood your screen with water.\nPinterest Facebook PHOTO: Amazon Lumos will light up your device&apos;s screen.\nPinterest Facebook PHOTO: Amazon Incendio sets your screen on fire (not literally, like with the exploding Samsung phones).\nPinterest Facebook PHOTO: Amazon Reducto will shatter your screen (also not literally, TG).\nPinterest Facebook PHOTO: Amazon And Orchideous will turn your screen into the most gorgeous, flower-filled garden.\nPinterest Facebook PHOTO: Amazon Apologies in advance for killing your productivity for the rest of the day.",

      "text": "Featured News Tech \nWe’ve mentioned several times in the past that tech giant Amazon has been trying to cross over into the music streaming world with a platform of their own. Now, they’re ready to roll in the UK as Amazon Music Unlimited has just officially launched. \nSo far, the platform boasts a catalog of 40 million+ songs which puts it in line with Apple Music and slightly ahead of Spotify at a competitive price point of £9.99 a month. The major selling point with Amazon Music Unlimited is that with a whole line of other tech products available, they’re able to bundle them all together. \nAmazon Prime customers will have Amazon Music Unlimited reduced to £7.99 on a per-month payment basis while a full year’s service is further reduced to £79 (about £6.50 a month). In addition, there’s also Amazon Prime Music. This service is free with Amazon Prime but the catalog is limited to just 2 million tracks; the service is supposed to act as a funnel, transitioning first-time streaming customers trying out the free Amazon Prime Music into Amazon Music Unlimited if they so desire. \nFor owners of Amazon’s voice-activated Amazon Echo there’s a further discount to be found if you sign up for Amazon Music Unlimited dropping to just £3.99 a month. Best of all the voice-controlled speakers allow you to interact with Amazon Music Unlimited by requesting specific playlists based on both mood and time period –‘sad 90s music’, ‘happy 2000s R&B,’ for example – via voice control. Even more impressive perhaps, is that Amazon Music Unlimited has lyrics integrated into their database allowing users to request songs based on specific lyrics. \nAmazon will also take a leaf out of Spotify’s book with their own set of recommended personal playlists of their own for the less-adventurous. \nAmazon Music Unlimited is now available in the US, UK, Germany, and Austria.",

The move comes more than a year after a critical piece in the New York Times highlighted stack-ranking as a factor in what the story characterized as a “bruising” work culture. \nIt also comes in the midst of a frenzied market for tech talent driven in big part by speedy growth in the cloud.\nMicrosoft also employed a stack-racking system that was much criticized internally.

      "title": "Amazon files its first-ever lawsuits against alleged sellers of counterfeit goods",
      "text": "Amazon today filed two lawsuits against online sellers alleged to have illegally offered counterfeit goods through its vast e-commerce platform.\nThe suits, filed in King County Superior Court in Seattle, are believed to be the first time Amazon has sued third-party sellers over the alleged sale of counterfeit goods on its site.\nIn the past, Amazon itself has been sued by sellers who alleged that the company was partially responsible for enabling the sale of counterfeit goods infringing their intellectual property.\nAmazon’s suits target sales of knockoff fitness products and heavy lifting equipment sold illegally under the TRX and Forearm Forklift brands, which are both legitimate sellers on the Amazon platform.\nFitness Anywhere, the company behind the TRX fitness product line, joined Amazon in the suit over the alleged sale of counterfeit versions of its products. TRX was founded by former Navy SEAL commando Randy Hetrick, according to the complaint.\nDefendants in both complaints include several companies and individuals in California, Florida and New York.\nThe suits are the latest effort by Amazon to crack down on misuse of its e-commerce platform by rogue sellers. The company has separately filed a series of suits against people and companies alleged to have facilitated and participated in the posting of fake product reviews on the site.\nAmazon declined to comment on the suits over the counterfeit products, but the complaints provide a detailed description of the company’s position and tactics.\nAmazon has zero tolerance for counterfeits, and has invested heavily in protecting the integrity of the Amazon marketplace for consumers, sellers, and manufacturers. Amazon’s anti-counterfeiting policy clearly prohibits the sale of counterfeit products …\nAmazon invests tens of millions of dollars annually developing sophisticated technology to detect bad actors and potentially counterfeit products, and it employs dedicated teams of software engineers, research scientists, program managers, and investigators to operate and continually refine its anti-counterfeiting program. Among other things, when sellers register to sell products through Amazon’s Marketplace, Amazon’s automated systems scan information about the sellers for signals that the sellers might be bad actors, and Amazon blocks those sellers during registration before they can offer any products for sale. On an ongoing basis, Amazon’s systems also automatically and continuously scan thousands of variables related to sellers, products, and offers to detect activity that indicates products offered by a seller might be counterfeit. Amazon uses innovative machine learning to improve its automated systems in order to anticipate and stay ahead of bad actors. Numerous Amazon investigators around the world respond quickly to review any listing identified as a potential counterfeit product. These investigators also review notices of claimed infringement from rights owners, who know their products best. When Amazon finds counterfeit products from whatever source, it removes those products immediately. Amazon regularly suspends or blocks sellers suspected of engaging in illegal behavior or infringing others’ intellectual property rights.\nHere are the lawsuits as filed by the company.\nAmazon Counterfeit Lawsuits by Todd Bishop on Scribd\n",

Reynolds paid for the items himself, but used the village’s tax exempt status in the purchases. \nReynolds joined the Village in 2005 and was appointed chief in 2006. \nIt’s not clear who will be named as his replacement. \nCopyright 2016 WXIX.

      "text": "Nov 2013 pub date – 4HC – will surpass 50% by November 2013] \nAmazon is at the forefront of this publishing revolution. Through the Kindle eReader and the Kindle eBook store, it has given indie authors a platform to get published and gather an audience. As a $100-billion-plus market cap e-commerce juggernaut, Amazon already has a substantial user base ( as per comScore , 282.2 million people visited Amazon.com in June 2011 – or roughly 20% of the total internet traffic). Coupled with high royalty rates (70% compared to 10-15% for traditional publishers), it is the perfect platform for a fledgling writer to make a living, and if fate agrees, even a fortune. \nThe path to becoming a Kindle millionaire isn’t easy, but it’s possible to tilt the odds in your favor by following best practices. [TIM: Becoming a millionaire using non-Kindle ebooks is arguably even easier — here’s one $1,000,000/month example .] \nThis how-to post will look at general principles and lessons from real-world successes. Understanding Amazon and Niche Selection \nThe first step is market research. \nYour first order of the day should be to spend a few hours around the Amazon Kindle marketplace . Browse through the top sellers , be generous with your clicks and read up as much as you can – user reviews, book descriptions, Amazon’s editorial reviews (if any). You want to get an intuitive feel for the market, what sells, what doesn’t. How many non-fiction books end up in the top 10? What genre do they belong to? What is the average price of a Kindle bestseller? What do their covers look like? How many reviews do they have? What is the average rating? What is the correlation between rating and current ranking? \n[TIM: For what it’s worth, much like Hugh Howey , I write about what I love or would love to learn about. Here’s how I did preliminary market research for The 4-Hour Chef : \n– I polled my 400,000+ followers on Twitter and Facebook with questions like “What are your favorite 2 or 3 cookbooks?” and “If you were starting over, which 2 or 3 books would get you most excited while learning fundamentals?” \n– I then used virtual assistants via Taskrabbit.com to create a list of those titles that pop up more than 3 times. I also asked professional chefs the same questions and cross-referenced the lists. \n– Once I had the repeat contenders (let’s assume 20 titles), I headed to Amazon, where I did 2 things: \n1. First, I identified the titles on my list that have an average review of 4 stars or higher. \n2. Second, I read the “most helpful” critical reviews from those titles, aiming to focus on 3-star ratings, whenever possible. If not, I look for 4-star. The 1- and 2-star are usually written by people who hate everything (look at their other reviews if you doubt me), and the 5-star reviews tend not to go into detail. From the “most helpful” 3–4-star reviews, I compile a list of: \nA) Things “missing” or deficient in even the best books. These are opportunities for me to do or explore something new. For instance, even the best-selling BBQ books were criticized for omitting the “heart and soul of BBQ”: short ribs and brisket. This meant I naturally had to include at least one. \nB) I download all 20 books onto my Kindle and read the “Popular Highlights” in each, sorted by “Most Popular.” This often allows me to read 20–50 pages instead of 300, 500, or even 1,000 pages. Then I can deep dive only where I love what I see. If you don’t like the movie trailer, you’re certainly not going to like the book the highlights were pulled from. \nBut this begs the question: how do you go about selecting your niche in the first place? \nI’m tempted to say: pick a niche you actually enjoy reading. But this may not always be the best advice. I enjoy reading complicated literary novels and obscure texts in linguistics, but they’re hardly the stuff best sellers are made of. Your niche selection should be in-line with market demands. This is why spending time in the Amazon marketplace is important: it will tell you which niches are popular and which are not. \n[TIM: To really determine what will sell and what will not, I highly recommend reading this step-by-step method by Noah Kagan . He built two multi-million-dollar businesses before age 28 using similar methodologies.] \nOnce you have your niche, spend some time researching your ideal buyer. See where they hang out, how active they are online, what is their average age and income, and what motivates them to buy an eBook in the first place? Are they looking for solutions, or are they looking for adventures and story-telling to ease their boredom? \nOnce you have a faint picture of your ideal buyer, find out what they do and what they consume online. Entrepreneurs will likely hang out at TechCrunch , while productivity folks will have Lifehacker bookmarked. Quantcast is a good tool to understand market demographics better. Just type in the URL of the target site, and you’ll get a fair idea of their demographic make-up. [TIM: You can also get valuable data from Kickstarter projects you find that might attract similar customers — which sites are sending them the most traffic? ] \nBe prepared to spend a few hours over a weekend in market research. [TIM: I’ll spend weeks doing this, if necessary. I don’t truly know my audience until I could make decisions for them.] \nA few power tips for niche selection: \n– Weight loss and dieting are a perennial Amazon favorite. \n– Business books tend to find a lot of favor with readers as well, especially if you can package scattered information into an easy to digest package (example: Personal MBA by Josh Kauffman). \n– Reddit is one of the finest sources to research niches and gather ideas. Spend a few hours in /r/Fitness and its related sub-reddits ( /r/leangains , /r/paleo ) and you’ll come up with dozens of ideas for a book (example: The Butter and Bacon Diet: Losing Weight With Keto, inspired by /r/keto ). This is a nice list of sub-reddits arranged by popularity. \n– Don’t go niche-hopping. Stick to one niche and dominate it with a flood of quality content. There are dozens and dozens of ideas scattered all over the Internet. Research these ideas, agglomerate them into comprehensible forms, and synthesize them into consumable format, and you’ll have your eBook. [TIM: This isn’t my approach, but it can be done well, even with public domain materials.] Creating the eBook \nThis can be the hardest or the easiest part of becoming a Kindle publisher, depending on your comfort level with writing. Writing the eBook yourself can be incredibly fun if you enjoy the creative process, or a mind-numbing chore if you don’t. \n[TIM: Writing a book shouldn’t be used to determine if you like (or can at least handle) writing. Try and publish a chapter-length (3,000-5,000 words) blog post a week for a month. If you can’t do that, don’t commit to a book, IMHO. To improve your craft, I suggest On Writing by Stephen King, Bird by Bird , and On Writing Well .] \nAlternatively, you can outsource the entire project. But before you jump into the fray, there are a few key steps to consider: \n– Brainstorm the title of the book. Along with the cover, your title is the most visible aspect of your book. Dig through the bestseller list in your targeted niche to see how top books are titled, and consider following their lead. [TIM: I actually test both titles and subtitles using cheap Google Adwords campaigns.] \n– Brainstorm angles and approaches to the content. What makes your book unique among the competition? What new perspective are you bringing to the niche? How can you deliver most value to your readers? \n– Create a detailed outline of the entire eBook . Map everything out, from the introduction to the concluding paragraph. Look to the best selling books in your niche for inspiration and advice on structure and organization. You should have a thorough outline detailing the style, tone and content of each chapter. \n[TIM: I typically break my books into 3-5 “sections” which are then broken down into chapters. I use the program Scrivener to map this out. Each chapter has a beginning, middle, and end like a magazine article. Each of them should be independently self-sufficient. This makes the book easier for me to write if I hit a block… and it makes the book easier to read. I can write chapters out of order, and readers can consume them out of order.] \n– While it’s necessary to strive for quality and push conventions aside, it is also important to be practical in your approach. You might aspire to write avant-garde literary novels, but that’s hardly the stuff best-sellers are made of. The key is to write an astounding book in a niche that sells. This, of course, doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice on quality; Max Brooks’ “ World War-Z ” piggybacked on the zombie apocalypse trend, and yet found a way to comment on compelling present day social and political issues. Now it’s a major film starring Brad Pitt. \nIf you want to write the book yourself, as Tim would have it, there are a few things you can do to sharpen your skills: \n– Become a master of the Snowflake Method . Essentially, it means building a comprehensive ‘map’ of your book – character backstories, narrative arcs, plausible scenarios – before you write a single word. It flies in the face of all conventional notions of ‘creative inspiration,’ but it can be deadly effective at writing superior novels with strong narrative arcs, especially in genre fiction. The Snowflake Method has been devised by author Randy Ingmerson, who has used it himself in all six of his best-selling novels. \n– Storytelling is a craft, and like any other craft, it too can be mastered with practice. Barry Eisler, who has tackled both legacy and self-publishing (and succeeded wildly), suggests a reading of three books – Stein on Writing: A Master Editor of Some of the Most Successful Writers of our Century Shares His Craft Techniques and Strategies by Sol Stein , Learning to Write Fiction from the Masters , by Barnaby Conrad, and Robert McKee’s Story: Substance, Structure, Style and Principles of Screenwriting to improve the craft of storytelling. [TIM: I personally favor Save the Cat for fiction/screenwriting.] \n– Learn from fellow self-published authors. Eisler recommends the blog of novelist J.A. Konrath , who has been self-publishing since 2004 and recording his experiences on the blog. Eisler says, “I think anyone even considering self-publishing ought to be reading Joe, and if you’re not interested in self-publishing, you should read him just to be sure you understand the pros and cons of the various publishing options available today.” Eisler also has a list of indie author blogs on his website that can help you understand the self-publishing process. \n– Learn from the masters: the likes of Stephen King, Nicholas Sparks, and Robert Ludlum have spent a lifetime perfecting their craft. Comb through their novels diligently. See how they create tension, withhold information to create suspense, and write dialogues. The more you read, the better you will become at grasping the essence of a good novel. \n– Create a writing schedule and stick to it . Set aside at least an hour or two for writing each day. This is the hardest part about writing a successful novel, simply because it requires discipline and commitment. Most writers don’t succeed because they give-up midway. Don’t be that writer. [TIM: Most of my friends who are consistently good writers write between 10pm-8am. This means they either go to be really late — I do my best work between 11pm-5am — or they wake up really early. It’s easier to concentrate when the rest of the world is asleep.] \nOtherwise, it’s time to find freelancers to finish your project: \n– Insist on a Skype interview before you hire anyone. Pay careful attention to their command of language. Also pay attention to how well they ask you questions. \n– Ask them difficult questions: What is their prior experience with writing eBooks? What’s their best and worst published work and why? What mistakes have they made, professionally and creatively? \n– Speak with references and include: “He/she seems great. I like them. Of course, all people have strengths and weaknesses. If you had to choose theirs, what would they be?” \n– If they pass the above, give them your detailed brief and outline in full. The more information your writer has, the better the finished product will be. \n– Consider payment on a chapter-by-chapter basis until a strong working relationship is established. \n– Last but not least, have them sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement . Formatting the eBook for Kindle \nYou’ll most likely write your eBook as a Word document. Converting a. docx/.doc file to the Kindle format is relatively straight forward with Amazon’s conversion tools. Amazon itself has a comprehensive guide on formatting a book for Kindle. \nThe key things to keep in mind when formatting are: \n1. File size: files larger than 50mb cannot be converted to the Kindle format. Remember that Amazon’s delivery costs are approximately $0.15/mb. The larger the file size, the higher these costs. Compress the document as much as possible before uploading it to Amazon for the conversion process. \n2. Amazon has a comprehensive guide to building a book for Kindle that covers every aspect of formatting – creating front matter, table of contents, etc. This is a free eBook that can be downloaded here . \n3. The catalog/cover image is crucial for sales. Here’s Amazon’s online guide on how to create the cover. Designing the Cover \nNever judge a book by its cover, they say. On Amazon, however, your cover will go a long way towards setting you apart from the self-published pap that usually litters the Kindle store. If you’ve done your market research right, you already know what I’m talking about: badly formatted books with covers that look like Photoshop disasters and a child’s scribbling in MS paint dominate the low-end of the market. \nA quality cover is proof that you’ve put thought and effort into the book – a good signal for a prospective buyer. [TIM: Also think in terms of thumbnail size — will it grab attention as a tiny image on a handheld device? You won’t have a nice big hardcover to show it off. Think like an app designer choosing an icon for the iPhone.] \nDepending on your budget and Photoshop skills, you can either design the cover yourself ($0), or outsource it ($5 to $395). \nOPTION A: DESIGNING THE COVER YOURSELF \nUnless you are a Photoshop whiz, I don’t recommend this option. If you must cut corners and design the cover yourself, I recommend keeping things simple: grab a high quality image from Shutterstock that echoes the generic conventions of your niche and write your book title in an appropriate font. For inspiration, head to the Book Cover Archive . \nPro tip: Fonts, like images in a cover, echo the established values of a genre. Fonts in romance novels are usually florid, while those in thrillers and weight loss books are more contemporary. Make sure that you use fonts that adhere to genre conventions. \nOPTION B: OUTSOURCING THE COVER DESIGN \nPick your poison: \nCheap: Set up a competition on 99designs to crowdsource your eBook cover. Prices can range from $50 to $500. OR, hire an established, experienced book cover designer. You can easily find a ton of these on sites like AuthorSupport or Damonza . \nCheaper: For $20-50, hire a designer from oDesk to design a cover for you. \nCheapest: For $5, get a cheap cover from Fiverr . Marketing and Promoting Your Book \nSo you’ve written your book, you’ve formatted it for Kindle, and you have a gorgeous cover image to entice readers. \nNow it’s game time. \nMarketing is what separates the successful Kindle publishers from the also-rans who hug the bottom of the sales charts. \nSelf-publishing essentially inverts the traditional publishing model, where publishers publish the book, then get the media to drum up enthusiasm before the public can pass it along through word-of-mouth. Self-published authors must do this entire process in reverse: they must get people interested in their books before they actually publish the book on Amazon. It requires building relationships with your readers and establishing a sense of community by leveraging social media. \n[TIM: I’ll keep this note short. Here’s how to create a high-traffic blog (1MM+ unique visitors a month) without killing yourself . It’s exactly how I built this blog and manage it.] \nESTABLISH A CONSISTENT AUTHOR PROFILE \nIn the mid-80s, at the height of his literary prowess, Stephen King started writing books under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman. Bachman’s books were failures – Running Man sold only 28,000 copies in its initial print run, but ten times as many when Bachman was outed as a pseudonym for King. The message is obvious enough: readers won’t think twice about buying books from authors they know and recognize. \nFor amateur authors, this translates into maintaining a consistent author profile across multiple media properties. You are essentially trying to create a personal brand ( like Tim’s ). Select a good picture and make sure you use it on all author-related websites, including your blog, social media, and Amazon Author Central (more on this below). \nSTART A BLOG \nIt is 2012; you have no excuses for not running a blog. It is free and downright easy with software like WordPress . The 4-Hour Workweek blog (built using WordPress) was started as a platform to promote a book and foster a community. Today, the blog and its readership are arguably more valuable than the book itself. [TIM: Definitely true.] \nShare advice and tips related to your niche. Your blog should serve as a teaser trailer for what’s in store in your book. Be as educative, informative, and creative as you can be. This 4-Hour Workweek blog is a good model to imitate. \n[TIM: You don’t have to start out sexy! Check out this hideous mess , the earliest version of this blog . It’s atrocious.] \nHARNESS THE POWER OF SOCIAL MEDIA \nStart with the obvious:",

      "text": "Noam Galai | WireImage | Getty Images Donald Trump's White House win has been very good for the retail stocks that have been getting crushed over the years by online retailer Amazon.com .\nAmazon itself has fallen, along with the high beta tech names, but Bespoke says brick-and-mortar retailers it tracks in its \"Death by Amazon\" index have rallied sharply. \n\"Until the period just before the Presidential Election, the Death By Amazon index was under-performing, down 4.6 percent YTD versus an S&P 1500 up 5 percent and Amazon up over 16 percent. Since election day, it's been the complete opposite. Amazon has shed over 6 percent, while the Death By Amazon index has rallied almost 9 percent,\" Bespoke wrote in a note earlier Monday.\nPaul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke, said he views Amazon's decline as the result of a rotation by investors who are dumping names like Alphabet and Facebook , and are snapping up industrials and financials — and also retailers.\nThe retail stocks, he said, are being helped by Trump policy. Trump has promised tax cuts and a massive infrastructure program, which has been lifting a whole group of stocks.\n\"I think lower taxes helps out the prospects of the retailers. I don't think it's a function that nobody's going to ship via the internet anymore. The [performance] gap has been enormous,\" said Hickey.\nBespoke's \"Death by Amazon\" list is made up of 54 retailers of all different sizes. Among them are Wal-Mart, Costco , CVS , Dollar Tree , Fred's , GameStop , Nordstrom , Kroger's , Kohl's, Office Depot, Francesca's , Haverty Furniture , Foot Locker, Williams-Sonoma , Supervalu and Target. \nHickey said he believes the rotation by investors funding their new infrastructure and other holdings is the most likely explanation for Amazon's drop, which is about 8 percent from Election Day through Monday's close.\nHe said he does not believe it has to do with the disagreement between Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Trump, which played out over Twitter. Bezos last week did congratulate Trump on his win. \n\"There is talk about the 'grudge,'\" Hickey said. \"Maybe for some people, that's why they're selling, but what I would think is its more towards money reallocation — funds out of tech, which has done so well.\"",
