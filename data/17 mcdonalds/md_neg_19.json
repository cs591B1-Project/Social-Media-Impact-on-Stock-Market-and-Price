      "text": "A McDonald's worker was fired and charged with two counts of battery after allegedly pouring mustard into a police officer's drink in Topeka, Kansas (video below).\nThe outrage began when a pro-police Facebook page, Kansas GOING BLUE, posted a picture of the drink and this caption on Nov. 27:\nA McDonald's here in Kansas just served a Law Enforcement Officer on duty a Dr Pepper with Mustard in a drive thru order. This is extremely unacceptable!! According to the manager this happened before with a Kansas Highway Patrol trooper. Maybe we should all remind them of the Taco Bell incident that happened in Newton. #McDonalds #KansasGoingBlue\nKSNT reported on Nov. 28 that the employee had been fired following a \"lengthy investigation\" into the mustard incident, which involved a Dr. Pepper drink.\nMcDonald's customer Michelle Hodges told KSNT that she would still eat at the calorie-rich restaurant because it's close to her work and cheap.\nTom and Marilyn Dobski, who own McDonald’s restaurants in Topeka, said in a statement:\nAll customers, including local law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities, are always welcome at our restaurants. Immediately upon learning of this complaint, we began our own internal investigation to gather the facts. We are shocked by the isolated actions of a single employee. This employee no longer works for our organization. We proudly support police officers and all divisions of first responders at our restaurants across northeast Kansas. On Dec. 2, police arrested Jonathan Gill for allegedly putting the mustard in the drink, and charged him with two counts of battery against a police officer, reported KSN-TV.\nMost of the Facebook commenters on the Kansas GOING BLUE page were outraged by the stunt:\n\"I have never liked the service at this McDonalds! They always are rude!\"\n\"Make it prison time for felony food tampering and 'hate crime' against the cop.\"\n\"If I was that officer, on duty I would go inside and arrest him in front of everyone. With the evidence as proof, we all have the right to have our food not tampered with. Some kids must think it's funny until someone gets suck.\"\n\n",

Truth rating: 10 By Shari Weiss | 9:02 pm, December 5th, 2016 VIDEO (NBC) \nWe McDonald covered “Scars To Your Beautiful” during “The Voice” on Monday. Check out the video below! \nAs Gossip Cop has reported, 17-year-old McDonald has been bouncing around decades and genres throughout the NBC competition. Her song selections have ranged from Broadway favorites to recent Rihanna to a 1942 Billie Holiday classic. That last one was “God Bless The Child,” which propelled the teen to number 9 on the iTunes singles chart last week. \nNow for her Top 8 performance, McDonald opted to go modern again with Alessia Cara’s inspirational track. In rehearsal with coach Alicia Keys, the aspiring star said the song “represents the kind of artist I want to be.” Keys noted, “We herself has expressed how she’s felt bullied for being different, so this is her message.” \nAnd McDonald delivered that message “We-style,” as Keys put it, and it was once again an impressive performance from the contestant. Miley Cyrus joined Keys in a standing ovation, and then noted, “The way you were on the stage showed me what a We tour would like it.” \nKeys pointed out that this is all “We’s vision,” and noted how “proud” she is of her artist. “When you finish performing, We, we can’t stop screaming. That’s how much we believe you,” she went on to say, telling viewers they were “witnessing the growth of a star.” Watch below! \nEnter your email address here to receive daily news updates from us.",

      "title": "McDonald's Revamps $4 Billion McCafe Brand as It Lags Starbucks",
      "text": "McDonald's Revamps $4 Billion McCafe Brand as It Lags Starbucks \n(Dreamstime) Monday, 05 Dec 2016 01:23 PM Close A A \nMcDonald’s Corp., losing ground in its battle for the nation’s coffee drinkers, is planning to shake up its McCafe brand -- part of a bid to challenge Starbucks Corp. and Dunkin’ Donuts. \nThe company will reintroduce the McCafe concept next year, about eight years after it debuted nationwide. The push follows efforts to upgrade its java and get more of its beans from sustainable sources, mimicking a move by its Seattle-based rival. \n“We’re really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,” Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights, said in an interview. The new McCafe campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing of the chain’s coffee rewards program, she said. \nCoffee is still a booming business in the U.S., but fast-food companies haven’t been able to capitalize on much of that growth. Sales at burger chains rose just 3.3 percent last year, compared with an almost 10 percent jump for coffee cafes, according to research firm Technomic. Though McCafe generates $4 billion annually in U.S. sales, it could better cater to customer needs, Cunningham said. \nStarbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts have attracted customers with high-margin espresso, lattes and mochas. Though McDonald’s offers a wide range of coffees these days, it hasn’t become as much of a go-to source for upscale drinks. \nMcCafe is “a very important piece,” Cunningham said. “It gives us the chance to follow what the customer is really looking for.” \nFood Fight \nRe-emphasizing coffee is critical at a time when food sales are under pressure. Supermarkets have lowered prices, making it more alluring to eat at home instead of at a restaurant. Gas stations and other channels also are increasingly selling prepared meals, adding to the competition. \nMcDonald’s is looking to build on the success of its all-day breakfast, which rolled out last year across the U.S. It’s also upgrading stores with table service and more touch-screen ordering kiosks. The all-day breakfast push helped fuel a return to growth, but the resurgence has been waning: Domestic comparable sales rose just 1.3 percent last quarter, and McDonald’s is facing declining foot traffic. \nMcDonald’s isn’t alone in struggling to build a more sophisticated coffee menu. After Burger King introduced 10 new Seattle’s Best drinks in 2013, including flavored lattes, the rollout fizzled. The company later merged with Tim Hortons, a Canadian coffee chain, though the two brands remain distinct. \nTwo-Dollar Deal \nMcDonald’s still plans to emphasize its price advantage over Starbucks as it retools the McCafe brand. The company is planning a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal for the first quarter of next year, Cunningham said. \nThe chain, with about 14,000 domestic restaurants, said in October that it would buy all of its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020. In another sign of Starbucks envy, McDonald’s sold pumpkin-spice lattes across all of the U.S. this fall -- the first time it’s done so in three years. \nThe company opened its first stand-alone McCafe location in Toronto last year, a move that it said “showcases the company’s passion for elevating the cafe experience.” McDonald’s now sells Americanos and shots of espresso across its Canadian restaurants. The McCafe locations even bake McCafe pastries in house. \nIn the U.S., McDonald’s is upgrading its espresso machines with equipment that creates more consistent-tasting drinks, Cunningham said. The new gear, which has better milk-steaming technology and can make a wider variety of drinks, costs about $12,000 apiece. \nBut the typical McDonald’s diner is a low- to middle-income consumer and not adventurous when it comes to coffee, said Will Slabaugh, analyst at Stephens Inc. Customers are looking for something that’s affordable and familiar, he said. \n“It’s going to continue to be a slow build for them, especially in this type of environment where the customer expects a deal,” Slabaugh said. “I don’t expect that to be a huge needle mover for them.” \n© Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

      "text": "McDonald’s Takes on Starbucks With Elaborate Espresso Machines Eater 23 mins ago Chris Fuhrmeister © Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\nAside from their shared status as global behemoths, McDonald’s and Starbucks have few similarities in terms of perception. The former is viewed by many as the picture of low-cost, low-quality fast food, while the latter projects itself as a hip destination for today’s remote workers to plop down in front of their MacBooks for hours at a time. McDonald’s is trying to change those perceptions.\nAlready raising its bar in other areas of service , Mickey D’s is looking to become a more serious player in the modern coffee game, reports Bloomberg . The chain is overhauling its McCafe brand with beans sourced from sustainable purveyors and fancy espresso machines that check in at $12,000 a pop. A company spokesperson tells Bloomberg the reboot will allow McCafe to “better cater to customer needs.”\nWhether the changes will draw in a new clientele seeking a premium experience remains to be seen, but McDonald’s isn’t turning its back on customers who look to the chain for value. McDonald’s will offer $1 drip coffee in the first quarter of 2017, according to Bloomberg , and it’s planning a $2 “specialty coffee” deal as well.\nStill, it can’t be denied that McDonald’s is evolving. The chain has made its McCafe announcement less than a month after it revealed plans to roll out table service at its restaurants across America. It is also deploying more touchscreen kiosks that offer a line of “Signature Crafted Recipes.” Diners get to choose their protein (grilled or fried chicken or a burger patty) and a flavor profile for toppings (apple-bacon-dijon, sweet barbecue-bacon, or pico-guacamole). It’s an increasingly popular ordering style at burgeoning fast-casual chains.\nThanks in large part to the debut of all-day breakfast last fall, McDonald’s has emerged from a years-long sales slump . The chain is clearly trying to take advantage of its newfound momentum and carve out a secure position in the fast food market going forward. If the latest moves are any indication, company executives believe that may mean a transition from the traditional fast food model to a nouveau fast-casual approach.\nThe timing of the Golden Arches’ McCafe news comes on the heels of Starbucks’ own big announcement: Longtime chief executive officer Howard Schultz is stepping down in April . Schultz will remain with the company in a different role, but McDonald’s is giving incoming CEO Kevin Johnson a new challenge to consider.\nRELATED: The McDonald’s secret menu items you need to order\nClick to expand Replay Video Hygge, the Nordic trend that could help you survive 2016 Hygge — pronounced as “hyue-gar,” “hoog-jar” but most commonly “hoo-gah” — broadly means an approach to living that embraces positivity and enjoyment of everyday experiences, said to be core concepts of attitudes to life in the Nordic region.

      "text": "End Procurement Of Eggs From Caged Hens: Mahajan To McDonald's End Procurement of Eggs from Caged Hens: Mahajan to McDonald's Press Trust Of India | Updated: December 06, 2016 13:57 IST Tweeter BJP MP Poonam Mahajan has urged McDonald's India to end the procurement of eggs from battery cage facilities and start sourcing only cage-free eggs in its supply chain.Mahajan, who is also a trustee of People for Animals, has written a letter to the company in the wake of recent commitments made by McDonald's to switch to 100 per cent cage-free eggs within its supply chains in United States, Canada and South Africa.\"The factory farming of egg-laying hens is replete with cruelty. The birds are crammed wing to wing and nearly immobilized their entire lives. McDonald's has recently committed to improve animal welfare standards within its supply chain in the United States, Canada and South Africa by phasing out the procurement of eggs from caged hens.\"A similar policy adopted in India would change the lives of approximately 120 million egg-laying hens presently suffering in battery cages,\" a statement quoting Mahajan said.It said that India is the third largest egg-producing country in the world with approximately 120 million egg -laying hens that are bred in \"cruel, commercial battery cages\" which are typically less than an A4 size sheet of paper and are named so for the way they are stacked on top of the other in the form of batteries.Keeping hens in battery cages are more likely to harbor Salmonella, which is found in retail eggs and is a major cause of food poisoning in India, it said. The statement said that in 2013, 24 out of 29 states in India had agreed that battery cage system is illegal.The leading egg-producing states are Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu , Maharashtra, Haryana, Punjab and West Bengal.

      "text": "Follow Us ® 2016 Bustle Wé McDonald's 'The Voice' Semi-Finals Song Choice Is Important & Shows Exactly What Type Of Album We Can Expect From Her By Jessica Molinari 6 hours ago \nA beautiful message from a beautiful artist. W é McDonald performed Alessia Cara's \"Scars To Your Beautiful\" in The Voice Semi-Finals and her song choice was so important. As someone who has struggled with bullying, McDonald really felt close to this specific song. It had gotten her through some tough times and, by singing it on one of the biggest stages in the country, she sent a message to bullies everywhere. At this point in the game, McDonald could have sung any song out there. But by choosing this specific anthem, the 17-year-old really showed what kind of music we would get from her own album. \nMcDonald has been a force ever since her Blind Audition. The difference between her speaking voice and singing voice has shocked fans everywhere. Because of it, she is one of the most talked about artists of the season. But not only is her voice shocking, it's unbelievable. At only 17, McDonald's talent is leagues ahead of professionals twice her age. Her sound bears resemblance to some of the greatest female voices of all time. But her incredible sound is not the only special part about her. McDonald is using her platform to shed light on important issues, much like her coach Alicia Keys. There's no doubt any song she produces would carry with them important messages. She is a legend in the making, which is why her spot in The Voice finale is practically guaranteed. \nMcDonald has a very, very good shot at winning The Voice Season 11. Both her over-the-top vocals and charming personality have won over the hearts of fans everywhere. But even if she doesn't take the title, McDonald has a very fruitful music career ahead of her. With Alicia Keys as a mentor, doors are bound to open for the young artist. The Voice is just the beginning of the 17-year-old's long journey and I, for one, can't wait to be along for the ride. \nImage: Trae Patton/NBC ",

To draw customers away from its competitors, McDonald’s will highlight its price advantages over Starbucks with offers including $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty beverages over the first quarter of next year.\nMcDonald’s has already begun competing with Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts—this fall, the company sold pumpkin-spice lattes throughout the U.S. for the first time in three years. In Canada, McDonald’s sells Americanos and shots of espresso, and even has a standalone McCafe in Toronto.",

      "text": "AGAIN – Worms Found In McDonald’s Hamburgers!! – THIS IS REAL! December 6, 2016 by Todd \nAt least two people have reported finding worms in food from McDonald’s restaurants in two Kentucky communities. \nMayfield resident Madison Stephens tells WPSD-TV that she visited McDonald’s on Sunday and purchased food for her and her 1-year-old son. She says as she was about to bite into her hamburger, a live worm fell out. \nAt the McDonald’s in Draffenville, about 25 miles away from Mayfield, Lacey Jo Lovett says she also found a worm in her burger on Tuesday. \nStephens says she contacted McDonald’s about the incident, and they sent her a $10 gift card. \nMcDonald’s spokesman Michael Love says in a statement that the company is investigating and will “take all appropriate measures to resolve the matter.” \n(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Business News | Tue Dec 6, 2016 | 4:25am EST Exclusive: McDonald's to keep minority stake in China, Hong Kong stores - source People walk past the entrance to a McDonald's restaurant in Shanghai, China, July 30, 2015. BRANDS/MCDONALDS REUTERS/Aly Song \nHONG KONG McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) is looking to raise $1 billion to $2 billion with the sale of its China and Hong Kong stores after the U.S. fast-food chain decided to keep \"a significant minority stake in the business,\" a person with direct knowledge of the plans said on Tuesday. \nThe company has picked a consortium led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP ( CG.O ) and Chinese conglomerate Citic Group Corp [CITIC.UL] to buy the stores and its decision to retain the minority stake lowered the price tag for the business from up to $3 billion expected previously, said the person, who declined to be identified because details of the deal are not public. \nMcDonald's wants exposure to future growth in the world's second-largest economy which is why it decided to maintain the stake, the person said. The company will also keep for now its stores in South Korea, which it previously also wanted to sell, the person added. \nA McDonald's spokeswoman in Shanghai declined to comment. Carlyle declined to comment and CITIC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. \nMcDonald's in March said it was reorganizing operations in the region, looking for strategic partners in China, Hong Kong and South Korea as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model. \n(Reporting by Elzio Barreto; Additional reporting by Julie Zhu; Editing by Christopher Cushing) Next In Business News Apple Watch sales to consumers set record in holiday week, says Apple's Cook \nSAN FRANCISCO Sales of the Apple Watch to consumers set a record during the first week of holiday shopping, and the current quarter is on track to be the best ever for the product, Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters.",

Did you know it was an animal before they deep fried it?’ \nAnd one commenter was particularly graphic: ‘Uhm. Have you ever seen chicken nuggets get made? You are literally eating every single part of a chick. \n‘They throw them in a huge grinder. Alive. Feathers. Eyes. Feet. Organs. Beak. That feather should be the least of your worries.’ \nMetro.co.uk has contacted McDonald’s and Celeste Sperry for comment. More ",

      "text": "McDonald's coffee strategy targets Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts Monday Dec 5, 2016 at 11:59 AM Dec 5, 2016 at 11:59 AM By Leslie Patton, Washington Post News Service \nMcDonald's Corp., losing ground in its battle for the nation's coffee drinkers, is planning to shake up its McCafe brand -- part of a bid to challenge Starbucks Corp. and Dunkin' Donuts. \nThe company will reintroduce the McCafe concept next year, about eight years after it debuted nationwide. The push follows efforts to upgrade its java and get more of its beans from sustainable sources, mimicking a move by its Seattle-based rival. \n\"We're really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,\" Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights, said in an interview. The new McCafe campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing of the chain's coffee rewards program, she said. \nCoffee is still a booming business in the U.S., but fast-food companies haven't been able to capitalize on much of that growth. Sales at burger chains rose just 3.3 percent last year, compared with an almost 10 percent jump for coffee cafes, according to research firm Technomic. Though McCafe generates $4 billion annually in U.S. sales, it could better cater to customer needs, Cunningham said. \nStarbucks and Dunkin' Donuts have attracted customers with high-margin espresso, lattes and mochas. Though McDonald's offers a wide range of coffees these days, it hasn't become as much of a go-to source for upscale drinks. \nMcCafe is \"a very important piece,\" Cunningham said. \"It gives us the chance to follow what the customer is really looking for.\" \nRe-emphasizing coffee is critical at a time when food sales are under pressure. Supermarkets have lowered prices, making it more alluring to eat at home instead of at a restaurant. Gas stations and other channels also are increasingly selling prepared meals, adding to the competition. \nMcDonald's is looking to build on the success of its all-day breakfast, which rolled out last year across the U.S. It's also upgrading stores with table service and more touch-screen ordering kiosks. The all-day breakfast push helped fuel a return to growth, but the resurgence has been waning: Domestic comparable sales rose just 1.3 percent last quarter, and McDonald's is facing declining foot traffic. \nMcDonald's isn't alone in struggling to build a more sophisticated coffee menu. After Burger King introduced 10 new Seattle's Best drinks in 2013, including flavored lattes, the rollout fizzled. McDonald's is planning a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal for the first quarter of next year, Cunningham said. About Us",

      "title": "McDonald’s revamps $4 billion McCafe brand",
      "text": "Read Article \nMcDonald’s Corp., losing ground in its battle for the nation’s coffee drinkers, is planning to shake up its McCafe brand – part of a bid to challenge Starbucks Corp. and Dunkin’ Donuts. \nThe company will reintroduce the McCafe concept next year, about eight years after it debuted nationwide. The push follows efforts to upgrade its java and get more of its beans from sustainable sources, mimicking a move by its Seattle-based rival. \n“We’re really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,” Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights, said in an interview. The new McCafe campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing of the chain’s coffee rewards program, she said. \nCoffee is still a booming business in the U.S., but fast-food companies haven’t been able to capitalize on that growth. Sales at burger chains rose just 3.3 percent last year, compared with an almost 10 percent jump for coffee cafes, according to research firm Technomic. Though McCafe generates $4 billion annually in U.S. sales, it could better cater to customer needs, Cunningham said. \nStarbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts have attracted customers with high-margin espresso, lattes and mochas. Though McDonald’s offers a wide range of coffees these days, it hasn’t become as much of a go-to source for upscale drinks. \nMcCafe is “a very important piece,” Cunningham said. “It gives us the chance to follow what the customer is really looking for.” \nRe-emphasizing coffee is critical at a time when food sales are under pressure. Supermarkets have lowered prices, making it more alluring to eat at home instead of at a restaurant. Gas stations and other channels also are increasingly selling prepared meals, adding to the competition. \nMcDonald’s is looking to build on the success of its all-day breakfast, which rolled out last year across the U.S. It’s also upgrading stores with table service and more touch-screen ordering kiosks. The all-day breakfast push helped fuel a return to growth, but the resurgence has been waning: Domestic comparable sales rose just 1.3 percent last quarter, and McDonald’s is facing declining foot traffic. \nMcDonald’s isn’t alone in struggling to build a more sophisticated coffee menu. After Burger King introduced 10 new Seattle’s Best drinks in 2013, the rollout fizzled. The company later merged with Tim Hortons, though the two brands remain distinct. \nMcDonald’s still plans to emphasize its price advantage over Starbucks as it retools the McCafe brand. The company is planning a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal for the first quarter of next year, Cunningham said. \nThe chain, with about 14,000 domestic restaurants, said in October that it would buy all of its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020. In another sign of Starbucks envy, McDonald’s sold pumpkin-spice lattes across all of the U.S. this fall — the first time it’s done so in three years. \nThe company opened its first stand-alone McCafe location in Toronto last year, a move that it said “showcases the company’s passion for elevating the cafe experience.” McDonald’s now sells Americanos and shots of espresso across its Canadian restaurants. The McCafe locations even bake McCafe pastries in house. \nIn the U.S., McDonald’s is upgrading its espresso machines with equipment that creates more consistent-tasting drinks, Cunningham said. The new gear, which has better milk-steaming technology and can make a wider variety of drinks, costs about $12,000 apiece. \nBut the typical McDonald’s diner is a low- to middle-income consumer and not adventurous when it comes to coffee, said Will Slabaugh, analyst at Stephens Inc. Customers are looking for something that’s affordable and familiar, he said. \n“It’s going to continue to be a slow build for them, especially in this type of environment where the customer expects a deal,” Slabaugh said. “I don’t expect that to be a huge needle mover for them.” Share",

People walk past the entrance to a McDonald's restaurant in Shanghai \nBy Elzio Barreto \nHONG KONG (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N: MCD ) is looking to raise $1 billion to $2 billion with the sale of its China and Hong Kong stores after the U.S. fast-food chain decided to keep \"a significant minority stake in the business,\" a person with direct knowledge of the plans said on Tuesday. \nThe company has picked a consortium led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP (O: CG ) and Chinese conglomerate CITIC Group Corp [CITIC.UL] to buy the stores and its decision to retain a stake of up to 25 percent lowered the price tag for the business from up to $3 billion expected previously, said the person, who declined to be identified because details of the deal are not public. \nMcDonald's wants exposure to future growth in the world's second-largest economy which is why it decided to maintain the stake, the person said. The company will also keep for now its stores in South Korea, which it previously also wanted to sell, the person added. \nA McDonald's spokeswoman in Shanghai declined to comment. Carlyle declined to comment and CITIC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. \nMcDonald's in March said it was reorganizing operations in the region, looking for strategic partners in China, Hong Kong and South Korea as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model. \nMcDonald's owns most of its more than 2,800 restaurants in the three markets. It is offering a 20-year franchise to buyers with a 10-year extension option. \nThe Chinese and Hong Kong stores attracted bids from a variety of parties, including TPG Capital Management LP ( TPG.UL ) - which teamed up with mini-market operator Wumart Stores Inc - and real estate firm Sanpower Group Co Ltd [SPGCL.UL], which owns British department store House of Fraser Ltd [HFPLC.UL], Reuters previously reported. \nThe sale comes at time when fast-food operators including McDonald's and Yum Brands Inc (N: YUM ) are recovering from a series of food-supply scandals in China that have undermined their performance. \nYum, best known for the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, agreed to sell a $460 million stake in its China unit to investment firm Primavera Capital and an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (N: BABA ) ahead of a planned spin-off of the business.

      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters  34   \nHONG KONG (Dec 6): McDonald's Corp is looking to raise US$1 billion to US$2 billion with the sale of its China and Hong Kong stores after the US fast-food chain decided to keep \"a significant minority stake in the business,\" a person with direct knowledge of the plans said on Tuesday. \nThe company has picked a consortium led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP and Chinese conglomerate CITIC Group Corp to buy the stores and its decision to retain a stake of up to 25% lowered the price tag for the business from up to US$3 billion expected previously, said the person, who declined to be identified because details of the deal are not public. \nMcDonald's wants exposure to future growth in the world's second-largest economy which is why it decided to maintain the stake, the person said. The company will also keep for now its stores in South Korea, which it previously also wanted to sell, the person added. \nA McDonald's spokeswoman in Shanghai declined to comment. Carlyle declined to comment and CITIC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. \nMcDonald's in March said it was reorganizing operations in the region, looking for strategic partners in China, Hong Kong and South Korea as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model. \nMcDonald's owns most of its more than 2,800 restaurants in the three markets. It is offering a 20-year franchise to buyers with a 10-year extension option. \nThe Chinese and Hong Kong stores attracted bids from a variety of parties, including TPG Capital Management LP — which teamed up with mini-market operator Wumart Stores Inc — and real estate firm Sanpower Group Co Ltd, which owns British department store House of Fraser Ltd, Reuters previously reported. \nThe sale comes at time when fast-food operators including McDonald's and Yum Brands Inc are recovering from a series of food-supply scandals in China that have undermined their performance. \nYum, best known for the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, agreed to sell a US$460 million stake in its China unit to investment firm Primavera Capital and an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ahead of a planned spin-off of the business.",

      "text": "McDonald’s Revamps Its $4 Billion McCafe Brand by December 5, 2016 — 9:47 AM EST December 5, 2016 — 9:47 AM EST Burger chain will reintroduce concept with deals, marketing Fast-food companies have struggled to build coffee reputation \nMcDonald’s Corp., losing ground in its battle for the nation’s coffee drinkers, is planning to shake up its McCafe brand -- part of a bid to challenge Starbucks Corp. and Dunkin’ Donuts. \nThe company will reintroduce the McCafe concept next year, about eight years after it debuted nationwide. The push follows efforts to upgrade its java and get more of its beans from sustainable sources, mimicking a move by its Seattle-based rival. \nMcCafe coffee drinks Source: McDonald’s \n“We’re really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,” Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights, said in an interview. The new McCafe campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing of the chain’s coffee rewards program, she said. \nCoffee is still a booming business in the U.S., but fast-food companies haven’t been able to capitalize on much of that growth. Sales at burger chains rose just 3.3 percent last year, compared with an almost 10 percent jump for coffee cafes, according to research firm Technomic. Though McCafe generates $4 billion annually in U.S. sales, it could better cater to customer needs, Cunningham said. \nStarbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts have attracted customers with high-margin espresso, lattes and mochas. Though McDonald’s offers a wide range of coffees these days, it hasn’t become as much of a go-to source for upscale drinks. \nMcCafe is “a very important piece,” Cunningham said. “It gives us the chance to follow what the customer is really looking for.” Food Fight \nRe-emphasizing coffee is critical at a time when food sales are under pressure. Supermarkets have lowered prices, making it more alluring to eat at home instead of at a restaurant. Gas stations and other channels also are increasingly selling prepared meals, adding to the competition. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.

The all-day breakfast push helped fuel a return to growth, but the resurgence has been waning: Domestic comparable sales rose just 1.3 percent last quarter, and McDonald’s is facing declining foot traffic.\nMcDonald’s isn’t alone in struggling to build a more sophisticated coffee menu. After Burger King introduced 10 new Seattle’s Best drinks in 2013, including flavored lattes, the rollout fizzled. The company later merged with Tim Hortons, a Canadian coffee chain, though the two brands remain distinct. Two-Dollar Deal \nMcDonald’s still plans to emphasize its price advantage over Starbucks as it retools the McCafe brand. The company is planning a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal for the first quarter of next year, Cunningham said. \nThe chain, with about 14,000 domestic restaurants, said in October that it would buy all of its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020. In another sign of Starbucks envy, McDonald’s sold pumpkin-spice lattes across all of the U.S. this fall -- the first time it’s done so in three years. \nThe company opened its first stand-alone McCafe location in Toronto last year, a move that it said “showcases the company’s passion for elevating the cafe experience.” McDonald’s now sells Americanos and shots of espresso across its Canadian restaurants. The McCafe locations even bake McCafe pastries in house. \nIn the U.S., McDonald’s is upgrading its espresso machines with equipment that creates more consistent-tasting drinks, Cunningham said. The new gear, which has better milk-steaming technology and can make a wider variety of drinks, costs about $12,000 apiece. \nBut the typical McDonald’s diner is a low- to middle-income consumer and not adventurous when it comes to coffee, said Will Slabaugh, analyst at Stephens Inc. Customers are looking for something that’s affordable and familiar, he said. \n“It’s going to continue to be a slow build for them, especially in this type of environment where the customer expects a deal,” Slabaugh said. “I don’t expect that to be a huge needle mover for them.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

      "text": "McDonald's revamps $4 billion McCafe brand Tuesday Dec 6, 2016 at 2:01 AM Chain tries to catch a break as it lags Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts. By Leslie Patton Bloomberg News \nMcDonald's Corp., losing ground in its battle for the nation's coffee drinkers, is planning to shake up its McCafe brand — part of a bid to challenge Starbucks Corp. and Dunkin' Donuts. \nThe company will reintroduce the McCafe concept next year, about eight years after it debuted nationwide. The push follows efforts to upgrade its java and get more of its beans from sustainable sources, mimicking a move by its Seattle-based rival. \n\"We're really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,\" Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights, said in an interview. The new McCafe campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing of the chain's coffee rewards program, she said. \nCoffee is still a booming business in the U.S., but fast-food companies haven't been able to capitalize on much of that growth. Sales at burger chains rose just 3.3 percent last year, compared with an almost 10 percent jump for coffee cafes, according to research firm Technomic. Though McCafe generates $4 billion annually in U.S. sales, it could better cater to customer needs, Cunningham said \nStarbucks and Dunkin' Donuts have attracted customers with high-margin espresso, lattes and mochas. Though McDonald's offers a wide range of coffees these days, it hasn't become as much of a go-to source for upscale drinks. \nMcCafe is \"a very important piece,\" Cunningham said. \"It gives us the chance to follow what the customer is really looking for.\" \nRe-emphasizing coffee is critical at a time when food sales are under pressure. Supermarkets have lowered prices, making it more alluring to eat at home instead of at a restaurant. Gas stations and other channels also are increasingly selling prepared meals, adding to the competition. \nMcDonald's is looking to build on the success of its all-day breakfast, which rolled out last year across the U.S. It's also upgrading stores with table service and more touch-screen ordering kiosks. The all-day breakfast push helped fuel a return to growth, but the resurgence has been waning: Domestic comparable sales rose just 1.3 percent last quarter, and McDonald's is facing declining foot traffic. \nMcDonald's isn't alone in struggling to build a more sophisticated coffee menu. After Burger King introduced 10 new Seattle's Best drinks in 2013, including flavored lattes, the rollout fizzled. The company later merged with Tim Hortons, a Canadian coffee chain, though the two brands remain distinct. \nMcDonald's still plans to emphasize its price advantage over Starbucks as it retools the McCafe brand. The company is planning a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal for the first quarter of next year, Cunningham said. About Us ",

      "text": "A \nHONG KONG: McDonald's Corp is looking to raise US$1 billion to US$2 billion with the sale of its China and Hong Kong stores after the U.S. fast-food chain decided to keep \"a significant minority stake in the business,\" a person with direct knowledge of the plans said on Tuesday. \nThe company has picked a consortium led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP and Chinese conglomerate CITIC Group Corp to buy the stores and its decision to retain a stake of up to 25 percent lowered the price tag for the business from up to US$3 billion expected previously, said the person, who declined to be identified because details of the deal are not public. \nMcDonald's wants exposure to future growth in the world's second-largest economy which is why it decided to maintain the stake, the person said. The company will also keep for now its stores in South Korea, which it previously also wanted to sell, the person added. \nA McDonald's spokeswoman in Shanghai declined to comment. Carlyle declined to comment and CITIC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. \nMcDonald's in March said it was reorganizing operations in the region, looking for strategic partners in China, Hong Kong and South Korea as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model. \nMcDonald's owns most of its more than 2,800 restaurants in the three markets. It is offering a 20-year franchise to buyers with a 10-year extension option. \nThe Chinese and Hong Kong stores attracted bids from a variety of parties, including TPG Capital Management LP - which teamed up with mini-market operator Wumart Stores Inc - and real estate firm Sanpower Group Co Ltd , which owns British department store House of Fraser Ltd , Reuters previously reported. \nThe sale comes at time when fast-food operators including McDonald's and Yum Brands Inc are recovering from a series of food-supply scandals in China that have undermined their performance. \nYum, best known for the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, agreed to sell a US$460 million stake in its China unit to investment firm Primavera Capital and an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ahead of a planned spin-off of the business. \n(Reporting by Elzio Barreto; Additional reporting by Julie Zhu; Editing by Christopher Cushing) - Reuters",

      "text": "Carlyle Consortium Nears Deal to Buy McDonald''s China Franchise -- Update December 06, 2016, 07:12:  Carlyle Consortium Nears Deal to Buy McDonald's China Franchise -- Update \nBy Kane Wu, P.R. Venkat and Julie Steinberg \nA consortium including private-equity giant Carlyle Group LP is close to a deal valued at as much as $2 billion to buy McDonald's Corp.'sChina franchise, giving the U.S. fast-food chain operator cash and local help cracking the China market. \nMcDonald's is selling a roughly 80% stake in its China franchise to the Carlyle consortium, which also includes Chinese state-owned conglomerate Citic Ltd., the people said. The deal, which still needs a final sign off from the McDonald's board, could fetch the fast-food operator an upfront payment of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, according to people familiar with the situation. \nA McDonald's spokesperson in China declined to comment. \nThe Oak Brook, Ill., chain has about 2,200 stores in China, about a third of which are already franchised. The deal will see all of its remaining China stores franchised, with McDonald's keeping a 20% stake in them. The move should help McDonald's trim its overall operational costs and preserve capital. \nMcDonald's would also rake in an estimated 5% to 7% of the China franchise sales for 20 years. \nMcDonald's monthslong auction of its China franchise attracted interest from private-equity firms TPG and Bain Capital LLC, teaming up with local partners, and a handful of local players bidding on their own. \nA deal would also let Citic and Carlyle build 1,300 new stores in China and Hong Kong. \nSales from established McDonald's stores in China shrank after a supplier issue led to shortages of hamburgers and chicken at some restaurants in 2014, according to figures provided on the company's earnings calls. Although sales in the country began recovering in the middle of last year, they shrank again in the most recent quarter due to \"protests surrounding recent events related to the South China Sea,\" McDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said on a recent earnings call. \nThe fast-food brand still has room to grow in China, the only major market where the number of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores--5,000 and counting--outstrips the number of McDonald's stores. But the novelty of burgers, fries and shakes has long since faded in the world's second-largest economy. The consortium will need to find new ways to satisfy Chinese consumers demanding healthier, more upscale and personalized alternatives. \nIn a similar move, fast-food rival Yum Brands Inc. said earlier this year it would split off its KFC and Pizza Hut operations in China and maintain a foothold in the country through royalty payments. It struck a deal in September to sell a combined $460 million stake in the China operations to Chinese private-equity fund Primavera Capital, run by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Greater China Chairman Fred Hu, and Ant Financial Services Group, the financial affiliate of Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. \nThe McDonald's deal would be state-owned conglomerate Citic Ltd.'s first foray into the restaurant business. The group runs a number of companies in the financial, real estate, national resources and energy sectors. It owns China's seventh-largest lender by assets, China Citic Bank, and the country's leading investment bank, Citic Securities Co., as well as energy giant Citic Resources Holdings Ltd., and metals manufacturer Citic Pacific Ltd. \nWashington, D.C.-based Carlyle is no stranger to China's consumer sector. It bought a majority stake in Shanghai- based Italian restaurant chain Babela Restaurant Management Co. in 2007 and sold it to an Asia-based private capital fund in 2012. It has also invested in hotel chains and a packaged-food company in China. The majority of the companies in Carlyle's growth portfolio are in China, its website shows. \nWayne Ma contributed to this article. \nWrite to Kane Wu at Kane.Wu@wsj.com, P.R.

(iStock) \nA few customers at a New Bern, N.C. McDonald’s received more than just the standard greeting after ordering at the drive-thru window on Sunday. \nAnd they weren't exactly “lovin' it.” \nIn a video of one incident captured by a customer, a voice can be heard over the intercom making some pretty unsavory statements. \nThe alleged hacker says, \"You know I'm actually on the toilet right now and I'm just going to serve you your food. I'm not even going to wash my hands. I'm trying to get some special sauce out right now.\" \nAfter pausing, the voice continues, \"You know what just pull forward because I'm going to give you whatever the f--- I feel like giving you.\" \nA McDonald’s employee told the franchisee owner that the system's wireless frequency had been hacked. On Monday, owner Bill Purcell, released a statement addressing situation, reports WCTI. \n“We are investigating this matter with the help of the New Bern Police Department,” Purcell said. \n“In addition, we are taking steps to prevent this isolated incident from happening again. As local owners, our biggest priority is our customers and community and we want to ensure that every experience at our restaurant is a positive one.” \nThe original video of the incident has been shared more than 38,000 times of Tuesday morning.

That does not mean McDonald's will be eliminating all humans in its restaurants, but eventually there will be fewer of them.\n\"It's cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who's inefficient making $15 an hour bagging french fries,\" former McDonald's USA CEO Ed Rensi said in May on Fox Business Network's Mornings with Maria .\nContinue reading ",

I'm not even going to wash my hands,\" a man is heard saying through the radio in a video shot by the customer, according to New Bern's WCTI-TV . \nThe video was recorded Sunday and has reportedly been viewed more than 38,000 times on Facebook. \n\"You know what, just pull forward because I'm going to give you whatever the f--- I feel like giving you,\" the person is also heard saying in the video of the intercom. \nThe owner of that McDonald's location reported the incident to local police and blamed the vulgar exchange on hackers, according to WCTI. Employees at the restaurant said the intercom's radio frequency had apparently been accessed by pranksters. \nClint Davis covers entertainment and trending news topics for the Scripps National Desk.

      "text": "Related Content View Photo A McDonald's employee displays a Mega Mac burger at a McDonald's outlet in Tokyo April 5, 2007. REUTERS/Toshiyuki …\n\nBy Elzio Barreto\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp is looking to raise $1 billion to $2 billion with the sale of its China and Hong Kong stores after the U.S. fast-food chain decided to keep \"a significant minority stake in the business,\" a person with direct knowledge of the plans said on Tuesday.\nThe company has picked a consortium led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP and Chinese conglomerate CITIC Group Corp to buy the stores and its decision to retain a stake of up to 25 percent lowered the price tag for the business from up to $3 billion expected previously, said the person, who declined to be identified because details of the deal are not public.\nMcDonald's wants exposure to future growth in the world's second-largest economy which is why it decided to maintain the stake, the person said. The company will also keep for now its stores in South Korea, which it previously also wanted to sell, the person added.\nA McDonald's spokeswoman in Shanghai declined to comment. Carlyle declined to comment and CITIC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nMcDonald's in March said it was reorganizing operations in the region, looking for strategic partners in China, Hong Kong and South Korea as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model.\nMcDonald's owns most of its more than 2,800 restaurants in the three markets. It is offering a 20-year franchise to buyers with a 10-year extension option.\nThe Chinese and Hong Kong stores attracted bids from a variety of parties, including TPG Capital Management LP - which teamed up with mini-market operator Wumart Stores Inc - and real estate firm Sanpower Group Co Ltd, which owns British department store House of Fraser Ltd, Reuters previously reported.\nThe sale comes at time when fast-food operators including McDonald's and Yum Brands Inc are recovering from a series of food-supply scandals in China that have undermined their performance.\nYum, best known for the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, agreed to sell a $460 million stake in its China unit to investment firm Primavera Capital and an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ahead of a planned spin-off of the business.\n\n(Reporting by Elzio Barreto; Additional reporting by Julie Zhu; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",

      "text": "A McDonald’s branch refused to accept a Scottish ÂŁ5 note (Picture: Deadline) A furious Scot filmed a London McDonald’s manager refusing to accept his Scottish ÂŁ5 note.\nIn the clip, taken in a McDonald’s near Hyde Park on Sunday, Ian Hardie tries to pay for his order with a new Scottish plastic fiver.\nBut the woman behind the till, who appears to be a manager, shakes her head and tries to hand it back. Ian, from Aberdeen, eventually storms: ‘It’s a f ÂŁ5 note!’\nCan we reunite Dilara with the British ginger stallion she met on a night out in Amsterdam? It was revealed earlier this year that a chain of McDonald’s in the Lincolnshire area was refusing Scottish money but such cases are rare in the capital. It also emerged today that a chain of chemists in Gloucestershire is also refusing to accept Scottish bank notes.\nIn the 15-second clip, Ian attempts to argue with the McDonald’s manager, saying: ‘No seriously, it’s pound sterling.’\nThis embed is invalid\nThe memes came out in force (Picture: Deadline) But the staff member continues to shake her head, and says it is her ‘discretion’ whether she takes the money or not.\nAt this stage, Ian becomes angry, and replies: ‘It’s a f five pound note.’\nYet the woman will still not let up, gesturing towards the till and saying ‘I’m sorry but the machine is not accepting it’.\nIan, 27, said that, despite being infuriated at the time, he found the incident quite comical.\n‘Before my money was given back to me, I’d been stood for about five minutes whilst management discussed it then they said they wouldn’t accept it.\n‘I found the whole thing hilarious if I’m honest. A lot of people have taken it quite seriously.’\n(Picture: Deadline) (Picture: Deadline) He added that after the debacle, he ended up leaving the restaurant, saying: ‘If my fiver wasn’t good enough, I wasn’t using my card.’\nThe clip has received almost 250,000 views after being posted on Facebook on Sunday.\nScottish social media users expressed their anger at the incident.\nKeith Forsyth wrote: ‘S McDonald’s don’t go there.’\nGlenn Ives posted an image of a scene from Braveheart with the caption: ‘They can take our lands but they’ll never take our fivers.’\nAlex Cairnie wrote: ‘Should be sacked for illiterate ignorance.’\nWhilst Graham Scott quipped, in a reference to the cow fat in Bank of England fivers: ‘Those fivers have more animal in them than any McDonald’s burger.’\n(Picture: Deadline) In September, McDonald’s themselves were branded ‘ridiculous’ after it was revealed that many of their stores in the county of Lincolnshire had a policy not to accept Scottish banknotes.\nThis is one of the first instances of this nature to take place in the capital.\nThis week, a Gloucestershire based chemist revealed that they had decided to stop accepting Scottish banknotes because they are some of the most counterfeited in the country.\nAccording to the Bank of England Scottish banknotes ‘are not ‘legal tender’; furthermore, Bank of England banknotes are only legal tender in England and Wales. Legal tender has, however, a very narrow technical meaning in relation to the settlement of debt.\n‘The acceptability of a Scottish or Northern Ireland banknote as a means of payment is essentially a matter for agreement between the parties involved.\n‘If both parties are in agreement, Scottish and Northern Ireland banknotes can be used in England and Wales.’",

      "text": "  Can Coffee Help McDonald’s Improve Its Image? A revived coffee brand could be a refreshing change   MCD +0% SBUX +0% DNKN +0% \nMcDonald's ( NYSE:MCD ), the largest burger chain in the world, has decided to double down on the coffee business. \nMcDonald's is going through a huge transformation process, moving toward a franchise-heavy model as it faced a huge slowdown in its growth trajectory. Things have picked up in the last 12 months, though, as same-store sales stayed positive. \nDue to its sheer size, increasing the company's store footprint is going to be a hard task, and same-store sales have to stay positive if it wants to keep its top line moving. McDonald’s decision to shift toward a franchise-heavy model was likely prompted by the fact that it will help stabilize its top line. Meanwhile, global same-store sales increased by 3.5% in the last quarter but only grew by 1.3% in the U.S.   MCD \nNow, McDonald's has decided to get aggressive with its coffee brand, McCafe. It is an important part of McDonald’s business as it generates $4 billion annually in the U.S. McDonald’s will be reintroducing the McCafe concept next year, and it plans to go in with price cuts to take on rivals Starbucks ( NASDAQ:SBUX ) and Dunkin’ Donuts ( NASDAQ:DNKN ). \nMcDonald’s still plans to emphasize its price advantage over Starbucks as it retools the McCafe brand. The company is planning a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal for the first quarter of next year, U.S. Senior Vice President of Strategy and Insights Kristy Cunningham told Bloomberg . \nCoffee is indeed a huge global market and, considering the fast food chain’s footprint of more than 36,000 stores around the world, coffee could well turn out to be a big revenue spinner for the company. \nThe effort will take time to percolate through to the top line, but a big push can help effectively re-brand the unit. Also under way is a major overhaul of the entire chain with a focus on more personalized service. \n“The Golden Arches' cafe brand isn't the only aspect of the company getting an upgrade. The burger chain revealed last month that its restaurants will be getting revamped as part of an effort to become a 'modern and progressive burger company.' \n“McDonald's will be adding self-service ordering kiosks, craft burgers and table service to its stores.” – CNBC \nStarbucks has changed the narrative around coffee and is the best premium coffeehouse chain in the world. McDonald’s can certainly use some of that goodwill surrounding coffee that Starbucks has built in order to improve its own image with respect to the coming generations. \nThe move may not help keep its sales numbers ticking, but it can definitely help the company change the way its brand is perceived. \nDisclosure: I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours. \nStart a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.

      "text": "McDonald's To Keep Sizable Minority Stake In Chinese Restaurants December 06, 2016, 11:00:00 AM   \n(RTTNews.com) - McDonald's ( MCD ) is looking to raise between $1 billion to $2 billion with the sale of its China and Hong Kong restaurants. However, the struggling fast-food giant plans to keep a \"significant minority stake in the business,\" according to a source cited by Reuters on Tuesday. \nThe fast-food giant intends to hold up to 25 percent stake in the stores according to Reuters, however, the Wall Street Journal reports the company to keep a 20 percent stake. \nMcDonald's has picked a consortium led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP and Chinese conglomerate CITIC Group Corp., to buy the stores. McDonald's decision to continue to maintain up to 25 percent stake in those outlets lowered the purchase prices from up to $3 billion. \nMcDonald's, which has about 2,800 restaurants in China, Hong Kong and South Korea, decided to keep the stake because it wanted exposure to future growth in the world's second biggest economy. McDonald's will also keep for now its stores in South Korea, which it earlier planned to divest. \n ",

      "text": "\nShutterstock\nAside from death and taxes (two of life’s most unfortunate certainties), there has only been one thing that many of us have been sure of: the fact that McDonald’s would never carry waffle fries. While other chains have happily offered up fried potatoes all smushed together to look like your favorite breakfast food (they just taste better , okay?), McDonald’s hasn’t really done much with their fries (why mess with perfection) until they introduced the Gilroy Garlic variety earlier this year. \nAny of us who thought they were going to stop there were terribly, terribly wrong. McDonald’s now offers waffle fries. And it’s as good a reason to move to Canada as any. (It’s also a good reason to go back to McDonald’s, even if you have given up on the Big Mac.) \nCome in and warm up with the new Season’s Cravings menu. It’s only here for a short time, so try it today! #SeasonsCravings pic.twitter.com/i7iNj9ahHj \n— McDonald's Canada (@McD_Canada) December 1, 2016 \n\nYep, unfortunately, these fries are only available in The Great White North (for now), but considering how well they’re doing — most people love them — we can all start wishing and hoping for a post-holiday miracle now. (Or we can head to Canada, where exchange rates work in our favor!)\nPlease, McDonald’s, hear our prayer: You’ve already removed that terrifying Ronald from sight, now is the time for waffle fries across the land. Bring them unto us. Like immediately.\n\nPeople are already really psyched about these things, by the way. In fact, one person almost died when he found out that waffle fries existed. \nSaw that McDonalds has waffle fries now and nearly got in a car accident shouting \"2016 is saved\" from my car window.\n— Nick Ross (@NickBossRoss) November 30, 2016 \n\nThe only real problem waffle fry lovers seem to be having is the cost versus the size. Apparently, the fries are a little too pricey per serving. And they’re smaller than the regular fries. \nwhy are McDonald's waffle fries so expensive I ain't tryna spend $4 for 3 potato waffles\n— owen (@ogregora) November 30, 2016 \nMcdonald's waffle fries are a win but you don't get much\n— leah mell (@leahmelll) November 26, 2016 \n\n\n@glovesaveluongo McDonald's website says that one order of waffle fries is 87 Grams, while a medium fries is 110 grams 🤔\n— Danielle Rushton (@Canadien_Girl11) November 26, 2016 \n\nOutside of cost, though, there’s another struggle. Do you want fries or does nothing taste better than being thin feels? \ni want to be skinny & glowing, but i also want to go to Mcdonald's & order 6lbs of waffle fries (????)\n— ❁ Kayley Chabot ❁ (@kayleychabot) November 26, 2016 \nMcDonald's would announce new waffle fries as soon as I get on a diet lma \n— Kaya ➴ (@KayaBridge) November 26, 2016 \n\n\nOf course, how could you go wrong when this description of the waffle fries gets it so right ?\nMcDonald's waffle fries are basically when you pig out and squeeze fries together except it's done for you\n— dom (@_dominicM) November 26, 2016 \n\nThis is all the proof you need: We must have waffle fries now. Could someone start a petition?\nMcDonald's waffle fries, game changer.\n— Dino (@dinesh__t) November 28, 2016 \nPrimary reasons to move to Montreal:\n1. It's a trump-free zone\n2. All of the boys are cute\n3. McDonald's has waffle fries\n— Lee (@leebish7) November 27, 2016 \nwhen ur tryna stop eating mcdonald's, then they come out with waffle fries pic.twitter.com/ib4100GydS \n— young overdraft. (@_YassinIsmail) November 27, 2016 \nHonestly all I want is to try the waffle fries from McDonald's\n— Magali Taillon (@goodbyeblueyes) November 26, 2016 \nMcDonald's getting waffle fries I kno they gong be litt \n— money jake (@1500Jake) November 26, 2016 \nI'm not saying I had McDonald's waffle fries twice tonight but the first batch was overcooked and I had to know their full potential.\n— Baillie Scheetz (@bailliescheetz) November 26, 2016 \n\n",

Most Popular \nMcDonald's Corp., losing ground in its battle for the nation's coffee drinkers, is planning to shake up its McCafe brand -- part of a bid to challenge Starbucks Corp. and Dunkin' Donuts. \nThe company will reintroduce the McCafe concept next year, about eight years after it debuted nationwide. The push follows efforts to upgrade its java and get more of its beans from sustainable sources, mimicking a move by its Seattle-based rival. \n\"We're really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,\" Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior VP-strategy and insights, said in an interview. The new McCafe campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing of the chain's coffee rewards program, she said. \nCoffee is still a booming business in the U.S., but fast-food companies haven't been able to capitalize on much of that growth. Sales at burger chains rose just 3.3% last year, compared with an almost 10% jump for coffee cafes, according to research firm Technomic. Though McCafe generates $4 billion annually in U.S. sales, it could better cater to customer needs, Ms. Cunningham said. \nStarbucks and Dunkin' Donuts have attracted customers with high-margin espresso, lattes and mochas. Though McDonald's offers a wide range of coffees these days, it hasn't become as much of a go-to source for upscale drinks. \nMcCafe is \"a very important piece,\" Cunningham said. \"It gives us the chance to follow what the customer is really looking for.\" \nFood Fight \nRe-emphasizing coffee is critical at a time when food sales are under pressure. Supermarkets have lowered prices, making it more alluring to eat at home instead of at a restaurant. Gas stations and other channels also are increasingly selling prepared meals, adding to the competition. \nMcDonald's is looking to build on the success of its all-day breakfast, which rolled out last year across the U.S. It's also upgrading stores with table service and more touch-screen ordering kiosks. The all-day breakfast push helped fuel a return to growth, but the resurgence has been waning: Domestic comparable sales rose just 1.3% last quarter, and McDonald's is facing declining foot traffic. \nMcDonald's isn't alone in struggling to build a more sophisticated coffee menu. After Burger King introduced 10 new Seattle's Best drinks in 2013, including flavored lattes, the rollout fizzled. The company later merged with Tim Hortons, a Canadian coffee chain, though the two brands remain distinct. \nTwo-Dollar Deal \nMcDonald's still plans to emphasize its price advantage over Starbucks as it retools the McCafe brand. The company is planning a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal for the first quarter of next year, Cunningham said. \nThe chain, with about 14,000 domestic restaurants, said in October that it would buy all of its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020. In another sign of Starbucks envy, McDonald's sold pumpkin-spice lattes across all of the U.S. this fall -- the first time it's done so in three years. \nThe company opened its first stand-alone McCafe location in Toronto last year, a move that it said \"showcases the company's passion for elevating the cafe experience.\" McDonald's now sells Americanos and shots of espresso across its Canadian restaurants. The McCafe locations even bake McCafe pastries in house. \nIn the U.S., McDonald's is upgrading its espresso machines with equipment that creates more consistent-tasting drinks, Ms. Cunningham said. The new gear, which has better milk-steaming technology and can make a wider variety of drinks, costs about $12,000 apiece. \nBut the typical McDonald's diner is a low- to middle-income consumer and not adventurous when it comes to coffee, said Will Slabaugh, analyst at Stephens Inc. Customers are looking for something that's affordable and familiar, he said. \n\"It's going to continue to be a slow build for them, especially in this type of environment where the customer expects a deal,\" Mr. Slabaugh said. \"I don't expect that to be a huge needle mover for them.\" \n--- Bloomberg News",

      "text": "McDonald's Corp is looking to raise $1 billion to $2 billion with the sale of its China and Hong Kong stores after the U.S. fast-food chain decided to keep \"a significant minority stake in the business,\" a person with direct knowledge of the plans said on Tuesday.\nThe company has picked a consortium led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group and Chinese conglomerate CITIC Group Corp to buy the stores and its decision to retain a stake of up to 25 percent lowered the price tag for the business from up to $3 billion expected previously, said the person, who declined to be identified because details of the deal are not public.\nMcDonald's wants exposure to future growth in the world's second-largest economy which is why it decided to maintain the stake, the person said. The company will also keep for now its stores in South Korea, which it previously also wanted to sell, the person added.\nZhang Peng | Getty Images A Ronald McDonald statue waves to customers outside a McDonald's restaurant in Jlin province, China. A McDonald's spokeswoman in Shanghai declined to comment. Carlyle declined to comment and CITIC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nMcDonald's in March said it was reorganizing operations in the region, looking for strategic partners in China, Hong Kong and South Korea as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model.\nMcDonald's owns most of its more than 2,800 restaurants in the three markets. It is offering a 20-year franchise to buyers with a 10-year extension option.\nThe Chinese and Hong Kong stores attracted bids from a variety of parties, including TPG Capital Management which teamed up with mini-market operator Wumart Stores Inc and real estate firm Sanpower Group Co Ltd which owns British department store House of Fraser , Reuters previously reported.\nThe sale comes at time when fast-food operators including McDonald's and Yum Brands are recovering from a series of food-supply scandals in China that have undermined their performance.\nYum, best known for the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, agreed to sell a $460 million stake in its China unit to investment firm Primavera Capital and an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding ahead of a planned spin-off of the business.\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .",

      "text": "The best way to combat the likes of Trump, Le Pen and Farage and the politics they represent is to rescue power from the grip of transnational corporations Contact author Tuesday 6 December 2016 18.57 GMT View more sharing options Share on Messenger Close \nA wave of revulsion rolls around the world. Approval ratings for incumbent leaders are everywhere collapsing . Symbols, slogans and sensation trump facts and nuanced argument. One in six Americans now believe that military rule would be a good idea . From all this I draw the following, peculiar conclusion: no country with a McDonald’s can remain a democracy. Globalisation as we know it is over – and Brexit is the biggest sign yet | Ruchir Sharma Read more \nTwenty years ago, the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman proposed his “golden arches theory of conflict prevention”. This holds that “no two countries that both have McDonald’s have ever fought a war against each other since they each got their McDonald’s”. \nFriedman’s was one of several end-of-history narratives suggesting that global capitalism would lead to permanent peace. He claimed that it might create “a tip-over point at which a country, by integrating with the global economy, opening itself up to foreign investment and empowering its consumers, permanently restricts its capacity for troublemaking and promotes gradual democratisation and widening peace”. He didn’t mean that McDonald’s ends war, but that its arrival in a nation symbolised the transition. \nIn using McDonald’s as shorthand for the forces tearing democracy apart, I am, like him, writing figuratively. I do not mean that the presence of the burger chain itself is the cause of the decline of open, democratic societies (though it has played its part in Britain, using our defamation laws against its critics ). Nor do I mean that countries hosting McDonald’s will necessarily mutate into dictatorships. The old forms and forums still exist, but their power seeps away, re-emerging where we can no longer reach it \nWhat I mean is that, under the onslaught of the placeless, transnational capital that McDonald’s exemplifies, democracy as a living system withers and dies . The old forms and forums still exist – parliaments and congresses remain standing – but the power they once contained seeps away, re-emerging where we can no longer reach it. \nThe political power that should belong to us has flitted into confidential meetings with the lobbyists and donors who establish the limits of debate and action. It has slipped into the diktats of the IMF and the European Central Bank, which respond not to the people but to the financial sector . It has been transported, under armed guard, into the icy fastness of Davos, where Friedman finds so warm a welcome (even when he’s talking cobblers ). Michael Sheen: ‘Brexit’s message appealed to abandoned communities’ \nAbove all, the power that should belong to the people is being crushed by international treaty. Contracts such as Nafta, Ceta the proposed TransPacific Partnership and Trade in Services Agreement and the failed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership are crafted behind closed doors in discussions dominated by corporate lobbyists . And those lobbyists are able to slip in clauses no informed electorate would ever approve of, such as the establishment of opaque offshore tribunals , through which corporations can bypass national courts, challenge national laws and demand compensation for the results of democratic decisions. \nThese treaties limit the scope of politics, prevent states changing social outcomes and drive down labour rights, consumer protection, financial regulation and the quality of neighbourhoods. They make a mockery of sovereignty . Anyone who forgets that striking them down was one of Donald Trump’s main promises will fail to understand why people were prepared to risk so much in electing him. \nAt the national level too, the McDonald’s model destroys meaningful democracy. Democracy depends on reciprocal belief, trust and belonging: the conviction that you belong to the nation and the nation belongs to you. The McDonald’s model, by rooting out attachment, could not have been better designed to erase that perception. Sovereignty? This government will sell us to the highest bidder | George Monbiot Read more \nAs Tom Wolfe observes in his novel A Man in Full , “the only way you could tell you were leaving one community and entering another was when the franchise chains started repeating and you spotted another 7-Eleven, another Wendy’s, another Costco, another Home Depot”. The alienation and anomie this destruction of place promotes are enhanced by the casualisation of labour and a spirit-crushing regime of monitoring, quantification and assessment (at which McDonald’s excels ). Public health disasters contribute to the sense of rupture. After falling for decades, for instance, death rates among middle-aged white Americans are now rising . Among the likely causes are obesity and diabetes, opioid addiction and liver failure, diseases whose carriers are corporations. \nCorporations, released from democratic constraints, drive us towards climate breakdown, an urgent threat to global peace. McDonald’s has done more than its fair share: beef production is among the most powerful causes of climate change . \nIn his book The Globalisation Paradox , the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik describes a political trilemma. Democracy, national sovereignty and hyperglobalisation, he argues, are incompatible. You cannot have all three at once. McDonaldisation crowds out domestic politics. Incoherent and dangerous as it often is, the global backlash against mainstream politicians is at heart an attempt to reassert national sovereignty against the forces of undemocratic globalisation. \nAn article about the history of the Democratic party by Matt Stoller in the Atlantic reminds us that a similar choice was articulated by the great US jurist Louis Brandeis. “We may have democracy, or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can’t have both,” he said. In 1936 the congressman Wright Patman managed to pass a bill against the concentration of corporate power. Among his targets was A&P , the giant chainstore of his day, which was hollowing out towns, destroying local retailers and turning “independent tradesmen into clerks”. How cities took over the world: a history of globalisation spanning 4,000 years Read more \nIn 1938 President Roosevelt warned that “the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in its essence, is fascism.” The Democrats saw concentrated corporate power as a form of dictatorship. They broke up giant banks and businesses and chained the chainstores. What Roosevelt, Brandeis and Patman knew has been forgotten by those in power, including powerful journalists. But not by the victims of this system. \nOne of the answers to Trump, Putin, Orbán, Erdoğan, Salvini, Duterte, Le Pen, Farage and the politics they represent is to rescue democracy from transnational corporations. It is to defend the crucial political unit that is under assault by banks, monopolies and chainstores: community. It is to recognise that there is no greater hazard to peace between nations than a corporate model that crushes democratic choice. \nTwitter: @GeorgeMonbiot .

      "text": "By Kane Wu, P.R. Venkat and Julie Steinberg\nA consortium including private-equity giant Carlyle Group LP is close to a deal valued at as much as $2 billion to buy McDonald's Corp.'s China franchise, giving the U.S. fast-food chain operator cash and local help cracking the China market.\nMcDonald's is selling a roughly 80% stake in its China franchise to the Carlyle consortium, which also includes Chinese state-owned conglomerate Citic Ltd., the people said. The deal, which still needs a final sign off from the McDonald's board could fetch the fast-food operator an upfront payment of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.\nAn announcement could be made as early as next week, the people said.\nA McDonald's spokesperson in China declined to comment.\nThe Oak Brook, Ill., chain will keep around a 20% stake in its 2,220-store empire in mainland China and Hong Kong, 65% of which it owns and operates. The move would help McDonald's trim its overall operational costs and preserve capital.\nMcDonald's would also rake in an estimated 5% to 7% of the China franchise sales for 20 years.\nMcDonald's monthslong auction of its China franchise attracted interest from private-equity firms TPG and Bain Capital LLC, teaming up with local partners, and a handful of local players bidding on their own.\nWayne Ma contributed to this article.\n 06, 2016 06:30 ET (11:30 ",

      "text": "Previous Next \nNEW BERN, N.C. - A customer placing her order in the drive-thru line at a North Carolina McDonald's was shocked by what she allegedly heard being said through the intercom speaker. \n\"You know, I'm actually on the toilet right now and I'm just going to serve you your food. I'm not even going to wash my hands,\" a man is heard saying through the radio in a video shot by the customer, according to New Bern's WCTI-TV . \nThe video was recorded Sunday and has reportedly been viewed more than 38,000 times on Facebook. \n\"You know what, just pull forward because I'm going to give you whatever the f--- I feel like giving you,\" the person is also heard saying in the video of the intercom. \nThe owner of that McDonald's location reported the incident to local police and blamed the vulgar exchange on hackers, according to WCTI. Employees at the restaurant said the intercom's radio frequency had apparently been accessed by pranksters. \nClint Davis covers entertainment and trending news topics for the Scripps National Desk.

      "text": "McDonald's officially broke ground on its new headquarters building on the site of Oprah Winfrey's former Harpo Studios in Chicago's West Loop, marking the ceremonial start to a project that's expected to be completed in spring 2018.\nMayor Rahm Emanuel ; Ald. Walter Burnett Jr., 27th; and representatives from McDonald's, developer Sterling Bay and builder McHugh Construction were present at the brief ceremony Tuesday afternoon.\n\"This was one of those times where we had to make a decision not for the community but for the city of Chicago,\" Burnett said at the ceremony, thanking the neighbors for not opposing the project.\nMcDonald's announced its plan to move to the rapidly gentrifying neighborhood, alternatively known as the West Town and Fulton Market, in June. In July, the old Harpo Studios was demolished to make way for the new construction. Sterling Bay got approval from the City Council to increase the site's allotted density and build a bigger building in September.\nThen in October, McDonald's announced it was stretching out. McDonald's has agreed to lease just under 500,000 square feet in the new building, up from the 390,000 square feet previously planned.\nIn total, the two-building structure, which at its highest will reach nine stories tall, will encompass more than 600,000 square feet. Taking out underground parking and other amenities, there's a total rent-generating space of about 540,000 square feet. That also includes planned retail on the ground floor. No tenants in that space have yet been confirmed.\nMcDonald's operates an 86-acre campus in Oak Brook , which was custom-built for the company nearly 40 years ago. Officials have acknowledged that the Oak Brook headquarters is showing its age, and McDonald's wants to be downtown so it can better cater to the younger, digital-savvy residents it wants to hire and court as customers.\nsbomkamp@chicagotribune.com \nTwitter @SamWillTravel \nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Oak Brook Rahm Emanuel Walter Burnett, Jr.",

I'm not even going to wash my hands,\" a man is heard saying through the radio in a video shot by the customer, according to New Bern's WCTI-TV . \nThe video was recorded Sunday and has reportedly been viewed more than 38,000 times on Facebook. \n\"You know what, just pull forward because I'm going to give you whatever the f--- I feel like giving you,\" the person is also heard saying in the video of the intercom. \nThe owner of that McDonald's location reported the incident to local police and blamed the vulgar exchange on hackers, according to WCTI. Employees at the restaurant said the intercom's radio frequency had apparently been accessed by pranksters. \nClint Davis covers entertainment and trending news topics for the Scripps National Desk.

      "text": "Getty Image\nThere’s no doubt that consumers are more likely to buy something based on the popularity of a brand. Air Jordans will always beat Starburys . That is if they even still make Starburys. Coke will always beat RC Cola. It’s difficult to compete with name recognition. Such has been the case with Starbucks . People love the place so much that no one even seems to bat an eye over the price. Well, McDonald’s begs to differ. \nThe company started McCafe almost a decade ago in hopes of challenging Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks and has decided to start over and completely reinvent itself in the new year by focusing on sustainable beans and a price point their competitors can’t compete with. Basically they’re attacking Starbucks’ strength (single origin coffee), attacking their weakness (price), while seeming to go all in on another weakness which customers love ( too much sugar ). \n“We’re really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,” Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights told Bloomberg . \nPart of the new McCafe will include $1 drip coffee (as opposed to $2 dollars at Starbucks) and only $2 for specialty coffees like a Latte, Peppermint Mocha, or Frappe. Will there be sugar caramels and sauces on top? You’d better f*cking believe it. \nThe revamp includes adding $12,000 espresso machines to many of their restaurants. That might seem like a lot of cash to compete with Starbucks, but that’s the price of high-quality coffee. The difference is that McDonald’s doesn’t want to hit you in the wallet the way the other top brands might. They’re willing to spend more money to ensure that you don’t have to. \nNobody thinks McDonald’s will become the 2016 version of “Central Perk”. The company will always be known more for McNuggets than macchiatos. They’re just hoping consumers will give their coffee a try. They think you might actually like it. At the worst, you only spend $1 for a coffee that ends up getting cold in your car’s cup holder. \nIf that’s not enough, they have all day breakfast now. You have to wash down your McGriddle with something and it might as well be a reasonably-priced sustainable sourced coffee. Will it be a major move in the fast food wars? Time will tell!\n",

      "text": "Here Come the Waffle Fries … Maybe (MCD) By Dan Moskowitz | December 6, 2016 — 2:57 PM EST \nMcDonald's Corporation ( MCD ) is well known for its salty and delicious fries. They might not be the healthiest food item in existence, but there’s nothing wrong with a treat once in a while. With McDonald’s having the dominant French fry of the fast-foot industry, you might wonder why it would bother attempting anything else with its fries, but the answer to that question is relatively obvious. \nIn the event you haven’t noticed, McDonald’s up against much more intense competition than in the past. It still must contend with traditional foes like Burger King and Wendy’s, but those are no longer the real threats to the fast-food chain’s market share . The real threat stems from fast-casual restaurants. Chipotle has faded, Panera Bread is still there, and while many people don’t seem to notice, Shake Shack is a very serious threat to McDonald’s in the 21 st century. Therefore, McDonald’s must innovate relentlessly in order to maintain traffic flow, which of course leads to increase sales. \nMcDonald’s has launched waffle-cut fries, but only in Canada, and only for the holiday season. What makes this promotion different that most promotions from McDonald’s is that customers must pay a premium for the waffle-cut fries. They cost $4, and according to reports from Uproxx, Delish and BuzzFeed, Canadian consumers are willing to pay that premium. The reason for this is simple: the word about waffle-cut fries has spread and people love them. If that’s the case, then don’t be surprised if McDonald’s brings waffle-cut fries to the United States in the future. \nIn fact, if McDonald’s can offer limited-time items and charge higher prices for them due to excitement and high consumer demand, then it would present an opportunity for margin expansion, which investors would love. The only catch is that McDonald’s launched Crisscuts in the United Kingdom in the past, which appear to be the same thing as waffle-cut fries. Consumers in the U.K. loved them, but McDonald’s didn’t follow through. Based on the U.K. McDonald’s website, when a consumer asked about Crisscuts no longer being available, McDonald’s replied: “Crisscuts are part of a 'bank' of sides we keep for promotional activities, which we introduce during the year as part of promotions such as Great Tastes of America, Summer, Festive, etc.” \nDear McDonald’s, here's a little secret for you: “Give consumers what they want.” \nMCD has appreciated 2.47% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 3.18%.",

      "text": "McDonald’s Is Serving Up Waffle Fries in Canada, and People Are Pumped This is the excuse to move to Canada you've been waiting for. Jackson Connor Image via Flickr/Mike Mozart, Craig Dennis \nSay what you will about McDonald’s—that its Chicken McNuggets are rubbery, that its Big Macs have lost their cultural relevance . But true students of the fast-food game know that when it comes to French fries, Mickey D’s is the undisputed GOAT. \nThat said, in recent months McDonald’s—particularly its international branches—has been trying to fix something that ain’t broken. First, the Golden Arches began introducing terrifying pumpkin spice-flavored fries in Japan , and then a location in France decided to do away with deep-fried spuds all together . Come in and warm up with the new Season’s Cravings menu. It’s only here for a short time, so try it today! # SeasonsCravings pic.twitter.com/ i7iNj9ahHj — McDonald's Canada ( @McD_Canada ) December 1, 2016 \nNow, marking McDonald’s latest experiment, the company is reportedly testing waffle fries this winter in Canada, along with a new hashbrown burger. \nThough McDonald’s is famous for its thin, crisp French fries, Twitter—the final arbiter in these matters—seems to be pretty hyped on the idea of getting some lightly-battered, waffle-cut sides this holiday season. \nwhen ur tryna stop eating mcdonald's , then they come out with waffle fries pic.twitter.com/ ib4100GydS — young overdraft. ( @_YassinIsmail ) November 27, 2016 \nmcdonald's new waffle fries are amazing 😍😍",

      "text": "Weinstein Co.’s McDonald’s Movie ‘The Founder’ Will Open Doors Early Anthony D'Alessandro Pin it Share Weinstein Co. is premiering The Founder on Dec. 7 at the ArcLight Hollywood for a one-week awards qualifying run before its nationwide Jan. 20 release date. Originally, the John Lee Hancock-directed pic was to counterprogram Suicide Squad during the first weekend of August, but then word was that the film moved to late December to capitalize on awards season. This new date for Founder is earlier than expected. Pic tells the true story of how Ray Kroc ( Michael Keaton ), a struggling salesman from Illinois, met burger restaurant impresarios Mac and Dick McDonald, in 1950s Southern California, and pulled the business away from them to make a billion-dollar empire. The Wrestler ‘s Robert Siegel penned the script. Laura Dern plays Ray Kroc’s first wife Ethel; Linda Cardellini portrays his second wife Joan Smith; John Carroll Lynch is Mac McDonald and Nick Offerman is Dick McDonald. TWC Co-Chairman, Harvey Weinstein commented in a statement, “This film has a unique relevance to our current times. You have a persistent and, at times, calculating entrepreneur representing both the best and worst of American businessmen and who ultimately created the fast food industry as we know it today. It’s up to audiences to determine if he’s a visionary, an opportunist or a crook and how that fits in our society. I think everyone is going to want to see this story and ultimately decide for themselves.” Related stories",

      "text": "CHICAGO (CBS) — McDonald’s is making a major move that broke ground on Tuesday. \nMcDonald’s headquarters is moving 18 miles from Oak Brook to Randolph and Carpenter in the West Loop.\nCBS 2’s Suzanne Le Mignot takes a look at what that means for the thousands of employees.\nA ceremonial shovel toss of dirk marks the groundbreaking of McDonald’s headquarters in the West Loop. The food giant’s corporate office will bow be back in Chicago, after more than four decades. \n“It’s just a really exciting day for us,” said Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s CEO. \nMcDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook said all 2,000 employees at their Oakbrook location, will now be working on the spot, once occupied by Harpo Studios, at Randolph and Carpenter. \n“I do want to say to McDonald’s and Steve particularly and everybody after 45 years, welcome home,” said Mayor Rahm Emanuel. \nMcDonald’s will occupy 485,000 square feet of the new, nine story building. \nEasterbrook calls the West Loop, vibrant and trend driven.\n“I can’t quantify it, but I think the reality is, as you see other businesses around us, you’ll see the amplifier affect that a global headquarters can have on an emerging and exciting area like this,” he said.\nThe West Loop is home to food wholesalers and renowned restaurants.\n“We’re just very honored to have McDonald’s in the West Loop,” said Carla Agostinelli, West Loop Community Organization. “They’re a company that excels in leadership and diversity and that really defines this city, that we live in.”\nThe ground floor retail space, will have some kind of restaurant concept, that will contribute to the West Loop scene. Hamburger University will also be at headquarters. \nAs for the fate of McDonald’s Oakbrook headquarters, that the company is leaving after 45 years, the CEO said they’ll see what company may want to take over the space, once they move to the West Loop, in the Spring of 2018.\n",

      "title": "Carlyle Consortium Nears Deal to Buy McDonald's China Franchise",
      "text": "A consortium including private-equity giant Carlyle Group LP is close to a deal valued at as much as $2 billion to buy McDonald's Corp.'s China franchise, giving the U.S. fast-food chain operator cash and local help cracking the China market.\nMcDonald's is selling a roughly 80% stake in its China franchise to the Carlyle consortium, which also includes Chinese state-owned conglomerate Citic Ltd., the people said. The deal, which still needs a final sign off from the McDonald's board, could fetch the fast-food operator an upfront payment of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.\nAn announcement could be made as early as next week, the people said.\nA McDonald's spokesperson in China declined to comment.\nThe Oak Brook, Ill., chain has about 2,200 stores in China, about a third of which are already franchised. The deal will see all of its remaining China stores franchised, with McDonald's keeping a 20% stake in them. The move should help McDonald's trim its overall operational costs and preserve capital.\nMcDonald's would also rake in an estimated 5% to 7% of the China franchise sales for 20 years.\nMcDonald's monthslong auction of its China franchise attracted interest from private-equity firms TPG and Bain Capital LLC, teaming up with local partners, and a handful of local players bidding on their own.\nA deal would also let Citic and Carlyle build 1,300 new stores in China and Hong Kong.\nSales from established McDonald's stores in China shrank after a supplier issue led to shortages of hamburgers and chicken at some restaurants in 2014, according to figures provided on the company's earnings calls. Although sales in the country began recovering in the middle of last year, they shrank again in the most recent quarter due to \"protests surrounding recent events related to the South China Sea,\" McDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said on a recent earnings call.\nThe fast-food brand still has room to grow in China, the only major market where the number of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores—5,000 and counting—outstrips the number of McDonald's stores. But the novelty of burgers, fries and shakes has long since faded in the world's second-largest economy. The consortium will need to find new ways to satisfy Chinese consumers demanding healthier, more upscale and personalized alternatives.\nIn a similar move, fast-food rival Yum Brands Inc. said earlier this year it would split off its KFC and Pizza Hut operations in China and maintain a foothold in the country through royalty payments. It struck a deal in September to sell a combined $460 million stake in the China operations to Chinese private-equity fund Primavera Capital, run by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Greater China Chairman Fred Hu, and Ant Financial Services Group, the financial affiliate of Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\nThe McDonald's deal would be state-owned conglomerate Citic Ltd.'s first foray into the restaurant business. The group runs a number of companies in the financial, real estate, national resources and energy sectors. It owns China's seventh-largest lender by assets, China Citic Bank, and the country's leading investment bank, Citic Securities Co., as well as energy giant Citic Resources Holdings Ltd., and metals manufacturer Citic Pacific Ltd.\nWashington, D.C.-based Carlyle is no stranger to China's consumer sector. It bought a majority stake in Shanghai-based Italian restaurant chain Babela Restaurant Management Co. in 2007 and sold it to an Asia-based private capital fund in 2012. It has also invested in hotel chains and a packaged-food company in China. The majority of the companies in Carlyle's growth portfolio are in China, its website shows.\nWayne Ma contributed to this article.\nWrite to Kane Wu at Kane.Wu@wsj.com, P.R.

      "text": "BREAKING: McDonald’s Gets Bad News \nThe way the technology is supposed to work is that shoppers download the Amazon Go app, scan their personalized bar code upon entry into the store, pick up what they need, and once they leave the store their “virtual cart” is charged to the shopper’s Amazon account. \nThis amazing technology utilizes what the consumer giant dubs “Just Walk Out” technology. Just Walk Out reportedly comprises computer vision, deep learning algorithms and sensor fusion. It seems like an advanced version of the hotel minibars in which items are weighted and if they are removed the guest charged for them. \nHowever, Amazon promises that if you decide not to get an item and put it back on the shelf, your virtual cart will be updated to reflect only the actual items you take out of the store with you. Advertisement - story continues below \nSee the video below … this is absolutely crazy! \nSo all of those protesters clamoring for a higher rate of pay may want to start protesting something else, because automation is coming and soon we won’t even have the jobs to think about requesting a higher minimum wage. \nShare this story on Facebook and Twitter and be sure to add your thoughts to the comment section below.

      "text": "0 \nNext week on Raw The New Day are set to defend their Tag Team Titles against Cesaro and Sheamus, and Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson in a triple threat match. The team didn’t sound so happy when they found out about the match on Raw Fallout, but McDonald’s sent Big E something that should turn his frown upside down. \nRelated: WWE Pulls World Champion AJ Styles From Live Event, The New Day React To Title Match \nMcDonald’s sent Big E a custom championship fanny pack, along with a letter. According the letter, “the undisputed champ, the iconic Big Mac, is ready to tag in and help Big E take down hunger. The letter also says that the fanny pack is filled with coupons, that Big E can presumably use to purchase Big Macs. \nYou can check out the one of a kind fanny pack belt below. \n— ShinigamE (@WWEBigE) December 5, 2016 \nFitness model Julie Real announced on Instagram that she has signed a deal with WWE. She posted the following: \n“So everyone wonders why I’m always MIA. Well, this is why…I’ve been working towards dreams and proud to say I am now officially signed with WWE! Like what I’ve learned through years of martial arts…each belt only means that you become a student all over again in that bracket. This is just the beginning of my journey and I am so thankful for those who have been there for me. I’d like to give a special shoutout to all the people who have made this possible for me.” \n“My coaches and teammates at @santino_bros , my coaches @k_slaya and Arna at @kilfit_athletics , my coaches and teammates at @blackhousemma , my nutritionist @npnmatt , all the coaches and people who have been there for my whole martial arts career and last but not least, the most important one who made this possible for me, Paul Cheng (One FC fighter and football player for the Beijing Lions). .” A photo posted by WWE Wrestler (@julierealofficial) on Dec 4, 2016 at 12:26pm PST TAGS",

      "text": "\nThe food mashups just keep on coming. In what may or may not be a direct jab at McDonald's for their Nutella Burger , Burger King will launch their Ketchup Donut Whopper to celebrate Hanukkah. Exclusive to Israel, the thinking behind the collab was to incorporate a Whopper with sufganiyah -- a.k.a jelly-filled doughnuts -- traditionally eaten during the celebration. Fittingly dubbed the \"SufganiKing\", the burger features traditional Whopper innards with a fried doughnut bun filled with ketchup instead of jelly. This creation is set to debut on December 25 and run through January 1. Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

I'm not even going to wash my hands,\" a man is heard saying through the radio in a video shot by the customer, according to New Bern's WCTI-TV . \nThe video was recorded Sunday and has reportedly been viewed more than 38,000 times on Facebook. \n\"You know what, just pull forward because I'm going to give you whatever the f--- I feel like giving you,\" the person is also heard saying in the video of the intercom. \nThe owner of that McDonald's location reported the incident to local police and blamed the vulgar exchange on hackers, according to WCTI. Employees at the restaurant said the intercom's radio frequency had apparently been accessed by pranksters. \nClint Davis covers entertainment and trending news topics for the Scripps National Desk.

      "text": "monticelllo—Getty Images McDonald's is buying new coffee machines to ramp up its efforts to compete with Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. A drip coffee will cost just $1 \nMcDonald’s wants to become the place where you get your daily coffee fix. \nThe fast food chain is reintroducing its coffee shop, the McCafé, in 2017, with improvements like getting beans from sustainable sources, Bloomberg reported . The chain would also require U.S. franchisees to purchase new gear for their espresso machines, with a price tag of $12,000. The updated equipment would have better milk-steaming technology and be able to make a greater variety of drinks. \nThe move would make the restaurant’s offerings competitive with coffee giants like Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts—and McDonald’s plans to tout price as a key advantage over its rivals. Starting in the first quarter of next year, it will offer a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal. \nThe company is also expanding to cafes: It opened its first stand-alone McCafé in Toronto and sells products like Americanos, espresso shots and pastries that it bakes in-house. \nIt’s not the only step that McDonald’s has taken to compete with Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts. This fall, McDonald’s sold pumpkin spice lattes across all its U.S. locations for the first time in three years. \nThe chain is hoping that caffeine might be a way to bring more customers in the door: Though sales at burger chains increased by just 3% last year, coffee café sales spiked by 10%. Though McDonald’s has seen success with the launch of its all-day breakfast menu last year—and is testing new menu items like garlic fries and features like mobile ordering —foot traffic is still on the decline. \n",

      "text": "McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook hinted that the world's largest burger chain may have a presence in the ground-floor retail space planned in its new headquarters in Chicago's West Loop.\n\"We want to take a prime position in the retail space because we think it's a great opportunity for us to express what we stand for now and also some of the things we look forward to sharing in the future,\" Easterbrook said. \"We're still working on the precise details of it but we'll have some fun sharing the news when we're ready.\"\nIt's not clear if that means McDonald's will build a restaurant there or if the chain will be partnering with other companies for something new to occupy that retail space, which faces busy Randolph Street.\nHe made the comments after McDonald's officially broke ground at the site of Oprah Winfrey's former Harpo Studios, marking the ceremonial start to a project that's expected to be completed in spring 2018. Mayor Rahm Emanuel; Ald. Walter Burnett Jr., 27th; and representatives from developer Sterling Bay and builder McHugh Construction also were in attendance at the brief ceremony Tuesday afternoon.\nMcDonald's announced its plan to move to the neighborhood, alternatively known as West Town and Fulton Market, in June.\nThe move will bring some 2,000 employees from Oak Brook to a trendy area of the city best known for fine restaurants like Girl & the Goat and Au Cheval . Community leaders and residents have expressed concern over the increase in traffic accidents and congestion that adding all those new people may bring.\nBurnett thanked the neighbors for not opposing the McDonald's move. \"This was one of those times where we had to make a decision not for the community but for the city of Chicago,\" he said at the ceremony, citing the benefits that a big employer like McDonald's can bring to the city, including jobs.\nMcDonald's currently operates an 86-acre campus in Oak Brook but wants to be downtown so it can better cater to the younger, digital-savvy residents it wants to hire and court as customers.\n\"At the moment we have a fantastic workforce that will be coming downtown with us,\" Easterbrook said. \"Over time, as the business changes and things evolve, we have a fantastic hiring environment to tap into.\"\nsbomkamp@chicagotribune.com\nTwitter @SamWillTravel\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Oprah Winfrey Au Cheval",

      "text": "If you've always gotten an Egg McMuffin with a fresh-cracked round egg, you might be surprised to know that you could have also gotten it with scrambled eggs or egg whites. In fact, there are actually five different preparations of eggs at McDonald's and here's what you get with each:\n\n- Round Egg - The default of the McMuffin, the round egg is just a egg cracked into an egg ring and cooked over the grill.\n\n- Scrambled Egg - Available in McDonald's breakfast platters, liquid eggs (Eggs, Citric Acid) are cooked on the grill.\n\n- Folded Egg - This is standard on McDonald's biscuit sandwiches and come to each restaurant pre-cooked and frozen. They're heated up when they're needed and contain a combination of the following: Eggs, Nonfat Milk, Modified Food Starch, Salt, Citric Acid, and Soy Lecithin.\n\n- Egg Whites - The key feature of McDonald's Egg White Delight McMuffin, these are egg whites cooked on the grill.\n\n- Sausage Burrito Eggs - The name's a bit self-explanatory: these are the eggs that come in the Sausage Burrito. Like the folded eggs, they're pre-cooked and frozen. The ingredients are a bit different as the scramble also includes sausage and vegetables. Here's the full list: Whole Eggs, Pork, Tomatoes, Skim Milk, Soybean Oil, Green Chilies, Onions, Modified Corn Starch, Spices, Salt, Water, Dextrose, Natural Flavors, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Sugar, Rosemary Extract, Calcium Chloride, and Citric Acid.\n\nWhile it's easy enough to get a a round egg or egg whites on your Bacon, Egg & Cheese Biscuit with the availability of the All Day Breakfast menu , you might be able to finagle some sausage burrito mixture onto your hamburger at some McDonald's restaurants...\n\nPhoto via McDonald's.

      "title": "McDonald's Nears Deal to Sell China Business -- WSJ",
      "text": " Kane Wu, P.R. Venkat and Julie Steinberg\nA consortium including private-equity giant Carlyle Group LP is close to a deal valued at as much as $2 billion to buy McDonald's Corp.'sChina franchise, giving the U.S. fast-food chain operator cash and local help cracking the China market.\nMcDonald's is selling a roughly 80% stake in its China franchise to the Carlyle consortium, which also includes Chinese state-owned conglomerate Citic Ltd., according to people familiar with the situation. The proposed deal, which still needs a final signoff from the McDonald's board, could fetch the company an upfront payment of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, the people said.\nA McDonald's representative in China declined to comment.\nThe Oak Brook, Ill., chain has about 2,200 stores in China, about one-third of which are already franchised. All of the company's remaining China stores would be franchised under the deal, with McDonald's keeping a 20% stake in them. The move would likely help McDonald's trim its overall operational costs and preserve capital.\nMcDonald's also would rake in an estimated 5% to 7% of the China franchise sales for 20 years.\nThe company's monthslong auction of its China franchise attracted interest from private-equity firms TPG and Bain Capital LLC, teaming up with local partners, and a handful of local competitors bidding on their own.\nA deal also would let Citic and Carlyle build 1,300 stores in China and Hong Kong.\nSales from established McDonald's stores in China shrank after a supplier problem led to shortages of hamburgers and chicken at some restaurants in 2014, according to figures provided on the company's earnings calls. Although sales in the country began recovering in the middle of last year, they shrank again in the most recent quarter because of \" protests surrounding recent events related to the South China Sea,\" McDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said on a recent earnings call.\nThe fast-food brand still has room to grow in China, the only major market where the number of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores -- 5,000 and counting -- outstrips the number of McDonald's stores. But the novelty of burgers, fries and shakes has long since faded in the world's second-largest economy. The consortium will need to find new ways to satisfy Chinese consumers demanding healthier, personalized and more upscale alternatives.\nIn a similar move, fast-food rival Yum Brands Inc. said earlier this year it would split off its KFC and Pizza Hut operations in China and maintain a foothold in the country through royalty payments. It struck a deal in September to sell a combined $460 million stake in the China operations to Chinese private-equity fund Primavera Capital, run by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Greater China Chairman Fred Hu, and Ant Financial Services Group, the financial affiliate of Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\nThe McDonald's deal would be state-owned conglomerate Citic Ltd.'s first foray into the restaurant business. The group runs a number of companies in the financial, real-estate, national-resources and energy sectors. It owns China's seventh-largest lender by assets, China Citic Bank, and the country's leading investment bank, Citic Securities Co., as well as energy company Citic Resources Holdings Ltd. and metals manufacturer Citic Pacific Ltd.\nCarlyle, based in Washington, is no stranger to China's consumer sector. It bought a majority stake in Shanghai- based Italian restaurant chain Babela Restaurant Management Co. in 2007 and sold it to an Asia-based private capital fund in 2012.\nIt has also invested in hotel chains and a packaged-food company in China. The majority of the companies in Carlyle's growth portfolio are in China, its website shows.\n--Wayne Ma contributed to this article.\nWrite to Kane Wu at Kane.Wu@wsj.com, P.R.

      "text": "McDonald's To Keep Up To 25% Stake In China, Hong Kong Stores: Source McDonald's to Keep up to 25% Stake in China, Hong Kong stores: Source Thomson Reuters | Updated: December 07, 2016 14:05 IST Tweeter \nMcDonald's Corp is looking to raise $1 billion to $2 billion with the sale of its China and Hong Kong stores after the U.S. fast-food chain decided to keep \"a significant minority stake in the business,\" a person with direct knowledge of the plans said on Tuesday. \nThe company has picked a consortium led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP and Chinese conglomerate CITIC Group Corp to buy the stores and its decision to retain a stake of up to 25 percent lowered the price tag for the business from up to $3 billion expected previously, said the person, who declined to be identified because details of the deal are not public. \nMcDonald's wants exposure to future growth in the world's second-largest economy which is why it decided to maintain the stake, the person said. The company will also keep for now its stores in South Korea, which it previously also wanted to sell, the person added. \nA McDonald's spokeswoman in Shanghai declined to comment. Carlyle declined to comment and CITIC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. \nMcDonald's in March said it was reorganizing operations in the region, looking for strategic partners in China, Hong Kong and South Korea as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model. \nMcDonald's owns most of its more than 2,800 restaurants in the three markets. It is offering a 20-year franchise to buyers with a 10-year extension option. \nThe Chinese and Hong Kong stores attracted bids from a variety of parties, including TPG Capital Management LP - which teamed up with mini-market operator Wumart Stores Inc - and real estate firm Sanpower Group Co Ltd, which owns British department store House of Fraser Ltd, Reuters previously reported. \nThe sale comes at time when fast-food operators including McDonald's and Yum Brands Inc are recovering from a series of food-supply scandals in China that have undermined their performance. \nYum, best known for the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, agreed to sell a $460 million stake in its China unit to investment firm Primavera Capital and an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ahead of a planned spin-off of the business.

      "text": "McDonald''s Plans $12,000 Espresso Machines To Take On Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts  28:  McDonald's Plans $12,000 Espresso Machines To Take On Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts \n(RTTNews.com) - Fast food major McDonald's is investing in $12,000 espresso machines for all of its U.S. restaurants, with a view to challenge Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts in the coffee business, Bloomberg reported. \nAiming to attract more customers, the company plans to reintroduce its coffee shop McCafe in 2017, with upgraded espresso machines, and special deals for customers. The updated equipment would have better milk-steaming technology, and can make a variety of drinks. The company has also promised to buy more sustainably sourced coffee beans. \nWith a view for its offerings to be more competitive with coffee giants like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts, the company is also said to highlight its price advantages over its rivals. The company plans to offer $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty beverages over the first quarter of 2017. \nMcDonald's sells Americanos and shots of espresso in Canada, and even has a stand-alone McCafe in Toronto. \nThe chain's foot traffic is reportedly down, despite its success with the launch of all-day breakfast menu last year. The company is also testing new menu items like garlic fries and features like mobile ordering. \nThe company expects that caffeine would bring more customers. As per the report, sales at burger chains increased by just 3 percent last year, while coffee cafÃ© sales grew by 10 percent. \n ",

      "text": "PITTSBURGH Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. 40.4406 -79.9959 \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — You probably don't know his name, but you've almost certainly devoured his creation: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun. \nMichael James \"Jim\" Delligatti, the McDonald's franchisee who created the Big Mac nearly 50 years ago and saw it become perhaps the best-known fast-food sandwich in the world, died Monday at home in Pittsburgh. Delligatti, who according to his son ate at least one 540-calorie Big Mac a week for decades, was 98. \nDelligatti's franchise was based in Uniontown, not far from Pittsburgh, when he invented the chain's signature burger in 1967 after deciding customers wanted a bigger sandwich. Demand exploded as Delligatti's sandwich spread to the rest of his 47 stores in Pennsylvania and was added to the chain's national menu in 1968. \n\"He was often asked why he named it the Big Mac, and he said because Big Mc sounded too funny,\" his son Michael Delligatti said. \nHowever, McDonald's in 1985 honored Esther Glickstein Rose with coming up for a name for the burger and presented her with a plaque etched with a likeness of the best-selling sandwich and french fries between the Golden Arches. She was a 21-year-old secretary for the company's advertising department in 1967 when, the story goes, a harried executive dashing to a board meeting asked her for a name nomination. \nJim Delligatti's family disputes that Rose came up with the idea. The company didn't immediately clear up the dispute Wednesday. \nDelligatti told The Associated Press in 2006 that McDonald's resisted the idea at first because its simple lineup of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and shakes was selling well. \n\"They figured, why go to something else if (the original menu) was working so well?\" Delligatti said then. \nMcDonald's has sold billions of Big Macs since then, in more than 100 countries. When the burger turned 40, McDonald's estimated it was selling 550 million Big Macs a year, or roughly 17 every second. Delligatti received no payment or royalties for coming up with the burger, the company said. \n\"Delligatti was a legendary franchisee within McDonald's system who made a lasting impression on our brand,\" the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said Wednesday in a statement. The Big Mac \"has become an iconic sandwich enjoyed by many around the world.\" \nAnn Dugan, a former assistant dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz School of Business and an expert on business franchises, said Jim Delligatti's genius was simple: He listened to customers who wanted a bigger burger. \n\"In franchising, there's always this set playbook and you have to follow it. Jim saw an opportunity to go outside the playbook because he knew the customer,\" Dugan said. \"He persevered and (McDonald's) listened, and the rest is history.\" \nDelligatti headed M&J Management, a four-generation family business and McDonald's franchise organization, for more than 60 years. He opened his first McDonald's in Pittsburgh's North Hills suburbs in 1957. In 1979, he co-founded Pittsburgh's Ronald McDonald House, then the seventh such facility in the country, where families can stay when children travel to Pittsburgh for life-saving medical care, and he was involved in several other charities. \nDelligatti also helped introduce breakfast service at McDonald's, developing the hotcakes and sausage meal to feed hungry steelworkers on their way home from overnight shifts in the mills, his family said. \nIn addition to his two sons, Jim Delligatti is survived by his wife, Ellie, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \nThe Devlin Funeral Home near Pittsburgh is handling visitation Thursday and Friday. Delligatti's funeral will be held Saturday at St. Joseph's Parish in O'Hara Township. SEE FULL ARTICLE ",

      "title": "Ground-floor restaurant to anchor McDonald's corporate HQ",
      "text": "McDonald’s new corporate headquarters on a West Loop site that once housed Oprah Winfrey’s Harpo Studios will be anchored by a ground-floor restaurant, CEO Steve Easterbrook disclosed Tuesday.\nAt a ceremonial “groundbreaking” for a project that’s been under way for months, Mayor Rahm Emanuel welcomed McDonald’s Corp. back “home” to the city where it was headquartered from 1955 to 1971 before moving to Oak Brook.\n“After 45 years, you’re like a family member now. We’re never gonna let you go again,” Emanuel said.\nEasterbrook initially teased a “McDonald’s presence” on the ground floor of the nine-story building at Randolph and Carpenter that will house a McDonald’s workforce now 2,000-strong as well as Hamburger University and the company’s test kitchens.\nMcDonald’s will occupy 485,000 square feet of space in the building, which is expected to open in the spring of 2018.\nBut under questioning after the groundbreaking, Easterbrook acknowledged that it would be a restaurant of some kind, perhaps a new concept for McDonald’s.\n“That’s what we are. We’re a restaurant business. So, it’ll be a restaurant concept of some sort,” Easterbrook said.\n“As we’ve got more details to share, we’ll share them. But at the moment, I just wanted to acknowledge that we will have a McDonald’s presence of a kind on the ground-floor retail space. And we’re looking forward to that also contributing to the local going-out scene. It’s a great place to come out and eat and drink around this area.”\nEasterbrook was equally tight-lipped about the future of the bucolic Oak Brook campus that McDonald’s has called home for more than 40 years.\n“When we’re ready to move out, we’ll see if someone wants to move in. But at the moment, we’re focused on the new site down here,” he said.\nThe McDonald’s CEO was more expansive about his reasons for returning to Chicago without an incentive or taxpayer subsidy of any kind.\nIt’s about being “closer to our customers” and about transforming McDonald’s into a “modern, progressive” company with a workforce filled with millennials who crave the city’s excitement, nightlife and vibrant cultural scene.\n“Being here today and in the heart of the city with all the hustle and bustle entering my fourth Chicago winter — which I’ve come to embrace, although not so warmly — it’s clear to me that being on the corner of Carpenter and Randolph is the right place for McDonald’s,” Easterbrook said.\n“We’re moving back to Chicago because we believe in the energy of this great city — an energy we believe we can add to . . . . We have to get close to our customers . . . you could not be in a more vibrant, customer, trend-driven area than in the West Loop of Chicago.”\nRobert Gibbs, executive vice president and global chief communications officer for McDonald’s, added, “The excitement, the energy. All that there is to do every minute of the day makes this a great place to attract world-class talent. . . . You can feel the energy and the talent that’s down here. It’ll be so exciting.”\nMayor Rahm Emanuel greets old friend and former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who is now global chief of communications for McDonald’s. | Fran Spielman/Sun-Times\nTuesday’s groundbreaking ceremony was a reunion of sorts for Emanuel and Gibbs, who served together under President Barack Obama. Gibbs was White House press secretary; Emanuel was Obama’s first chief of staff.\nNow, the two men are neighbors in Ravenswood.\n“I didn’t realize until after I moved in that I lived a block away — literally. I was walking my dog and saw cars out in front of a house and thought, ‘That seems kind of interesting,'” Gibbs said.\n“When we first moved in, we accidentally set off the alarm because we got the house but didn’t get the code to turn off the alarm. Pretty quickly the police came over. And it was apparent that somebody lived nearby and we attracted their attention.”\n# fast-food mcdonald's corp. west loop",

      "text": "McDonald's CEO says robots won't replace workers. He's wrong The Motley Fool 23 hrs ago Daniel B. Kline © Provided by Fool Mcdonaldskiosk Editor’s note: The opinions in this article are the author’s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.\nMcDonald's (NYSE: MCD) CEO Steve Easterbrook has said that the chain's automation efforts won't lead to it eliminating human workers.\nThat might be true in the short term, but ultimately it makes no sense for the company to pay people to do what robots do better and -- after a big capital investment -- cheaper. That does not mean McDonald's will be eliminating all humans in its restaurants, but eventually there will be fewer of them.\nQuote: s in the article McDonald's Corp MCD\n▼ 119.25 -0.04 -0.03% Starbucks Corp SBUX\n▼ 57.44 -0.06 -0.10% \"It's cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who's inefficient making $15 an hour bagging french fries,\" former McDonald's USA CEO Ed Rensi said in May on Fox Business Network's Mornings with Maria .\nThat sounds like a dire prediction, and it could be, but pretty much all of recorded history suggests it's going to happen. What Rensi said simply makes sense. A tablet can take your order better, faster, and with more accuracy than a human. They same is almost certainly true when it comes to producing fries, burgers, or making the rest of the chain's fare.\nWhile Easterbrook said at the McDonald's annual meeting in May that robots won't replace humans -- saying that McDonald's is a service business and \"we will always have an important human element\" -- that might not be out of benevolence or a commitment to maintaining a human workforce. Instead, he knows that the change won't be immediate, or even quick, so there's no point in riling up workers who may well not work for his company (or will be in non-menial jobs) by the time they do.\nJob markets change\nTechnology replacing people has been a fact of life since humanity moved beyond living in caves. A man with a hammer can do the work of multiple men with rocks while a man with a nail gun can replace a whole bunch of hammer users. We no longer have phone operators, elevator operators, and even most of our frozen yogurt dispensing has been turned over to machines. We've limited the amount of human toll takers, replaced some bank tellers with ATMs, and have cut human labor everywhere from factories to kitchens.\nChanges in some of those fields were lamented, even fought, but the reality is that progress happens. Easterbrook even noted in the company's Q3 earnings call, which was transcribed by Seeking Alpha (registration required), that McDonald's has modernized many of its stores outside the U.S.\n\"In Canada, we're engaging with customers in simpler, less stressful ways, offering them more choices in how they order or pay,\" he said. \"We now have dual-point service and self-order kiosks in almost 90% of our traditional restaurants. In addition, we're taking steps to redefine hospitality on both sides of the counter with dedicated guest experience leaders in all of Canada's traditional restaurants.\"\nBut self-ordering kiosks will mean a need for fewer employees, just like the automated checkout lines in a grocery store, where technology allows one employee to oversee many stations, arguably while offering better service.\nThe robots are coming\nStarbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) has shown that the first wave of adding technology -- in its case mobile order-taking and payment -- does not always mean fewer workers. The coffee chain has been able to shift labor from order-taking into production, allowing stores to become more efficient given the limited space behind its counters.\nIt's possible that a faster, more efficient McDonald's will, at first, let the company grow demand. That would simply shift worker demand rather than eliminate it. Ultimately though, a robot can likely make McNuggets, fries, and Big Macs better and cheaper than a person.\nThat's bad for the people doing those jobs, but you can't protect fast-food workers from technology any more than you could phone operators or toll takers. While it's reasonable to think McDonald's will have humans in customer-facing jobs, it's also logical to expect the chain -- and many others -- to use robots or other technology in areas where that makes sense.\nAutomation, after the initial capital investment, can lower costs and raise profits for McDonald's. It can also let one location serve more people, allowing for rises in same-store sales that would be difficult when relying on human workers solely. The robots are coming, and they will take jobs, just as new technologies have since pretty much the day the wheel was invented.\nSPONSORED: 10 stocks we like better than McDonald's\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Weinstein Co. The Weinstein Company \nThe Weinstein Co. is premiering The Founder on Dec. 7 at the ArcLight Hollywood for a one-week awards qualifying run before its nationwide Jan. 20 release date. Theme Of Obsession Front And Center At Weinstein Panel & How Ray Kroc Was Like Trump - The Contenders \nOriginally, the John Lee Hancock-directed pic was to counterprogram Suicide Squad during the first weekend of August, but then word was that the film moved to late December to capitalize on awards season. This new date for Founder is earlier than expected. Pic tells the true story of how Ray Kroc ( Michael Keaton ), a struggling salesman from Illinois, met burger restaurant impresarios Mac and Dick McDonald, in 1950s Southern California, and pulled the business away from them to make a billion-dollar empire. The Wrestler ‘s Robert Siegel penned the script. Laura Dern plays Ray Kroc’s first wife Ethel; Linda Cardellini portrays his second wife Joan Smith; John Carroll Lynch is Mac McDonald and Nick Offerman is Dick McDonald. \nTWC Co-Chairman, Harvey Weinstein commented in a statement, “This film has a unique relevance to our current times. You have a persistent and, at times, calculating entrepreneur representing both the best and worst of American businessmen and who ultimately created the fast food industry as we know it today. It’s up to audiences to determine if he’s a visionary, an opportunist or a crook and how that fits in our society. I think everyone is going to want to see this story and ultimately decide for themselves.” \n",

      "title": "Jeremy Renner, Don Handfield on More 'Avengers' and 'Bourne' Films, and Making a Movie About McDonald's",
      "text": "COMMENTS Christopher Patey “I don’t really watch TV. I don’t read books for entertainment, either. Look, I live in entertainment,” says Renner (right), with Handfield. They were photographed May 24 at The Combine offices in Culver City. The actors turned producers of 'The Founder' (who met at Gold's Gym) talk about taking back control, why they named their company The Combine and what else is in the works. \nJeremy Renner and Don Handfield were struggling actors, newly arrived in Los Angeles and living off ramen, when they met at Gold's Gym in Hollywood about 20 years ago. Handfield went on to pursue a career as a writer-director-producer (including a stint at E!), while Renner stuck to acting and eventually became Oscar-nominated for The Hurt Locker and The Town as well as starring in The Bourne Legacy and the current hit Arrival . \nNow they're back together at The Combine, a five-employee production company that has an overhead deal with PalmStar Media, investor Kevin Frakes' film-finance vehicle. Even though Renner appears as Hawkeye in the Avengers movies, he and his partner's goal is not to make expensive studio tentpoles but rather low- to mid-budget specialty films, along with telefilms and series. Renner, 45, cites The Shawshank Redemption , Braveheart and A Clockwork Orange among his favorite films, while Handfield, also 45, mentions television shows including Game of Thrones and Silicon Valley . \nThe duo produced 2014's Kill the Messenger and 2015's The Throwaways , but their highest-profile bet yet is The Founder , about the real-life Ray Kroc and how he wrested control of McDonald's from the brothers who founded the fast food enterprise. That movie, which stars Michael Keaton as Kroc and had a budget of $15 million to $20 million, is getting a one-week awards-qualifying run starting Dec. 7, followed by a wider release Jan. 20 from The Weinstein Co. \n\"Kroc was 52; he had diabetes, thyroid problems, heart problems; he was an alcoholic [when he got involved with the McDonalds],\" says Handfield, who before he obtained the McDonald family life rights was fascinated by the late-blooming businessman. Handfield, a married father of two young children (his wife is actress Tressa DiFiglia), and the single Renner (who has a 3-year-old daughter) spoke with THR in their Culver City loft about their filmmaking style, their TV plans and whether Renner will make another Bourne or Avengers movie. \nAt what point did you start talking about creating a company? \nJEREMY RENNER Around The Hurt Locker Oscar time [in 2010]. It was getting busy for me, and I was working a lot. I felt like, \"Wow, I'd be an asshole to let opportunities slip by because my bandwidth is so limited.\" So we came together. And because we knew each other so well, there was a shorthand. He's a structure guy, and I'm more of the character guy, and I thought we'd be a good team. \nWhy did you call your company The Combine? \nDON HANDFIELD It was two friends coming together. And then I was doing some research and found out that in the 1920s they called the Irish Mafia \"the combine.\" That was cool. \nHow did you obtain rights to the McDonald family? \nHANDFIELD I was Googling, and I found that one of the reasons the McDonald brothers sold [their rights to Kroc] was that they had another idea, like Motel 6 before Motel 6 existed. I read that Dick McDonald had invested in a remote, one-off, tiny motel in Massachusetts. I called and got the night manager. I was like, \"This is kind of a strange request: Does one of the McDonald brothers own this thing?\" And he's like, \"Well, yeah.\" And the grandson of Dick McDonald called me three days later and said, \"We've been waiting 50 years for someone to tell our story, and no one reached out.\" \nWhat was it that made you go with the Weinsteins? \nHANDFIELD When we went in there, they had 30 mock-up posters done of how they'd market the film. \nRENNER As that was happening, [director] David O. Russell called and was saying wonderful things about Harvey because of Silver Linings Playbook and the NFL stuff. [Weinstein accused the NFL Network of \"censorship\" when it dropped an interview with stars Bradley Cooper and Chris Tucker over a character betting on football.] They can navigate those waters of dealing with the McDonald's brand. \nHANDFIELD The great thing about Harvey is, if you're dealing with McDonald's, this major corporation, he's not afraid of that. He would step into that. \nThe film's release has been delayed twice. Have they lived up to their promises? \nHANDFIELD That remains to be seen. There's still time. \nRENNER They had their specific plan of getting it [released] toward the end of August; then I think Harvey had some other thoughts about putting it out in awards-season time. It'll generate noise that way. Good movies rise to the top. \nWhat was your goal in producing? \nRENNER I didn't want to always be — I don't want to say a victim, but reactive to where the movie takes me. I was always on the road, and boy did I go on the road for like five years, and I didn't sleep in my bed for two months of those five years. The idea was, \"Let's work a little smarter and not so hard.\" Because I [don't want to] realize at the end of my life, \"Wow, I haven't had any shared experiences with the people I love.\" \nWhat niche do you want to fill as producers? \nRENNER There's only 12 stories to be told, and we have to find new, interesting worlds to set them in. Slingshot is a great example [ a film Renner and Handfield are developing ]. It's a David and Goliath story set in this rally world. No one in America knows what rally racing is, and it's the third-most-popular sport in the world. \nHANDFIELD We also wanted to fill the gap in the studio pipeline, the $15 million to $35 million features that aren't being made there anymore. \nWhat else are you developing? \nRENNER Half our projects are for me, half are for someone else. We don't want to develop films now, we want to make movies — from the [untitled] Steve McQueen biography to King of Heists , about the biggest bank robbery in American history; and a story about Doc Holliday, whom I find an interesting character. \nYou're moving into television, too. \nHANDFIELD We have a television division and a show in development, Playing With Fire , and have Knightfall , about the Knights Templar, at History channel; we're finishing season one and they're talking about season two. We're going into reality television, too. \nWould you do another Bourne ? \nRENNER I don't get to make those decisions. They were going down some road with [director] Justin Lin, and there was a script they were working on. And then Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass did another one. They can't have two at the same time. Again, these are decisions I don't get to make. Is it a character I love? Yes. \nAre you doing more Avengers ? Will there be a Hawkeye spinoff? \nRENNER I don't really know if there'll be a Hawkeye movie. It's really been fun. We're making Avengers 3 and 4 next year, back-to-back. I haven't seen the scripts. \nThen what will you do to relax? \nRENNER Spend time with my child. Relaxing is not something I do! \nThis story first appeared in the Dec. 16 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. To receive the magazine, click here to subscribe .",

      "text": "\nMichael Keaton ‘s Oscar chances just got ever-so-slightly better. The Weinstein Company has just announced that it will put The Founder into theaters starting today for an awards-qualifying release. Directed by John Lee Hancock , the biopic tells the story of Ray Kroc, the enterprising businessman who turned McDonald’s from a humble local operation into a global billion-dollar empire. Get details on The Founder awards qualifying run, and check out the new The Founder trailer, below. \nThe Weinstein Company has announced that The Founder will kick off a one-week run at the Arclight Hollywood starting today, December 7 . Those in other cities will have to wait a while longer to see it, however, as the national rollout is still planned for January 20, 2017 . Here’s a synopsis:\nTHE FOUNDER, directed by John Lee Hancock (THE BLIND SIDE, SAVING MR. BANKS), features the true story of how Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton), a struggling salesman from Illinois, met Mac and Dick McDonald, who were running a burger operation in 1950s Southern California. Kroc was impressed by the brothers’ speedy system of making the food and saw franchise potential. Writer Robert Siegel (THE WRESTLER) details how Kroc maneuvered himself into a position to be able to pull the company from the brothers and create a billion-dollar empire. The film also stars Laura Dern as Ray Kroc’s first wife Ethel; Linda Cardellini as his second wife Joan Smith; John Carroll Lynch as Mac McDonald and Nick Offerman as Dick McDonald.\nAnd here’s a trailer:\n\nThe Founder has had a weird and winding road to the big screen. Originally, it was scheduled for the awards-friendly date of November 25. However, The Weinstein Company then decided it wanted to put Dev Patel’s Lion in that slot instead, so it moved The Founder to August 5. Then, at the last minute, The Weinstein Company decided a summer debut wasn’t quite right either and postponed The Founder to January 20, 2017. At the time , the word was it’d get a limited release starting around December 16. But we didn’t hear about the film again until today, when The Weinstein Company issued a press release confirming The Founder is in theaters, like, now.\nWhile there could be any number of reasons The Weinstein Company has been so wishy-washy on their release strategy for The Founder , the one they picked does not exactly instill confidence. Maybe they don’t think the movie is good. Maybe they do think it’s good, but don’t think it’ll make money. Or maybe they like The Founder just fine, but have been so busy pushing Lion for awards attention that they forgot they also had The Founder on their to-do list. Who knows.\nFor what it’s worth, early word on the film has been mixed. Variety was a fan, calling it “a glowingly crafted, smartly acted film [that] largely holds the cheese.” The Hollywood Reporter was more conflicted, and didn’t much seem to care for its “wishy-washy” tonal shifts. And ScreenCrush seemed entirely unimpressed, sniffing that the film “offers very few insights, and has no apparent point beyond mythologizing the early days of a company that doesn’t exactly need assistance in the self-mythologizing department.” But I suppose you don’t need us to tell you what everyone else thinks — if you live in LA, you can go out and see for yourself right now.\nThe post ‘The Founder’ Trailer: Michael Keaton’s McDonald’s Biopic Kicks Off Its Awards Qualifying Run Today appeared first on /Film .\n",
