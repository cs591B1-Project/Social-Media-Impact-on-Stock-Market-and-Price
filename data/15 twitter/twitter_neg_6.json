      "text": "By Roshini Rajapakska, MD \nPublished November 19, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print I generally recommend having both, but it comes down to personal preference and your own needs. If you don’t have any major medical problems, you may be OK visiting your ob-gyn as your regular doctor. Any good gyno will be happy to talk to you about overall health. Although ob-gyns give guidance first and foremost on women’s health and issues related to the reproductive organs, plenty offer services outside of that purview (cholesterol screenings, say).\nRELATED:  4 Times Your Vagina Needs to See a Doctor ASAP \nEven so, an annual physical exam by a primary care provider (PCP) will probably cover a lot more ground, including metabolic, respiratory and digestive health, for starters. Also, some gynos may feel more comfortable referring you to another specialist for ailments that a PCP would handle herself. For example, if you have a rash, your ob-gyn may encourage you to get a dermatologist’s opinion, while a PCP may be able to treat it in one stop.\nUltimately, it all depends on the doctor. If you have a great relationship with your gyno and feel she gives you the 360 medical assistance you need, fine. Just alert her that she’s the only doctor you visit routinely. This way, she knows to give you comprehensive checkups or send you to another MD when necessary.\nHealth’ s medical editor, Roshini Rajapaksa, MD, is assistant professor of medicine at the NYU School of Medicine. \nThis article originally appeared on Health.com.",

      "text": "NetherRealm CEO Ed Boon took to Twitter for a fan poll, asking what guest characters fans would like to see most in Injustice 2. In the first survey, specifically for a guest Mortal Kombat character, the choices were Subzero, Johnny Cage, Raiden and Jax. In the second poll, which looked at bringing in a genre guest character, the choices were Buffy, Hellboy, Terminator and Spawn.\nSubzero and Spawn were the clear, runaway favorites, taking 52% and 45% respectively. Coming in second place were Raiden at 20% and Hellboy at 21%.\nOf course, in typical Ed Boon fashion, don't be surprised if ALL of these characters appear as DLC for Injustice 2.\nInjustice 2 is presently scheduled for release in 2017 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. There is also a free-to-play mobile version in development for iOs and Android devices.\nConfirmed characters revealed thus far include Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman, Supergirl, Blue Beetle, Atrocitus, Deadshot Gorilla Grodd and Wonder Woman.\n Tom Taylor, original writer of the Injustice: Gods Among Us tie-in comic books is returning to write another tie-in series for Injustice 2.\nFor more information on Injustice 2, head over to our sister site, GameFragger.com.",

      "text": "Published November 20, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print AP \nBy Joe Bilello - Fox News @Joe_Bilello \nWe must thank the Democrats for constantly reminding us that the historical hate group known as the Ku Klux Klan technically still exists. Otherwise, no one but their 14 members would even know.\nThis week, retiring Nevada Senator Harry Reid claimed that the election of Donald Trump \"has sparked a wave of hate crimes across America.” Reid added, \"Many of our fellow Americans believe that Trump's election validates the kind of bullying, aggressive behavior Trump modeled on a daily basis.” Reid continued with his nonsensical race-baiting gibberish and attempted to link Trump to the apparently-still-in-existence KKK.\nWhen it comes to hate crimes, Harry Reid seems to be using a different standard to determine guilt other than the usual facts and evidence that the rest of us use. The man who once claimed that someone had told him that Mitt Romney didn't pay his taxes is apparently using the same burden of proof to convict Trump supporters of hate crimes. My cousin’s neighbor said that her gay friend was attacked by Trump supporters just for being gay. That's good enough for me. Case closed.\nA female Muslim student at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette claimed that she was assaulted by two men wearing Trump’s “Make America Great Again” hats. Again, that was good enough for many folks, including some in the national media, to convict these hate-filled apparitions. The problem was that no such event ever took place as the young lady later admitted to law enforcement that she made the whole thing up. And her story was not an anomaly.\nThe liberal media and Hollywood elites have already established the utter stupidity of the average Trump voter, right? But did you know that they are so stupid that they typically deck themselves out in full Donald Trump apparel before committing their hate crimes, according to many recent reports. Perhaps, in true \"The Godfather: Part II\" style, they say something like \"Donald Trump says hello\" before brutally attacking their victims. At least the brilliant, highly educated anti-Trump protesters are smart enough to cover their faces with hoods and bandannas as they loot stores, defecate in the street and set cars on fire.\nFake hate crimes have been on the rise for years. But Trump’s election all but guaranteed that we would see an unprecedented level of alleged hate crimes and hate crime hoaxes. The far left has become so emotionally invested in the idea that a Trump presidency would spark an onslaught of hate and violence that they simply cannot let these fears go invalidated. And when there are no actual hate crimes to be found, they must be fabricated.\n(Note to hate crime hoaxters: Be more creative. Use something other than the swastika. It's a dead giveaway that you're a fake.) \nThe fake hate crime has become almost effortless in the age of social media. A simple tweet or Facebook post like \"My friend was beaten by Trump supporters just for being gay\" is enough for some to hand down a conviction in the court of public opinion.\nHarry Reid claims that many Americans feel \"validated\" in hateful actions following the election of Donald Trump.  Democrat Congressman Jared Huffman added to Reid’s insanity by saying, “We must prepare for more of this because the Trump campaign has legitimized and given public space to some shadowy groups that used to hide from public view.”\nBut which of these scenarios is more likely?\n1). Now that Donald Trump is the President-elect, a group of young men feel perfectly comfortable and “legitimized” assaulting and shouting racial epithets at a young Muslim girl with little to no fear of repercussions. They will be praised by the public at large and law enforcement will most likely ignore if not commend their crimes. In the event that they are arrested and convicted, they need only to wait until January 20 when they will most certainly receive a pardon from President Trump?\nOr\n2). A left-wing activist is trying to prove that all the fear mongering surrounding the Trump victory was not unwarranted. They completely fabricated the alleged crime in the hopes of not being caught but in the event that their lies were exposed, they would simply claim that they were trying to \"raise awareness\" about the festering climate of hate and inevitable crimes that are sure to eventually take place?\nThere can be no doubt that a certain amount of misguided individuals genuinely feel some level of fear. There is also no doubt that purveyors of fake hate crimes believe, in their demented minds, that they are somehow helping these individuals. But if individuals are truly afraid of the inevitable hate crime, why exacerbate those fears with hate crime hoaxes? Most likely because, the supposedly inevitable hate crimes never actually happen.\nIt is possible that some guy in Kansas City mumbled a derogatory term to an Arab gas station attendant at some point. That behavior should be condemned by all, but is it a national crisis?\nClick on the links below to find out about some of the hate crime hoaxes that have taken place following election night.\nThe ‘hate-crime’ victims of Trump who weren’t \nThere is no violent hate crime wave in Trump’s America \n7 fake hate crimes that the media blamed on Trump and his supporters",

      "text": "More... People line-up to see the Broadway play “Hamilton,” Saturday Nov. 19, 2016, in New York.   demanded an apology from the cast of the hit musical a day after an actor lectured   Pence about equality, ... more >   Andrew Blake   \nTwitter users propelled “#BoycottHamilton” to the top of the social network’s list of trending topics in the United States on Saturday less than 24 hours after the cast of the Broadway musical addressed   Pence at the end of Friday evening’s performance. \nMr. Pence was in attendance during Friday night’s performance at the Richard Rodgers Theater in Manhattan, and cast members most certainly didn’t let his appearance go unnoticed. “Hamilton” star Brandon Victor Dixon — read a statement directed squarely at the vice-president elect while flanked by colleagues during Friday’s curtain call. \n“Vice President-elect Pence, we welcome you and we truly thank you for joining us at ‘Hamilton: An American Musical,’” Mr. Dixon — who plays Aaron Burr, the U.S. vice president who killed Alexander Hamilton in a pistol duel — said. \n“We are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. We hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us.” \n  responded through his official Twitter account on Saturday morning, and a tweet that condemned the cast of Hamilton as “very rude” was shared more than 28,000 times within six hours of being published. \nMr. Trump was hardly the only social media user unimpressed by the actor’s address, however, evidenced largely by #BoycottHamilton surging to the top of Twitter’s trends list on Saturday. The hashtagged-topic was the hottest item on Twitter for several hours in the U.S. starting shortly after Mr. Trump tweets, and continued to top its trends list well into the afternoon as Trump supporters vowed to protest the smash-hit musical. \n“Mike Pence being harassed is not surprising. Liberals are intolerant. They attack people with different beliefs than them. #BoycottHamilton,” wrote Twitter user Jeremy Nolt, a self-described Trump campaign volunteer with nearly 17,000 followers. \n“#BoycottHamilton is the number one trending thing on Twitter!,” the “Ladies 4 Trump” account tweeted to its 38,000 followers. “This is a big step forward in our fight against entertainment industry!” \n“Free speech. Yes. Lecturing a paying audience. No. #boycottHamiltion,” tweeted Katie Hopkins, a columnist for the U.K.’s Daily Mail newspaper with more than a half-million Twitter followers. \nAs Trump supporters discussed picketing the play, however, others on social media noted that obtaining tickets for the widely successful play was nearly impossible to begin with. \n“#BoycottHamilton? Good luck with that. Tickets are already sold-out past President-elect Troll’s impeachment,” tweeted “Westworld” actor Jeffrey Wright. \n“You know what? I support #BoycottHamilton,” tweeted comedian Patton Oswalt, whose political humor skews leftward. “I hope it intensifies — especially during the first week of March, maybe that Sunday matinee?” \nThe address read aloud to Mr. Pence during Friday evening’s performance was co-written by “Hamilton” star Mr. Dixon, lead producer Jeffrey Sheller, director Thomas Kail and its creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda. \n“We had to ask ourselves, how do we cope with this?” Mr. Seller told the New York Times afterwards. “Our cast could barely go on stage the day after the election. The election was painful and crushing to all of us here. We all struggled with what was the appropriate and respectful and proper response. We are honored that Mr. Pence attended the show, and we had to use this opportunity to express our feelings.”",

      "text": "Published November 19, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print   \nAs U.S.-backed Iraqi forces close in on the Islamic State's hub of Mosul, the leader of the terror network has become so insecure about his own safety that he refuses to emerge from his underground hideouts and never sleeps without his suicide vest on, Reuters reported .\nDUTCH INTELLIGENCE EXPERTS SAY ISIS HAS 60-80 OPERATIVES IN EUROPE \nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi \"has become intemperate,\" losing self-control and showing more signs of paranoia, according to messages sent from inside Mosul to the Iraqi military. Reuters reported Wednesday it had viewed the messages.\nIraqi troops pushed deeper into eastern Mosul Saturday, backed by aerial support from the U.S.-led international coalition -- but faced stiff resistance from ISIS fighters, Maj. Gen. Sami al-Aridi of the Iraqi special forces said.\nSAUDI-LED MILITARY COALITION DECLARES 48-HOUR CEASEFIRE IN YEMEN \nMeanwhile, al-Baghdadi \"has cut down on his movements and neglects his appearance,\" according to the message from the person inside Mosul. \"He lives underground and has tunnels that stretch to different areas. He doesn't sleep without his suicide bomber vest so he can set it off if he's captured.\"\nTwo weeks ago, al-Baghdadi released a new message urging his followers to keep up the fight for Mosul. His rallying cry came in a sermon-like recording, more than half an hour long, distributed by the militant group's al-Furqan media arm. It was not clear when the recording was produced.\nThe city of more than one million people and the surrounding territory fell to ISIS fighters during the militant group's surprise attack in June 2014. Al-Baghdadi visited the city soon after the takeover, and from inside Mosul declared an Islamic caliphate that at one point covered nearly a third of Iraq and Syria.\nIn his recording, al-Baghdadi rallied his fighters — especially in Mosul — and called on them to obey orders while remaining resilient and steadfast.\n\"Oh you who seek martyrdom! Start your actions! Turn the night of the disbelievers into day,\" he says, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. organization that monitors militant activity online, which reported the al-Baghdadi recording first.\n\"Totally decimate their territories, and make their blood flow like rivers,\" al-Baghdadi also says.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Twitter 0 \nIt was speculated that Yamaha will launch the new MT-03 naked streetfighter, based on the R3, in the Indian two wheeler market. It seems like the Japanese automaker is working on an all-new entry level quarter-litre motorcycle. A new Yamaha motorcycle has been spotted testing in India, which looks different than the MT-03 or MT-15. The spotted model could be the next Yamaha FZ 250 or 200, which is likely to be positioned below the Yamaha R3. Read More – Yamaha MT-03 Launching Next Year \nGoing by the pictures, it is visible that the spotted vehicle features an air and oil cooled single-cylinder engine. This indicates that the bike could get a 250cc or 200cc motor. The bike also shares its underpinnings with the Fazer 250, which is currently on sale in the Brazilian market. This bike is expected to be developed in India with inputs from the Japanese R&D team. Yamaha India could also export this bike to other growing nations. Yamaha FZ 250 Engine Specifications \nThe naked streetfighter is likely to get the same 249cc oil-cooled, single-cylinder, fuel-injected engine that also powers the Brazilian-spec Fazer 250. However, this engine could be re-tuned to offer more power and torque. When powers Fazer, the 249cc engine churns out a maximum power output of 20.7PS at 8,000rpm and 20.4Nm of torque at 6,500rpm. Power is transmitted to the rear wheels of the bike via a 5-speed gearbox. The India-spec model could get a 6-speed unit. This motor is BSIV ready, which will allow Yamaha to price it aggressively. Read More – Yamaha R15 V3.0 Will Be More Powerful \nThe bike is expected to be based on the double cradle chassis. Suspension mechanism of the motorcycle comprises of Telescopic forks upfront and swingarm type monoshock with link at the rear. The spotted model also gets disc brakes at both ends, but it misses out on ABS system. Yamaha FZ 250 Launch Date \nThe bike is currently in testing phase, and it would take around 1 year to actually come in production form. We expect the new FZ 250 motorcycle to come India in the second half of 2017. We will update you as soon as Yamaha make any comment on the same. Yamaha FZ 250 Price In India \nThe quarter-litre motorcycle will be locally developed in India. To be positioned above Yamaha R15, the new bike is expected to be priced in the range of Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 1.7 lakh. Yamaha FZ 250 Design \nThe naked motorcycle will be based on a diamond-type frame. It looks like a more evolved current FZ, sharing features from the bigger FZ or MT series features. This model gets all the street bike credentials, featuring upright riding position with small rear foot pegs and single piece handlebar. The design is heavily inspired from the FZ-S and the M-Slaz. Upfront is a compact fairing and new LED headlamps sourced from the M-Slaz. The sculpted fuel tank features large extensions that gives it muscularity and aggressively look. Other features include LED tail-lamp, split seats and stubby exhaust that is covered with silver-finished plastic casing. Yamaha FZ 250 Spy Images Suspension and Braking \nThe suspension mechanism of the bike comprises of 41mm telescopic forks upfront and a monoshock at the rear. For braking, the bike gets all disc brake units. The spotted model misses out on ABS (Anti-Lock Braking System). Yamaha FZ 250 Competition \nThe new 250cc naked streetfighter will rival against the KTM Duke 200, Mahindra Mojo, Bajaj Dominar 400 and Honda CBR 250R.",

      "text": "By Cameron DaSilva \nPublished November 20, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print ALLEN PARK, MI - AUGUST 8: DeAndre Levy #54 of the Detroit Lions watches the action during training camp on August 8, 2015 at the Detroit Lions Training Center in Allen Park, Michigan. (Photo by Leon Halip/Getty Images) \nLast week, Detroit Lions linebacker DeAndre Levy revealed that his proudest moment in college was breaking the leg of \"dirtbag\" Joe Paterno . His comments on the late Penn State head coach obviously stemmed from the sexual assault scandal at the university involving Jerry Sandusky, which Paterno said he wasn't aware of.\nLevy's declaration made its rounds on the web as many were taken aback by it, but he expanded on his stance a few days later. In a piece for the Detroit Free Press , which he does regularly, Levy wrote about why he deemed Paterno a \"dirtbag,\" and his thoughts on how sports are prioritized over humanity.\nHere's part of what Levy said:\nMore from FoxSports South Carolina State football team uses 55-year-old running back Joe Thomas Sr. T.J. Watt channels his brother J.J. with this pick-6 FOX Sports Florida Midday Minute 'Plus': Bucs, Jags, Dolphins hit the road Marc Marian is owning Friday | PROCAST I hope me speaking in jest about my \"proudest moment\" doesn't distract from the serious sentiment. Any person or institution, Joe Paterno included, that turns away from or fails to act against sexual assault is a \"dirtbag.\" \nLevy continues to explain his point by putting the Penn State scandal into perspective, making it more personal to readers. He asks them to imagine if it was their \"son, nephew, cousin or young male\" taken advantage of at a football camp, only to have the story break years later.\nLevy added:\nIf you're aware of sexual violence and don't use the full strength of your power to stop it, you're just as complicit and responsible. We have to stop prioritizing sport over humanity and the worse things a person can do, including failing to disrupt DECADES of sexual violence. \nYou can read Levy's full piece for the Detroit Free Press here .",

      "title": "Twitter Runs Neo-Nazi Ad Hours After Outlining Steps To Limit Abuse",
      "text": "On Tuesday morning, Twitter published a blog post outlining new steps aimed at curbing the spike in abusive tweets and Twitter accounts that have plagued the site in recent years, particularly during an election cycle that produced a surge in white supremacist and so-called alt-right accounts.\nTwitter has been criticized for taking a passive stance on the issue. But the new steps announced Tuesday, combined with the site’s move to suspend several accounts of high-profile alt-right users, seemed to mark a step toward greater censorship of the extremist accounts.\nTwitter’s plan to limit abusive and hateful content includes an updated policy that allows users to report such content even if it targets other users. It also plans to expand the “mute” feature – which allows users to remove an account’s tweets from their timeline without blocking the account – to include keywords, phrases and conversations.\nAds By Artscroll: But, as Twitter acknowledged on its blog, the new steps will not “suddenly remove abusive conduct from Twitter.” In fact, about 12 hours after Twitter published the announcement, Los-Angeles based writer and musician Ariana Lenarsky posted a screenshot of an ad on her timeline promoted by the now-suspended account @NEW_ORDER_1488, which represents a neo-Nazi website called The New Order.\nThe ad links to an article on The New Order’s website titled “The United States Was Founded as a White People’s Republic,” followed by the hashtag #WhiteAmerica. The website’s homepage, adorned at the top by a Nazi swastika, advocates for a “rebirth of racial idealism and reverence for the eternal laws of Nature.” The article promoted in the Twitter ad has been deleted from the website.\nThe promotion violated Twitter’s ad policy, which “prohibits the promotion of hate content, sensitive topics, and violence globally.” Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey acknowledged the mistake and apologized in a tweet Thursday. He said Twitter’s “automated system” allowed the ad to go through, notifying users the ad has been “fixed,” tweeting: We made a mistake here and we apologize. Our automated system allowed an ad promoting hate. Against our policy. We did a retro and fixed! https://t.co/7gvycmzpsm\nTwitter could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe social media company has searched for options to combat its declining stock prices and sluggish user growth, but investors, including Disney, have expressed skepticism that has been linked to Twitter’s lenient approach to abuse and harassment.\nLenarsky responded to Dorsey’s apology on Thursday, calling for people to continue holding Twitter accountable for filtering its promotions, tweeting: Acknowledgement from @jack & @twitter is great, but it really isn’t over. We must continue to hold feet to the fire on this stuff (Nazis).\n(c) 2016, The Washington Post · Jasper Scherer\n ",

      "title": "Twitter adds new ways to curb abuse",
      "text": "Twitter adds new ways to curb abuse Katie Benner, Nov 21, 2016, International New York Times Social media companies are under increasing scrutiny for the amount of hate speech that thrives on their platforms, especially since the presidential election.\nNow, Twitter has unveiled several new measures to curb the online abuse, although the changes are unlikely to be far-reaching enough to quiet the company’s critics.\nRecently, Twitter said it was making it easier for its users to hide content they do not wish to see on the service and to report abusive posts, even when those messages are directed at other users. The company has given its support teams training to better identify mistreatment on Twitter.\n“There’s a fine line between free expression and abuse, and this launch is another step on the path toward getting rid of abuse,” said Del Harvey, Twitter’s vice president of trust and security. “We’ve been launching new products to address this, and the cadence of product releases is picking up. We have a lot planned on this path.”\nOnline harassment and hate speech have long festered on Twitter, but the incidents appeared to rise during the presidential campaign. Exchanges between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton grew personal and acrimonious.\nTwitter has not had a comprehensive response for dealing with hate speech, largely because the company did not want to limit freedom of expression on the service. But over time, Twitter has rolled out measures to tackle the problem. It has let people mute the accounts of other users, effectively making their content disappear from view. Last year, it issued an explicit prohibition against hateful conduct.\nThe company is now taking more action. It is letting people more specifically block out what they do not want to see on the service, including muting words, phrases and even entire conversations.\nTwitter is also making it easier for people to report abusive behaviour, even if they are only bystanders to the abuse, and for the company to evaluate those reports.\nAnd it has overhauled its approach to training support teams, holding special sessions on cultural and historical context for hateful conduct.\nCritics said that while the steps are positive, they will not eliminate hate speech.\nTwitter’s changes “don’t stop the problem of posting abusive content,” said Mark S Luckie, a former Twitter manager. Part of the reason abuse has thrived on Twitter is because the company allows anonymity, Luckie said.\n“But unlike other sites with anonymity, Twitter lets users broadcast to the world — so their abuse has a huge potential impact,” he said. “If you fight with a celebrity and the celebrity fights back, then you have potentially reached a global audience with your abuse.”\nHarvey acknowledged that Twitter has not always moved fast enough to clamp down on abusive behaviour.\nShe said that the problem would probably never be entirely solved, but that the company was doing more to identify repeat offenders who create new accounts when Twitter shuts them down or who incite users to gang up on others.",

      "text": "Pin it Share President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter this weekend to slam the wildly popular Broadway musical, Hamilton, but vice president-elect Mike Pence didn't seem to share the same sentiment. Pence attended a performance of the Tony-award winning production on Friday night, where he was called out by Brandon V. Dixon -- who portrays America's first treasury secretary and the third vice president, Alexander Hamilton -- at the end of the show in a statement that was written by the cast and the show's creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and producer Jeffrey Seller, according to Broadway.com. \"We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,\" Dixon declared after thanking the vice president-elect for attending. \"We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.\" WATCH: Megyn Kelly Says Daughter Was 'Afraid of Donald Trump,' Recalls 'Security Issues' \"I really enjoyed watching Hamilton ,\" Pence told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace during a pre-taped appearance. \"It was a real joy to be there. I heard a few boos. I wasn't offended by what was said.\" Trump, however, responded differently to the statement and expressed his disapproval on Twitter. \"Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton , cameras blazing,\" he tweeted on Saturday morning. \"This should not happen!\" WATCH: President Obama Talks to Daughters Sasha and Malia About Trump -- 'Fight for Treating People With Kindness' \"The theater must always be a safe and special place,\" he continued in another post. \"The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\" The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 Trump also tweeted out his disapproval of Alec Baldwin making his return to Saturday Night Live to portray the president-elect. This was Baldwin's first time impersonating Trump since he beat Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. \"I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night,\" Trump tweeted in response to the episode. \"It is a totally one-sided, biased show -- nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?\" I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 Baldwin quickly responded to Trump's post with a series of tweets. \"Equal time? Election is over. There is no more equal time. Now you try to be Pres + people respond. That's pretty much it,\" the 56-year-old actor wrote. \"You know what I would do if I were Prez? I'd be focused on how to improve the lives of AS MANY AMERICANS AS POSSIBLE.\" WATCH: Wait, Is Kanye West REALLY a Donald Trump Supporter? -- See the Rapper's Democratic Campaign Contributions \"I'd be focused on improving our reputation abroad, including actually fighting for freedom and not just oil,\" he added. \"I would make every effort to retrain Americans so to create jobs. One way you make America great again is to put it back to work. ...I would make appointments that encouraged people, not generate fear and doubt.\" Baldwin concluded his Twitter rant: \"@realDonaldTrump, I could go on. You want more advice, call me. I'll be at SNL .\" Related Articles",

The Grand Tour did not disappoint! — Ella (@ella_nappin) November 18, 2016 ...other people were. Very disappointed with The Grand Tour. Nice production but apart from a few swipes at the BBC and a nice intro it was note for note Top Gear — Nicky Milburn (@NickyMilburn) November 18, 2016 Some people thought it sold Amazon Prime all by itself... The Grand Tour is a whole reason in itself to subscribe to Amazon Prime. It's great to see the old Top Gear crew together again. — Alex Hammond (@alexshammond) November 18, 2016 ...others didn't. — #ClemFandango (@youngin_uk) November 18, 2016 Some lol-ed... The Grand Tour is awesome. I had a really hard LOL at the dead celebrities bit... I missed those guys so much. — Ryan Comerford (@Ryan_Comerford) November 18, 2016 ...others went on about steroids... The grand tour is like top gear on steroids, @BBC_TopGear you might as well go home and give up ...and most agreed it was better than Top Gear. The #grandtour was pretty great for the first episode better than the reboot of top gear — george wills (@gwillscobax) November 18, 2016 This guy isn't sold. Hi @twitter . Please stop serving me ads for The Grand Tour. I'm not going to watch that shit. — Mark Emlyn Evans (@marcooth) November 18, 2016 Meanwhile certain celebrities gave their unbiased opinion... Er, there seems to be some sort of car show already on Amazon. And it's not bad. — Richard Hammond (@RichardHammond) November 17, 2016 ...but some had found a better option Great news.

According to IE, the AAP’s social media team released the official statistics on Sunday and claimed that a large part of the public reciprocated Kejriwal’s sentiments regarding the opposition of demonetisation. \nThe statement says that at least 50 lakh people had viewed the Delhi CM’s assembly speech on demonetisation on various social media websites. The statement also reads that AAP’s Facebook page saw a massive growth of about 640 percent in the week following the announcement of the demonetisation policy. Almost half a crore have watched the November 15 speech, the statement added. \nKejriwal’s assembly speech has garnered over 48,02,000 views and 1,72,128 shares on AAP’s Facebook pages.

      "text": "Trump continues Twitter rant against 'Hamilton' cast \nby: Michelle Ewing, Cox Media Group National Content Desk Updated: Nov 20, 2016 - 12:46 AM (Hamilton LLC via AP) \nNEW YORK - The \"Hamilton\" drama continues ... \nThe day after President-elect Donald Trump slammed the cast of the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\" for addressing Vice President-elect Mike Pence after Friday's show, Trump returned to Twitter to insult the show and call for an apology. \n\"The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior,\" he wrote early Sunday. \n>> See the tweet here \nThe cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 \n\nThe tweet came less than 12 hours after he took another shot at the actors. \n\"Very rude and insulting of Hamilton cast member to treat our great future V.P. Mike Pence to a theater lecture,\" Trump tweeted Saturday evening. \"Couldn't even memorize lines!\" \nThe post was quickly deleted, but not before someone captured a screenshot of the tweet. \n>> See the tweet here \nTrump posted this 3rd tweet attacking \"Hamilton,\" then deleted it fast. Rare move by him. Spokeswoman not saying why. pic.twitter.com/qfXODdakPu — Patrick Healy (@patrickhealynyt) November 20, 2016 \n\nThe controversy erupted Friday evening when Pence attended the show and was booed by some audience members. After the performance, actor Brandon Dixon addressed Pence from the stage . \n\"You know, we have a guest in the audience this evening. Vice President-elect Pence, I see you walking out, but I hope you hear just a few more moments. There's nothing to boo, ladies and gentlemen. There's nothing to boo. We're all here sharing a story of love. We have a message for you, sir; we hope that you will hear us out. And I encourage everybody to pull out your phones and tweet and post because this message needs to be spread far and wide,\" Dixon began . \n\"Vice President-elect Pence, we welcome you and we truly thank you for joining us here at 'Hamilton: An American Musical.' We really do. We, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us. All of us,\" he continued. \n\"Thank you truly for seeing this show, this wonderful American story told by a diverse group of men, women of different colors, creeds and orientations.\" ",

      "text": "Published November 21, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print   \nA Washington woman kidnapped from her home Friday and held for ransom was found dead Sunday, Q13Fox reported.\nThe body of Sandra Harris, 69, was found Sunday morning by a motorist who called 911.\nHarris was taken from her Kennewick residence by someone she knew, Kennewick Police Sgt. Ken Lattin said.\n\"This was not a random act,\" Lattin said regarding the abduction. \"They're not related. We're not exactly sure what the nature of the relationship was, but this was not random.\"\nLocal and federal law enforcement agencies contacted a kidnapper and negotiated for several hours, ultimately agreeing to pay the ransom.\nAuthorities made the money exchange just before 10 p.m. Friday near the town of Eltopia, and shortly after they arrested a suspect: 49-year-old Theresa Wiltse of Connell, Wash.\nWiltse is being held without bond. It was not immediately clear if she had retained an attorney.\n\"There's possibly another suspect or suspects involved, or it's possible she acted alone,\" Lattin said.\nAbductions for ransom are rare in the United States.            \n\"They are unusual for us here as well,\" Lattin said. \"I've been here 28 years, our chief has been here 35 years plus, and that's not something that has happened during our lifetime here in Kennewick.\"\nAnyone with information related to this case in encouraged to contact the Kennewick Police Department at (509) 628-0333 or Crime Stoppers at (509) 586-8477.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Axl Rose Criticizes Trump on Twitter posted by Dave Basner - share \nDon't expect Axl Rose to perform at President-elect Donald Trump 's inauguration. The Guns N' Roses singer took to Twitter to lash out at Trump for claiming the cast of Broadway's Hamilton gave Vice President-elect Mike Pence a hard time when he went to see the show. { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"artist\", \"id\" : 39143, \"name\" : \"Guns N' Roses\" } } \nAfter Friday's performance, the actors of Hamilton thanked Pence for coming and appealed to him to work on behalf of all Americans. On Saturday, Trump demanded an apology from the cast for harassing their future VP: Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016 The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016 The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 \nAxl wasn't having any of it and essentially told Trump to suck it up: \"Hamilton Cast harassed Pence.\" Do u ever stop whining?An apology?Seriously?!U won,this is the job,get on with it or get out of the kitchen. — Axl Rose (@axlrose) November 19, 2016 \nThe rocker has been pretty vocal politically lately, and on Friday discouraged politicians from allowing Senator Jeff Sessions to become Attorney General: Good people don't listen to, acknowledge, nominate or elect people like Senator Jeff Sessions. — Axl Rose (@axlrose) November 18, 2016 \nClearly Axl is able to stay up to date on the news as GN'R tour in South America. Get all their dates here . \nPhoto Credit: Getty",

Marconi was the first of four police officers in three states shot during a seemingly unconnected Sunday spree.\nThree of the incidents appeared to be targeted attacks and involved law enforcement officers sitting unsuspectingly in their patrol cars, either waiting in traffic or after pulling vehicles over for traffic stops.\n\"I think the uniform was the target and the first person who happened along was the person he targeted,\" San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said on Monday of the Texas case.\nA GLANCE AT POLICE AMBUSH KILLINGS IN THE US Police in that investigation are searching for a 2009-2012 black Mitsubishi Galant with black rims that was believed to be driven by the suspected gunman.\nEarlier Monday, San Antonio authorities released video surveillance footage showing the man outside police headquarters. He is seen speaking to a clerk on an intercom before being let in to a vestibule. But the man only stayed a short time before leaving. McManus wouldn't detail what the suspect said, only that he asked a question.\nRead the full story at FoxNews.com→",

      "text": "14 \nOne day after Trump took to Twitter to grouse that Saturday Night Live was making fun of him and ask whether he'd be getting \"equal time,\" an off-the-record meeting is being held in Trump Tower. Executives and anchors from the country's five biggest television networks are set to meet with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower on Monday afternoon. \nThe meeting was organized by Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who is now a senior adviser to Trump. \nSince the meeting is off the record we won't have a clue as to why the networks were summoned. It may be to read them the riot act for treating him poorly. It may be to lay down the law going forward—what things the networks must do to gain access, and what things they must not. It may be a friendly get-together to get to know the neighborhood fake news promoter, Steve Bannon. It may be to go down the list of dos and do nots when it comes to photographing the new president's hairpiece. \nThis meeting is notable, as President-elect Trump hasn't held even a single news conference to answer press questions—another break with precedent—and there's, well, questions as to whether he will be adhering to any of the other conventions we expect of our presidents. There are many looming questions about whether Trump will provide the same levels of press access that past presidents have permitted, like a traveling \"press pool\" and regular news conferences. \nWell sure. Part of being a self-declared super genius is deciding that the ethical conventions meant to provide at least some small measure of accountability and transparency to the public are no longer needed for you , because the public only needs to know what you tell them they need to know. \nThis will be interesting, and at least one test of how beholden the networks are to upholding Trump's new order as opposed to their own journalistic conventions. Let’s see how long it will take for the contents of this meeting to leak out.",

      "text": "Three weeks ago, Twitter abruptly announced it would shut down Vine, the 6-second video looping platform it acquired for $30 million in 2012. Avid users were dismayed , a Vine cofounder tweeted his regret at selling to Twitter , and 350 Twitter employees (or 9% of its staff) lost their jobs. Then last week, in a new wrinkle, TechCrunch reported that Twitter is in talks to sell Vine, writing that, “Mourning for Vine from the internet community boosted the interest of potential acquirers.”\nBut if there are interested buyers now (including, embarrassingly for Twitter, an offer from the porn site Pornhub ), might Twitter have been able to sell it before, rather than announce it would just kill it? Did it try to find a buyer first? How did Twitter botch the handling of Vine so badly?\nCommentary from three Vine insiders, speaking to Yahoo Finance on condition of anonymity, helps explain what went wrong.\nTwitter wanted Vine to be for art, not comedy Two former Vine employees, as well as a Vine power-user who was feted by Twitter executives and flown to events, all say they were not surprised that Twitter would shut Vine. What surprised them was how abruptly Twitter announced the closure.\nThe lack of warning was, “really inconsistent with Twitter’s whole mantra of respecting the user’s voice and the user’s content,” one of the former employees says.\nThe larger problem, it appears, was how Twitter executives, and even the founders of Vine themselves, viewed Vine’s potential. “I think it started with the founders—their vision was art, but it became personal and entertainment, and it was an uphill battle to fight for the creators and the comedians,” says the same employee. “You definitely didn’t feel a lot of support from above in that direction.”\nAnother former employee concurs, “As much as Twitter and Vine maybe wanted to have an artistic application, it didn’t go that way.”\nIndeed, when Vine first launched in January 2013, the Vine videos most frequently featured as “Editor’s Picks” were artistic visual creations from users like Noah Kalina, a Brooklyn-based photographer who became famous back in 2006 for taking a photo of himself every day for six years. (Kalina’s video, “ Everyday ,” has 27 million views.) In 2014, BuzzFeed wrote that Kalina’s Vines are “surreal works of art,” and NPR highlighted 10 “New York Vine-ographers you should follow,” including Kalina and other artists. NPR quoted Vine cofounder Collin Kroll saying one of the most exciting aspects of Vine was “people that modify their phones to get shots in a certain way, so you see the lens and the tripods.” Art was the name of the game.\nBut soon enough, humor, performance, and personality became the point of Vine, though there were still people using it differently. The users that became most popular, “Vine stars” like King Bach, Lele Pons, and Logan Paul were not attempting to use Vine as a medium for unique camera angles or special effects. They were posting scripted, 6-second comedy skits.\nIt helped them amass millions of followers and earn hundreds of thousands of dollars for sponsored posts in which they plug a brand. But it wasn’t what Twitter wanted. And while it was making money for those stars, it wasn’t helping to make money for Twitter. Last year, Twitter acquired Niche , a tool that connects social media creators with brands, but that reportedly did not go far in monetizing Vine.\nthe money to be made off brands for a single Snapchat story or single Instagram post is nuts. check this chart out: pic.twitter.com/DcVDFILLNK \n— Sapna Maheshwari (@sapna) August 30, 2016 \n\n\nIt didn’t improve matters when Instagram added video (at first, in 15-second length only) in June 2013. “If you look at early Vines, half of them were stop-motion art, and the other half were just your friends, like, making coffee,” says an avid Vine user who built a following in the hundreds of thousands. “It was before Instagram video, so people just used it as an Instagram for video. That use case died when Instagram added video.” Instead, the comedy skit use case flourished.\nTwitter left Vine to operate on its own When Twitter acquires a company, former and current employees say, it is not always consistent in how deeply it absorbs the acquired team into the existing Twitter team. “Often they inject them into the company and try to contextualize them,” says a former employee, “but for a select few, and it’s seen as a special circumstance, they let them exist on their own, and operate independently. They don’t impede. And that can be really positive or really negative.”\nWith Vine, Twitter management left it alone. “Especially when Dick [Costolo] was CEO,” the former employee says, “it was like, you guys do what you want, we will do what we want.” That hands-off approach did nothing to monetize Vine, and it didn’t help it grow any faster (it reportedly has 200 million monthly active users).\nLast fall, Mic.com reports , 20 of Vine’s top stars met with Vine executives in Los Angeles. The star wanted to be paid more than $1 million each to commit to posting a set number of videos per month on the platform, keeping it thriving. Vine balked, according to the story.\nI sat with those execs a year ago and told em to shape up…they didn't listen. Now everybody wants an interview? #RIPVine \n— DeStorm Power (@DeStorm) October 27, 2016 \n\n\nMic.com quotes some Vine stars as saying that meeting was the beginning of the end. But it wasn’t yet the definitive end, because this year, in January, Vine again flew a handful of creators to Europe, where they worked on an original series. Soon after, Vine shut the series project down. “And they were not kind about it,” says the former Vine creator. “They pulled the plug on all promotion of creators, had no interest in creators. They would talk about how, ‘We want to empower everybody to create beautiful videos.’ They still didn’t get it.”\nTwitter is not commenting on reports of a possible sale, and had no new comment for this story beyond reiterating that, as it said when it first announced it would shut down Vine , “We’ll be keeping the website online because we think it’s important to still be able to watch all the incredible Vines that have been made.”\nA person close to the company says that Twitter will soon offer an easy way to download Vine videos from the Vine web site, though that is not yet available. If Twitter sells Vine, it likely won’t need to worry about that.\nVine evolved naturally, like a living, breathing thing, and became an especially popular outlet for sports clips . But Twitter was never quite able to figure out its best identity. Shutting it down was an utter PR fail, and if it sells Vine to a new buyer that does successfully grow and monetize it, that could be an even worse bit of optics for Twitter management.\n—\nDaniel Roberts is a writer at Yahoo Finance, covering sports business and technology.

Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton , cameras blazing,\" he tweeted on Saturday morning. \"This should not happen!\"\nWATCH: President Obama Talks to Daughters Sasha and Malia About Trump -- 'Fight for Treating People With Kindness'\n\"The theater must always be a safe and special place,\" he continued in another post. \"The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\"\nThe cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 Trump also tweeted out his disapproval of Alec Baldwin making his return to Saturday Night Live to portray the president-elect. This was Baldwin's first time impersonating Trump since he beat Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.\n\"I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night,\" Trump tweeted in response to the episode. \"It is a totally one-sided, biased show -- nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?\"\nI watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 Baldwin quickly responded to Trump's post with a series of tweets. \"Equal time? Election is over. There is no more equal time. Now you try to be Pres + people respond. That's pretty much it,\" the 56-year-old actor wrote. \"You know what I would do if I were Prez? I'd be focused on how to improve the lives of AS MANY AMERICANS AS POSSIBLE.\"\nWATCH: Wait, Is Kanye West REALLY a Donald Trump Supporter? -- See the Rapper's Democratic Campaign Contributions\n\"I'd be focused on improving our reputation abroad, including actually fighting for freedom and not just oil,\" he added. \"I would make every effort to retrain Americans so to create jobs. One way you make America great again is to put it back to work. ...I would make appointments that encouraged people, not generate fear and doubt.\"\nBaldwin concluded his Twitter rant: \"@realDonaldTrump, I could go on. You want more advice, call me. I'll be at SNL .\"\nRelated Articles\nAriel Winter Snaps Sexy Swimsuit Selfie Jenna Dewan Tatum Shows Off Toned Abs Kendall Jenner Stuns in Lace-up Catsuit",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump has taken to Twitter once again to slam “ Saturday Night Live ,” calling the NBC show “one-sided” and “biased.”\n“I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show – nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?” Trump wrote in an early Sunday tweet, just hours after this week’s show, which had Alec Baldwin reviving his Trump impression in a sketch that painted the president-elect as completely unprepared for the Oval Office.\nBaldwin replied in a series of tweets on Sunday morning, writing, “Equal time? Election is over. There is no more equal time. Now u try 2 b Pres + ppl respond. That’s pretty much it.”\n“You know what I would do if I were Prez?” he continued. “I’d be focused on how to improve the lives of AS MANY AMERICANS AS POSSIBLE … I’d be focused on improving our reputation abroad, including actually fighting for freedom and not just oil.”\n“I would make appointments that encouraged people, not generate fear and doubt,” Baldwin concluded. “I could go on. You want more advice, call me. I’ll be at SNL.”\nIt’s far from the first time Trump has taken aim at “SNL.” He has also slammed Baldwin in particular, whose impression of him gained popularity in the run-up to the Nov. 8 election.\nBaldwin has publicly spoken against Trump before, and supported Hillary Clinton ahead of the election. The Twitter feud comes just one day after Trump demanded on the social media platform that the cast of “Hamilton” apologize to Vice President-elect Mike Pence for one of the cast’s actors giving him a speech at Friday night’s show.\n… @realDonaldTrump\nEqual time?\nElection is over.

      "text": "0 \nA Twitter account presumably designed to name and shame people who contributed to Donald Trump’s campaign has spectacularly backfired. \nRather than making the donors look stupid, the account, which is a bot that tweets names of contributors from the Federal Election Commission, showed how diverse Trump supporters are. \nThere were professionals, and blue-collar workers, men and women, and they were from all over America. \nIt showed the diversity the Democrats keep saying they want.

Since this galaxy is so faint and yet was still discovered, that may mean there are many more out there yet to be glimpsed.\nFOUND: DRAGONFLY 44, A STRANGE GALAXY MADE MOSTLY OF DARK MATTER \n“This discovery implies hundreds of faint dwarf satellites waiting to be discovered in the halo of the Milky Way,” Masashi Chiba, a professor at the Astronomical Institute of Tohoku University in Japan, said in a statement . “How many satellites are indeed there and what properties they have, will give us an important clue of understanding how the Milky Way formed and how dark matter contributed to it.”\nAmong the Milky Way's other satellite galaxies are the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, with the former being about 163,000 light years away. \nThe discovery of Virgo 1 is reported in a new study in The Astrophysical Journal.",

(AP) The Minnesota Vikings have waived running back Ronnie Hillman and promoted rookie defensive end Stephen Weatherly from the practice squad to fill the roster spot.\nThe Vikings made the move on Monday after Hillman carried the ball twice for a total of 9 yards in a 30-24 victory over Arizona.\nHillman, a member of Denver's Super Bowl-winning team last season, was used sparingly in the eight games he spent with Minnesota after star Adrian Peterson was placed on injured reserve. Hillman rushed 18 times for 50 yards and caught four passes for 43 yards, behind Jerick McKinnon and Matt Asiata for playing time.\nMore from FoxSports Giants are on a roll, but still taking it one game at a time The Green Bay Packers are popular, but are they actually an elite NFL franchise? | THE HERD Dak Prescott impressed Colin Cowhed by picking up after himself - find out why | THE HERD Shannon Sharpe does not hold back talking about Packers QB Aaron Rodgers | UNDISPUTED The Vikings are last in the NFL in rushing.\nWeatherly was a seventh-round draft pick out of Vanderbilt.\n---\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL",

Major League Baseball opened an investigation late last week and the players were placed on administrative leave under its minor league domestic violence policy. \nThe players involved are members of the Rangers' Dominican Summer League team, which consists of prospects who are just getting their start in professional baseball.\nClick for more from FoxSports.com.",

      "text": "Published November 21, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. -- Just last season, Minnesota Vikings coaches gave Xavier Rhodes boxing gloves to wear during drills in practice.\nThe idea was having Rhodes better learn how to effectively play cornerback without risking penalties for grabbing at the receiver.\nOpponents aren't winning many rounds with Rhodes these days.\nMore from FoxSports Dak on what record win streak means to Cowboys Giants are on a roll but are still taking it one game at a time Whitlock 1-on-1: Mike Pereira explains missed NFL extra points | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Denver Broncos, Houston Texans best fit Tony Romo for 2017 season | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Rhodes picked off Carson Palmer twice, including a 100-yard touchdown return that was the longest in team history, and helped lead the Vikings to a 30-24 victory over Arizona on Sunday that stopped their four-game losing streak. The fourth-year player, drafted by the Vikings in the first round out of Florida State with the selection they received from Seattle in the trade for wide receiver Percy Harvin, is tied for fourth in the NFL with four interceptions.\n\"Those are huge splash plays that everybody notices, but he's tackling, doing everything right,\" free safety Harrison Smith said. \"He's playing lights out.\"\nThe performance was prolific enough to trigger an NFL Network interview with Deion Sanders , the Pro Football Hall of Fame member and most famous of the many cornerbacks Florida State has produced. Sanders, who became well known for his flamboyance, teased Rhodes for not adding any flair to the end of his return.\nThough he plays with plenty of fire, Rhodes isn't much for show. He was too exhausted for a celebration by the time he reached the end zone for the first time since high school, so much so that he requested an oxygen mask on the sideline to help recover.\n\"My legs were dead,\" Rhodes said, \"and I was just tired.\"\nThe receivers Rhodes has been covering lately have been worn out, too, from Kelvin Benjamin to Odell Beckham Jr. to DeAndre Hopkins. Palmer threw in his direction nine times, with three completions for a total of 19 yards.\n\"This week coach said to play our defense, be aggressive and go out there and tackle. Tight coverage, sack the quarterback, and this week we did all of that,\" Rhodes said. \"We accomplished all of our goals.\"\nIncluding, most importantly, victory. The defense didn't escape blame for the losing streak, with one issue an overzealous attempt to produce the kind of momentum-changing plays that Rhodes had on Sunday. The problem is when players chase them, usually out of desperation to boost a struggling team, other issues often arise.\nRhodes and Smith, for example, each whiffed in overtime two weeks ago when they converged on Detroit wide receiver Golden Tate after a catch that he took into the end zone to win the game.\n\"We are all trying to make plays,\" Rhodes said. \"You just need to be disciplined.\"\nThat's just as important as aggression for a cornerback in this league, as Zimmer has long reminded his pupils. Zimmer, who coached Sanders for five seasons as the defensive backs coach in Dallas, has developed an affinity for Rhodes since taking the job three years ago.\n\"If we would just play a solid, fundamental football game and let the big plays come to us, they do,\" Zimmer said, adding: \"They're not always going to come, but you just have to do your job first and then the rest will happen.\"\nJust like that interception late in the second quarter with the Vikings clinging to a 13-10 lead and the Cardinals at third-and-goal at the 9. Palmer argued that cornerback Captain Munnerlyn held the intended target, John Brown, before Rhodes swooped in from behind.\n\"I'm a competitive guy and he said he felt like his receiver was held on that play. I didn't think so at all. I'm entitled to my space, and my space is on the field. He ran directly into me, so I jammed him up. I didn't grab. I didn't yank. I let him go. Ball's in the air,\" Munnerlyn said. \"Xavier, I don't know where he came from, but he made the play and took it 100 yards.\"",

      "text": "Published November 21, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print CLEVELAND (AP) Hue Jackson has run out of pep talks. At this point, there's only so much he can do to stop this dismal season from an even deeper descent.\nThe Browns' record is one thing.\nJackson can't lose his locker room, too.\nMore from FoxSports Dak on what record win streak means to Cowboys Giants are on a roll but are still taking it one game at a time Whitlock 1-on-1: Mike Pereira explains missed NFL extra points | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Denver Broncos, Houston Texans best fit Tony Romo for 2017 season | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF As his team recovered from a 24-9 pasting from Pittsburgh, a loss that dropped Cleveland to 0-11 in 2016 and below .500 overall for the first time in 66 years, the Browns coach said it's vital over the next five games for his frustrated players to keep fighting - together.\n''I understand how people feel about us right now,'' Jackson said Monday.\n''This team is going to continue to work hard. We are going to continue to stick together because we know that is the only way success will come. We have to continue to have each other's backs.''\nThe Browns are hoping to avoid dubious history. Three NFL teams previously went 0-11 before winning a game - the 1975 Chargers, 1984 Bills, 2000 Chargers - while seven had even worse starts.\nIt can't get much worse for the Browns than Sunday, when the Steelers overpowered them, recording eight sacks, taking rookie quarterback Cody Kessler out with a concussion - his second head injury in 28 days - and dominating both lines from the outset.\nKessler will miss Sunday's game against the surging New York Giants (7-3) and it's possible the third-round pick is done for the season.\nJosh McCown, who was sacked four times and absorbed a few more crushing hits when he came in for Kessler in the fourth quarter, will make his third start this season.\nThe 37-year-old McCown has endured difficult seasons before, but those haven't softened the impact this one is having.\n''It is a tough, tough time for us,'' he said. ''Especially for guys who have been in the league for a little while and in our locker room, it is frustrating.\n''But at the end of the day, we are going to continue to reload, come back to work and fight hard to make it right and get it going. We owe it to the rest of the guys in the locker room, the coaches, the people in the organization and the city to get this thing turned around.''\nSome of the frustration is beginning to boil over.\nFollowing Cleveland's 21st loss in 22 games, Browns wide receiver Terrelle Pryor, one of the lone bright spots in an otherwise depressing season, vented his feeling by calling out some offensive teammates for not doing a better job of protecting the Browns quarterbacks.\nPryor didn't name names, but there was no hiding his anger. And unlike Pro Bowl tackle Joe Thomas, he didn't lay blame on Cleveland's front office for gutting the club's roster during the offseason to build for the future.\nPryor spoke from his heart, which seems fractured.\n''They can't keep getting hit like that, and if I want to voice my opinion, I'm going to voice my opinion now, because it's going on too much,'' he said. ''I don't care if you've got to hold these dudes. Hold them and take the damn penalty and stop getting our quarterbacks hit. I hate that.''\nWhile Jackson appreciated Pryor's passion, he didn't like his message.\n''That is not Terrelle's job,'' Jackson said. ''I know he is frustrated and we all are. No doubt, we need to protect our quarterback, but that is not for him to say.\n''Let's focus on ourselves and support each other. That is what good teams do, and that is what we are going to work to become.''\nJackson spoke with Pryor, who caught five passes for 97 yards, another performance that will only help his bargaining power in getting a contract extension from the Browns.\n''Sometimes, like most people, after the game and after the heat of the moment, you are a little frustrated and maybe you say some things that you wish you hadn't,'' Jackson said.\n''I understand it is coming from a good place. I know that no one wants to see our quarterback getting hit, but I think everybody has to let me be the judge of that.''\nAs for Jackson, it appears he hasn't lost the confidence of his players, who remain supportive despite a season testing everyone's patience and stomachs.\n''We stand 100 percent behind him,'' linebacker Christian Kirksey said.\nJackson is weathering the storm the only way he knows - head on. He wasn't prepared to lose on this scale, but he's determined to not let the losing slow him down.\n''I know what I signed up for,'' he said. ''I truly believe I am just the man for the job. That has not shown, and I respect that and I understand how our fans and all feel, but I am not running from this. I am going to run through it. We are going to fix this. That is what I came here to do.''\n---\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL .",

''I was just feeling happy, and knowing that I could pick it up and run faster.''\nBenjamin was eager to display his speed in the team's first workout after its bye. In a light session on a damp field, Benjamin was raring to show that his ailing knee is fine.\nMore from FoxSports Dak on what record win streak means to Cowboys Giants are on a roll but are still taking it one game at a time Whitlock 1-on-1: Mike Pereira explains missed NFL extra points | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Denver Broncos, Houston Texans best fit Tony Romo for 2017 season | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF ''It felt good to be back out there,'' said Benjamin, who has missed two games. ''We'll see how it goes this week.''\nBenjamin was among the Chargers returning to practice after being injured leading up last week's bye. Also working and looking as if they'll play on Sunday at Houston were strong safety Jahleel Addae (clavicle) and inside linebacker Denzel Perryman (hamstring).\n''It's great to get Denzel back on the field,'' coach Mike McCoy said. ''We all know what type of player he is, with his knowledge of the system and the play-making ability that he has. So anytime you can get any player back it is always a bonus for our team.''\nEspecially if Perryman, the team's top run-stopper, can stay fit for the next six games. In four of those contests, the opposition averages at least 4 yards per carry. Perryman hasn't played since Oct. 30.\nAddae, another physical player, could deliver some brawn to a run defense which is ranked in the top 10. Although it's a unit which will no longer feature nose tackle Brandon Mebane, who suffered a season-ending biceps injury in the loss to Miami on Nov. 13.\n''The way (Addae) plays the game, his passion, it doesn't matter if it's during practice today or Sunday at kickoff,'' McCoy said. ''You love everything about him. It was great to see him out there at practice today.''\nDwight Lowery, the Chargers' free safety signed in the offseason, agreed.\n''He has the most experience out of everybody in the room,'' Lowery said. ''So to bring his energy, passion, physicality, passion and also his knowledge of the defense is going to help us tremendously I believe. It will be a lift to have him out there.''\nTwo key players didn't return. Cornerback Brandon Flowers (concussion) and inside linebacker Jatavis Brown (knee) were unable to go.\nIt appears the last-place Chargers (4-6) won't be going to the playoffs for the sixth time in seven seasons. But quarterback Philip Rivers gathered his teammates after practice and stressed for them to keep fighting.\n''Phil told us that everyone wishes we could go back in time and change one little thing we did in the losses that we had,'' rookie defensive end Joey Bosa said. ''But obviously we can't do that. Looking forward we have six games left and that is really all we can handle. That is what we are focused on. Our goal is to go 6-0.''\n---\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL",

      "text": "By Chris Chase \nPublished November 21, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print LANDOVER, MD - NOVEMBER 20: Quarterback Kirk Cousins #8 of the Washington Redskins celebrates after teammate running back Rob Kelley #32 (not pictured) scores a fourth quarter touchdown against the Green Bay Packers at FedExField on November 20, 2016 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Rob Carr/Getty Images) \nThere's a pall hanging over the Washington Redskins and, for once, it doesn't have to do with the team looking up hopelessly at the Giants, Cowboys and Eagles. In an otherwise exciting football year in D.C., the specter of quarterback Kirk Cousins' impending free agency looms after every game, which each have been serving as a public referendum on Cousins' future in Washington. Will the Redskins bring him back under the franchise tag, sign him to a contract worth between $80 and $90 million (a funny-money guess based on how much the far-inferior Brock Osweiler got in free agency in 2015) or let him walk away? The question has overshadowed a promising season - the future clouding the present.\nThe risks on all sides are obvious. The Redskins can sign Cousins to that big deal, watch him regress (or get injured) and waste four years waiting to get out of a contract so unwieldy it doesn't allow the team to build a foundation in other areas. It's happened before. Or they can let Cousins go and spend the next decade watching him lead a rejuvenated Bears franchise that beats the Redskins every two or three years just to rub it in. No one really considers the best-case scenario: Cousins plays like a quarterback in or around the top 10 of the league and the new-look Redskins front office builds a team around his competence that can compete annually.\nD.C. sports pessimists (so, like 95% of them) only think about the first two possibilities and have already made up their mind about the former.\nMore from FoxSports Dak on what record win streak means to Cowboys Giants are on a roll but are still taking it one game at a time Whitlock 1-on-1: Mike Pereira explains missed NFL extra points | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Denver Broncos, Houston Texans best fit Tony Romo for 2017 season | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF \"Sure, pay Kirk Cousins $80 million. If there's anything we've learned over the course of 20 years it's that Washington is a place where quarterbacks and overpaid free agents flourish. Seriously, I'm asking, what has happened that would make anyone believe this could work for another five years?\" - A D.C. sports fan who wishes to remain nameless because if Cousins gets signed and actually manages to outperform his contract he wants to be able to say he saw it coming \nThat's a reasonable position. Going by history, it's perhaps more reasonable than hoping Cousins gets signed and lives up to the deal. Albert Haynesworth, Bruce Smith, Adam Archuleta, Jeff George, Dana Stubblefield and Deion Sanders provide the compelling case as to why. Then again, all those were free-agent transfers. Washington rarely gives one of its own a massive contract - last year's extension to Trent Williams, which was the largest in NFL history for an offensive tackle, might have been the first.\nWith each additioanl win, Cousins gets closer to becoming the second and possibly earning the biggest contract in history for a team that knows something or five about big contracts. Right now, the Redskins are 6-3-1, their best record through 10 games since 1996. They're 11-4--1 in the past 16 regular season games, the third-best mark for any NFL team. That record makes for the best season-long stretch since the final year of Joe Gibbs 1.0.\nCousins is the straw stirring the drink. He's played 26 games since becoming the full-time starter and is throwing for 279 yards per game on a 69 percent completion clip with 46 TD, 18 INT and a QB rating of 100.4. Over that aforementioned 16-game stretch, he's thrown for 4,772 yards, 31 TD, 8 INT and a rating of 107.2. He throws a gorgeous deep ball. He looks off receivers. He and Jordan Reed have a connection that brings to mind Brady and Gronkowski. There are mistakes - holding onto the ball too long, audible calls into busted plays, unfortunate passes - but the good far outweighs the bad. All season I've been saying that barring a meltdown the Redskins are going to have to stick with Cousins, stats and record be damned, for the simple reason there's no one else available. Now it's different. The Redskins are going to stick with Cousins because he's earned the money and there's every reason to believe he'll keep on doing so.\nConsider that even if Washington's worst-case scenario comes true - winning two of the final six, let's say - Cousins will still have led the franchise to a winning record in back-to-back years, something that hasn't happened since 1996-97 when Washington was a juggernaut that went 9-7 in '96 and followed that up with a 8-7-1 record the next year. (Last year's division champs went 9-7. This year, the team has a tie on its ledger. Could it be another 9-7/8-7-1 finish? This is where the pessimism of a Washington sports fan kicks into hyperdrive.) The last back-to-back playoff appearances came a year after the 1991 Super Bowl title and has only happened eight times in the Super Bowl era (five of which were with Gibbs). Right now, Cousins is on the verge of erasing a slew of two-decade droughts by getting Washington back to the playoffs and putting the team in great position to go on a run D.C. hasn't seen since years before the internet.\nThat's why he has to return. If his last six games are average or below average, that shouldn't be a sign to keep looking. It merely lowers his price. Yes, a contract might take some soul-searching for Washington fans who think they're perpetually stuck in the 1980s and a front office that loves to get in its own way. It should be pretty simple though: The Redskins have a quarterback playing more consistently over 26 games than any time since before Lawrence Taylor met Joe Theismann's leg. (Mark Rypien's 1991 still stands as the best full season by a Washington quarterback in the last 30 years but Cousins is challenging that in 2016.)\nThe cold feet are natural. For years, the Washington sports scene was a study in disappointments. D.C. never got to have fun things. Then all of a sudden, over the course of eight years Joe Gibbs returned, baseball did too, the Capitals took a surefire superstar at No. 1, the Nationals got two and the Redskins were going to spend a decade watching Robert Griffin III take them to the playoffs.\nIt all came crashing down. Gibbs 2.0 was a disappointment, though it resulted in the most playoff appearances for any Redskins coach since Joe Gibbs. (And don't sleep on what Gibbs did with a subpar roster, particularly in 2007 when the team rallied from the midseason murder of Sean Taylor to go on a four-game winning streak and make the playoffs.) The Nationals were mediocre-to-horrible for years. Despite tremendous regular-season success, Alex Ovechkin and the Caps can't win a playoff series. Stephen Strasburg got hurt. Bryce Harper won an MVP then had a season best described as \"you'll get 'em next year.\" The team is 0-3 in playoff series despite having the second-best record in baseball over the last five seasons. And RG3? His tale is the stuff of 19th-century Russian literature.\nOutlaying a possible nine figures to a quarterback who isn't worth it can get even the best-run franchises into a rut. (Washington only need look 25 miles to the north for an example.) That's not a worry the Redskins can afford to think about. When you have five playoff appearances and just two postseason wins since 1992, you don't get to keep searching for a Peyton Manning or Tom Brady. You realize you haven't had it so good in 30 years. You realize discarding quarterbacks is the mark of the mediocre. You remind yourself, and be thrilled, that you somehow got a franchise cornerstone in the fourth-round of a draft in which you took another quarterback at No. 2. Then you pay the man his money.",

      "text": "Chicago-based Geofeedia, a CIA-backed social-media monitoring platform that drew fire for enabling law enforcement surveillance, has let go 31 of its approximately 60 employees, a spokesman said Tuesday.\nIn mid-October, Twitter followed Facebook and Instagram in cutting Geofeedia off from its valuable data stream , after an American Civil Liberties Union report said police had used the platform to track protests and other large gatherings. The Chicago Police Department and others have used the company's tools.\nGeofeedia cut the jobs, mostly in sales in the Chicago office, in the third week of October, the spokesman said. It has offices in Chicago, Indianapolis and Naples, Fla. The cuts were first reported by Crain's Chicago Business.\nChicago police used Geofeedia, the TweetDeck for cops under fire from ACLU Ally Marotti A Chicago startup backed by the CIA and used by the Chicago Police Department has landed at the center of a battle over privacy and social media after reports that its platform was being used for government surveillance.\nGeofeedia helps clients monitor social media posts tied to a specific place for...\nA Chicago startup backed by the CIA and used by the Chicago Police Department has landed at the center of a battle over privacy and social media after reports that its platform was being used for government surveillance.\nGeofeedia helps clients monitor social media posts tied to a specific place for...\n(Ally Marotti) An emailed statement attributed to CEO Phil Harris said Geofeedia wasn’t \"created to impact civil liberties,” but in the wake of the public debate over their product, they’re changing the company’s direction.\n\"Following these suspensions, we have decided to scale back our business and focus on a variety of innovations that will allow us to serve our customers and continue our rapid growth trajectory as a leading real-time analytics and alerting platform,\" the statement said.\nHarris said Geofeedia's software has been \"impactful\" for schools, sports leagues, customer service, marketing and event planning, per the statement. He also referred to the company's $17 million funding round in February — which brought its total funding to nearly $24 million — and \"strong sales and growth\" as strengthening the company.\n\"Our strong financial position has allowed us to carefully consider the appropriate areas of focus for our technology going forward,\" Harris wrote in the statement.\nGeofeedia would not say if it lost clients following the ACLU report, and declined to specify what areas it will focus on moving forward.\naelahi@tribpub.com\nTwitter @aminamania\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Job Layoffs Unemployment and Layoffs",

The overwhelming majority of the deaths compiled by researchers occurred in India, where 76 people died. In the United States, there were eight selfie-related deaths.\nThe most common factor behind the so-called “selfie deaths”— defined as a death of an individual or group that could have been avoided had the individual(s) not been taking a selfie— was a fall from an elevated location like buildings or mountains. Deaths involving both elevation and water were next, followed by fatalities involving trains, according to researchers from Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania and two colleges in India.\nMore on this...

      "title": "After the Election, a Thanksgiving to Unite Us - Nation",
      "text": "Published November 22, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print iStock \nBy Melanie Kirkpatrick  \nPublished November 22, 2016  | The Wall Street Journal \n\nEditor's note: The following essay originally appeared in the Wall Street Journal and is used with permission. \n\nElection Day has come and gone, and after one of the most divisive campaigns in memory, “healing” seems to be the word of the hour. What better time to begin than Thanksgiving, which Benjamin Franklin called a day of “public Felicity” to give thanks for our “full enjoyment of Liberty, civil and religious.” Thanksgiving, our nation’s oldest tradition, is a moment to focus on our blessings as Americans, on what unites us, not on what divides us.\nSuch was the case in 1863, when Abraham Lincoln called for a national Thanksgiving celebration. He did so at the urging of a farsighted magazine editor who believed that a Thanksgiving celebration would have a “deep moral influence” on the American character, helping to bring together the country, which was divided over the issue of slavery. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation was the first in the unbroken string of annual Thanksgiving proclamations by every subsequent president. It is regarded as the beginning of our modern Thanksgiving holiday.\nLincoln’s call for a national Thanksgiving was different from the thanksgivings he or Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, had called in the early years of the Civil War to express gratitude to God for specific Union or Confederate military victories. Rather, in 1863 Lincoln asked Americans to give thanks for the nation’s general blessings. It was the first time since George Washington led the country that a president proclaimed a day of general Thanksgiving.\nThe opening sentence of Lincoln’s proclamation set the tone: “The year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies,” he wrote. This was an astonishing way to characterize the year 1863, when death, suffering and grief were ever present. At the Battle of Gettysburg, which had taken place in July, the Union lost 27% of its fighting men and the Confederacy lost 37%.\nYet amid this human suffering, Lincoln cataloged the blessings for which Americans could be grateful. Even “in the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity,” he wrote, the nation remained at peace with foreign countries, its borders were expanding, its population was growing, and its farms, industries and mines were producing.\nLincoln spoke not as commander in chief of the Union forces but as president of the entire nation, North and South. He made no reference to victories or losses or rebels or enemies. Instead, the president spoke of “the whole American people.” He called on every American to celebrate Thanksgiving “with one heart and one voice.”\nTo understand how Lincoln came to believe in the healing power of a national Thanksgiving, it is necessary to examine the remarkable life of the woman who made it happen. She used her position as editor of the most popular magazine of the pre-Civil War era to conduct a decadeslong campaign for a countrywide Thanksgiving holiday. She is often called the godmother of Thanksgiving. Her name was Sarah Josepha Hale.\nHale’s story is a classic American saga of how one enterprising, hardworking individual with a good idea can have an impact in an open, democratic society. In this case, a penniless young widow from New Hampshire—subject to all the limitations attached to such a station in life in the early 19th century—rose to become the editor of the most widely circulated magazine of her era, Godey’s Lady’s Book.\nRead the full story in the Opinion section on FoxNews.com→",

It was also a top priority to bring the cheesy favorite to the chain's loyal fan base. \nTACO BELL'S CHEAPEST MENU ITEM? \n“One thing we know about our customers is that they love cheese,” he said. “That’s definitely what they want from Taco Bell.”\nThe Steakhouse Burrito and Queso Nachos are both $5.99.",

Mylan has agreed to pay $465 million to settle allegations that it overbilled Medicaid for EpiPen. At issue was whether the product should have been classified as generic under a Medicaid program.\nIn September, a House panel grilled Mylan CEO Heather Bresch about the skyrocketing cost of the devices, which many parents rely on when their children have allergic reactions. The list price of EpiPens had grown to $608 for a two-pack, an increase of more than 500 percent since 2007.\nIn nearly four hours of questioning, Bresch declined to answer many questions about the company's finances and profits, infuriating lawmakers. She defended the company's business practices and signaled there were no plans to lower prices.\nRead more at Foxnews.com→",

The shelter was contacted after the dog’s microchip was tracked, and the animal adoption center claims Faris violated a contract she signed when she adopted Pete that stated she would let the shelter know if she ever handed the pup over to a new owner. \nSources connected to Faris told TMZ the actress and her actor husband, Chris Pratt, found a new home for Pete. It was not immediately clear if that arrangement was temporary or permanent. \nThe adoption center, Kinder4Rescue, told TMZ Faris will have to prove the dog was lost and she was working to find him if she wants to avoid the fine. \nClick here for more on this from TMZ.",

      "text": "Published November 22, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print   \nPresident-elect Donald Trump vowed to rebuild the country’s infrastructure on the campaign trail -- but a closer look at his $1 trillion proposal to give the nation’s highways, bridges and railways a makeover shows the freshman politician faces a rough road of his own with members of the GOP.\nDuring his victory speech, Trump pledged he’d “rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none.” He added, “We will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.”\nWhen President Obama tried to deliver on a similar promise, Republican lawmakers fought him at every turn, making their deep-seated dislike for government spending known.\nIf the fiscal fights of the past are any indication of what’s to come, Trump could have a tough time. Take the budget, for example.\nTrump’s agenda seems to run counter to years of promises made by congressional Republicans to balance the federal budget.\nTrump's tax cut, estimated to cost almost $5 trillion over 10 years, will likely be pared back.\nPredictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map → \nTop lawmakers like House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, and No. 3 Senate Republican John Thune of South Dakota say the GOP's tax plans shouldn't add to the deficit. That would mean tax rates couldn't be cut nearly as sharply as Trump wants.\n\"We know we're going to have to pay for this,\" said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican. \"The question is whether we do it now or whether we send it to our kids and grandkids and make them pay for it. So that's an important point that we need to achieve some consensus on.\"\nOn the spending side of the ledger, Trump's promises of a huge infrastructure plan are already running into difficulty with Republicans.\n\"We are not going to vote for anything that increases the national debt,\" said Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho. \"Fiscal conservatives in the House are not going to support anything that is not paid for.\"\nThe flip side involves longstanding promises by Capitol Hill Republicans to balance the budget by repealing the Affordable Care Act, sharply cutting social programs like Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and student loan subsidies. Trump promises to replace the so-called \"Obamacare\" and assured voters during the campaign that he wouldn't cut Social Security and Medicare -- and he's on record as saying that 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney's choice of now-Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., \"was the end of the campaign.\"\n\"I said, `You've got to be kidding' -- because he represented cutting entitlements, etc., etc. The only one that's not going to cut is me,\" Trump said at a February campaign stop.\nMajor reforms require presidential leadership -- and as a candidate Trump didn't show much interest in attacking the deficit.\n\"It's clear that deficits and spending retrenchment and entitlement reform was not what this election was about,\" said Neil Bradley, a former top House GOP aide who is skeptical of the party's ability to deliver major spending cuts.\nThe deficit, said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., \"wasn't talked about in the campaign.\"\nThe math is also daunting. The most recent House GOP budget plan, for instance, promised to balance the budget over a decade by cutting spending by $6.5 trillion -- roughly 13 cents of every dollar spent -- over the next 10 years. But their budget plans have kept Social Security, the Pentagon, veterans programs and interest payments immune from cuts, so they've doubled down on cuts to the Medicaid health program for the poor and disabled, along with cuts to domestic programs like education, farm subsidies, housing vouchers and scientific research.\nRecently, however, the focus in Washington has been to reverse cuts to the Pentagon and domestic agencies imposed by a 2011 budget deal. Along the way, Obama and top Republicans sought modest cuts to the federal crop insurance program and the generous military pensions paid to veterans in their 40s and 50s -- only to have to reverse course after bipartisan squealing from rank-and-file lawmakers.\nGiven the inability to preserve such tiny spending cuts in recent years, one couldn't be faulted for doubting whether lawmakers could stomach the far, far larger cuts demanded by Ryan's balanced budget plans.\nOne option for both spending and taxes is to enact a one-time tax break on overseas profits that multinational corporations \"repatriate\" back to the United States. That could produce $100 billion or so over 10 years by some estimates and the windfall is being eyed for both an infrastructure package and a tax reform bill.\n\"I think the American people will support spending when they get something concrete and tangible for our efforts,\" said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss. \"There is a feeling that there's enough money there to pay for a big infrastructure program to get the economy going again and pay for stuff and also use part of the repatriation as a way to finance tax reform.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

For nearly the entire week since he became president-elect, Donald Trump has been holed up in the tower, his gilded New York skyscraper.  (AP Photo/Kathy Willens) \nElections have consequences and an obvious one now is your distress. Your grief over Hillary Clinton’s defeat is understandable, but your rage over Donald Trump’s victory is not.\nYet instead of searching for the reasons, you  embarrass the city by booing Mike Pence at “Hamilton.”  You screech over Trump’s personnel picks and reflexively smear people you don’t know. Too often, your argument is “Shut up.”\nYou are playing with fire by hardening the very polarization you decry. Please stop before you burn down the American house.\nBy all means, mourn Clinton’s loss and the probability that you will never again see her name on a ballot. Her concession speech felt like “goodbye” and someone else will shatter the final glass ceiling.\n\nTo continue reading Michael Goodwin's column in the New York Post, click here. \nPredictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections.

The more I read about him the more I see why.\nMattis is a combat leader, respected by other officers and by the troops. He’s a well-read military historian who takes the time to thoroughly understand the theaters he is operating in. He knows strategy, tactics, leadership, and the Big Picture. He has given his country and his Marine Corps 44 years of exemplary service. He understands the world and the threats that face America. He knows both the uses and limitations of military power. He appears to be a perfect fit for a commander in chief who means to be serious about defending America.\n\nAnd there is one intangible benefit General Mattis brings with him that should not be overlooked or underestimated. How useful it would be those across the world who wish us ill to know that we have a SECDEF named Mad Dog. \nRead the full story at The Spectator→",

(Reuters File Photo) \nMacy's annual Thanksgiving Day Parade kicks off 9 a.m. this Thursday. The floats start in Manhattan Upper West Side neighborhood before moving downtown toward Macy's flagship department store on 34th Street in New York City.\nThe legendary parade has come a long way since its debut in 1924. The parade was originally named the “Macy’s Christmas Parade” and was started by store employees who wanted to celebrate the holiday season with an event reminiscient of their hometown European festivals.\nThe original 5.5 mile route had floats, workers marching. clowns and even some live animals like lions, tigers and elephants from the Central Park Zoo. In 1927, Macy’s decided rename the parade and gear it towards Thanksgiving. The company also introduced cartoon character floats. One of the first balloons ever used was Felix the Cat. \nTHANKSGIVING DINNER WILL COST YOU LESS THIS YEAR \n“This year, as we celebrate 90 years of magical moments, we are truly humbled by the unique role the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade fills in the lives of millions worldwide,\" Amy Kule, executive producer of Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade told FoxNews.com. “We are thrilled to celebrate this special milestone with a spectacular line-up filled with amazing new and commemorative elements that will continue our storied legacy of unparalleled holiday entertainment.”\nIf you can’t make it to New York City to see the parade live (or you'd rather catch the floats in warmer weather), head down to the sunshine state. After the legendary parade marches in New York, several balloons and floats are shipped down to Universal Studios where the parade is recreated as “Macy’s Holiday Parade\" which runs daily from Dec. 3 to Jan 1.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract The Red Power Ranger soars above the holiday crowds. (Macy's Inc) \nDo you have a real passion for parades? Check out more fun facts about Macy's annual spectacle:\n1) More than 50 million people will be watching the Macy’s Day Parade on television and 3.5 million people watching along the parade route.\n2) The longest balloon in the parade is the Red Mighty Morphin' Power Ranger measuring 77-feet long. Just one of his arms is the size of a standard school bus.\n3) More than 40 gallons of florescent paint and 5 barrels of glitter were used to create the flames on the character balloon, Eruptor from \"Skylanders.\"\nNEW YORK CITY BUSINESSES HIT HARD BY ONGOING TRUMP PROTESTS \nRelated Image Expand / Contract Felix the Cat was one of the parade's first cartoon floats. (Macys Inc. ) \n4) It takes more than 800 internal tie-lines to keep SpongeBob SquarePants afloat . Spongebob Squarepants was the first-ever square balloon in the Parade.\n5) Thomas the Train will be chugging along the parade route for it’s third year. The balloon measures 51-feet long, 23-feet wide, 47-feet tall, making Thomas the parade’s largest balloon by helium volume . It contains the most balloon fabric ever used to design one character.\n6) The highest hair award this year goes to one of the newest balloons, Poppy of Dreamwork’s \"Trolls,\" Branch and Guy Diamond - both Trolls' iconic hair stands more than 12-feet tall and it's one of the parade’s widest balloons at 38 inches.\n7) The first ever character balloon in the Macy’s Parade is back this year and is modeled after the original 1927 balloon of the animated film star, Felix The Cat.  Felix has been created  using the same techniques that were used in the 20’s. He will also be  carried with poles.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract DreamWorks' Trolls flies at Macy's Balloonfest in preparation for the 90th anniversary of Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade at Citi Field on Nov. 5, 2016 in New York City.

The Elf on the Shelf is also the tallest ballon at 64-feet. \n13) Sarah McClaughlin is slated to appear this year atop the \"Deck the Halls\" float. The special vehicle is trimmed with more than 300 feet of garland and includes a Christmas tree three stories tall.\n14) Macy’s Parade may seem larger than life-- but there are some restrictions. They must stay under three stories tall and, width-wise, can not take over several lanes of traffic. They also must be able to collapse to no more than 12 &frac12;-feet tall and 8-feet wide in order to safely travel through the Lincoln tunnel from New Jersey to Manhattan.\n\nCarey Reilly is a lifestyle blogger, TV host, comedian and lover of cocktails.

      "text": "by Derric Haynie \nWondering if Twitter could be the marketing tool your business needs? Thinking your company needs a larger Twitter following? Here are the questions you should ask yourself first: Do I need business instantly (and have no following)? If yes, then no social media channel is going to be right for you—try advertising. Do I (or my team) have four hours a week and $100 a month (that’s your estimated tool cost)? If no, then you won’t be able to actually pull this off. Do I know who my ideal customer is (especially what hashtags they might use to identify themselves)? If no, then figure out your buyer persona before attempting this strategy. Do I have tracking set up on my website (email conversions, most importantly)? This is standard operating procedure, so it better be a “yes.” Do I have blog content or something valuable to promote? If no, then create that before beginning. \nNow, if you’re ready to proceed, Twitter marketing could be just what you were looking for. But before we begin, I have to tell you the truth about marketing on Twitter… The Truth About Twitter Marketing \nTwitter is a vain site, with tons of spammers, black hatters, and fake accounts. Even the real people on Twitter are too busy for you. Most are getting 100 new Tweets in their feed every second. This bombardment of information is happening all across social media, and at this point, it’s just part of playing the game. \nNo one is on social media to download your stupid e-book. Engagement > Promotion. (highlight to tweet) \nRemember: You’re on Twitter, and the people seeing your posts aren’t on your site and don’t give a crap about you. In fact, they almost certainly aren’t thinking about you at all, and they might not even know who you (or your company) are. I’m saying this not to scare you, but to set the stage for your Twitter marketing strategy. \nThe word “value” is thrown around a lot these days. If you aren’t operating your Twitter marketing strategy from a place of providing value (most companies I would say operate from a place of expecting sales), then you aren’t going to perform well. \nEven with all the noise out there, you can cut through it with a very simple Twitter marketing strategy that involves three simple tactics. 1. Increase Engagement and Growth by Sending Auto-Mentions to New Followers \nAuto-mentions on Twitter have changed my life. It’s true—I have new business partners and tons of business connections because of the auto-mention. \nThe only way I know to use auto-mentions effectively is with my favorite Twitter marketing tool, Audiense . I highly recommend checking it out this awesome tool for Twitter marketing and growth, but if you have your own way, that’s fine too. \nHere’s how auto-mentions works: \n1. Someone follows you. \n2. This triggers an automatic Tweet at them. \nYou don’t DM (direct message) them some spammy message, and you certainly don’t Tweet some spammy message. Remember the rule: Provide value! \nWhat’s the best way to do that? Ask a question! \nHere, we asked Chris what his favorite conference to attend was. He responded “ Social Media Marketing World 2016 ,” which I also happened to have attended (and it’s also my favorite). I bring my favorite speaker, Marcus Sheridan , into the conversation, and all of a sudden he’s shouting out to Gary Vee and the whole gang. \nThe second best thing to do is send them to the best, most relevant blog post you’ve ever written in your life . It’s your one chance to impress someone—better send them to the goods! \nBut the key here is targeting. With Audiense, you can detect keywords in a user’s bio to send them the right kind of content. I only send this blog post (called “Startup Advice”) to people that have “#Startup” in their bio. Make sense? \n3. People respond and engage. \nPeople don’t respond to DMs because they are private and mostly spam. But people love responding to mentions because it’s the nature of Twitter, to respond and engage with people in a public setting for short conversations. And this isn’t some sort of trick—we really do want to chat with people, but can’t possibly start a conversation with everyone manually. \n4. You continue the conversation (when appropriate). \nCongratulations, you’ve just started a conversation on social media. Not that innovative, and not that hard. Yet no one is doing this! Do Auto-Mentions Actually Work? \nEvery single time. I’ve validated across multiple brands and accounts. Account growth goes up substantially: \nAnd so does engagement: The 3 Rules of Auto-Mentions Only point people to things that are completely free and ungated. Respond to every response. Only use this strategy when people follow you. The Most Common Misconception About Auto-Mentions \nThe common misconception is that this tactic is spammy. Every one in 1,000 auto-mentions I get someone responding (hey, still starting a conversation) telling me they don’t appreciate my spammy message. \nBut it isn’t spammy. Social automation can be used for good as well as evil, so it really matters who’s controlling the rocket ship. An auto-mention sending people to some random squeeze page for an e-book they aren’t going to read is spammy. An auto-mention asking someone their favorite speaker? Favorite book? That’s a conversation starter. \nPeople use these conversation starters every single day at parties and events. This strategy is really only as automated as your canned opening line when you shake someone’s hand. \nHere’s a bonus reason why auto-mentions are awesome: Mentions do not show up under your main account feed. They are in “Tweets and Replies:” \nPeople will not see every single message you send out using this method. Thus, while the conversations are public, they are also targeted to the people that follow both you and the other account. 2. Follow New Users in Your Target Market \nYeah, I said it. Follow them! Brilliant, I know. But getting the attention of a potential user, customer, or influencer, could actually be as simple as following them. \nPeople see their new followers in their notification feed, and they’ll frequently check out your Twitter bio and follow back. Using Twitter search or Audiense, find people fitting your target market criteria and follow 300–400 every couple of days. \nPro tip: If you use Audiense you can sort out people that don’t have avatars, people that haven’t been active in the last 15 days, and people that have new accounts. Those are all low quality followers that you don’t want to waste your time on. \nRemember when I said I only send my blog post to people with “#Startup” in their bio? I also follow a lot of people with “#Startup” in their bio. See how this follow/unfollow strategy now leads right into auto-mentions? Get your auto-mentions setup, then start following the crap out of people. \nThere’s nothing much to this strategy other than choosing the right follow criteria. Below, we are targeting people that use “#SocialMedia” and also have a large following: \nAlways start with your most influential users first, so that there’s an amplification opportunity for your efforts. After a few days, you can then unfollow anyone who hasn’t followed you back. This is super helpful within Audiense, but there’s also a free tool called Mass Unfollow that, well, mass unfollows everyone not following you. 3. Content Curation Is Now Mandatory for Every Business \nIt blows my mind that companies, big and small, think they can act like they are the only company in the world. “Me. Me. Me. I only Tweet about me!” \nThe idea behind content curation is simple: Provide value to your followers by connecting them with relevant content that falls slightly outside of your area of expertise or your industry. \nAnd here’s why it’s important: Because people don’t stop existing after they are done doing business with you. \nStop pretending your customers stop existing after they are done doing business with you. \n– Derric Haynie \nHere’s how you can go about curating content on Twitter : Step 1 \nGo about your day online, and when you find something you think would be relevant to your audience—something that is evergreen and high quality—use Pocket or Flipboard to save it for later. Step 2 \nGet MeetEdgar . It may cost you money, but it’s worth it. Log in and create a content calendar like this one: Step 3 \nStart adding all this relevant content to categories. This includes adding your past blog posts into their own category—it is, after all, okay to promote your own great content on your own social profile. \nFrom here, your content will go out on an ongoing basis, filling in the gaps of your existing social media strategy. You should still, of course, find and Tweet out relevant and timely material using another tool like Buffer or Hootsuite . \nMeetEdgar goes above and beyond by making you more active. (By the way, account growth is directly related to Tweet frequency.) If you want to grow, you need to Tweet. But you also can’t Tweet out crap, so you really have to work hard to find the goods. Bonus: Use Branded Links to Get 34 Percent More Clicks \nInstead of using a generic URL shortener, like Bitly, you can easily replace all of your links with a branded URL shortener through Rebrandly . This means you can use “mybrand.xyz” instead of “tiny.crap/random-gibberish” or the more commonly seen “bit.ly/u5Etz.” \nWhich Tweet do you think better represents Social Media Examiner’s brand and the link they are sharing? \nOr: \nPlugging in your own URL shortener is free (you may have to purchase a domain for $2–$12) and instantly amplifies all of your marketing efforts. So why aren’t you doing it? I highly recommend always using a branded domain with a custom URL slug. \nIf you set aside four hours of your time each week, spread out across all five weekdays, to execute on this strategy, I guarantee you will see real growth and engagement coming into your Twitter account. There are tons of people out there on Twitter just looking to chat, hang out, or learn something new from you. Get out there, and provide them some value! \nRemember that these tactics are just the beginning for companies like yours to start gaining traction. There are still tons of other things you can do on Twitter, such as influencer outreach, engaging in Twitter chats, competitive social monitoring , and creating cool and engaging video responses. \nWhat do you think? Still not convinced auto-mentions are for you? Hesitant to follow new users for one reason or another? I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments below. \nGet more content like this, plus the very BEST marketing education, totally free. Get our Definitive email newsletter. Filed Under:",

      "text": "Twitter suspends Tila Tequila following pro-Nazi posts It's part of Twitter's broader crackdown on purveyors of hate speech. Save Linda Davidson/The Washington Post via Getty Images \nTwitter's quest to clamp down on hatemongers , trolls and similar provocateurs isn't slowing down any time soon. The social network has suspended Tila Tequila's account after the reality show star (shown at left) posted a string of pro-Nazi tweets, including one showing her giving a Nazi salute at a white nationalist conference in Washington. While she has previously sworn that she isn't racist (she's of Vietnamese heritage), she hasn't exactly hidden her shift toward the extreme right. She once posted a photo of herself wearing a Nazi armband in front of Auschwitz, and in her Twitter bio described herself as an \"alt-reich queen\" and \"literally Hitler.\" \nTwitter doesn't normally discuss the circumstances surrounding a suspension, but we've reached out regardless and will let you know if it has something to say. However, this follows shortly after Twitter expanded its abuse reporting to let you flag hateful tweets targeting people based on race, ethnic groups and other demographics, whether or not they're targeted at you. Tequila may not have been singling people out, but her posts weren't exactly promoting cultural acceptance and compassion. \nIt won't be surprising if bans like this continue. Twitter's reluctance to combat trolls may have cost it an acquisition bid from Disney , among other suitors. The last thing it needs is a verified user whose very presence on the service makes Jewish and non-white people feel unwelcome. While the ban won't allay questions about Twitter's support for freedom of expression, it's important to remember that this a private business. It has no obligation to host speech it doesn't like, especially if that speech intimidates other users and ultimately hurts its bottom line.",

      "text": "Published November 22, 2016 EFE Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Caracas –   Venezuela's legislative National Assembly, currently with an opposition majority, welcomed Tuesday as a new member the opposition lawmaker Rosmit Mantilla, the Caribbean country's first openly gay legislator, who was released from jail last week after being imprisoned for two-and-a-half years.\nMantilla was received with applause and was sworn-in before the leadership of the legislature headed by speaker Henry Ramos Allup, who invited him to take a seat and participate in the debate scheduled for this Tuesday.\n\"Outside (in the street) there's hunger, there's insecurity, I was imprisoned by the Sebin (national intelligence service), but Venezuela is imprisoned by hunger and insecurity,\" Mantilla told reporters after being sworn-in.\nHe said he is committed to freedom and political change, and thanked the Catholic Church and the Vatican for his release from jail.\nThe legislator was considered by the MUD opposition alliance as an iconic political prisoner and was declared a \"prisoner of conscience\" in 2015 by Amnesty International, which asked Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on several occasions for his immediate release.\nMantilla, a member of the Voluntad Popular (VP) party of jailed opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, was the first political prisoner to be released after the government and MUD reached the first accords of their dialogue last Nov. 12, which included the release of several imprisoned members of the opposition.\nThe newly freed prisoner, who before his arrest was a VP militant, was presented as a MUD candidate for the western state of Tachira when he was in jail and subsequently won a seat in the National Assembly in the elections of Dec. 6, 2015.

      "text": "Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey was suspended from Twitter for a short time tonight. Dorsey — who operates the account @jack — was seemingly removed from the service he runs at around 9PM ET , for reasons that are currently unknown, before being reinstated around 15 minutes later.\nThe service has been slow to suspend people for hate speech and harassment in the past, but is usually quick to remove accounts that post obscene images or videos. Speculating entirely, it could be that Dorsey was the target of a hacking attempt, and his account was taken down to preemptively halt any kind of public performance, while Twitter worked to get it back into his hands. His account returned without reference to the brief intermission.\nTwitter founder @jack has had his account suspended.\n— Jon Passantino (@passantino) November 23, 2016 The Verge has contacted Twitter for comment.",

      "text": "Twitter reminds everyone it won't cooperate with government or police surveillance Twitter doesn't want third parties spying on its users. share JUSTIN SULLIVAN / GETTY IMAGES In a blog post , Twitter reiterated its policy that forbids third party organizations from using the company’s public data or data products, like Gnip, for surveillance purposes. As a company, our commitment to social justice is core to our mission and well established. And our policies in this area are long-standing. Using Twitter’s Public APIs or data products to track or profile protesters and activists is absolutely unacceptable and prohibited. While this policy is not new, Twitter data (resold through third party brokers) can still end up in the hands of companies that profile activists and protesters for law enforcement across the world. Twitter says this stance on surveillance does not impact its own guidelines for dealing with law enforcement. In some cases, Twitter is legally required to hand over user information to enforcement agencies. That isn’t changing. Although courts request user data from Twitter regularly, as published in the company’s transparency reports , law enforcement use social media scanning tools to read, collect and profile public account data for surveillance and monitoring. A court order is generally not required to collect public social media data. Broader questions as to whether data-intensive companies, like Twitter and Google, will take decisive action to reject government surveillance operations have surfaced since Donald Trump’s presidential win hit Silicon Valley by surprise . Trump’s platform promises to be heavy on surveillance , including a potential plan to create a database specifically for Muslim-Americans. (Unlike many of Trumps campaign promises, this one actually appears to be on the table .) Twitter, for its part, has shut off access to at least two different companies —Geofeedia and Snaptrends — that were providing surveillance services to U.S. law enforcement efforts this year. Those relationships were severed after the ACLU and other social justice organizations complained that the companies were using Twitter’s “firehose” — the inside term for the 500 million tweets that blast over the social media platform each day — to help police surveil activists. Geofeedia laid off half its staff after Twitter shuttered access to its data. Based on information in the @ACLU ’s report, we are immediately suspending @Geofeedia ’s commercial access to Twitter data. — Policy (@policy) October 11, 2016 Today’s comments signal Twitter is cracking down even further on its anti-surveillance rule. “Over the coming months, you’ll see us take on expanded enforcement and compliance efforts, including adding more resources for swiftly investigating and acting on complaints about the misuse of Twitter’s Public APIs and Gnip data products,” the company wrote in its blogpost. Twitter’s policy requires those who purchase its data to submit info outlining how it will be used. This is how the company tries to ensure outside parties don’t use the information for surveillance, a spokesperson clarified. Earlier this month, the FBI hired Dataminr , a social media analytics company, to help the agency search the “complete Twitter firehose, in near-real time.” Twitter owns a five percent stake in Dataminr, yet earlier this year pulled access to the service because it was being used by the CIA . “A narrowly tailored news alert product is available to some first responders, like the FBI. Our position on surveillance use cases is clear and those use cases are strictly prohibited,” Twitter said in a statement to Fortune about the FBI’s use of Dataminr. Twitter and its developer community rarely seem to see eye-to-eye on how to use the company’s data trove. In fact, Twitter has had such a rocky relationship with developers that CEO Jack Dorsey apologized publicly for it in October of last year. “Somewhere along the line our relationship with developers got a little bit complicated, a little bit confusing, a little bit unpredictable,” he said at the company’s developer conference, Flight. This year, that conference was scrapped . recode_divider",

Dorsey — who operates the account @jack — was seemingly removed from the service he runs at around 9PM ET, for reasons that are currently unknown, before being reinstated around 15 minutes later.\n\nThe service has been slow to suspend people for hate speech and harassment in the past, but is usually quick to remove accounts that post obscene images or videos. Speculating entirely, it could be that Dorsey was the target of a hacking attempt, and his account was taken down to preemptively halt any kind of public performance, while Twitter worked to get it back into his hands. His account returned without reference to the brief intermission.\n\n\n\nTwitter...",

In a bizarre twist today, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and CEO had his own Twitter account suspended by his company and people were quick to notice it.\nHAHAHA @Jack Dorsey got suspended from his own platform \nMEME MAGIC IS REAL FOLKS pic.twitter.com/vCb4Lbwuno \n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 23, 2016 \n\nApparently at around 5 am EAT, people noticed that Jack Dorsey was suspended on his own platform, which is of course funny in the sense that it is not something you would normally see every day. Of course people were quick to give their opinion about this on Twitter.\nSo Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has been censoring #pizzagate so the people have hit back by reporting his account so much it got suspended \n— Will Moriarty (@will_moriarty) November 23, 2016 \n\nThe CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, has been suspended and now nothing makes sense pic.twitter.com/PwHp5rjES1 \n— Jared Wyand (@JaredWyand) November 23, 2016 \n\nBREAKING: @Twitter CEO @Jack Dorsey has just banned himself from Twitter. This is not a joke. On Gab soon? #Tweetstallnacht #TwitterHeaven \n— WeSearchr (@wesearchr) November 23, 2016 \n\nIt is not clear what exactly happened but Jack gave an explanation to the bizarre incident a while ago and it looks like it was some bug in the system. He explained that the account suspension was an “internal mistake” which is interesting.\njust setting up my twttr…again (account suspension was an internal mistake)\n— jack (@jack) November 23, 2016 \n\nFunny enough, Jack Dorsey decided to use the famous phrase “just setting up my twttr” (which is actually the first tweet published on Twitter) to set the record straight. (See the resemblance?)\njust setting up my twttr\n— jack (@jack) March 21, 2006 \n\nTwitter has been on a roll in recent times trying to curb the situation of hate speech and cyberbullying in its platform since it is one of the many problems plaguing the social network. According to the company, an account may be suspended if\nthey are spammy or just plain fake, which in turn could cause a security risk to its users. the account security is at risk n the form of being hacked or compromised in a way. the account posts abusive tweets or portrays abusive behaviour where it can be suspended temporarily or in some cases permanently.  \nRead On Web → Twitter Suspended Its Own CEO’s Twitter Account \n",

      "text": "225 shares \nAs if Twitter hadn’t already dealt us enough rude shocks all year, the company had another big one up its sleeve: suspending its CEO’s account. \nThe Register reports that around 6PM PT, CEO Jack Dorsey’s profile (@jack) displayed an ‘account suspended’ message. The company managed to restore his account 15 minutes later. The gaff amused many a Twitter user: HAHAHA @Jack Dorsey got suspended from his own platform 😂😂😂 \nMEME MAGIC IS REAL FOLKS 🚨 pic.twitter.com/vCb4Lbwuno \n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 23, 2016 \nFor a brief period, @jack’s profile hadn’t yet had its full follower count of 3.9 million restored. Naturally, jokes ensued: Guys, I now have more followers than @jack pic.twitter.com/tgfktdvxCt \n— Jon Passantino (@passantino) November 23, 2016 \nTo their credit, Dorsey and Co. laid the matter to rest with a clever quip: just setting up my twttr…again (account suspension was an internal mistake) \n— 🚶🏽jack (@jack) November 23, 2016 \nFans of Twitter will recognize Dorsey’s reference to the first tweet ever , which he posted in 2006, back when the service was called twtrr. \nInterestingly, @jack now has only 3.47 million followers. It’s unclear as to how the profile may have shed close to half a million followers over an internal error, but let’s hope that doesn’t happen to anyone else. \n2016, don’t scare us like that again, mmkay?",

      "text": "The Twitter account of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was briefly suspended according to media reports. The account was restored with the follower count reset to zero. most of the followers were restored a little while later. Dorsey tweeted out an echo of his historic first tweet, modified to reflect the circumstances. A clear explanation was not given for the suspension, but Dorsey claimed the account was suspended because of an internal mistake.\njust setting up my twttr…again (account suspension was an internal mistake)\n— 🚶🏽jack (@jack) November 23, 2016 \n\nTechCrunch calls it an “ apt piece of symbolism ” that the account of the CEO was suspended, following 10 years of a poor track record of protecting its users and reducing the abuse on the platform.\nThe suspension led to celebrations by alt-right accounts , a loosely organised group with far right beliefs, according to a report in Gizmodo . Twitter has been cracking down on alt-right accounts and has suspended several accounts associated with the movement.\nImage: bakedalaska\nTwitter suspends accounts for many reasons, including when the accounts are hacked. This has led to speculation on if the Dorsey’s account was indeed hacked. The most obvious suspects for such a hack is Ourmine , which has compromised several high profile social media accounts. OurMine has previously hacked Dorsey’s Twitter account. However, the spare of alt-right related suspensions have made some users speculate an attack from another source.\nWas Twitter founder and CEO @jack hacked to send a message to stop censoring users? His account was down for awhile pic.twitter.com/bjVUVil64r \n— Joe Biggs (@Rambobiggs) November 23, 2016 \n\nThe hacking angle is just speculation, and there is no evidence that Dorsey’s Twitter account was compromised in this instance. Unless Twitter or Dorsey provides more information, the best explanation right now is that it was a mistake by Twitter. The account was restored in under thirty minutes.\nThe post Twitter briefly suspends account of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey by mistake appeared first on Tech2 .",
