      "text": "We’ve all been there: You’re about to take off on your long-haul flight and wonder how you’re going to keep yourself entertained for the whole trip. After perusing through all of the pre-screened choices on the plane’s in-flight entertainment system, there isn’t anything available that quite piques your interest. Enter Netflix .\nOnce the service that we could only use while in the comfort of our home or with Wi-Fi and streaming capabilities, Netflix now allows users to download some TV shows and movies ahead of time. This new feature could completely change how you travel — road warriors, rejoice!\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \n\nThe best part of all: Downloading your favorite programs is completely free. As of now, only select programs are available to download, and Netflix plans to add more downloadable content in the future. The complimentary service is included in all Netflix subscription plans and is available for phones and tables on both Android and iOS devices. To take advantage, download the latest version of the Netflix app and select the program you’d like to download.\nSay, for example, you’re in the middle of binge-watching “Stranger Things” and can’t fathom closing out of the screen for your upcoming flight. Well, you can now download all of your remaining episodes so the binge never truly has to stop — you can watch on your Uber ride to the airport , sitting in the lounge and while you’re in the air.\nThis is a great addition for Netflix. The ability to download your favorite programs in advance to watch wherever you go is a real game-changer.\nH/T: Bloomberg \nFeatured image courtesy of Getty Images. \nChase Sapphire Preferred® Card APPLY NOW Earn 50,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening.

      "text": "Search Netflix Offers Users Ability to Download Content to Watch on the Go \nYou can now watch shows like “Orange Is the New Black” or “Narcos” even without Internet connection Joe Otterson | November 30, 2016 @ 8:14 AM \nNetflix has made a range of TV shows and movies available to download so you can watch even without an Internet connection, the company announced on Wednesday. \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their ‘Stranger Things’ binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” Netflix said in a statement. “Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.” \nNetflix originals like “Stranger Things,”“Orange Is the New Black,”“Narcos,”“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” and “House of Cards” are currently available for download. Other shows, like “Supernatural,”“The 100,”“The Office,” and “The Flash” are also available. Also Read: 'Gilmore Girls': 10 Theories About 'A Year in the Life's' Unanswered Questions \nThe new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. The move comes over a year after Amazon Prime began offering users the ability to download their streaming content. \nNetflix had previously said they were considering offline viewing as an option for users, but it depended on a number of factors. \nCliff Edwards, a director of corporate communications at Netflix, told Tech Radar that allowing offline viewing was a “short term fix for a bigger problem,” such as unreliable Wi-Fi coverage affecting video playback. 17 Great Christmas Movies You Can Stream on Netflix Right Now (Photos) \nThe only reason people love this time of year is because it's now appropriate to binge watch a whole bunch of Christmas movies. So instead of wasting your time browsing for the best holiday movies, TheWrap's got you covered with 18 of our favorites. \n\"Love Actually\" \nProbably one of the best new classic Christmas movies out there. It's a romantic-comedy that follows nine intertwined love stories and it will give you all the feels. Just keep a box of tissues handy. Universal Pictures \n\"Last Holiday\" \nA shy ambitious woman writes her dreams of being a professional cook down in a journal, but never pursues it. Instead, she works in the cookware section of a department store, until one day she bumps her head while flirting with her co-worker. \nUpon examination, doctors tell her she has weeks to live, so the woman decides to quit her job and live life to its fullest. Paramount Pictures \n\"While You Were Sleeping\" \nOne of Sandra Bullock's earlier films, she plays a lonely woman working for the Chicago Transit Authority and has a crush on a regular commuter. On Christmas day, she saves him from a tragic accident and accompanies him to the hospital where a nurse mistakes her for his fiancee. Buena Vista Pictures \n\"White Christmas\" \nWe couldn't leave out this Christmas classic. This romantic-comedy-musical involves two singing acts joining together to save a former commanding officer's failing inn in Vermont. Paramount Pictures \n\"Serendipity\" \nA fateful day during the holiday season brings a man and woman in their 20s together for a magical night. The two part ways, despite having a strong mutual attraction, and years later try to find their way back to each other. Miramax Pictures \n\"Scrooged\" \nIt's another take on Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol,\" so we already pretty much knows how this movie plays out. This time though, it's a successful and cynical TV executive who gets haunted by three Christmas ghosts. Paramount Pictures \n\"Miracle on 34th Street\" (1994) \nA typical feel good Christmas movie to remind everyone that Santa Clause is really real. A woman is tasked with hiring a Santa Clause look-a-like to pose for pictures at a department store when she comes across a man named Kris Kringle--who happens to really be Santa. 20th Century Fox \n\"A Russell Peters Christmas Special\" \nSometimes, we don't want cuddly sentimental Christmas movies with cute dogs and love stories. Sometimes, we just want to laugh. \nIn comes comedian Russell Peters with a Christmas special Netflix \n\"November Rule\" \nWhile this isn't, on its, face, your typical Christmas Holiday movie, it does involve a guy who breaks up with his girlfriend because of his self-declared November rule -- which means that every November he has to break up with the woman he's with to avoid the lovey attachment of the holidays. I think you can guess what kind of holiday turn this plot is gonna take. Capitol Love \n\"Christmas With The Kranks\" \nThe Kranks cause a riot when they decide to skip Christmas and go on a vacation instead (the blasphemy) because their daughter is away in Peru. After almost heading out the door for their cruise, their daughter decides she's coming home after all, leaving the Kranks scrambling to get a fancy Christmas party together in the nick of time. Columbia Pictures \n\"Mickey's Magical Christmas\" \nYou can never go wrong with Mickey and Christmas especially when the movie features pretty much all of the Disney characters from Donald Duck to Aladdin's Jafar. Disney \n\"Marry Me for Christmas\" \nMost people dread the holidays because they don't want to be asked about who they're dating, when they're getting married/pregnant, etc. In this movie, a woman gets one step ahead of the game when she enlists her employee to pretend to be her fiancee to make her family happy. UP \n\"Beethoven's Christmas Adventure\" \nThere are very few things better than Beethoven the dog in a Santa hat trying to rescue an elf and save Christmas. Universal Pictures \n\"Santa Buddies\" \nOne of the few things better than Beethoven trying to save Christmas: Air Bud's puppies trying to save Christmas. Disney \n\"12 Dates of Christmas\" \nA woman keeps reliving Christmas Eve, including a date with a man named Miles, over and over again. How horrible. \n\"Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas\" \nThis movie is like having your grandparents read Christmas stories to you--except its Mickey and his friends which is even better in our opinion. Disney \n\"Snow Day\" \nEvery kid's dream: not having school because of a snow day. In this movie, kids try to stop a snowplow from cleaning up the streets to keep their school snowed in. It's not actually a Christmas movie, but all the snow should get you in the holiday spirit. Paramount Pictures Next Slide 1 of 18 \nA playlist of holiday films you can unapologetically binge watch from “Last Holiday” to “Love Actually” \nThe only reason people love this time of year is because it's now appropriate to binge watch a whole bunch of Christmas movies. So instead of wasting your time browsing for the best holiday movies, TheWrap's got you covered with 18 of our favorites.",

      "text": "(WFLA) — Yep, you read that right. Netflix subscribers can now download movies and TV shows to watch anytime and anywhere – with no internet connection.\nNetflix said in a blog post Tuesday night, “Many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline. For example, Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown are available for download today.”\nNetflix isn’t the first streaming tycoon to introduce a downloading feature, though. Amazon released a similar program to the Prime video streaming over a year ago.\nNetflix hasn’t discussed the quantity of files you can download yet, but their help page does say there are two different quality standards for downloads. The company also warns the higher quality video will take longer to download and use up more space on your device.\nStick with WFLA News Channel 8’s Lila Gross for more trending and viral news.\nhttp://wx.wfla.com/oembed/app_promo/app_dl.html ",

There is a brand new download button that will pop up on content that’s available to download so that you can avoid consuming data on road trips or prepare a movie for a long airplane ride. That includes TV shows as well as movies and documentaries.\nAs it stands, Netflix’s available content for offline viewing is pretty limited, but they will be expanding availability from here on out. Netflix’s first-party shows and movies are available for offline viewing right out of the gate, but there are also some third-party options as well.\nIt’s a start, at least.\nIf you want to see what’s available to download, you can select a new option within the updated Netflix app for “Available for Download.” That’ll give you a list of options.\nAre you excited for offline viewing in Netflix?",

      "text": "Netflix now lets you watch your favorite shows offline Posted: Netflix streaming device -- Apple TV. A standard Netflix mailer including DVD and return envelope. Reed Hastings, Netflix's CEO, will be granted half the stock options he received in 2011, but his salary was not cut. Beauty shots of Netflix corporate headquarter campus Beauty shots of Netflix corporate headquarter campus By Sara Ashley O'Brien \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- It just got even easier to binge on Netflix. \nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. Members will want to make sure they have the most recent Netflix app on their Android or iOS devices to access the new \"download\" button. \nUp until now, you needed a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on the go. \nYou'll find Orange Is the New Black, Narcos and The Crown available -- but you can't download everything. Shows like the new season of Gilmore Girls, Friends and New Girl are restricted for now. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a \"short term fix for a bigger problem.\" That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix's Help Center page, \"you'll want to delete\" downloaded titles before attempting to download new content. \nThat's because some licensing agreements have limits on the number of titles people can download at the same time. The length of time Netflix users will have to watch a show or movie will vary by title. The \"My Downloads\" page will show members how long, such as 48 hours, they have with each title. \nThe company said in an email to CNNMoney it is working with \"lots\" of partners globally on securing downloading rights \"for the bulk of the content on our service.\" \nTM &© 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "By Kevin Fitzpatrick November 30, 2016 9:06 AM | ScreenCrush Netflix \nIt’s not quite a streaming service hooked up to your eyeballs , but if there’s one thing Netflix subscribers have clamored for, its the ability to watch TV and movies on occasions where internet connections aren’t explicitly available. So it is, that Netflix will now let viewers download its programs at no extra cost. \nNow display as download option in Netflix apps, the new feature offers subscribers a chance to view programs offline in a lower-resolution “Standard” option, or a Higher version that naturally requires more time and storage space. Here’s how Netflix describes the feature , which is already applicable to shows like Orange Is the New Black , Narcos and The Crown as of today: \nWhile many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection. […] \nThe new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nNetflix has seemed apprehensive of an offline mode in the past, though rival streaming services like Amazon Instant Video have already enabled the format. It’s unclear if Netflix will make their entire catalogue available, but let’s just say your next flight got a heck of a lot less boring. \nStay tuned for further details in the meantime.",

      "text": "Netflix Offers Users Ability to Download Content to Watch on the Go More Netflix has made a range of TV shows and movies available to download so you can watch even without an Internet connection, the company announced on Wednesday. “While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their ‘Stranger Things’ binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” Netflix said in a statement. “Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.” Netflix originals like “Stranger Things,” “Orange Is the New Black,” “Narcos,” “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” and “House of Cards” are currently available for download. Other shows, like “Supernatural,” “The 100,” “The Office,” and “The Flash” are also available. Also Read: 'Gilmore Girls': 10 Theories About 'A Year in the Life's' Unanswered Questions The new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. The move comes over a year after Amazon Prime began offering users the ability to download their streaming content. Netflix had previously said they were considering offline viewing as an option for users, but it depended on a number of factors. Cliff Edwards, a director of corporate communications at Netflix, told Tech Radar that allowing offline viewing was a “short term fix for a bigger problem,” such as unreliable Wi-Fi coverage affecting video playback.

      "text": "Photo-Illustration: Vulture and Netflix \nNetflix announced today that it's finally enabling users to download shows and movies for those times when internet is hard to come by — flights and subway rides and such. It's a much-anticipated feature, one that rivals such as Amazon have long offered, and it's sure to improve the overall Netflix experience. (App users need to just make sure they have the latest version.) But that's simply the latest and most publicized way to get more out of your Netflixing. Here's an assortment of other tips and tricks to ensure that you're squeezing every bit of binge-watching goodness out of your account.\n1. Save Your Mobile Data (or Use a Ton )\nStreaming in HD devours data, so if you're using the Netflix mobile app, be careful not to blow past your mobile plan's data limits. To be certain that you don't, navigate to the app's \"Cellular Data Usage\" setting to toggle between Wi-Fi only, low, medium, high, and unlimited settings. That \"unlimited\" option lets it go crazy — according to a Netflix rep, it uses about 1 gigabyte every 20 minutes.\nAlternately, just remember to download anything you want to watch while you're wrapped in a warm blanket of Wi-Fi at home. Then you'll never again have to worry about data limits.\n2. Watch in HD \nYou can keep things cranking in high-def by going to Netflix's playback settings menu , though first make that your subscription allows for high-definition viewing. Bonus: You can also use the playback settings menu to turn off the auto-play feature that keeps episodes rolling.\n3. Say Good-Bye to Pixelation \nYour Netflix resolution can turn on a dime. The service is constantly evaluating your internet connection, automatically cranking the clarity up or down depending on available bandwidth. The good: The service does a pretty solid job, even if your internet sucks. The bad and the ugly: Sucking internet can cause your once-clear picture to quickly deteriorate into a mess of pixels. Luckily, you can take control of this automatic process to ramp up your resolution, even if your internet is shaky.\nFirst, you need to unlock some hidden menus. While your movie is playing in a browser, hit Control+Shift+Alt+S (or Control+Shift+Option+S if you're on a Mac). This will bring up a menu with a series of columns. Find the one that says \"Video Bitrate,\" highlight the highest figure available, and click \"Override.\" Highlighting more than one number (perhaps the top three or four) will allow Netflix to switch between a few selections, giving it some wiggle room while still keeping things from looking like a Cubist painting. One thing to note: There's a reason Netflix downscales resolution for poor internet connections. If your 'tubes can't handle high-def, expect buffering. \n\n4. Rate Everything for Better Recommendations \nNo matter what you watch, the five-star rating system will help Netflix's algorithm narrow down the best suggestions for your unique tastes. You can further refine those recommendations by breaking out different profiles for each member of your household.\n5. Add Trailers, Rotten Tomatoes Scores, and IMDb Ratings \nIn Netflix's typical layout, you're offered star ratings based on what users with similar tastes to your own thought of a movie or show. But do you demand more, including critics' rankings? Then you'll want to take advantage of the free Chrome extension NEnhancer . The tool allows you to see a film's Rotten Tomatoes score as well as its IMDb rating and pop-up trailers.\n6. Learn How to Find Better Movies \nWith such a vast catalogue, half the fun of Netflix (and most of the challenge) is simply finding something you want to watch. A few years ago, several sites began using Netflix's public API to sort movies by rankings like Rotten Tomatoes score. Unfortunately, Netflix revoked its public API in 2014, and many of these sites withered away. Still, a handful of third-party sites live on, either because they've figured out workarounds or have been granted private API access by Netflix. A few good ones to start with: AllFlicks and InstantWatcher . The Best of Netflix subreddit is another solid source of suggestions. (Also consider swinging by Vulture's What to Stream Now hub .)\n7. Unlock Hidden Categories \nNetflix is known for its absurdly niche categorizations — in January 2014, The Atlantic charted more than 76,000 subcategories on the service — but the site only shows each user a tiny sliver of it full catalogue, making it difficult for users to dig deep.\nThankfully, accessing these subcategories is pretty easy. All that's required is a simple URL hack, where Netflix assigns each category a number. If you copy and paste the Web address \"https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/NUMBER,\" just replace \"NUMBER\" with the category's designated number, and it will bring you to the desired genre. Sites such as netflixcodes.me and netflixhiddencodes.com make it easy to find the category codes for genres that interest you. Just how specific does this get? The code \"1\" gives you \"African-American Crime Documentaries,\" while \" \" gives you \"Movies Starring Cher.\"\n8. Don't Just Search for Titles \nNetflix lets you search for a lot more than just movies or TV shows. Typing \"Netflix\" into the search bar will show you Netflix's original programming, while searching for \"4K\" or \"HDR\" limits results to content that streams in these next-gen standards — a great way to make use of a new 4K or HDR-enabled TV.\n9. Pick the Best ISP for Streaming \nIt's tough to know how well your internet provider handles data-hungry services like Netflix. Thankfully, Netflix's site offers an ISP speed index that ranks different providers in a wide variety of countries by how well they can handle your binges. Verizon FiOS comes out on tops in the U.S., while New York stalwart Time Warner Cable chugs along at sixth place, just behind Comcast. (We'll see if that changes post-merger .)\n10. Remember Your Keyboard Shortcuts \nNetflix is chock-full of shortcuts that let you leave the mouse alone. For easy reference, here they are :\nThe space bar and enter key function as pause/play buttons. PgDn pauses, while PgUp plays. F will take you to full screen; Esc will take you out of it. Shift + left arrow will rewind, while shift + right arrow will fast forward. The up and down arrows should impact volume levels. M is a toggle for mute. 11. Make Subtitles More Legible \nWant to tweak your font size or color of subtitles? Go to your account page and select \"subtitle appearance.\" You can even mess with the text's background and shadow.\n12. Kick Freeloading Friends to the Curb \nIf you've been generous with your Netflix password over the years, there's no telling how many leeches are using your account (and seriously messing with your algorithm). To give them all the boot at once, go to your account page and select the option to \"sign out of all devices.\" Then change your password while trying to resist cackling maniacally.\n13. Try Out New Features Early \nNetflix is constantly rolling out new features designed to enhance the viewing experience. If you want to get first dibs, you can opt into their \"test participation\" program by going to your account page and selecting the option for \"test participation.\"\nNote: Vulture published a previous list of Netflix hacks in 2014. This updated list includes several of the original tips that are still working and relevant.",

      "text": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video NEW YORK — You can now Netflix and chill without internet connection.\nNetflix is allowing users to download their favorite TV shows and movies on its streaming services to watch offline. The streamin service announced Friday that the new feature will be available worldwide.\n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" the streaming service wrote in a press release.\nSo Netflix lovers will no longer have to worry about data usage or searching for the nearest wifi connection.\nOnly a few shows, such as \"Orange is the New Black,\" \"Narcos\" and \"The Crown\" are available for download, but Netflix promises more will be added in the near future.\nThe feature is available for all phones and tablets on Android and iOS.\nNetflix seems to be a latecomer to the offline-streaming world. Amazon offers an offline viewing option for select movies and TV shows on its Instant Video service. Epix and Starz also have the same service.",

Just like YouTube and Google Play Movies, Netflix users can now cache titles they want to watch to their mobile device’s storage, then playback whenever is best for them. <span id=\"more-194216\"></span>\nAccording to Netflix, not all titles are available for this, but plenty are. For example, The Crown, Orange is the New Black, and Narcos are available, and plenty more are on the way.

Deal. \nItching to follow the life and times of Queen Elizabeth II in \"The Crown\" while you travel underground in a dingy subway like the rest of us simple peons? Sure, why the hell not. \nThe feature is currently available for select movies and shows, but the company says more downloadable choices are on the way. \nThere is one catch: the new option is limited to the Netflix app on iOS and Android devices, so off-line binge-watching on your laptop is still out of reach — for now.

Free for Subscribers Tech By Tucker Bowe \nIf you’re a Netflix subscriber — which you probably are, since there are roughly 86 million of you — you can now watch most of your favorite movies and shows offline. All you need to do is download the latest update to the Netflix app, available today on Android and iOS. In the app, a download button appears next to the shows and movies that allow the new offline feature. You can download videos in either “standard” or “higher” quality; Netflix doesn’t specify the exact difference between the two, but the higher-res videos take more time to download and require more storage on your phone. \nLike Amazon Prime Video, which has had this offline feature for a while, there is a limited selection of programming from which to download content. Still, commuters, people on airplane mode and those who aren’t always connected to wi-fi will see the new feature as something of a godsend. Netflix has always allowed subscribers to stream via cellular data, but performance is spotty when the LTE connection is unreliable, like if you go under a tunnel or travel through rural America, and it’s a killer for people with data caps. Those without data caps will be pleased to learn that you can download content on wi-fi or LTE, unlike with Amazon Prime Video. And for all 86 million Netflix subscribers, offline viewing won’t cost anything extra. A Beer Nerd’s Guide to Netflix and Chill \nThe brews to buy before movie night. Read the Story Next Up",

      "text": "Netflix enables downloads of select content for offline viewing on iOS, Android   06:55 am PT (09:55 am ET) Netflix has deployed the ability to download select TV shows and movies from its catalog, with most of the initial offerings coming from the company's unique programming. Netflix has announced that \"Stranger Things,\" \"Orange is The New Black,\" \"Narcos\" and \"The Crown\" are available for download today. After users update the Netflix app, a \"download now\" button is available on content with downloads enabled. Users can download in smaller file size \"standard\" and \"higher\" quality options, but Netflix has not as of yet provided technical details on the resolutions or bit rates of the downloaded video categories. AppleInsider has contacted T-Mobile regarding if downloads for offline viewing would count against data caps, or be somehow down-sampled through the \"Binge On\" initiative , and has not as of yet received a response. Netflix has historically denied that it was planning on downloads for offline viewing, but Amazon's recent addition of the feature with its streaming video service may have been an impetus to allowing it. Netflix promises more titles will be made available for download soon. The new download feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. Topics:",

      "text": "Notch up another win for 2016. Despite all of its initial promise, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life has tainted the rest of the series for the worse. This article contains spoilers for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . \nThe responses to Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life have been mixed , and most have understandably focused on the long-awaited final four words of the show. Fans have been shocked and unsurprised, have loved them and hated them. I have seen many fans comment, “I loved everything about the revival — ignoring the final four words.” But how can you ignore the plot point that undoes so much of what you love so dearly about a show in the first place? \nRelated: Gilmore Girls revival: What the final four words mean for the series \nThe final four words have long concerned me. Amy Sherman-Palladino’s insistence that she knew how the show was going to end meant when she left the show prior to season 7, fans had to navigate a final season that was not what the show’s creator envisioned. For this reason season 7 is both heavily criticized for being ‘different’ and ‘wrong,’ while also being forgiven as some alternate-universe ending that one day, hopefully, Sherman-Palladino would correct. It was okay if things didn’t end exactly how we hoped; after all, this wasn’t the ‘real’ ending. \nThere was no possible way for every fan’s hopes for this ‘real’ ending to be encapsulated within four words. Yet for many fans (and undoubtedly for Netflix), those final four words were the entire selling point of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . In contrast, while rewatching the entire series over the past few months, I did my best not to think about them. I assumed the words themselves would be anticlimactic, but I was okay with that. But after hearing the final four words in the revival, I wondered just what show I had been watching all of these years. \nSherman-Palladino claims she has never watched Gilmore Girls season 7, but clearly someone has filled her in on the details because the Netflix revival was nothing if not a rewrite of what could have been. With the exception of Emily’s plot arc, a result of Edward Herrmann’s unfortunate death, you can easily see how Lorelai and Rory’s stories could have played out over a final season or two. And while the will-they-won’t-they of Luke and Lorelai’s slow meander towards marriage might have been at times tiresome, it was Rory who suffered the most when revival storylines were dealt out. \nThat the revival ended with Rory announcing her pregnancy is not the issue. The desire to bring the show full circle is understandable, and even more so with the added dose of nostalgia that any revival must grapple with. But in order to get Rory to this place, her entire character had to be rewritten. \nCounter opinion: Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life review: A messy, must-see for fans \nWe saw after Rory lost her virginity to Dean how troubling both Gilmores found infidelity, but that is long forgotten here. And rather than the Rory who stays up all night to plan and make lists for every eventuality, 2016 Rory doesn’t even have a single pitch prepared when she goes to a job interview. We are told that after scoring a dream job reporting on the Obama campaign, Rory is now essentially unemployable with only a few bylines to her name—and not because of the tenuous job market, but because she is demonstrably ill-equipped and unprepared to work as a freelancer. \nThis all makes sense when we remember that Sherman-Palladino had this ending planned for the end of the TV run, for a Rory aged 23. A Year in the Life does its best to undo all of Rory’s hard work and development, to essentially get her back to a quarter-life crisis moment. But what might have worked at 23 doesn’t at 32, and Rory’s behavior in her job interviews, her woeful attempts at interviewing people on the street for her article, and her inability to remember her own boyfriend’s name just aren’t cute or endearing at this age. \nStill, Rory pregnant at 32 is different from pregnant at 23, especially within a show about the struggles of her mother, who gave birth at 16. If Sherman-Palladino had her way originally, Rory wouldn’t have been much older. Of course the circumstances of the situation may have been different than depicted in the revival. Rory may have been in a real relationship, and may have not been cheating on her boyfriend with an old college ex. But the parallels between Logan and Christopher are not new, and as Sherman-Palladino chose Logan as the (most likely) father to Rory’s unborn child, it’s safe to assume he would have also been the choice nine years ago. \nLorelai’s ability to build a life from scratch without assistance from her parents — a life she clearly loved, and did not feel was any kind of consolation prize — was one of her most admirable qualities. But Gilmore Girls spent seven seasons showing us that Rory was going to have more than this. Rory wanted to be a foreign correspondent, to travel, to make a difference. She would walk the line between her grandparents’ world of money and prestige, and her mother’s values of independence and honesty. She would be the one to have it all. \nExcept she wasn’t, because she was supposed to be pregnant at 23. And, as Gilmore Girls refuses to mention the “A”-word of abortion, she was almost certainly going to become a mother. Indeed, at 23 and back in Stars Hollow, she would essentially have become her mother. \nWe might argue that Rory could have had a child at 23 and pursued all of her career goals, but the context of Gilmore Girls tells us differently. This show tells us that when you have a child, you give something up. Lorelai gave up her family and financial security. Lane gave up her dreams. Sherry wasn’t happy with her sacrifice, but in order to get her freedom back she had to give up her child. \nThe unfortunate message that there is no way for a young woman to have it all continues in the Gilmore Girls revival. You can be Paris Gellar—successful at work, two adorable children, a beautiful home — but you’ll not only be plagued by a potent case of imposter syndrome, you’re divorced. You can be Lane Kim—an unfortunately ageing husband and kids you love—just remember you have to give up your rock and roll dreams on the way. Or you can be Rory—either 23, and repeating your mother’s mistakes, or 32, and back in your home town, working a job that doesn’t pay, homeless, planning a very niche memoir, and with an unplanned child on the way. \nAttending Chilton, working at the Yale Daily News , her disappointments with Mitchum Huntzberger and with the New York Times didn’t matter. Her ambition didn’t matter. This was how it was always going to end, with Rory back in Stars Hollow and with a baby on the way. It is Ted standing under Robin’s window with a blue French horn all over again. \nIf Sherman-Palladino wanted to write a story of a thirty-something having a second quarter-life crisis, that would be fine. A change in career is nothing revolutionary, and it might have been refreshing to see Rory’s goals change. Even in the original show, Rory’s biggest character flaw was always her failure to recognize her own privilege, and watching her struggle with the realization that financial security can’t fix everything would have been incredibly satisfying. But while it is tempting to frame A Year in the Life through this lens, this is not the story that was told. \nIn season 7 I thought Lane was the outlier — the side character who suffered an ungenerous fate under a new show runner — a fate I assured myself would not have happened had Sherman-Palladino been steering the ship. But Lane was the mark of the future; she just happened to be the one to lose out first. \nAfter seven seasons of a show that supposedly celebrates its female characters and their differences, in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life I watched six hours of young women being punished for daring to dream bigger than their circumstances. And if this is the story Amy Sherman-Palladino intended to tell all along — if this is what we were always working toward — then Gilmore Girls was never the show I thought it was. And that truly breaks my heart.",

In the meantime, many of Netflix's original series, including Orange Is the New Black , Narcos and The Crown , are available to download right now. \nThe 25 best Netflix originals, ranked \nSubscribers can access the download feature on their Apple and Android devices through the Netflix app, which now includes a \"download\" button on the Details page. The download feature is included in all Netflix plans, although users will need iOs 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later to access it, along with the most recent version of the Netflix app. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com",

      "text": "23 'Gilmore Girls' references you may have missed in the Netflix revival   11:33 AM Megan Willett, INSIDER - Business Insider \nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" \nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming. \nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way. \nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all. Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year.Warner Bros. \nIn episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming. \nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing. Lorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix \nLorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival. In the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. \nWhile working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down. \nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together. Emily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \n\"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting. Gypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. \nIn season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep. \nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car. There are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons \nThat album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather. And this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix \nEdward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen. \nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years. \nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. The Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix \nHe's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips. It mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. \nThe Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour. \nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post. We finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix \nFans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him? \nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well. Lorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix \nShe tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year. Season six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. The Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \n\"Gilmore Guys\" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted. Richard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix \nIn the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her. This plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. \nLuke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \"Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\" \n\"There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \"I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\" \nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die. Lorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix \nWhen she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\" \nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now. When Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. \nRory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her: LORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate. RORY: Right. LORELAI: And alumnus is a man. RORY: Singular. LORELAI: So an unmarried man? RORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural. LORELAI: And plural is alumni. RORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys. LORELAI: Kinky! RORY: No, not kinky, just what it is. \nIt appears she forgot this lesson. The Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix \nIn this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath. The Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. \nWhile Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom. \nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans. Taylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. \nThe whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable. \n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\" Carole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix \nKing plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town. \nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use. The fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \n\"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist. \nTaylor deems Sophie's song \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" not catchy enough. Logan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. \nRory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom. \nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process. When Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. \nRichard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard. Of course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. \nShe was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood. When Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix \nIn the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket. Richard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. \nThey decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them. \nYou can read more about the scene here. Rory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix \nRory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed. Sookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros.\nIn the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\" \nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments. While they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "\nIt was about time! People have been asking for an offline viewing option on Netflix for years, and starting today, the company has finally started offering the feature for the smartphone and tablet version of their app.\nWhile many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.\nNot all movies and TV shows will be available while offline, but those that are, including many of Netflix’s original series, will include a tiny button that indicates “Download now to watch offline later.” The service plans to add more titles that support “offline viewing” in the near future.\n[Via Netflix ]\nThe post Netflix Finally Adds Offline Viewing Feature appeared first on Geeks are Sexy Technology News .\n",

(mphillips007/iStock/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, November 30, 2016, 11:46 AM \nYou can now watch “Stranger Things” on your phone when you aren’t connected to the internet. \nNetflix announced Wednesday that subscribers can now download shows and movies onto their Apple and Android mobile devices to watch offline. \nSome of the shows available to download are originals like “Stranger Things” and “Orange is the New Black.” However, not every show and movie the service offers can be downloaded. \nEddy Wu, Netflix’s director of product innovation, said in a statement on Netflix’s site that a menu is available within the app showing each user what can be downloaded. \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,” Wu said. \nMore titles will be available for download in the near future. \nNetflix looks to keep up with competition that already has offline viewing. Amazon Prime’s video service has offered offline to users for over a year, as has YouTube Red subscribers. \nThe new download feature in the app is available for Android and iOS phones.

      "text": "New on Netflix December2016 by Ryan Painter \nWe picked out a few standouts among the scores of movies and TV shows coming to Netflix next month. (MGN Online) A A \n( KUTV ) It's time again when we say goodbye to a few old Netflix friends and welcome in a collection of new strangers. Here are six titles that caught my attention. \nAlways (1989) \nI'm not going to try and convince you that \" Alway s\" ranks among Steven Spielberg 's best films. I do, however, think it is one of his most underappreciated. Inspired by the film \" A Guy Named Joe, \" \"Always\" was a passion project for Spielberg and Richard Dreyfuss . Yes, \"Always\" feels like it was written for another time and stood out as a peculiarity in 1989. It was a modest success at the box office, but fell well short of 1990's \" Ghost ,\" which essentially took some of the same ideas and made them more timely. Sometimes being \"timely\" limits a film's shelf life. I probably wouldn't sit down to watch \"Ghost\" again; I'll happily watch \"Always\" for John Goodman 's performance alone. \nFor the Love of Spock (2016) \nI regret that I was never able to talk with Leonard Nimoy . Whereas William Shatner seems to view his time spent on \" Star Trek \" with a certain amount of contempt (which made interviewing him for the 50th anniversary of the series rather difficult), Nimoy seemed at peace with being forever associated with the character Spock. It wasn't the only role he ever had, but it is the role that he will be remembered for. \"For the Love of Spock,\" directed by the actor's son, Adam Nimoy, explores the enduring popularity of Spock and the relationship that the actor had with the character and its fans. \nThe Angry Birds Movie (2016) \nThis one is for the kids. As someone who isn't familiar with all the backstory behind the film (you'd be forgiven if you, like myself, didn't think there was any backstory) there really wasn't anything to here to hold my attention. However, a particular 5-year-old boy, an \"Angry Birds\" expert, was able to fill in me regarding the many plot holes and explained to me exactly how the film fit into the gaming franchise. \nThe Crucible (1996) \nThe pairing of Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder might not be as exciting today as it was 20 years ago (when Ryder was still the beginning and the end of all things for 20-year-old me), but I still enjoy watching the duo in Nicholas Hytner 's cinematic adaptation of Arthur Miller 's play inspired by the Salem witch trials and McCarthyism of the 1950s. Art is at its best when it is dangerous. \nMarvel’s Captain America: Civil War (2016) \nDepending on how high \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\" soars, \"Captain America: Civil War\" will finish as one of the top two grossing films of 2016. Christmas morning the film will be available to stream on Netflix. Gather around the TV as friends turn on each other because of different ideologies. It's purely fiction, right? I mean, if superheroes can't get along what change do we, the regular folks, have? (Available 12/25/16) \nThe Eighties: Season 1 (2016) \nJust as we say goodbye to 2016 Netflix brings CNN's \"The Eighties\" to streaming. As a child of the era I have my own ideas regarding the decade, but I always enjoy hearing different people talk about a time we all love for very different reasons. (Avail. 12/30/16) \nHere's a complete list of titles coming to Netflix in December: \nAvail. 12/1/16 Angels in the Snow (2015)Beverly Hills Cop (1984)",

It has a respectable catalogue which you pay a reasonable amount of money to access and albeit this sounds great, it has had one major problem.\nYou may be watching a certain TV show or movie on Netflix but the ability to download and watch it later was not there. This meant that you had to stream everytime from where you stopped, which is quite inconveniencing in some situations.\nOn June this year, it was reported that Netflix would add the ability to watch content offline on the app and now it has been made official by the company.\n\nIf you want to watch your favourite TV show or movie on the Netflix app, you only need to tap on the download button shown above to view the content while offline. This is available on the details page. Netflix says that many of your favourite streaming series are already available for download like Narcos, Orange Is The New Black and The Crown , which are part of its original programming.\nThis is what I was waiting for the company to implement since they made Netflix available globally . The idea of downloading a show to watch later on will benefit situations like when you are travelling or you were not able to stream at the moment. YouTube also has the feature baked in its app and it is one of the best things about it.\nThe new feature will be available today on Android and iOS (both smartphones and tablets) so make sure to update your respective apps.\nRead On Web → Netflix’s New Feature Takes Streaming Out Of The Equation \n",

      "text": "Netflix Made a Gilmore Girls 'Binge Candle' That Smells Different as You Burn Through Each Episode Smell-O-Vision is almost real! By Sami Main November 30, 2016, 12:09 PM EST You can binge watch or binge read. And now you can even binge smell! Check out the Binge Candle, created by Netflix (with help from TBWA\\Chiat\\Day) to help promote the Gilmore Girls revival. There are four 90-minute episodes as part of Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life, each related to a specific season. The series follows the lives of Lorelai, Rory and Emily as they go through winter, spring, summer and fall of 2016. When you start your marathon of all four episodes, totaling around six hours of Gilmores, you start burning the Binge Candle. As it burns, it's perfectly timed to give off a different scent for each episode that correlates to that season. Hopefully Kirk's pig Petal is excluded from this smell experience. The show originally went off the air in 2007, where it was broadcast on first the WB and then the CW network. After nine years, fans were treated to the revival episodes on Nov. 25, exclusively on Netflix. Show creators Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband Daniel returned to finish the story as they always intended to do. As you hear the final four words of the series (unless Netflix and the Sherman-Palladinos strike another deal at some point), the candle will extinguish. Very dramatic ambience for a very dramatic moment! The candle is a part of a limited giveaway for fans of the series in the U.S., Asia and Europe, as well as readers of Hello Giggles and Brit+Co. Understandably, fans are totally excited for this heightened experience. Grab your PopTarts and Red Vines to nosh on, but keep them away from the candle. No need to interrupt this \"wax ingenuity\" with your snack foods. CREDITS",

The newly produced episodes continued a story that went off the air back in 2007, when President Obama was still Senator Obama, and our favorite fictional reporter, Rory Gilmore, was headed out on his campaign bus. We lived without Rory and her mom, Lorelai Gilmore, for nearly 10 years, and suddenly they were back. Now the series has ended again, possibly for good, and we all have to sort through that as best as we can. So how do we feel about the drive-by that was Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. Dazed? Confused? Happy? Drunk? All of it?\n\n*Kaitlyn Tiffany: *The last words...",

      "text": "Holiday Buyer's Guide How to download, manage Netflix shows on your phone or tablet After years of users begging for offline access to Netflix shows and movies, the company has given in. How to download, manage Netflix shows on your phone or tablet 0 Up Next Another Cyber Monday, another online sales record \nThe day has finally arrived! It's now possible to download shows and movies using the Netflix app to watch when you're on a plane, or without an internet connection. Heck, downloading Netflix content is a super easy way to save on your mobile data plan while on the go. \nBefore you get too excited, the first thing to do is install the latest version of the Netflix app on your iOS or Android device. \nAccording to Netflix, the new feature works on Android devices running Android 4.4.2 and up, as well as iOS 8.0 or later. Download away! Enlarge Image Photo by Jason Cipriani/CNET \nThe first time you launch the app after updating, Netflix displays a dialogue showing the download symbol used to initiate a download. More importantly, at the bottom of the popup is a link that takes you to all of the movies and shows you can currently download. Select it! Don't worry if you close the prompt before reading it, there's a new Available for Download category within the app. \nDownloading a show is as easy as tapping on the download button and letting the app take care of the rest. Naturally, you'll want to have a Wi-Fi connection when doing so. \nAlternatively, you can always look for the download button when browsing the Netflix catalog. \nYou can set the download quality by opening the menu and going to App Settings and choosing between standard and high Video Quality . High will take up more storage space on your phone. Managing your downloads Enlarge Image Photo by Jason Cipriani/CNET \nTo view and manage your downloaded shows, slide out the menu drawer and tap open My Downloads . Downloaded shows are grouped together, showing the number of episodes and amount of storage each show or movie is using on your device. \nUnlike other apps, the only limitation to the amount of storage Netflix will use is the amount of storage your phone has. In other words, if you have a 128GB phone, you can use as much of that as you want to store shows you normally binge watch. \nIn the My Downloads section, tap on a show or movie followed by the blue phone icon next to each episode or movie to delete it. You can also tap on the Edit button at the top of the screen to delete more than one show at a time. \nTo delete all downloads in one step, open the menu drawer then tap on App Settings followed by Delete All Downloads .

      "text": "You can now download, watch Netflix shows offline By Allen Cone | Nov. 30, 2016 at 11:57 AM Comments \nLOS GATOS, Calif., Nov. 30 (UPI) -- Netflix customers can now download film and televisions shows and watch them on mobile devices while offline, the company announced Wednesday. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, director of Product Innovation, for Netflix wrote Wednesday. \nMany series and movies are already available for download, including Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown, and more will be available, Wu said. \nThe new feature is included in all plans for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. The service is not available yet for the desktop. \nSome licensed shows and movies aren't available offline. \nNetflix users need to update their app to the most recent version in order to use the new feature. Then, they can click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series. They then can watch it later without an Internet connection. \nA new category on the Netflix app's side menu, called \"Available for Download,\" displays all the programs available offline. Also, an arrow next to the title indicates if it can be downloaded. \nNetflix, on its help page. said users should delete downloaded titles before adding new content because some licensing agreements limit the number of titles they can have downloaded at a time. \nNetflix is making the change as Amazon's Prime video service added the offline feature last year.",

      "text": "Netflix reaches out to binge watchers, unveiling download feature for offline viewing Filed under Technology at Get Daily Dallas News Headlines Sign Up   \nNetflix Inc. is making some TV shows and movies available to watch offline, providing its users a feature that has become a must-have in emerging markets with spotty internet access as well as for American binge-watchers on the go. \nThe world's largest online TV network will roll out its new download feature on phones and tablets for all subscribers, but only for select shows such as \"The Crown\" and \"Orange is the New Black\" at first, according to a statement Wednesday. \nNetflix has been signaling it would add a downloading option in recent months, as a way to continue increasing its subscriber base and match video-streaming rival Amazon.com Inc. Offline viewing will make Netflix shows more accessible to customers around the world, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa. \nShares of the Los Gatos, California-based company rose as much as 2.4 percent to $120.37 in New York Wednesday. \nNetflix has 86.7 million customers worldwide, 47.5 million of whom live in the U.S. The company now relies on international markets for most of its growth, and earlier this year expanded its footprint to the entire world, save for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" said Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation, in a web post. \nAs part of an update to Netflix's mobile app, a \"download and watch later\" icon will now appear for subscribers below program information. \nThe new feature is included at no extra charge in all plans and available on both Alphabet Inc.'s Android and Apple Inc.'s iOS platforms, the company said.

      "text": "- Source: Netflix \nStrike another reason to pirate TV shows off your list. Netflix now offers local download options for mobile device users, which means you can watch your favorite shows and movies anywhere without having to worry about chewing up expensive mobile data or maintaining a stable internet connection. \nStreaming services such as Netflix and Hulu go a long way in convincing people who pirate TV and movies not to bother. When you have access to a robust library of unlimited, affordable, on-demand content, there’s not much incentive to steal. \nOne of the only advantages to pirated content is its ability to access it locally, without the need for an internet connection right then and there. Streaming services require a solid network connection to watch videos, which limits where and when you can access content. You may want to watch a movie at the cabin or catch a TV show on a plane, but unless you have a locally saved file, you'll probably be tough out of luck. \nNetflix said its costumers often say that they want to continue binge watching their favorite content when they’re on the go, but mobile internet is expensive. So the company took the bold move of addressing that issue by enabling local downloads of its video library for mobile users. \nNetflix rolled out the downloads feature on November 30 to all subscription levels. If you have a Netflix account, you can download and store copies of Netflix content onto Android and iOS devices. The download service is not available for the desktop client. (We suspect this limitation is a countermeasure to curb the illegal distribution of the service's videos.) \nThe download feature isn’t available for everything in Netflix’s large catalog, but the selection is by no means sparse. You can already find dozens of TV shows, movies, and documentaries in the “Available for Download” section, and Netflix said it has “more on the way.” \nThe Netflix local download feature is live now. Simply download or update the mobile app to gain access to the new feature. Why would you pirate when great content is this accessible?

      "text": "By Jeff Baumgartner \nAfter indicating that it was warming to the idea, Netflix announced Wednesday that it has added an option that enables subscribers worldwide to download certain titles and play them back on smartphones and tablets while offline. \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection,” Eddy Wu, director of product innovation at Netflix, explained in this blog post. \nNot all of the Netflix streaming library supports the download option, though Netflix originals such as Orange Is The New Black , Narcos and The Crown are among those that are offered for download. \nWu noted that the feature is offered on all Netflix plans and supported on apps running on Android and iOS smartphones and tablets.",

The company announced today that subscribers will now be able to watch their favorite shows on the app without the use of an internet connection. Users can now use the \"Download\" option in the details of a film or tv show and have the series digitally downloaded to their app before they hit the town, go on vacation, or go off the grid. Not every title is available for download currently, but those wishing to test it out can find it available for Orange Is The New Black, Narcos, and The Crown. If you have the Netflix app on Android or iOS, you can try it out now! Let us know how it works!",

      "text": "24 min ago Taking these folks home for the holidays just got easier \nHoliday travel is about to get way more bearable, thanks to a long-anticipated update from Netflix . Members of the streaming service can now download their favourite shows for viewing on-the-go. \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” said Eddy Wu, the company’s director of product innovation, in a press release . “Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.” \nTitles that can be viewed offline now come with a download icon. You can also browse specifically in an “Available for Download” section. Once a show or movie has been downloaded, you’ll find it in your “My Downloads” section. \nOffline watching won’t cost you anything extra, but there are a couple of catches. The feature is only available for the newest version of Netflix, so update your smartphone/tablet app immediately. The feature is also only available for “select TV shows and movies.” So far that means Netflix Originals like Orange Is the New Black , Narcos , and The Crown . \nThe company promises more downloadable content is coming, and we’re also keeping fingers crossed for an offline mode for desktop. \nSign Up For A Daily Dose of D'Marge Email *",

      "text": "Netflix now lets you watch your favorite shows offline By Sara Ashley O'Brien, CNN | Updated - Nov 30th, 2016 @ 9:00am 3 \nNEW YORK (CNNMoney) — It just got even easier to binge on Netflix. \nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. Members will want to make sure they have the most recent Netflix app on their Android or iOS devices to access the new \"download\" button. \nUp until now, you needed a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on the go. \nYou'll find Orange Is the New Black, Narcos and The Crown available — but you can't download everything. Shows like the new season of Gilmore Girls, Friends and New Girl are restricted for now. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a \"short term fix for a bigger problem.\" That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix's Help Center page, \"you'll want to delete\" downloaded titles before attempting to download new content. \nThat's because some licensing agreements have limits on the number of titles people can download at the same time. The length of time Netflix users will have to watch a show or movie will vary by title. The \"My Downloads\" page will show members how long, such as 48 hours, they have with each title. \nThe company said in an email to CNNMoney it is working with \"lots\" of partners globally on securing downloading rights \"for the bulk of the content on our service.\" \nCopyright 2016 Cable News Network.

      "text": "  Netflix Now Lets You Download and Watch Offline — Here’s How All you need to know about the service’s long-awaited new feature by Aldrin Calimlim November 30, 2016 \nAt long last, Netflix has gained what is arguably its most requested feature: support for downloading videos for offline viewing. What does offline viewing mean? What does offline viewing mean? \nThat’s right. Finally, you can now save TV shows and movies for watching at a later time on your mobile device, even when you don’t have an internet connection. \nThis means that you don’t always have to be at home or need to have online access to binge-watch your favorite and trending TV shows and to finally get around to seeing the movies on your to-watch list. Especially for times when you’re not able to stream, like when you’re on an airplane or you’re on a commute with spotty internet, Netflix’s offline support will have you covered. What titles are available to download? What titles are available to download? \nIt’s important to note that not all titles on the service are available to download for offline viewing. Fortunately, many of the most popular TV shows and movies on the service already are. \nThese include, but are not limited to, films such as “North by Northwest,” “Pulp Fiction,” “Pacific Rim,” and “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” and the Netflix originals “Stranger Things,” “Black Mirror,” “The Crown,” “Orange is the New Black,” “House of Cards,” “Narcos,” and “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.” More titles will be supported over time. \nSee “How to download a title” below to find out how to browse downloadable content. What do I need to know? What do I need to know? \nDownloading for offline viewing is now available worldwide for Netflix subscribers across all plans, and is supported on smartphones and tablets running on Android or iOS.",

      "text": "At Long Last, Netflix Will Allow You To Watch Movies And Shows When You’re Not Online Nate Email \nEngadget – Netflix has long said that it had no intention of ever offering an offline playback mode for when you’re stuck on an airplane or anywhere else with no internet connection. But it seems like the company is changing course: An enigmatic tweet from the Netflix account says that “your favorite stories are now available for download any time.” It’s accompanied by a cute video with scenes from a bunch of Netflix original shows, but it seems as if the feature won’t be limited to only the company’s original content. Regardless of any catches, the message is clear: Netflix will finally let us save shows to watch when we don’t have an internet connection. \nIn a press release that just dropped, Netflix says that the feature will arrive later today in an app update for iOS and Android. The feature is pretty straightforward — when a show or movie is available to save offline, you’ll see a little “download” button. Netflix notes that many of its big shows, including Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown, are available to download today. \n\nIt’s no coincidence- I got Netflix last week and now they are letting people watch their shows at any time. They’ve been a company for like 15 years and in my first 10 days of having their service, boom, it gets infinitely better. \nAnd I’m siked for it, because people said it would never happen. Netflix has always denied they would allow it. And now after all this time, you will be able to download shows and movies onto your phone so you will never be without Netflix for as long as you live. On the Subway on the way to work, on flights over the ocean, at the end of the month when you’ve used up all your data and you’re dodging calls from your parents who are NOT HAPPY with you, you’ll never be without your shows. \nI just started Black Mirror yesterday and I’m not going to spoil it but episode 1 was about a guy fucking a pig. I cannot wait to watch that on a plane with a little old lady sitting next to me, glancing over at my screen. Netflix does it again!",

      "text": "NEW YORK — It just got even easier to binge on Netflix.\nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch Gilmore Girls and Stranger Things while on a flight or stuck in the subway.\nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships.\nUp until now, you need a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on-the-go.\nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability.\nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago.\nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download a new content.\nIt is unclear as of now if there’s a cap on how many shows or films people can download at once.\nNetflix did not immediately respond to CNNMoney’s request for comment",

      "text": "Shutterstock \nNetflix is rolling out an update for its Android and iOS apps that finally adds one of the most requested features for the popular video streaming service. The app will now allow users to download select TV shows and movies for offline playback.\nSee also: Netflix goes global, adding 130 more countries to its network January 7, 2016 There have been rumors for months that Netflix was going to add support for downloadable content, but today, the company flipped the switch on that feature. The bad news is that not every movie and TV series supports downloading for offline use, most likely due to previously copyright agreements with some studios.\n\nNetflix’s blog post indicates that some of its original TV shows like Stranger Things, Orange is the New Black, Narcos and The Crown all support the new download feature. As you can see from the screenshot above, users will be able to see if their movie or TV series can be downloaded with a downward arrow icon. The company says more films and TV shows will gain the download access feature in the coming months.\nThis new feature will be available worldwide across all of Netflix’s markets and best of all, the company won’t be raising its subscription fees or making people pay extra for downloading videos. This will certainly be a huge help for people who have a limited cellular data plan but who still want to binge watch videos while on the road or on an airplane flight, which normally does not support streaming media on Wi-Fi.\nOne word of warning: the change notes for the updated Netflix app shows that the downloadable video feature won’t work on all devices, but there’s no word on which Android products won’t support it.\nGet it on Google Play ",

Netflix hasn't released a full list of compatible shows, but it appears to mostly favor Netflix originals like \"Narcos\" and \"Stranger Things.\" It's unclear how many licensed titles from third parties will be available to download. \nAmazon Video, which offers thousands of free TV shows and movies for Prime members, lets you download just about any video for offline viewing. Netflix appears to be taking a more cautious approach to video downloads for now. \nThe \"Available for Download\" section on Netflix does include a variety of third-party shows and movies though, including \"Parks and Recreation,\" \"Mad Men,\" and a bunch of documentaries. Netflix said in a statement that \"many more\" titles are coming. \nScreenshot \nNetflix downloads work on iOS and Android devices. You'll need to update your Netflix app to the latest version, which launches Wednesday. A download button will appear next to the videos you can store for offline viewing. \nLike this: \nNetflix \nNetflix has historically been against allowing offline viewing, even as recently as the end of last year. But executives have loosened their opposition to video downloads this year, leading many to speculate it'd happen soon. Well, here it is, even if it's pretty limited for now. \nFindTheCompany | Graphiq",

Great for road trips in the middle of nowhere, right? Or that Metro commute to work. The new feature, which was announced on Netflix’s company blog and Twitter Wednesday morning, is mobile friendly, too. Even for you Android users. Many Netflix Original series are already available to download, a statement on the Netflix website says, including “Orange Is the New Black,”“Narcos,”“House of Cards,”“Stranger Things,”“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,”“Master of None” and “The Crown.” There are also a few non-Netflix shows you can watch offline, like “The Office,”“The Flash” and the animated movie “Minions,” according to Variety . The Netflix app just has to be updated to start downloading, and that’s it! Advertisement",

The feature lets users take Netflix movies and television shows with them even when they don’t have internet access. It is available for all Netflix subscribers and works on both Android and iOS platforms.\nWhile many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode.
