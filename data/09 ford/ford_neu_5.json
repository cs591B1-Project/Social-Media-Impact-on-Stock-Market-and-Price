      "text": "Black Friday discounts sure brought out those interested in a new ride, and then some.\nFord ( F ) reported on Thursday that sales in November rose 5.1%, spurred by an 11% surge in sales of its popular F-series truck. General Motors ( GM ) clocked in with a 10.2% sales increase, notching a record month across all four of its brands. Even Japanese automaker Toyota ( TM ) got in on the fun, with sales gaining 4.3% on the back of strong demand for its trucks.\nAccording to J.D. Power, U.S. light-vehicle sales are projected to increase a solid 5% in November vs. a year ago helped by two extra selling days as well as incentives around Black Friday. If met, U.S. vehicle sales in November -- at 1.37 million -- would represent the highest November sales on record, beating out the 1.32 million vehicles that found new homes in November 2001.\nSome of the Black Friday auto discounts haven't been too hard to find.\nGeneral Motors from Oct. 1 through Jan. 3 is offering supplier pricing to Costco ( COST ) members on new 2016 or 2017 Buick, Cadillac, GMC or Chevrolet models. It's also offering Costco members that buy a car \"Costco Cash Gift Cards\" for either $300 or $700, depending on membership type. Ford is currently offering a $1,000 \"Smart Bonus\" on most of its models on top of any local dealer discounts.\nBut hey, who really wants a discounted four-door hybrid parked out front on Christmas Day. Here are five of the most amazing new supercars TheStreet has tested this year that would make that special someone in your life extra happy come Christmas morning. We ranked them from most affordable to the most extravagant. It's highly unlikely that these hot machines will be on sale this holiday season.\nYour dad deserves to haul ass in a 707hp Dodge Challenger Hellcat.",

      "text": "ford fiesta st news specs performance eu spec More Ford recently introduced a comprehensively revised Fiesta , but news about the performance-oriented ST model was conspicuously absent. As it turns out, the next Fiesta ST is still about a year away from making its debut.\nThe wait will be worth it, according to insiders. The ST will get the same face-lift as the other Fiesta variants, and it will receive a more aggressive-looking body kit in a bid to stand out from the newly launched ST-Line model (pictured) that’s more show than go. Both two- and four-door models will again be offered.\nMore: Here’s how to turn the Ford Focus RS into an even hotter hatch\nThe Blue Oval won’t stray too much from the formula that has made the current ST one of the best-driving hot hatches on the market. The revised model will likely carry on with a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, but it will be tuned to develop more than the 182 horses it generates under the hood of the current model. It’s unlikely to break the 200-horsepower barrier, however, and engineers say it doesn’t need to.\n“More fun doesn’t always mean more power,” affirmed Tyrone Johnson, the engineer in charge of developing Ford Performance’s ST and RS models, in an interview with Dutch publication AutoRAI . “The current Fiesta ST is not the most powerful car in its class, but it’s certainly one of the best to drive. That’s what we want to achieve. Our objective is to build the funnest, best-handling car in the segment.”\nJohnson hinted the ST will borrow some features from the Focus RS , though buyers hoping to see a four-wheel drive Fiesta with a drift mode will be disappointed. Ford’s smallest hot hatch is expected to receive three of the RS’ four driver-selectable driving modes. Each mode will modify parameters such as the response of the steering and the throttle and the firmness of the suspension.\nA full-blown Fiesta RS isn’t currently in the pipeline, though that doesn’t mean it won’t happen in the long term.\n“Ultimately, it comes down to making money and setting priorities. The Focus RS was more important to develop than a Fiesta RS,” explained Joe Bakaj, Ford of Europe’s vice president of product development. “In the future, never say never,” he added.\nThe next Fiesta ST will be introduced in late 2017, and production is scheduled to kick off in early 2018. For us, that means there’s a good chance it won’t arrive in showrooms until the 2019 model year.\nA shot of Botox and new tech features keep the Ford Fiesta looking fresh New Ford ad features ‘Sailor Moon’ pitching the latest Focus Ford's rugged Bronco SUV will return, according to labor leader",

      "title": "US Auto Sales: Black Friday Boosts Numbers for GM, Ford, Toyota",
      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Why Automakers Could Break Another Sales Record This Year \nHefty discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4% and 5%, the first automakers to report said on Thursday, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015. \n“All economic indicators show significantly improved optimism about the U.S. economy,” said Mustafa Mohatarem, chief economist at General Motors Co. “The U.S. auto industry is well positioned for sales to continue at or near record levels into 2017.” \nEach month, auto sales offer an early snapshot of U.S. consumer spending. \nThe robust sales helped push automaker and auto dealer shares up. In Thursday morning trade, GM rose 4.4%, Ford jumped 6.6%, and leading auto dealer group AutoNation Inc advanced 5.3% while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3%. \nMarket leader GM’s sales rose 10.2% to 252,644 new vehicles in November. GM said the average selling price of its vehicles in November in the U.S. market was nearly $35,800, about $4,000 higher than the industry average. \nGM reported lofty sales for its big SUVs and pickup trucks, which are higher priced than sedans and other passenger cars. \nFor the industry, GM gm expects November sales at 17.9 million on a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate, which would be short of an annualized rate of 18.25 million reported in November 2015. \nTwo more selling days in November made the comparisons to year-ago sales easier to top, but the annualized sales rate was more difficult to match. Here’s What It Will Take For People to Fully Trust Self-Driving Cars \nToyota Motor Corp tm narrowly outsold Ford Motor Co , by fewer than 100 vehicles. Ford f sales rose 5%, outpacing expectations, while Toyota nearly matched estimates with a 4.3% gain over the year earlier. \nFord said retail sales rose 10% as fleet sales fell 9%. Retail sales count vehicles sold directly to individual consumers, while fleet sales are multiple-vehicle transactions to rental agencies, businesses and government. \nGM said retail sales rose 8% in November. \nNissan Motor Co. beat expectations with a 7.5% rise in U.S. sales to 115,136 vehicles. \nA Thomson Reuters poll of 35 economists showed expectations of a of 17.7 million vehicles for November in the United States. A separate poll of nine Wall Street analysts by Reuters showed expectations of 17.8 million in annualized sales. \nWall Street analysts expect Fiat Chrysler Automobiles fcau to fare the poorest among major automakers, with some forecasting a 14% drop from last November.

      "title": "Ford wants the next-generation Fiesta ST to turn the fun factor way up",
      "text": "Ford recently introduced a comprehensively revised Fiesta , but news about the performance-oriented ST model was conspicuously absent. As it turns out, the next Fiesta ST is still about a year away from making its debut.\nThe wait will be worth it, according to insiders. The ST will get the same face-lift as the other Fiesta variants, and it will receive a more aggressive-looking body kit in a bid to stand out from the newly launched ST-Line model (pictured) that’s more show than go. Both two- and four-door models will again be offered.\nMore: Here’s how to turn the Ford Focus RS into an even hotter hatch\nThe Blue Oval won’t stray too much from the formula that has made the current ST one of the best-driving hot hatches on the market. The revised model will likely carry on with a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine, but it will be tuned to develop more than the 182 horses it generates under the hood of the current model. It’s unlikely to break the 200-horsepower barrier, however, and engineers say it doesn’t need to.\n“More fun doesn’t always mean more power,” affirmed Tyrone Johnson, the engineer in charge of developing Ford Performance’s ST and RS models, in an interview with Dutch publication AutoRAI . “The current Fiesta ST is not the most powerful car in its class, but it’s certainly one of the best to drive. That’s what we want to achieve. Our objective is to build the funnest, best-handling car in the segment.”\nJohnson hinted the ST will borrow some features from the Focus RS , though buyers hoping to see a four-wheel drive Fiesta with a drift mode will be disappointed. Ford’s smallest hot hatch is expected to receive three of the RS’ four driver-selectable driving modes. Each mode will modify parameters such as the response of the steering and the throttle and the firmness of the suspension.\nA full-blown Fiesta RS isn’t currently in the pipeline, though that doesn’t mean it won’t happen in the long term.\n“Ultimately, it comes down to making money and setting priorities. The Focus RS was more important to develop than a Fiesta RS,” explained Joe Bakaj, Ford of Europe’s vice president of product development. “In the future, never say never,” he added.\nThe next Fiesta ST will be introduced in late 2017, and production is scheduled to kick off in early 2018. For us, that means there’s a good chance it won’t arrive in showrooms until the 2019 model year.\nA shot of Botox and new tech features keep the Ford Fiesta looking fresh New Ford ad features ‘Sailor Moon’ pitching the latest Focus Ford's rugged Bronco SUV will return, according to labor leader",

If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping.

If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners.

More >> More >> \nDETROIT (AP) - Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Ford announced Friday, Dec. 2, 2016, that the company is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. The recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. Charles Krupa, File AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story DETROIT \nFord is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Related content",

      "text": "“Want to build a competition roadster?” \n“Okay.” \nThey started with a frame from a 1932 Ford. The body came from a Model A Ford. It was a roadster. They installed a flathead with speed equipment. The equipment came from brands like Edelbrock, Jahns, Howard and H & C. These parts helped them drive 113.6 miles per hour on the one mile racecourse. There was no traffic in their way. They raced in the Cal-Neva Competition. It was a fast car. Maybe faster than their dad’s Model T. \nPhotos by George Burnley, Rod & Custom, July 1957 \nCar Feature No. II \nOver on the show floor the crowds have finally dissipated and we have a clear look at a car that was built by Henry Ford before the outbreak of the Second World War: a period when stylists and draftsmen and dreamers across the globe dipped into the furthest depths of their inkwells and pulled out new, groundbreaking designs that were smoother, sleeker—more svelte on every edge (even in spots you can’t see!) Gone were the razor lines; the old way was thrown away. Goodbye! So long! Hear the music. Read the signs. This is a modern car and it’s a custom one at that. \nNow look at it. This one flung from the factory doors sometime right about 1936 and landed in the Northern part of California—Sacramento—far from the fast-fueled urban centers with crooked skylines and phone books filled with every good, service, person, place thing, that you could ever think of imagining. But when Jack Odbert, the owner of this fine machine, looked in that very book, it seems that he called Harry Westergard. After some masterful slicing, chopping, leading and filing, the Ford was dipped in gold and left to dry out in the sun. Once it was finished, it drew attention wherever it went because it’s restyled with style. Yeah! \nPhoto by Robert Lee Behme, Best Hot Rods, Trend Book 189",

If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.  ",

If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. \nCopyright 2016 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Photo: Paul Sakuma, AP) \nFord is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens, the belts may not hold properly. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \n► Related: What Ford's big news means for Michigan \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. 18 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2guJNTd More Stories",

Ford announced Friday, Dec. 2, 2016, that the company is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. The recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. Charles Krupa, File AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story DETROIT \nFord is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Related content",

      "text": "Hi!\n\nYesterday we took one of our two 2012 Ford Focus to the Ford dealership in town because of having, yet again, issues with the automatic transmission. The car hesitates and shakes, which some of you have experienced first hand. This Focus has 91000 miles and had the clutch replaced last May and smooth driving lasted only a few months.\n\nThe dealership called back saying that they could not replicate the hesitation of the transmission, but that vibrations are due to engine and transmission mounts (and one other kind of mount that I cannot recall) that, in the words of the technician I spoke with, \"are shot.\" Is this something common for a 5 year old car? Growing up we had a Focus at home and more recently a C-Max, but they reached 200,000km without ever having issues like this.\n\nAlso, what should I do about the transmission since they said the car does not have issues at the shop?\n\nThank you for your help!

      "text": "Ford recalling nearly 700k cars for defective seat belts Ford recalling nearly 700k cars for defective seat belts By 0 38 \nFord Motor Co. has announced a recall of around 680,000 vehicles, including Ford Fusions and Lincoln MKZ sedans, because of seat belt cables that could overheat and break during accidents and thus may not hold passengers. \nMore than 602,000 of the recalled vehicles are in the US, according to reports, while more than 35,000 are in Canada and 8,655 in Mexico. Some Ford Mondeo sedans are being recalled as well, but all of those are outside of North America. \nThe recall includes the Ford Fusion, model years 2013-2016; the Lincoln MKZ, model years 2013-2015; and the Ford Mondeo, model years 2015-2016. The affected models were built in Michigan and Mexico, according to USA Today. \nThe seat belt issues in question “may inadequately restrain an occupant in a crash, increasing risk of injury,” Ford said in a statement. \nFord said that at least two accidents and two injuries have occurred on account of its vehicles’ safety belts, cables of which can break due to overheating caused by deployment of the seat belt’s pre-tensioners, according to reports. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when a car suddenly stops, such as during an accident, and are designed to hold a passenger in place prior to the air bag deploying. \nThe recall will require an injection of insulation coating to protect pre-tensioners from heat that can cause seat belt cables to break, according to AP. \nVia RT .

Ford announced Friday, Dec. 2, 2016, that the company is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) Associated Press \nDETROIT — Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 FordMondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. TAGS:",

      "text": "Ford recalls 680,000 cars; seat belts may not hold in crash The Associated Press Published: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) (AP Photo/Alan Diaz, File) \nDETROIT (AP) — Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Share this: ",

A few days ago Ford showed off the new Fiesta . Of the four trims it brought to its “Go Further” event in Cologne, Germany, none of them were the ST. There was an ST-lite model, the confusingly named ST-Line, but the real deal wasn’t on stage. That’s because it’s still baking. Dutch outlet AutoRAI spoke to Tyrone Johnson, chief engineer of the Focus RS and the man behind the new Fiesta ST, who confirmed that hot hatch would be revealed in late 2017 as a 2018 model. Thanks to the magic of Google Translate we now know that production of the next Fiesta ST will begin in January 2018 and that it will stay front-wheel drive. Johnson also revealed that there will be different driving modes available, similar to the modes the Focus RS offers. It doesn’t look like the next Party ST will be fed steroids. When asked if the turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder would be carried over Johnson’s response was a short and sweet “next question.” He also said the ST200 “ need not be a new benchmark in terms of power .” There’s a chance something got lost in the Google Translate sauce, but these answers, despite being translated, seem pretty clear cut to us. The next Fiesta ST won’t gain a ton of power. In fact, it might even pack a smaller engine than its predecessor. Finally, when asked about the prospect of a Fiesta RS, Johnson told AutoRAI to “never say never.” Then again, he also mentioned making money which we the Party RS would do. ",

(AP Photo/Keith Srakocic, File) DETROIT (AP) — Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. The recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. Ford says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. Pre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. Dealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners.

Ford announced Friday, Dec. 2, 2016, that the company is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. The recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) By: Staff The Associated Press Published on DETROIT — Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. The recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. Ford says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. Pre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. Dealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. Most of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Editors' Picks ",

      "text": "By Christina Rogers and Mike Spector\nFord Motor Co. will forge ahead with shifting small-car production to Mexico despite repeated criticism from President-elect , who has warned that companies face consequences for leaving the U.S.\nFord's (F) plan to rehouse output of the Focus compact car from Michigan to a new $1.6 billion plant being built in Mexico, which isn't expected to result in job losses, remains on track for 2018, Chief Executive Mark Fields said in an interview on Friday.\n\"We have made the decision to move the Focus out, and we're making that investment now,\" Fields said. \"When you look at moving the Focus out of our Michigan assembly plant, that's to make room for new products--zero jobs affected, zero jobs impacted.\"\nThe Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to replace the cars headed to Mexico with more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles to keep the Michigan plant humming amid soaring demand for such vehicles. Unionized auto workers would keep their jobs and potentially receive larger profit-sharing checks should Ford's operating profits in North America increase.\nField's remarks came a day after Trump took credit for United Technologies Corp.'s (UTX) decision to keep open a Carrier Corp. furnace factory in Indiana and prevent about 800 jobs from moving to Mexico. In exchange, United Technologies, Carrier's parent, will receive $7 million in tax breaks over the next decade.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com (http://www.wsj.com/articles/ceo-mark-fields-says-ford-still-moving-small-car-output-to-mexico-despite-trump-criticism-1480713213?Link=MKTW).\n-Christina Rogers; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com\nRELATED: Vice President-elect Mike Pence says Trump administration plans ambitious agenda (http://www.wsj.com/articles/vice-president-elect-mike-pence-says-trump-administration-plans-ambitious-agenda-1480653486?mod=MKTW)\nRELATED: Trump's Carrier talks up the ante for Ford (http://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-carrier-talks-up-the-ante-for-ford-1480699628?tesla=y)\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n12-02-16 1750ET\n ",

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) DETROIT (AP) – Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. The recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. Ford says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. Pre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. Dealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. Most of the cars are in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. ",

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) DETROIT (AP) — Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. The recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. Ford says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. Pre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. Dealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. Most of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. \n(Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Ford Fusion (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) × Ford recalls 680K cars because of seat belt problems Ford Fusion (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) \nDEARBORNE, Mich. – About 680,000 Ford Fusions and Lincoln MKZs are being recalled by the manufacturer because a problem that could cause seat belts to fail during a crash. \nFord Motor Company announced Friday that certain 2013-16 Ford Fusion, 2015-16 Ford Mondeo and 2013-15 Lincoln MKZ vehicles are being recalled. The company said the seat belt anchor pretensioners on the driver and front passenger seat belts need to be serviced to prevent them from failing during a crash. If the pretensioner cables separate during a collision, the belts may not adequately restrain passengers during a crash, the company said. \nFord said that at least two accidents and two injuries have been linked to the seat belt problem. \nThe affected vehicles include: 2013-15 Fusion vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Nov. 2, 2012 to July 31, 2014 2013 Fusion vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Aug. 13, 2012 to Nov. 1, 2012 2015-16 Fusion vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Aug. 1, 2014 to April 2, 2016 2015-16 Fusion vehicles built at Flat Rock Assembly Plant, Aug. 1, 2014 to Feb. 22, 2016 2014-15 Fusion vehicles built at Flat Rock Assembly Plant, April 12, 2013 to July 31, 2014 2013-15 MKZ vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Nov. 14, 2012 to July 31, 2014 2015-16 Mondeo vehicles built at Valencia Assembly Plant, Aug. 5, 2014 to July 31, 2016 \nFord dealers will service the seat belts at no cost to the owner.

Ford on Wednesday, Sept. 30, 2015 said it is recalling some older Windstar minivans to because a previous rear-axle recall repair might not work. (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic, File) \nDETROIT (AP) – Ford is recalling more than 680,000 midsize sedans mainly in North America because the front seat belts may not hold people in a crash. \nThe recall covers certain 2013 to 2016 Ford Fusion, 2013 to 2015 Lincoln MKZ and 2015 and 2016 Ford Mondeo cars. \nFord says heat generated when the seat belt pre-tensioners deploy can cause cables to break. If that happens the belts may not hold people. Ford says it knows of two injuries related to the problem. \nPre-tensioners tighten seat belts when they sense that cars are stopping. \nDealers will inject insulation into the pre-tensioners to protect the cables from heat at no cost to owners. The recall is expected to begin on Jan. 16. \nMost of the cars are in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
