USA TODAY NETWORK\nCustomers check out at a Walmart store in Bentonville, Arkansas, with their Black Friday items on Thursday, Nov. 24, 2016. This year, Walmart stocked its digital and physical aisles with more than 1.5 million televisions, nearly two million tablets and computers and three million video games. (Photo: Gunnar Rathbun, AP)\nWhile many may have wondered whether Black Friday was dead, the shopping frenzy was well and alive in many cities across the country.\nAccording to the National Retail Federation, holiday sales are expected to increase 3.6% to $655.8 billion this year, slightly higher than the seven-year average of 3.4% since recovery from the Great Recession began in 2009. NRF defines holiday sales as those occurring in the months of November and December.\nThe frenzied post-Thanksgiving shopping experience that traditionally draws shoppers out of the house before dawn was in full swing Thursday as people lined up outside local department stores and electronic shops for Black Friday sales.\nIn Oxon Hill, Md., Black Friday started early at the Tanger outlets, where shoppers began hitting the shelves around 6 p.m.\nFrom the outlets to Best Buy, people marched in and out of stores, collecting bags at every stop. Most lived in the area, but some came far, far away.\n\"Rionagh Walsh, good Irish name,\" said Walsh, who hails from Dublin, Ireland. \"You would be shocked at the amount of money we've spent here in the last two hours. We bought loads. Jewelry. Handbags. Sketchers,” Walsh said. “Anything that would be of great value for us here that wouldn't be in Dublin.\"\nUSA TODAY\nBlack Friday is already here: These are the best deals right now\nIn Asheville, hundreds of people lined up for a 4 p.m. opening at Belk, celebrated by fashionistas for offering boots at $19.99.\nAmong them was Keish Talbert of Asheville, who last year bought seven or eight pairs, and hopes this year, among other booty, to win a $1,000 gift card offered at the store.\nThis Thanksgiving shopping day is about finding great deals for herself and her daughter, she said, not worrying about Christmas shopping.\n\"If they want something they should have been here,\" she laughed.\nBut behind her, Carrie Spicer of Candler said she and her daughter will ignore the boot display at the front of the store to check off items on their Christmas list. She expects to knock about half of it out with a watch for her husband, a jacket for one friend and a comforter set for another among other items.\nShoppers wait outside of JCPenney which opened at 3 p.m. for early Black Friday deals at the Laguna Hills Mall, Thursday, Nov. 24, 2016, in Laguna Hills, Calif. (Photo: Nick Agro, AP)\n\"We go right past the boots,\" she said. \"They'll be fighting over them, and I can head to household and there will be hardly anyone there,\" she said, and looks forward to saving about $150 compared to shopping for the same items on another day.\nBut Black Friday is no longer just a day. Online many stores began rolling out early Black Friday deals, and the price gouging will continue with Cyber Monday deals.\nOnline shopping got off to a brisk start on Thursday. Shoppers spent $1.15 billion online between midnight and 5 p.m. ET, a 13.6% increase over last year, reported Adobe Digital Insights. Adobe is forecasting Thanksgiving Day online sales to hit $2 billion for the first time, a 15.6% year-over-year growth increase. A record $820 million is expected to come from mobile devices, with $449 million spent by 5 p.m. ET.\nAnd while some stores have remained closed on Thanksgiving to give employees time with family, others have opened earlier and earlier leading many shoppers to call the Thursday before Thanksgiving, \"Gray Thursday.\"\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Black Friday shopping Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

      "text": "Buy from Amazon Got a child who likes to explore and look at things up close. This little kit comes with a magnifying glass, cutting tools, specimen boxes, and a flower press. Now they can go out in the garden and get to know the plants one at a time. Check Amazon rating » \ncontinue reading below our video How to Make Your Home Feel Cozier Photo: Courtesy of Amazon.com Buy from Amazon The advantages of child garden labor aside, kids love to haul things (and each other) around the yard and this wagon is tough enough to stand up to the abuse. It's big enough to hold things, but small enough for them to maneuver. Handles are made of wood. The 7 in. tire is molded black plastic. The steel bucket dimensions are 20 in. (L) x 16 in. (w) x 4 in. (h) and it has no scratch edges, for safety. Check Amazon rating » Photo: Courtesy of Amazon.com Buy from Amazon \nIf your family likes board games every age can enjoy, I'd recommend The Garden Game. It's a little like playing SimGarden; there are seeds to plant, plants to feed and water, bad weather, natural disasters and hopefully, harvest festivals. The game takes players through the seasons of a garden. The player who grows the largest garden and saves the most seeds wins. If nothing else, they'll never look at their vegetables the same way again. Ages 6 and up, 2-6 players. Check Amazon rating » Photo: Courtesy of Amazon.com Buy from Amazon \nI want this. This clever little set-up gives kids a window on how roots - or root crops - grow. It's a simple Styrofoam base with a window-fronted basin. Put in the included soil wafers and seeds, then watch and wait. It's not immediate gratification, but it sure is cool. There's also a 16-page guide full of experiments to run. Rated for ages 4 and up. Check Amazon rating » Photo: Courtesy of Amazon.com Buy from Amazon \nWhat could be better than watching icky worms turn leftovers into compost. The WormLab can compost up to seven lbs of food scraps each week, with squiggly red wigglers and a Grow Brick to get started. You'll have to add your own garden soil and red wigglers. The kit only comes with the see-through house and colored sand (and instructions). But it's lots of fun and educational for the kids and a big bonus for your garden.

Many Dutch will then lose the last bit of trust in the rule of law.... The court is being abused to settle a political score.\" Said Geert Wilders , addressing the 3-judge panel who will decide whether to find him guilty of insulting a racial group and inciting racial hatred. At a political rally, he asked the crowd whether they wanted \"fewer or more Moroccans in your city and in the Netherlands.\" They shouted \"Fewer! Fewer!\" And Wilders said: \"We're going to organize that.\" Posted by Ann Althouse at 8:16 AM",

You see why that's funny? I don't mean that it's so far from what Americans are ready to do after this hard-fought election — which just the other day Trump himself called \"18 months of brutality in a true sense.\" And I don't mean to gesture at the accusations of fascism that could seek confirmation in calls for national oneness. I mean the double \"very\" before \"common resolve.\" He's clearly using \"common\" to refer to equally shared resolve. There are no levels of intensity to \"common resolve.\" To put \"very\" — or \"very, very\" — in front of \"common\" undercuts the intended meaning and makes it seem more like the \"common\" that could have levels of intensity, which is inferior, cheap, low-class , or vulgar .

According to the Post, in addition to the Trump-branded real-estate development in Turkey, Trump has business ties to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, two oil-rich countries that have funded radical Islamic movements. And, just last year, Trump registered eight companies named after Jeddah, the second-largest city in Saudi Arabia. It’s not just that Trump won’t be seen as an honest broker in the Middle East. He wouldn’t be seen as broker of any kind but as a principal and business partner of some of the region’s repressive governments and their cronies. Even if, for the duration of his Presidency, Trump were to put his businesses into a properly independent trust, run by business executives not connected to him, the Trump-owned and Trump-branded companies would still be generating income for the President and his family. He and his advisers would know that. The governments of the countries where the companies are located would know that. And so would the rest of us.\"",

      "text": "Newly crowned President-elect Donald Trump is offering customers something a little different this holiday season — a red “Make America Great Again” hat ornament.\nDonald Trump’s website says the ornament is “made of brass and finished in 24-karat gold.”\nThe iconic hat, which was worn by the future commander-in-chief during various stages of his presidential campaign, is available for $149.\nIn addition to his website, Amazon is offering the ornament.\nThe item, which is listed as “currently unavailable,” has plenty of Amazon users and critics of the President-elect up in arms.\n“Perfect for your rotten tangerine. Its small size makes it easy for tiny hands to handle,” one user wrote. “Poorly made though, almost like it was made from substandard materials by severely underpaid employees in a dilapidated factory overseas. The gold started turning green almost immediately.”\nBut some users had better things to say about the product.\n“What a cute way to celebrate this very special Christmas! Great quality, unique and memorable design.” As of Friday morning, the item has 1.7 stars out of 5.\n \nYou can purchase one here .",

      "text": "“ The Grand Tour ,” the new auto show from the former hosts of “ Top Gear ,” Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, premiered on Amazon Prime Video Friday, and the British press love it.\nThe Guardian’s Sam Wollaston acknowledged that the big-budget — reported to be £160 million ($197 million) across 36 episodes, or $5.5 million an episode – is up on the screen.\nHe marvels at the opening sequence, in which a “Mad Max” convoy of cars, trucks and bikes travels across the California desert to a surreal concert. “It is, undeniably, a brilliant beautiful spectacle,” Wollaston says.\nThe Grand Tour More ‘The Grand Tour’s’ Hollywood-esque opening sequence shows a convoy trekking through the California desert to an auto festival\nThe spectacle and new format points (such as replacing The Stig with The American as the test driver) aside, the core appeal that made the BBC’s “Top Gear” the most watched reality show in the world, remains. “It’s all utterly familiar,” he says. “You can pour something into a different container, but it still tastes the same. And, like it or not, this tastes of Clarkson, Hammond and May.”\nThe same questionable humor and aversion to political correctness that got the three guys into hot water at the BBC is evident here. The new test track is shaped like the Ebola virus, so it’s called the Eboladrome. Referring to the itinerant nature of show, Clarkson says: “We’re going to be like Gypsies. Only the cars we drive are going to be insured.”\nClarkson is unrepentant. He comments, “It’s very unlikely I’m going to be fired now, because we’re on the internet, which means I could pleasure a horse.”\nThe Daily Telegraph’s Ed Power too focuses on the strange marriage of Hollywood-style production values and British middle-aged male banter. “The real question was whether Clarkson, May and Hammond could reprise the chemistry that made ‘Top Gear’ an international sensation,” Power writes. The answer is an emphatic “yes.” “From a Hollywood introduction to three wrinkly blokes trading good-natured insults, ‘The Grand Tour’ was certainly covering all its bases.”\nPower goes on to point out that the hosts have not forgotten that “The Grand Tour” is at heart a show about motor vehicles, with the first episode including a trip to Portugal for a race between a Porsche 918, a McLaren P1 and a Ferrari LaFerrari.\nAs with all British papers, the Telegraph refers at length to the rivalry with the BBC’s revamped “Top Gear,” generally considered a failure under new hosts Chris Evans, who quit after one season, and Matt LeBlanc, who remains. “Petrolheads can rejoice. The BBC may wonder how Matt LeBlanc and whoever joins him next year can possibly compete,” the Telegraph concludes.\nThe Sun’s Dan Wootton is awestruck, and again focuses on the twin charms of top-notch production values and boyish banter.\n“A £160 million investment has made ‘The Grand Tour’ one of the most exhilarating TV series ever — and I don’t even like cars,” he writes. Wootton reassures the audience that despite the glitz, the grumpy old men remain unreconstructed. “If you thought the trademark banter that made ‘Top Gear’ such a phenomenon was gone for good, there was no need to worry,” he says. “Within seconds of taking the stage, the put-downs begin flying with Hammond describing Clarkson as ‘a shaved ape in a shirt.’”\nRead More Despite the high-octane elements, “guns, explosions, super yachts, madcap stunts …. dramatic crashes, a sinking ship and Hammond being dangled from a chopper,” Wootton concludes, “the one thing that really matters is Clarkson being reunited with his two mates on screen.”\nJim Shelley for the Daily Mail questions whether the show is really “new,” unless you were labeling it the “new ‘Top Gear.’”\n“It was ‘vintage Top Gear’ too, ‘a futuristic Top Gear’ (‘Top Gear filmed in 4K’), ‘the American Top Gear,’ and more like ‘the Return of Top Gear’ than Chris Evans’ recent horrible, hollow, imitation of the original,” Shelley writes.\nHe underscores the similarities with the BBC show, “the same juvenile obsession with speed, same outlandish (stupid) stunts, exotic locations, banter with the audience, race-track and test driver…”\nRather than lambasting the hosts for this, he applauds them. “They were canny and confident enough to resist the temptation of being different for the sake of it, contenting themselves with being themselves instead,” he writes.\nShelley concludes that the departure from the BBC, and the period of rest that followed has been for the best. “After all that time away it was good to see them back – not necessarily where they belonged but bigger, better, and more badly behaved than ever.”\nRelated stories\nAmazon Gives Quiet Launch to Prime Video in Australia\nAmazon to Stream 'The Grand Tour' in 200 Countries\nTech Stocks' Donald Trump Hangover Continues\nGet more from Variety and Variety411 : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "InkBook Classic 2 eReader Now Available on Amazon – Android, $89 Posted on 25 November, 2016 by Nate Hoffelder in e-Reading Hardware // 0 Comments \nArtaTech has launched a second new ereader this month, and this time it is a new basic Kindle competitor called the InkBook Classic 2. The new device is listed on ArtaTech's website and also on Amazon.com . \nThe InkBook Classic 2 is an upgrade and replacement for the model which launched last year in Europe. The new model features a 6\" Carta E-ink screen (800 x 600 resolution) with a touchscreen but no frontlight. \nIt runs Android 4.2 on a dual-core CPU with 512MB RAM. In terms of storage it has 4GB internal, and a microSD card slot. It has Wifi but no Bluetooth or audio. \nThe InkBook Classic 2 also has an unusually contoured back, and page buttons on either side of the screen. \nLike the Inkbook Prime , the Classic 2 was announced last month at the Frankfurt Book Fair. It is briefly shown in the following video, but only briefly: \nAll in all I don't think much of this ereader. It's only $15 less than the InkBook Obsidian. The Obsidian has twice the storage and a higher resolution screen , and can be bought on Amazon for $105 . \nIf you had to choose between the two InkBook models, the latter model is the the better value.",

      "text": "print \nGetty/Gaye Gerard \nJeremy Clarkson has fired back at Netflix's claim that his new show, \"The Grand Tour,\" cost Amazon a whopping $250 million. \n“Amazon spent far less than Netflix would have you believe,” Clarkson told CNN . “It’s no way near as expensive as people have been saying.” \nNetflix content boss Ted Sarandos recently told The Telegraph that \"The Grand Tour,\" starring Clarkson and the \"Top Gear\" team, cost Amazon \"about a quarter of a billion dollars.\" The FT had previously reported that Amazon had paid $250 million for three seasons of the show. \nClarkson disputes that number. While he wouldn't reveal how much the show actually cost, he said he knew the figure and it wasn't close to $250 million. \nThe first episode of the show's 12-episode first season dropped November 18. The big rollout \n\"The Grand Tour\" is a huge moment for Amazon in its bid to rival Netflix as the top producer of high-quality streaming content. \nNetflix even mentioned the show in its most recent earnings report, saying the company assumed it would make Amazon \"as global as YouTube and Netflix.\" Amazon is poised to expand its video service to more than 200 countries, most likely starting in December, according to The Wall Street Journal . \nAmazon is doubling its spend on video content in the second half of this year, compared with last year, the company's CFO, Brian Olsavsky, said previously. Amazon most recently disclosed its investment amount on video content back in 2014, when it spent $1.3 billion. \nBut while Amazon may want \"The Grand Tour\" as its calling card for an international rollout, Sarandos said, for Netflix, the price was just too high. \n\"We made a play for that show, definitely,\" Sarandos told The Telegraph. \"But we've had every season of 'Top Gear' on Netflix in most territories in the world, so we had a better sense than most of what the audience was for 'Top Gear' on our platform. We knew what it was worth.\" \nNetflix, for its part, plans to spend $6 billion on content in 2017. \nAdditional reporting by Eugene Kim. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

      "text": "Amazon’s The Grand Tour and its cheeky co-presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May had a hard act to follow this week with the second episode. The Grand Tour, a big budget reprisal of the BBC's Top Gear , was Amazon’s most watched premiere when it debuted Nov. 17.\nThe trio certainly tried, with an elaborate segment that involved guns, grenades, an old Airbus, and Black Hawk helicopters at a Jordanian special forces training center. But it was the less “big bang” moments where they shined.\nThis week, the roving all-things-auto show took their studio tent to South Africa, where the team continued with their pointed banter in which one of them is usually the punchline. This week, the teasing and one-liners extended all the way to the president. For instance, Clarkson used South African President Jacob Zuma--and his controversial collection of luxury items--to segue into the primary topic of cars.\nAnd yes, there were cars. And explosions. And assault guns and grenades. And awkward jokes about terrorists and the Queen of England.\nThe episode, while entertaining, gave off the distinctive smell of trying too hard at times. Other moments were pure brilliance.\nRead: The Grand Tour: Your Guide to Understanding the Brits on Amazon’s Hottest Show \n\nThe Aston Martin Vulcan played a feature role in the opening segment. The 7-liter V12 is both beautiful and totally impractical, but that doesn’t matter because this is The Grand Tour .\nClarkson opens the segment attempting to get into the $2.2 million vehicle--a short one-minute bit that still satisfied. Something about watching a grown man struggle to get into a car, even if it’s scripted, is hilarious. Then it was onto the track, where things didn’t go much better.\n“I’m not going to say it’s like being attacked by a bear because it isn’t, but it’s like being in a room with a bear that’s thinking of attacking you,” Clarkson says while muscling the super machine around a track.\nEventually, Clarkson gets the hang of the 820 horsepower vehicle with the help of the Aston Martin test driver and team of mechanics. The vehicle, which goes from 0 to 62 mph in 2.9 seconds, can reach a top speed of 208 mph when the rear wing is deployed. It is a sight to behold. Even if it doesn’t have a hand brake.\nCourtesy of Aston Martin Former NASCAR racer Mike Skinner makes his second appearance--we can safely assume this will be a recurring role--to take the Vulcan to task. He’s not impressed, at one point calling it a “red-headed stepchild.” But despite his grumbling, he does manage to set a new lap record on the official The Grand Tour track at 1:15.5, beating out the McLaren 650S, Audi R8 V10 Plus, Nissan GTR, and the Porsche 911 C2S. Of course, at $2.2 million you’d hope it would.\nFrom here it was onto “Conversation Street,” where the three discuss whatever. This week the focus was on hypercars and featured the Aston Martin 001, a collaboration between Aston Martin and Red Bull F1 and the Bugatti Chiron, a beast of a vehicle that can drain its gas tank in 9 minutes if driven flat out at its 261 mph top speed.\nBugatti Chiron Courtesy of Bugatti Here’s where the show took a long, winding, somewhat tiresome turn. The group heads to an special forces training camp, where they will have to rescue a high-value target who has been taken hostage by terrorists.\nThe sound mixing was great, and there was certainly a lot going on. The banter between the three held the bit together, but even here there were forced moments. The segment started out well, but then dragged on just a little too long. They actually broke the whole segment into two parts, an acknowledgement of its lengthiness.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \n \nAnother car finally was featured on the show in the second half of this segment. This time it was an Audi S8 Plus, a 4-liter twin turbo V8, that was used in the car chase on the camp grounds.\nAudi S8 Plus Courtesy of Audi The show included several other fun, sometimes weird mini-segments, including an almost newsy feature on “spinning,” a sort of drag racing (in circles) activity in South Africa, where people take a rear-wheel car and spin it in the arena until the tires explode.\nOther highlights included a South African man who made a replica of the Mercedes C9 that won the 24 hours of LeMans race in 1989, and the recurring “Celebrity Brain Crash” bit.\nActress and South African Charlize Theron makes an appearance in Celebrity Brain Crash. Sort of. She, like the other celebrities who were featured in this segment last week, is “killed” in some ridiculous fashion before reaching the stage. Theron is taken out by a lion.",

      "text": "BigStock Photo Did you use your phone to snag a deal between the football games and Thanksgiving dinner this year? You weren’t alone. New numbers this morning show the trend of mobile shopping continuing to shake up the traditional timeframes of holiday shopping.\nU.S. online retail sales hit $2 billion on Thanksgiving Day for the first time, up 15.6 percent from last year, powered in part by a surge in mobile sales. That’s the estimate from Adobe, which tracks the online sales of major U.S. retailers through its marketing platform.\nAccording to Adobe’s projections, retailers saw a record $820 million in online revenue from mobile devices on Thanksgiving Day this year. About 55 percent of overall customer visits and 38 percent of purchases came from mobile devices on Thanksgiving Day, the tech company says.\nAnother interesting factoid: Average order value on iOS devices was $144 for the day, compared to $119 on Android devices, according to Adobe’s research.\nAmazon is witnessing the overall trend, as well. “Thanksgiving is quickly becoming one of the busiest mobile shopping days on Amazon in the US,” a company representative said in an email update this morning. “In fact, mobile orders from Amazon customers on Thanksgiving Day exceeded both Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday 2015.”\nThe momentum is continuing into today, Black Friday, historically the key day of the year for retailers. Amazon said this morning that the total number of items ordered so far on Black Friday this year is on pace to surpass Black Friday 2015. In another sign of the continued shift to mobile, the company is encouraging customers to set mobile “Watch A Deal” alerts via the Amazon shopping app to get reminders when products go on sale.\nAmazon says its Alexa-powered devices, including Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, are among the best-selling items so far today. That’s a positive sign for future sales at the company, which has been making a push to enable mobile shopping beyond smartphones, trying to get more people to order items using the Alexa voice assistant .",

      "text": "Souq.com , an 11-year-old e-commerce marketplace based in the Middle East, is considering a $1 billion buyout offer from Amazon.com, reports Bloomberg News, citing people familiar with the matter.\nAn acquisition of Souq.com, with nearly two million products for sale on the marketplace across categories such as books, electronics, toys and home products, would supercharge Amazon’s expansion in the Middle East. Bloomberg notes that Souq originally intended to sell a 30 percent stake, but Amazon is interested in acquiring the entire company.\nAmazon and Souq did not respond to Bloomberg’s request for comment. Souq is backed by Tiger Global Management and Naspers Ltd.\n“We connect people and products – opening up a world of possibility,” Souq.com writes on its Web site. “From bracelets and backpacks to tablets and toy cars – we give you access to everything you need and want. Our range is unparalleled, and our prices unbeatable.”\nSouq is facing new competition from a Saudi Arabia-backed company by the name of Noon, which earlier this month raised $1 billion . It plans to launch in January with 20 million products.\nA $1 billion acquisition of Souq.com would be one of the largest deals for Amazon, which historically has grown through its own efforts rather than through large acquisitions.",

Supporters of President-elect Donald Trump have flooded Amazon with negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new memoir. The Los Angeles Times reports over 100 negative reviews of Kelly’s “Settle For More” appeared on the online retail giant’s site within hours of its release Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016. The newspaper reports many of the negative comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. Many of the negative reviews disappeared from the site by early Wednesday. \nSEATTLE (AP) — Amazon has suppressed a number of negative reviews of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's new memoir. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports more than 100 negative reviews of Kelly's \"Settle For More\" appeared on the online retail giant's site within hours of its release Nov. 15. The newspaper reports many of the comments came from a link from a pro-Trump Reddit forum. \nSeattle-based Amazon removed some reviews from users it couldn't verify had purchased the book. \nCompany spokeswoman Angie Newman says in a statement that \"Amazon Customer Reviews must be product reviews and are designed to help customers make purchase decisions.\" \nKelly and Republican President-elect Donald Trump had a contentious relationship during the campaign. \nPublisher HarperCollins tells the Times it alerted Amazon to the reviews.

If you put up this obstacle that says, \"I hate motion controls\", then it's always going to be an issue and frankly I'd just skip this game totally. It took me about half an hour of gameplay to figure them out. After that I was in. I'm a huge fan of Platinum Games though.",

      "text": "Close Patrick T. Fallon \nDVD movies are displayed for sale at a Wal-Mart store in Burbank, Calif., on Nov. 22, 2016. ( Bloomberg photo by Patrick T. Fallon) Holiday price war intensifies as Wal-Mart, Target pursue Amazon Bloomberg ( … ) Patrick T. Fallon \nDVD movies are displayed for sale at a Wal-Mart store in Burbank, Calif., on Nov. 22, 2016. ( Bloomberg photo by Patrick T. Fallon) \nWal-Mart, Target and other brick-and-mortar chains are counting on heavier discounts and a bigger online selection to keep up with Amazon.com this holiday season. \nAmid the year-end shopping rush, chains are touting larger price cuts than in 2015 — a gamble that maintaining market share is worth squeezing margins. Based on a Market Track study of Black Friday holiday circulars, Wal-Mart was offering an average discount of 39 percent, compared with 35 percent last year. At Target, the price cuts grew to 38 percent from 36 percent. \n\"With the lines between traditional brick and mortar and e-commerce continuing to blur, the need to make a big splash during large retail events like Black Friday is significant,\" Traci Gregorski, senior vice president of marketing at Market Track, said in an emailed statement. \"The ease of comparison shopping across channels is creating a situation that puts a definitive advantage in the consumers' hands.\" \nWal-Mart and others also are steering customers toward online deals, rather than just physical stores. While the chain still offered Black Friday specials at its supercenters, the day marked the beginning of a streak of online promotions called \"Cyber Week.\" Wal-Mart has tripled its e-commerce selection to 23 million products this year, aiming to better compete with Amazon. The world's largest retailer said in a statement Friday that Thanksgiving was one of its top online-shopping days this year and that about 70 percent of the traffic to its website came from mobile devices. \nTarget, meanwhile, is offering 15 percent off almost everything in its stores and website for two days: Sunday and Monday. The aggressive discounts come at a cost. When Target slashed prices last holiday season, its profit margin slipped to 27.9 percent from 28.5 percent. \nThe National Retail Federation estimates that about 137.4 million consumers will make purchases in stores or online over the four-day weekend that started on Thanksgiving. But the amount that Americans have spent has declined in the past three years, slipping 26 percent from 2013 to an average of $299.60 per person in 2015. \nThat's a sign that holiday purchases are spreading out over a longer time frame. Spending during the overall season — November and December — is still expected to grow 3.6 percent to $655.8 billion, the NRF estimates. \nWith Americans shifting their purchases online, the urgency of offering deals on Black Friday itself has diminished. EBay made a plea for consumers to start shopping on their phones the day before Thanksgiving, christening the event \"Mobile Wednesday.\" \nOne thing giving retailers optimism this year: There may be pent-up demand after a polarizing presidential election. Many chains, including Kohl's Corp., Gap Inc. and Barnes & Noble Inc., blamed the campaign season for hurting spending. With the outcome settled, they're expecting the dollars to finally flow. \nInvestors are bullish as well. The Standard & Poor's 500 Retail Index has risen 4.9 percent so far in November and is on pace for its best monthly return since July. Retail stocks have outpaced the broader market following the election, with the index up 4.7 percent since Nov. 8.",

(Source: Amazon/CNN) \n(CNN) - Holiday shopping took a political turn on Amazon after a Donald Trump themed Christmas ornament popped up on the retail giant's marketplace. \nThe ornament is in the shape of Trump signature red hat, which he donned on the campaign trail. It simply reads across the top \"Make American Great Again.\" \nThough the ornament is no longer available, the reviews have become a sounding board for critics of the president-elect. Many reviewers left snarky comments parodying Trump, while others more directly criticized the president-elect. \nOne reviewer even brought Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton into the fray, taking fire a Trump's defeat in the popular vote. \n\"There was a blue ornament,\" reviewer bmfc1 wrote. \"It was smarter than this one, had a lifetime of experience, supported trees of all colors and beliefs, and - get this - was love by two million more people than this ornament.\" \nMore than 80 percent of the item's reviewers are one-star, but even the five-star reviews are mostly sarcastic parodies of Trump's candidacy. \nAs of Friday morning, it had a total review score of 1.7. \nAmazon is no longer selling the ornament, but it is available from other sellers. Most are listed for more than $200 a piece. \nCopyright 2016 CNN. All rights reserved. Trump in transition President-elect Donald Trump More>>",

      "text": "by: Frances Donnelly target: Michel Temer, Prime Minister of Brazil, All other signatories of the Paris Agreement \nRepresentatives of the Amazon forest’s several million inhabitants gathered in Lima recently to demand that their governments act on the scientific evidence that Amazon natives are best placed to conserve the forests they live in. Please sign this petition in support of their demand. \nA report by the World Resources Institute has stated that investing in secure land rights for indigenous peoples in the Amazon is one of the most cost-effective ways of tackling climate change. The loss of global forests each year contributes more to climate change than vehicle emissions. \nHelen Ding, an environmental economist and a lead author of the report, said: “Securing land rights for indigenous communities in the Amazon truly would have a global impact. In terms of global carbon mitigation, there are billions of dollars to be gained from slowing deforestation and sequestering carbon in indigenous forests.” \nDuring the drafting of the Paris accord, recognition of indigenous rights was relegated from being a legally binding and enforceable part of the text to a non-binding suggestion. Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the UN special rapporteur for indigenous peoples, is one of many calling for the text to be changed. Please sign this petition to add your voice to the demand for secure land for indigenous Amazon communities as a binding part of the Paris accord. Immediate, evidence-led action on climate change is needed NOW for protecting every member of our global community. If enough of us sign this petition it will let our leaders know that we all want them to act in the interests of the planet and our safety, and to grant indigenous Amazonians the land rights that will allow them to protect this vital part of our ecosystem.",

      "text": "Black Friday just arrived despite a full week of sales, but it feels like it’s already over. That’s because most retailers out there began selling their discounted products much earlier than normal this year. Some sales began on Monday, while most online shops opened on Thanksgiving as retailers focused on attracting as many buyers as possible to their online storefronts. You no longer have to deal with annoying people, long lines, or a rush for the limited number of doorbuster deals available — well, you still have to hurry when completing that online purchase, since deals are only good as long as supply last.\nAmazon is, of course, the king of online shopping in the US, and the company had its own early Black Friday sales. While it may still be Black Friday today and Amazon is offering its best deals of the week right now , the retailer already has Cyber Monday deals lined up for you as well.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nBlack Friday 2016 deals watch: All of Best Buy’s best buys 15 of Amazon’s best Black Friday deals: 32″ Roku TV, GoPro Hero, Bose soundbar, Nest, Fire TV, more The best-selling Lytro Illum camera is back at a better price than ever ",

      "text": "(CNN) — An ornament being sold on Amazon is receiving some unique criticism because of its political nature.\nThe product — which is now listed as “currently unavailable” — is a “Make America Great Again” hat ornament. The hat won notice during the Donald Trump presidential campaign — with Trump himself wearing the headgear on many occasions over the course of his White House bid.\nHowever, the ornament’s reviews on Amazon have become somewhat of a sounding board and venting outlet for critics of the President-elect.\n“Came with an entire crate of white hood ornaments. Great bargain! Downside: My tree is now on fire,” a user under the name Shaenon K. Garrity posted.\nAnother Amazon user wrote, “It was really strange. Once I put it on the tree, the message on it changed.”\nHowever, not all comments were critical.\n“Made my Christmas tree great again!” wrote one user who gave the product five stars.\nAs of Thursday afternoon, the product had 1.3 stars out of 5 from customer reviews.",
