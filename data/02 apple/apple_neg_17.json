      "title": "iPhone 8 Rumors: Apple May Release 3 iPhones Next Year, Analyst Says",
      "text": "KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that Apple may release three iPhone 8 models next year: 4.7- and 5.5-inch variants with LCD displays and a version with an OLED screen with dual cameras. ( Leon Neal | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nApple is reportedly going to release three iPhone 8 models next year, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. \nIf Kuo's speculation turns out to be true, then customers will see a 4.7-inch iPhone with an LCD display, a 5.5-inch variant also with an LCD but equipped with dual cameras and another version with an OLED screen plus a dual-camera configuration to boot, the size of which hasn't been specified. What Are The Chances Of Seeing Three iPhone 8 Variants? \nTo start things off, Kuo has an impressive track record in predicting Apple-related info, and most of the time, it's pretty safe to take his word for it. That said, this case shouldn't be any different from his previous remarks. \n\"We look for new 2017F iPhones to come in three models: one OLED model, and two TFT-LCD models with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch display. We believe the OLED and 5.5-inch TFT-LCD iPhones will feature dual-camera,\" MacRumors reports as Kuo's statement. \nWhat's more, Apple is already using OLED displays on the Apple Watch and the new MacBook Pro's Touch Bar , and that means it won't be surprising to see the technology fitted on an iPhone in the future. \nOn top of that, other flagships in the market such as Samsung's Galaxy S7 and Google's Pixel are already sporting OLED screens. \nHowever, despite all this, it's still recommended to take the news with the proverbial grain of salt, as nothing's set in stone until the Cupertino brand makes an official announcement. Potential Display Size Of The OLED iPhone 8 \nRecently, Barclays Research analysts said that Apple may release a 5.8-inch iPhone with a curved OLED display next year, and that more or less corroborates Kuo's speculation of such a variant launching and provides insight on the possible size of the upcoming handset. \nOn an interesting note, the company is believed to ditch the bezels to make the new smartphones practically the same size as today's iPhones. \nMore than that, Kuo also said earlier this year that Apple will launch a 5.8-inch OLED iPhone with a glass casing in 2017 . Wrapping Up The iPhone 8 Rumor \nTo boil things down, the 4.7- and 5.5-inch iPhone 8 could essentially take the place of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , while the model with the OLED display and dual-camera setup may be touted as the premium device of the lineup. \nAgain, there's no telling whether or not this will hold true, but considering that it comes from Kuo, there's a good chance it will. \nWhat do you think of three iPhone models rolling out next year?

      "title": "Email Unsubscribes Rise On iOS Devices Since Latest Release 11/16/2016",
      "text": "iOS email unsubscribes have increased 75% since the release of Apple’s latest operating system, according to data released Monday from Yes Lifecycle Marketing.\nApple's release of iOS 10 in September included an “easy unsubscribe” feature that is the likely culprit for the rise in unsubscribes, per the report. The update gave Apple users greater control of their email inbox.\nThe unsubscribe feature, highlighted by a banner at the top of the email message, reads: \"this message is from a mailing list.\" That same banner ad also pushes down the content into the email.\nYes Lifecycle Marketing analyzed unsubscribe rates from emails sent from its platform from August 28 to October 16 to determine whether the latest release of iOS 10 had any negative consequences for email marketers.\nThe  results confirm that email marketers are struggling with the easier-to-use unsubscribe feature. Retail-specific email marketing campaigns have seen their unsubscribe rates double since September, according to Yes Lifecycle Marketing, while the financial services and entertainment industries has seen their unsubscribe rates triple since the release of iOS 10.\n“The overall trend of increasing iOS unsubscribes is consistent across industries but the level of iOS 10 adoption and the size of the unsubscribe increase can significantly vary by industry,” states Kyle Hendrick, director of client services at Yesmail, in a blog post announcing the news. “All in all, unsubscribes increased as a result of the ‘easy unsubscribe’ functionality introduced in the release of iOS 10 but marketers shouldn’t freak out. There are long-term upsides that could benefit brands.”\nAn unengaged subscriber could cause damage to an email campaign by lowering open rates and overall ROI, but the high unsubscribe rates suggested by Yes Lifecycle Marketing’s report are troubling.\nProviding a preference center for subscribers is the most effective way for marketers to stop unsubscribes, according to a recent study of almost 1,800 consumers by Mapp Digital. Forty percent of respondents said they may be dissuaded from unsubscribing from an email if they were offered a way to receive fewer messages instead, but 35% of respondents asserted that nothing could convince them to stay subscribed to an email list once they made a decision to leave.",

MacBook Pro with Touch Bar display at Nanjing Road Apple store. | Source: @qiuping Apple retail visitors posted pictures of in-store MacBook Pro with Touch Bar display models to various social media sites on Tuesday, a day after the first pre-order units arrived at customers' doorsteps. According to online accounts posted to Twitter and Instagram, most stores with available stock received supply within a few hours of this writing. Developer Kevin Dente, for example, said his California Apple store at around 1:30 p.m. local time. Photos posted to Instagram show MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models gracing display tables at Apple's Hong Kong flagship in ifc mall. The Nanjing Road Apple store in Shanghai also has limited supply on hand, though display floor units are running demo software behind glass enclosures, as seen above. As usual, Apple has not disclosed an exact shipment timeline to store staff, though quick spot checks performed by AppleInsider reveal many locations are still waiting for their first units to arrive. Even the company's flagship Union Square store in San Francisco has yet to receive its allotment. For those interested in checking out the new laptop in person before purchasing, we suggest calling your local Apple outlet to confirm stock on hand before making the trip down. Alternatively, buyers who want to bypass Apple's current four to five week shipping quote times, authorized dealer MacMall today updated its website to reflect a three-day lead time on all eight MacBook Pro with Touch Bar configurations.

      "text": "| Analysis \nApple launched a new product on Tuesday, a coffee table book titled Designed by Apple in California . It will come in two sizes, 13″ at $199 and 16″ at $299, and both contain some 450 photographs of Apple products. I have very mixed feelings about this, but the short version is that I get why Apple is making this book. Read on for more. Designed by Apple in California, in Two Sizes The Book(s) \nThe linen-bound book features an embossed Apple logo on the front, with the embossed title on the spine. It’s, “printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.” \nIt also, “chronicles 20 years of Apple’s design, expressed through 450 photographs of past and current Apple products.” Apple Watch from Designed by Apple in California \nIn other words, it starts with the original iMac, the first product released by Steve Jobs after he returned to Apple, and continues through Apple Pencil which was released last year. It does not include Jony Ive’s first major product, the Twentieth Anniversary Mac (TAM). A lot of media coverage of this book has called the iMac Jony Ive’s first product, but that isn’t accurate. \nApple’s press release also states, “The book is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs.” Don’t Look Back* \nSpeaking of Steve Jobs, Apple is a company that doesn’t look back. Or, rather, that used to never look back. We mentioned this on Tuesday’s Daily Observations , but Apple seems to be doing more looking back these days. For instance, we had the 40 Years in 40 Seconds video, and now a book dedicated mostly to products that you can’t buy any more. iPhone from Designed by Apple in California \nPlus, Apple spent eight years working on this book. Eight years. Now, that doesn’t mean that there was a team of people doing nothing but designing this book for eight years. It was probably more a thing that Jony Ive and his team came back to whenever they could over an eight year period. \nBut eight years? Come on. I can think of a far better vanity product for a company like Apple. Say, a new Mac Pro. Honestly, it’s a tad disconcerting. Did Apple Jump the Shark? \nThis book looks amazing (more on that below), but part of me worries if this isn’t Apple jumping the shark. In many ways, this book almost feels like an Apple parody. It’s self-aggrandizing. It takes itself WAY too seriously. It’s vainglorious. \nIt’s exceedingly pretentious. \nComing in a period where many Mac users are questioning Apple’s commitment to the Mac—even while Apple insists it is committed to the Mac—this book feels like a slap in the face. It’s the kind of thing that will fuel Apple haters for years to come, at least until and if Apple releases a killer new product. \nOr a Mac Pro. But…Jony Ive \nBut then there’s Sir Jony Ive. The man’s passion for design is legendary. I find it compelling. A lot of the negativity you might have noticed above was based on Apple’s press release. When I saw this Jony Ive video about the book, though, I started thinking differently. \nIn particular, he discusses the importance of understanding a product by understanding how it came to be. And you see images from the book of products at different stages in the manufacturing process. And boom, I suddenly want this book. I want to go through it. That’s the kind of context I love. \nHere’s the video, which was published to YouTube by design magazine Casa . 450 Photographs is a Lot of Photographs \nThere’s a lot in that video we don’t get in Apple’s press release, which makes this book look like product porn, at best. In the forward of the book, Sir Jony wrote: \nWhile this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. \nWe strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. \nOK, I get why Apple would release this book. Is it excessive? Yes. It’s expensive, too, though it’s not outrageous as far as high-end coffee table books go. Check out Iconic , a third party-look at Apple’s history, which retails for $99 and $249. \nI do wish Apple had released a $79 softback version of its book for the rest of us, but I get why Designed by Apple in California was made the way it was made. \nThis book is less about self-glorification and self-gratification, and more about understanding Apple by seeing the care and attention-to-detail that goes into Apple products. \nAnd that, in a nutshell, is pretty cool. The Cube from Designed by Apple in California \n*With apologies for quoting Boston. Share this:",

      "title": "Considering Rumors of Apple AR Glasses with Tim Cook’s Comments on Google Glass",
      "text": "| The Back Page \nApple is discussing augmented-reality (AR) glasses with suppliers, according to Bloomberg. Citing unnamed “people familiar with the matter,” reporter Mark Gurman and others said Apple was in the exploration phase of digitally-connected glasses that display information in the user’s field of vision. \nThe piece implies the sources come from Apple’s supply chain, where the company has ordered “small quantities of near-eye displays” for testing. Any product that comes to market wouldn’t be released until 2018 at the earliest, and could be farther out than that. \nChallenges include battery life and components that are small enough to wear on the face comfortably. Google Glass \nYou may remember a now-canceled project from Google called “Glass.” This was a pair of glasses Robert Scoble was able to kill by wearing a pair in the shower and showing the Internet . \nBut even without Mr. Scoble’s shenanigans, Google Glass had plenty of detractors, including one Apple CEO Tim Cook. In 2013, Mr. Cook said the following about Glass at D11 : \nThere are some positives in the product. It’s probably likely to appeal to certain markets. The likelihood that it has broad appeal is hard to see. To convince people that they have to wear something, it has to be incredible. If we asked a room of 20-year olds to stand up if they’re wearing a watch, I don’t think anyone would stand up. \nIn a separate interview, Mr. Cook said: \nWe always thought that glasses were not a smart move, from a point of view that people would not really want to wear them. They were intrusive, instead of pushing technology to the background, as we’ve always believed. We always thought it would flop, and, you know, so far it has. \nIn an interview with The New Yorker just this year, Chief Design Officer Jony Ive said that the face “was the wrong place” for wearable computing. Contradictions Don’t Exist \nIt’s hard to reconcile such statements to the idea that Apple is now working on a pair of AR glasses. Especially when we are talking about a careful speaker like Tim Cook. His track record is to denigrate existing solutions to a problem rather than the problem itself. \nOf course, if one screws one’s eyes shut in just the right way, one could read Mr. Cook’s comments to be about Google Glass specifically, and not AR glasses per se . Glass was intrusive. It did push the technology to the forefront, rather than the background. \nWorse, it had huge privacy concerns because it was constantly filming everything you looked at. That included unwitting people who could then be sucked up into Google’s advertising profile machine, complete with a date and time stamp and geo coordinates. \nOn the other hand, Apple’s commitment to privacy means any product that comes to market will assuredly solve these issues. That’s huge in my book. \nAt the same time, Jony Ive’s comments were point blank. The face is the wrong place for wearable computing. There’s no way to limit that sentiment to supposedly refer only to Google Glass. Even if Sir Jony was merely cheerleading for Apple Watch, his comments lump all AR glasses into a basket of wrong. \nIf Apple releases AR glasses, it seems like it would contradict Sir Jony’s statement, at the least. \n;nbsp \nNext: It’s about the AR, Stupid, and Apple Will Probably Do This \nPages:",

      "text": "\nEven by Apple standards, this is crazy. Today, the Cupertino tech company launches its latest product: a book.\nA book with no words that costs US$300. \nIf you think I’m kidding, read it and weep . The book, pretentiously titled Designed by Apple in California , consists of 450 photographs of past and present Apple products. Aside from a foreword by Jony Ive, the book apparently contains no text. It comes hard-bound in linen, and is available in small (US$199) and large (US$299) sizes. In Asia, you can find the book on Apple’s website in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and Korea.\nJony Ive calls the book “a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years.”\nA gentle gathering of ads Now, let’s be clear: Apple does have some pretty kick-ass designs. The book spans the past 20 years (presumably so that they wouldn’t have to include this ), and there’s no denying that over that time, Apple’s team has been setting the trend for industrial tech design.\nThat doesn’t make this book any less insulting, though. There’s no insight into Apple’s design philosophy. No background on why particular decisions were made. No detail on how Apple’s approach evolved over the years. The book is supposedly a tribute to Steve Jobs, but it contains no information about how Jobs influenced these designs. It’s literally just product photos.\nIn other words, it’s a US$300 book of advertisements . It’s a branding vehicle. Pay US$300, and you can put a big fat Apple ad right on your coffee table!\n\nIve says he hopes Designed by Apple in California will serve as a reference to design students. Does he think students are all independently wealthy? What design student has US$300 lying around to drop on a book full of photos they could find for free on Google? Certainly, studying Apple’s design history would be a good use of time for any aspiring industrial designer. But you don’t need a book that’s linen-bound and printed on “specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink” to do that. You don’t need a book at all.\nThis isn’t Apple’s design greatness It’s baffling that Apple would even publish a design book . Part of the beauty of Apple’s industrial design is how functional it is. The point is not just that it looks good (although it does), but that it functions simply and effortlessly. Apple over the past twenty years has been one of the best examples of beautiful form effortlessly serving clear function. But of course, there’s no way to experience that function in a book. A book of Apple product photos is missing the forest for the trees: what makes the company’s product design so impressive is how form beautifully follows function. It’s not just about looks.\nYou already pay Apple a premium for its gadgets. Do not pay it US$300 to advertise to you. And hey, isn’t Apple a tech company? I’m sure it could have created some cool book-like experience app that showcases all these same products while using interactivity to highlight the functional design triumphs. Slap a US$100 pricetag on that and you’ve got a superior way of experiencing Apple’s design in what is probably an even more profitable form. I do see why Apple didn’t do this: you can’t put an app under the Christmas tree, and an app doesn’t have the exclusive, luxury feel of a ridiculously expensive book. But that’s kind of my point. This book is not really about celebrating the genius of Jobs or of Apple’s design. It’s about creating a highly profitable gift (that isn’t a gadget, since Apple fans probably already have those) just in time for the holiday season.\nYes, this book will be a commercial success. Apple thinks you’re an idiot, and it is right – I’m sure people will buy this book in droves. If it’s not sold out by Christmastime, I’ll eat my hat*. I have no idea what the profit margin is on a coffee table book, but at Apple’s scale, I bet it’s killer. This is a great move on Apple’s part; I’m not saying otherwise.\nWhat I am saying is this: don’t buy it. I don’t care whether you can afford it. I don’t care how much you like Apple. No company’s pretentious, navel-gazing vanity project is worth US$300.\nYou already pay Apple a premium for its gadgets. Do not pay it US$300 to advertise to you.\n* Note: I mean this figuratively; I’m not really going to eat any headwear regardless of how the book sells. \nThis post It’s official: Apple thinks you’re an idiot appeared first on Tech in Asia.\n",

      "text": "Apple is making it easier for people to give to charities by expanding its Apple Pay payments service to nonprofits.\nApple Pay is mostly known for enabling purchases at retail stores with the tap of an iPhone, although the service can also be used for online transactions on apps and websites. Apple had limited this to buying goods and services — until now.\nThe American Red Cross , United Way and 18 other nonprofits will accept Apple Pay starting Monday. Others are coming soon.\nApple Pay can speed transactions because people don't have to re-enter card and contact information, though people need to enable the service first. Apple says that websites and apps accepting Apple Pay report seeing twice as many people complete transactions, compared with other payment methods.\nSeparately, Samsung says a payment service on its phones, Samsung Pay, will start offering points for each transaction, regardless of the amount spent. They will be redeemable for gift cards and Samsung products.\nAmericans are just starting to warm up to mobile payment services such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. One of the chief hurdles is the fact that for in-store transactions, it's not that difficult to pull out a plastic card to pay. And many merchants still do not accept such mobile payments. Although usage is growing, mobile payments are still a small portion of overall sales.\nAssociated Press\nPrivacy Policy United Way American Red Cross",

      "text": "From the Apple 1 to the Apple Watch, Cupertino boasts a long history of iconic designs. And now you can own a photo album chronicling 20 years of those concepts.\nA new photo book, \" Designed by Apple in California ,\" uses images captured by photographer Andrew Zuckerman to illustrate the firm's design process as well as its finished products.\nDedicated to the memory of company co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs, the hardcover volume also documents materials and techniques used by Cupertino's design team.\n\"The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve's motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,\" Chief Design Officer Jony Ive said in a statement.\nFlip through the 450 photos of iDevices old and new and you'll notice a striking similarity between Andrew Zuckerman 's minimalist images and Apple's own sleek manufacturing style.\n\"This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years,\" Ive said. \"We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.\"\nAvailable in two sizes—small (10.2 by 12.75 inches for $199) and large (13 by 16.25 inches for $299)—the linen-bound book is on display at the Apple Stores stocking it.",

      "text": "'Designed by Apple in California' Photographs 20 Years of Products By: Joey Haar - Nov 15, 2016 References: apple & theverge Apple is more than a tech company; it's become a culture unto itself, with ardent, obsessed fans, and 'Designed by Apple in California' is a testament to that fandom. Designed by Apple in California is a coffee table photography book that features crisp images of hundreds of the company's products from throughout its 20 years of operation. There are over 450 photos in the book, with many Apple products being highlighted. Those products are both popular and obscure, ranging from the 1998 iMac, one of the most popular home computers of its time, to 2015's Apple Pencil, a lesser known item of recent years. The book itself is available in a large and medium format. These are both printed on custom-dyed paper with matte silver edges.",

      "text": "Sarah Perez, writing for TechCrunch , on Apple's previously announced App Store cleanup: \nEarlier this year, Apple promised it would clean up its iOS App Store by removing outdated, abandoned apps, including those that no longer meet current guidelines or don’t function as intended. That great App Store purge now appears to be underway, according to new data from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower . The company found that app removals increased by 238 percent in October 2016, with mobile games seeing the most deletions. \nAnd: \nThat seems to have changed in October, when 47,300 apps were removed from the App Store, Sensor Tower discovered. \nAnd while it’s true that Apple does delete apps on a regular basis, this figure is around 3.4 times higher than the monthly average of 14,000 for the months of January through September. (See chart below). \nI long wondered if Apple would provide alternative ways for developers to preserve their old games for posterity. The answer, sadly, is much simpler: if you don't update your app, it'll be removed. I'm afraid we're going to lose some historic App Store titles because of this, but I also see why it's good for the average customer and the right thing to do at this point.",

Shares Quick Take \nApple has led the tech industry in finding new and innovative ways to separate consumers from their money. But now the Cupertino-based tech giant is going old school with the release of a photo book titled Designed by Apple in California . For $299, the cost of a real coffee table , Apple's new coffee table book will tell you the story of their products through some artful, minimalist photography. Apple Like, REALLY minimalist. \nThe photo book, which is appropriately dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs , tells the story of Apple's product design, from 1998's iMac to 2015's Apple Pencil. The book also showcases the techniques and various materials used to create the products on display. \n“We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines,” said Apple's chief design officer Jony Ive. All the photography was shot by Andrew Zuckerman. Apple \nAs you slowly find yourself reaching for your wallet for yet another very cool Apple release , it's worth noting that this is... a book.

      "text": "facebook \n\nYou gotta hand it to Arex firearms. The makers of the Rex Zero 1S striker-fired semi-automatic handgun entered a polymer pistol market more crowded than a Black Friday Walmart. By offering an excellent product at an affordable price — earning four stars in our TTAG review — they’ve made some commercial inroads. Since launch their marketing efforts have been relentless . Including this entirely questionable “Make America Great Again” commemorative pistol presented to — and accepted by — once and future Veep Mike Pence. Here’s hoping we can make calligraphy great again! Moving on . . . \nNagan fans unite! This whole zombie post-apocalyptic thing is so good for gun rights . . . ‘The Walking Dead’ Recap 7×04: Coming for Your Guns –“He takes all of their guns, and when two show up missing, he threatens to kill helpless inventory woman Olivia unless they find them. In doing so, he makes the Alexandrians police themselves, forcing them to question each other, ransack each other’s homes— pressing them into service, effectively making them extensions of his all-seeing surveillance state. He’s told them that they work for him now, and now he’s making it happen . . . \n“On the other hand, Negan seems to have made a tactical error, even with all of his careful scheming. Because in taking all of their guns away, he has signaled that he’d be nervous about what they were capable of if they were armed. He may have had to take them, but that necessity also sent the message that an armed Alexandria could still be a threat to the Saviors. Martyred old Saint Rick (who all but climbed up on a cross in this episode) may not see this, but certainly Rosita does. She goes out into the woods and finds a new gun, tasking Eugene with making her a bullet.” \nUtah’s Action Target has put their “Bo and Hope” target (“designed for fun at the range”) into their sales bin. Yours for just .59 a pop. I kinda like the floating brain — did it pop out of our vic’s head? But I don’t know if I could bring myself to shoot a contestant on Dancing with the Zombies. Especially someone named Hope. Unless it was Hope from Thirtysomething . Just saying . . . \nAxl Rose just couldn’t help himself, could he? During a concert in the low-crime, gun-free paradise known as Sao Paulo, Brazil [/sarc], the Guns ‘N Roses front man changed the lyrics of Civil War to suggest that the President Elect is feeding the fears of John Q. Public. This despite the fact that Mr. Trump is a GNR fan. The good news? “Former Guns N’ Roses guitarist DJ Ashba congratulated Donald Trump on his victory in the U.S. Presidential election on Twitter. Ashba said, “Congrats to our 45th President Donald Trump MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #UnitedWeStand #DevidedWeFall #ElectionNight.” \nHey Rocky! Watch me pull a Hexmag out of my hat! . . . Hexmag History: Two Guys, A Lot of Work, and A Good Idea –“ To get a magazine to correctly lock up tightly in the firearm, feed reliably and add additional desired features such as a sturdy and functional slots for reliably charging the magazine from 10-round strippers is a real trick . . . A couple of clear thinking guys saw a way to make a better mouse trap, the guts to try it and the ability to get it done. It is the American way, so American in fact that every single part of their products as well as the assembly is made and done in America.”‘Merica! \nIs putting Wilson Combat-branded grips on your non-Wilson Combat 1911 like putting an M badge on a non-M BMW sedan or SUV? Yes. Yes it is. Shame on you! \nWho knew guns could get discouraged? . . . Kenya burns 5,250 guns to discourage illegal weapons – “Kenya has stringent gun laws and obtaining a license is difficult. Applicants must go through several interviews and background checks. Despite the precautions, hundreds of illegal guns are smuggled into Kenya through porous borders, especially from Somalia, Kenya’s war-torn neighbor to the north. Authorities estimate that at least 500,000 guns are illegally held by civilians. The guns are used in cattle raids, extremist attacks and robberies.” And there you were thinking only Chicago suffered from porous borders.” But NOT self-defense, obviously . \nThree Decades Later, Star Wars Finally Gives Warwick Davis a Blaster Rifle –“ It’s hard to imagine that after three decades and a bunch of roles in different Star Wars films, Warwick Davis has never actually wielded a blaster rifle. That is, until Rogue One . . . Davis plays an alien insurgent on the planet Jedha who currently does not have a name, but will have one.” Let’s hope Mr. Davis has better aim than those hapless Storm Troopers. And now for something remotely plausible . . . Recommended For You",

Credit: HP Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 15, 2016 4:42 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nHP has been hoping that sleek, powerful hardware will lure Apple Mac aficionados to switch to its PCs, and now is aiming the new Z2 Mini mini-desktop at Mac Mini users. \nThe Z2 Mini packs the computing power of a full-size desktop into a box that can be held in one hand. Starting at $699, it will be available worldwide starting in December. \nHP has been excelling in PC design, with innovative desktops like Pavilion Wave , a cylindrical desktop, and Elite Slice , a modular mini-desktop onto which components can be snapped. \nThe 2.4-kilogram Z2 Mini can cram an Intel server CPU and discrete Nvidia GPU -- both of which have their own cooling fans -- into a tiny space while delivering screaming performance. \nThe Z2 Mini could be an alternative for those looking to replace the aging Mac Mini, which hasn't received a design or hardware upgrade for years now. \nApple has been abandoning the professional market and, for engineers and designers, the Z2 Mini is superior to the Mac Mini, said Jeff Wood, vice president of HP's workstation business, during a briefing. \nThe idea that Apple is stepping away from the professional market was highlighted during the recent release of the MacBook Pro , which has innovative features like the Touch Bar. But it attracted criticism for using old Intel Skylake chips, and was widely considered more of a consumer than a business PC. \nApple also hasn't upgraded its Mac Pro desktop since 2013, and workstations with Windows are filling that void. The new Windows workstations have superior processors, GPUs, memory and SSD storage. \nThe Z2 Mini is targeted at engineers and architects using applications like Autodesk or Solidworks. However, it isn't meant for use with VR headsets like Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, an HP spokesperson said. Nvidia's Quadro M620 GPU isn't designed for VR, and headsets typically need full-powered desktops like the Z840 with cutting-edge GPUs. \nThe Z2 mini-desktop can be configured with Intel's Xeon E3-1200v5 CPU, or Core chips. It supports up to 32GB of memory and up to 1.5TB of storage. \nAn entry-level model will have three DisplayPort ports, two USB 3.0 ports and an Ethernet port. A fully loaded model will have two additional USB Type-C ports. \nBut some features are missing. It doesn't have an HDMI port to attach displays, or a Thunderbolt 3 slot to attach high-speed storage. Workstation users dealing with high-end graphics need more than 1.5TB of storage, and the USB 3.0 port, with its data transfer speed of 10Gbps (bits per second), may not be enough. Storage devices attached to a Thunderbolt 3 port -- which transfers data at 40Gbps -- can be used in real time, much like internal storage. \nThe Z2 can be mounted behind a monitor so it remains hidden.

      "text": " DonorDrive\nCINCINNATI , Nov. 15, DonorDrive client, the COPD Foundation today brings supporters the ability to donate with Apple Pay, which is transforming mobile payments with an easy, secure and private way to donate that's fast and convenient.\nThe COPD Foundation now accepts Apple Pay for their series of Breathe Strong events, DIY or fundraise-your-way campaigns, memorial and tribute pages, as well as for general donations. With 75% of mobile donation dollars in The COPD Foundation's fundraising software, DonorDrive, coming through iOS, this will mean substantially more money for their mission of preventing and curing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.\nDonating in apps and on websites accepting Apple Pay is as simple as the touch of a finger with Touch ID, so there's no need to manually fill out lengthy account forms or repeatedly type in billing information.\nTodd Levy , CEO of DonorDrive Peer-to-Peer Fundraising, is delighted to see the organization as one of the earliest adopters of giving by Apple Pay: \"We're thrilled that the COPD Foundation is one of the first nonprofits offering this easy and secure giving option to their supporters.\"\nSecurity and privacy is at the core of Apple Pay. When you use a credit or debit card with Apple Pay, the actual card numbers are not stored on the device, nor on Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element on your device. Each transaction is authorized with a one-time unique dynamic security code.\nApple Pay is easy to set up and users will continue to receive all of the rewards and bene?ts offered by credit and debit cards. When making payments for goods, services and donations on the go in apps or Safari, Apple Pay works with iPhone 6 and later, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3 and later. You can also use Apple Pay in Safari on any Mac introduced in or after 2012 running macOS Sierra and confirm the payment with iPhone 6 or later or Apple Watch.\nFor more information on Apple Pay, visit: http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/\nFor more information about the COPD Foundation, visit: http://COPDFoundation.org\nDonorDrive Peer-to-Peer Fundraising Software helps nonprofits raise more money. With DonorDrive, organizations like MADD, Children's Miracle Network Hospitals, JDRF, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and NDSS Buddy Walks have raised more than $1 Billion .

      "text": "Tumblr Pinterest \nBrace yourselves, Apple fanboys. Christmas is about to look a lot merrier. \nThe Cupertino tech giant today announced the release of a new hardbound book which chronicles 20 years of pure Apple design. The intriguing story of the Jobs-Wozniak aesthetic is expressed through 450 photographs of past and current Apple products. \nMore specifically, the book entitled Designed by Apple in California will visually cover products from 1998’s iMac all the way to 2015’s Apple Pencil. \nThe minimalist publication will also document the vast array of materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team over two decades of innovation. \n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer. \n“This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” \nThe book features photography by Andrew Zuckerman and is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. \nTo make it even more appealing the book will come in two sizes and be printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight colour separations and low-ghost ink. \nThis linen-bound hardcover itself took eight years to develop. \nDesigned by Apple in California will be available from the 16th of November in small (260 x 324mm) for A$289 and large (330 x 413mm) for A$429. \nApple stores will also be stocking the publication. \nSign Up For A Daily Dose of D'Marge Email *",

Apple unveiled the new iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 tablets and the iMac with 5K Retina display.(Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) \nNews regarding the Apple iMac 2016 release date was not announced by Cupertino-based tech giant during their October event. However, fans are hopeful as rumors surfaced the presence of the new Kaby Lake processor in Apple's flagship device with 5K resolution display. Advertisement Intel’s Next-Gen ‘Kaby Lake’ CPUs Revealed, Likely Bound for Apple’s 2017 iMac and Mac Pro https://t.co/cOekyy8gSa via @iDropNews \n— iDrop News (@iDropNews) November 2, 2016 \nWhy is there a delay of Apple iMac 2016 release date? \nAccording to reports , the reason for the delay of Apple iMac 2016 release date announcement is that Kaby Lake processor is still unavailable, which Intel is yet to unveil. A recent Intel report found by AnandTech , however, says that the giant chip-maker is poised to release 11 quad-core Kaby Lake processors, all within the first three months of 2017. \nThe report details the planned release of seven (7) Core i5s, three (3) Core i7s, and one Xeon E3 v6 processors, chips that have been rumored to appear in the Apple iMac 2016 for quite some time now. \nIf the rumors of the new Kaby Lake processor in Apple iMac 2016 prove to be true, then each of these Kaby Lake chips are significantly faster and improved than their Skylake counterparts. This will make these new family of processors perfect for the latest version of Apple's flagship all-in-one. \nWill the Apple iMac 2016 sport a 5k resolution display? \nApple iMac 2016 will be arriving in a 5K resolution display. And the soon-to-released Apple iMac 20016 is now dubbed Apple iMac 2017. More info is yet to be released by the tech giant. \nIs Apple threatened by Microsoft's latest Surface Studio? \nApple really needs to step up its game though and come up with an official Apple iMac 2016 release date since the all-in-one market just got a little bit more interesting with the announcement of Microsoft's Surface Studio. \nThe new productivity device from Microsoft is currently miles ahead of the present iMac in both specs and features and usability. Support for the Microsoft Surface Pen and a new innovative tool called the Surface Dial pushed the Surface Studio to the top when compared side by side to the Apple iMac. \nThe Apple iMac has always prided itself with the distinction of being one of the best productivity and creativity devices in the market, but with the Microsoft Surface Studio's appearance, Apple's all-in-one has been left far back in the race. \nMore news and updates on the Apple iMac 2016 (or 2017) will be posted soon. So stay tuned for the highly anticipated announcement and release date. \n  Related Articles",

Email * iOS 10 Problems: Fix Battery Life, WiFi, Bluetooth Connectivity Issues, Bitmoji Keyboard And Other iPhone, iPad Problems \nApple is working hard on it’s beta updates for iOS 10.2 and the latest version of the software includes a change that will cause many naughty texters to breathe a sigh of relief. In the latest iOS 10.2 Beta 3, Apple has changed the peach emoji back to its original curvature, which many akin to a curvy rear end. \nMany on social media and texting use the peach emoji as reference to a butt. However, in the 10.2 Beta 2 software, Apple updated the look and shape of the fruit emoji to be rounder and less butt-like. This did not go over well is iOS users testing the new software. \nThe Next Web discovered Tuesday, within the recently released 10.2 Beta 3 that the peach emoji has returned to its original shape. However, Apple maintained the fuzzy more peach-like shading that it added in the 10.2 Beta 2. The best of both worlds. \nThe final version of iOS 10.2 is expected to release sometime in December and includes a host of new emojis , including an avocado, shark, croissant, a shark, a carrot, a squid, bacon, a kiwi, and an owl. Other notable emojis include female versions of the professional emojis , such as the teacher, astronaut, welder, coder, business worker, farmer, scientist, chef, student, mechanic, and doctor. ",

Originally, Apple gave September 7th as the date it would begin tidying up the store — the day of the iPhone 7’s launch — but it appears large-scale removals only began seriously last month. \nIn total, 47,300 apps were removed from the App Store, a figure 3.4 times greater than the store’s average amount of monthly removals, which generally comes in at around 14,000 (based on numbers tracked beginning in January 2016). \nDespite the cleanup, Sensor Tower notes that the App Store is still growing, and could balloon to more than double its current size by 2020, reaching about 5 million apps. \nApple also noted in September that it planned to impose more stringent naming guidelines that would see developers limiting the title of their app to 50 characters. Both changes are being made in an attempt to simplify search results .",

Despite how sleek and refined Apple’s new MacBook Pro is, it lacks MagSafe — which to my surprise I actually don’t miss — an SD card slot and to many, the most frustrating exclusion, USB-A. \nThere’s no easy solution to this problem beyond simply just sucking it up and buying a plethora of hubs and dongles, or ditching macOS for a Windows 10 laptop, a move many irate Apple fans insist they’re planning, though likely won’t follow through with. To quote a joke that isn’t funny anymore, perhaps these individuals just don’t have the “courage” to do so. \nApple’s decision to adopt USB-C over USB-A follows a historical pattern. The company has a history of forcibly killing aging technology like the floppy drive and DVD drive, though in the case of USB-A, this shift is likely a few years too soon. \nI dream of a world where we use one port format for everything and Apple pushing the USB-C narrative is a step in the right direction towards that utopia. However, since that future isn’t here and likely won’t be for a few years, there are growing pains. The fact that Apple strangely stuck with Lightning over USB-C with the iPhone 7 also throws a wrench into my dream. I can plug Google’s Pixel directly into Apple’s new MacBook Pro and not the iPhone 7. Whatever way you look at this situation, it doesn’t seem right, especially for a laptop with the term ‘Pro’ in its name. \nNow that what I affectionately refer to as the “ dongle life ” has gone mainstream, connecting a device to the new MacBook Pro is significantly more challenging than it once was. I, however, come from the future, having used Apple’s 12-inch MacBook as my primary computer for approximately a year, before switching to the Surface Book for the last six months or so. \nWhile the dongle life makes things more difficult, to some extent I fall in the target market for Apple’s new MacBook Pro laptop. I’m the type of user who doesn’t plug a lot devices into my computer when I’m on the go, covering events or traveling to or from work — though the lack of an SD card slot does make things more difficult for me when shooting photos at press events. \nTo circumvent this issue, I plug my camera, a Lumia G85, into a USB-C dongle, and pull photographs directly from the camera. Is this convoluted? A little bit, but it helps remove one step from the process of getting images directly onto my PC. \nHowever, when I sit down at my desk at the MobileSyrup office, I’m forced to use a USB-C hub — my current dongle life accessory of choice is Apple’s USB-C Digital AV Multiport hub , which features USB-A, USB-C (for charging) and HDMI — allowing me to plug my monitor into the new MacBook Pro via HDMI and charge it at the same time. I also add a USB-A 3.0 hub to the mix so that I can plug both my mouse and an SD card reader into the new Pro. \nThe resulting mess of cords and ports takes up a fair amount of space on my desk, but it gets the job done. In the future, I plan to buy a sleeker hub, perhaps one with multiple USB-A ports, but one that also includes a standard HDMI connection doesn’t seem to exist right now. Most USB-C hubs currently on the market suffer from connectivity issues and aren’t reliable. When a dominant player finally emerges with an affordable offering, I’ll definitely pick it up. \nThis is an interim period though and part of why to some extent I agree with Apple’s decision to adopt only USB-C in its new laptop. In a few years almost all devices, including monitors, will likely utilize USB-C, making this mess of dongles and cords a problem of the past. \nIt’s also important to note that technically the ports present in the new MacBook Pro are USB-C and Thunderbolt 3, with both protocols working through the same connector. The issue that begins to appear, however, is that while both connectors look the same, they don’t actually operate identically. \nNilay Patel over at The Verge has reported that plugging a DisplayPort monitor into a USB-C to Thunderbolt adapter doesn’t always work as you may think. Thunderbolt 1 and 2 use the same connector as Mini DisplayPort, but Patel’s adapter didn’t support DisplayPort and instead, just Thunderbolt. If the above two sentences sound confusing, you aren’t alone. The entire issue is difficult for almost anyone to wrap their head around. \nAnother example is the fact that the USB-C cable included in the MacBook Pro for charging purposes doesn’t work as a display connector. In addition, different ports on the new MacBook Pro also offer various throughput (this situation is complicated, so check out this story in Apple Insider if you’re interested). \nIn the end, navigating the complicated waters of USB-C is a chore right now, and consumers willing to deal with this mess will experience difficulties. On the bright side, Apple has lowered the cost of its USB-C adapters in Canada, though it likely would have been a good idea for the company to include some sort of hub for free in the Pro’s box in the first place. \nUSB-C is most certainly the future, the issue is that the future just isn’t here yet. \nRelated: Apple cuts price of USB-C accessories in Canada following MacBook Pro outrage [Update] LeTricolore \n“There’s no easy solution to this problem beyond simply just sucking it up and buying a plethora of hubs and dongles, or ditching macOS for a Windows 10 laptop, a move many irate Apple fans insist they’re planning, though likely won’t follow through with” \nWhy do you say that? \nBecause I can think of about 10 people off hand that I know personally who were outraged by the switch, but have now said they’re just going to buy one anyways. Mo Dabbas \nBut what still boggles me is why do people have to buy it despite not liking the lack of ports. For example, I’ve been using a surface pro 2 as my laptop, it’s still running well even thought it’s been about 3 years since I bought it. Why do people have to suck it up and buy a new macbook pro if their old one is still working fine?? Why not wait until USB-C becomes the main popular standard for everything which would eliminate the need of other ports. Ok, let’s assume they need a macbook pro right away because their’s collapsed or something, why not get an apple refurbished macbook pro which usually sell for 15-25% cheaper and you still get that same excellent warranty. Also, apple still sells the macbook air for now. If these people hate the lack of ports they desire in the macbook pro there are other options (within apple) to consider. The Iceman Cometh \nSo you excuse this company for this ridiculousness? USB C is t there yet and Apples move here is truly inexcusable Bob Loblaw \nApple doesn’t care. Their fanboys are retarded. They’ll eat up whatever sh!t apple poops out. hunter2 \nAs someone whose used docking stations for years I don’t see this as a problem. \nWhen you describe the situation at your desk, isn’t plugging in a single USB cable which connects to a hub that your charger, monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc plug into more desirable then getting to your desk and attaching 5 or 6 individual connectors into your laptop? fred \nChoice. I know Apple fans don’t understand this word.But having say, 2 USB-A connectors and 2 USB-C (instead of 4 USB-C) would give a lot more choice and flexibility to users. You’d be free not to use any USB-A port and still use your hub. But at least you could connect a USB thumb drive on the road. hunter2 \nI agree, its good to have choice. But I can also see the other end of the argument where having a choice will just cause people to never change. \nFor example, my work has mini meeting rooms with 27 inch monitors for small 2-6 person meetings. These things didn’t get equipped with HDMI cables until a large portion of our laptops were newer models with no VGA ports. It’s totally conceivable to me that if Dell didn’t drop the VGA port these monitors would still have no HDMI cables attached to them. I saw the same transition with optical discs. Despite every user having a shared drive mapped to their system where they could easily drop any data too large for an email, burning optical discs was still common until the optical drives were removed from enough of the laptops in circulation to cause it to be too cumbersome. fred \nWe all agree that we need to transition to new technology.But there is a good way to do it, and it’s to support both the old and the new tech during the transition. hunter2 \nI understand that viewpoint. My argument was just that a lot of times, when both are supported the, that transition either never materializes or is significantly delayed. \nLike i’m seeing dual USB A/ USB C flash drives at walmart. Personally I think these would be niche devices if the MacBook and smaller Dells didn’t start the ball rolling by dropping the ports. Our Dell 7275s dropped the USB A ports a while before this MacBook Pro came out. fred \nAlso don’t forget that Apple has been wrong in choosing connectors many times: Firewire, mini-DVI, ADC, Thunderbolt 2… \nFortunately they never made a laptop with only Firewire ports. \nThe fact is that USB-A will remain useful at least for the next 5 years. After which many of those who purchased that shiny MacBook will replace it anyways. \nI agree, but I also think that Apple pushing USB-C is the right thing, they’re just too early. Also, a USB-A should be included with every Pro, just like the headphone adapter with the iPhone 7. p_lindsay",

Others are using it as an opportunity to stress their companies' values and mission, or an opportunity to make nice with Trump, who many CEOs were publicly against during the campaign. \nThe men and women who head the nation's biggest companies know that having a hostile relationship with the Trump administration could make doing business difficult. They also know that they operate in liberal bastions like New York and San Francisco just as much as in Trump-leaning places like Fort Wayne, Indiana, or Charleston, West Virginia. \n\"Neutral is the best policy,\" says John Challenger, CEO of workplace consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas. \nT-Mobile's Legere, who long was vocally opposed to Trump, congratulated the president-elect on Twitter for his victory last week, while holding off on judging the president-elect's policies. Meanwhile another telecommunications executive, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, himself an immigrant and personally opposed to Trump, sent an email to employees saying that \"it's our obligation to accept the will of our fellow Americans and respect the new leader.\" \nIt's possible that Legere and Claure made nice because the president appoints the chairman and commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission, an agency that holds enormous influence over the telecommunications industry. All five FCC commissioners will see their terms expire during Trump's first term. \nCEOs of automakers, including Ford's Mark Fields, have also struck a conciliatory tone, partly because Trump has called for the repeal or renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has allowed the automakers to set up shop in Mexico tariff-free. \nMany CEOs publicly expressed hope that the tensions dividing the country will diminish, and that American consumers will set aside their fears and get back to what they do best: shop. \n\"We are hoping that in the postelection we are just going to see people ready to spend,\" said Marvin Ellison, CEO of JCPenney. \nCEOs and companies that try to bring people together are \"going to be the winners,\" says Dr. Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University's Lubin School of Business. \"That always works better from a brand perspective,\" he says. \nWall Street, which donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, also now faces an administration that could provide both profit and peril. \nTrump has said he wants to roll back some of the regulations in the Dodd-Frank law that was passed after the financial crisis, a move that would benefit big Wall Street banks. But the Republican Party's platform also contains a provision calling for the return of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Great Depression-era law that broke up big banks. \nThere's talk of a massive, $1 trillion infrastructure program that could rely on tax credits to private funding sources. Many of those programs will require Wall Street's army of investment bankers and lawyers to help underwrite and finance. \n\"The president-elect's commitment to infrastructure spending, government reform and tax reform — among other things — will be good for growth and, therefore, will be good for our clients and for our firm,\" said Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, according to a transcript of a voicemail he sent companywide. \nIn an email to his employees, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the election of Trump shows \"the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face.\" \nTrump's victory drew a range of responses from CEOs in Silicon Valley, where popular sentiment had tilted strongly against Trump because of his statements on immigrants, women, overseas manufacturing and the use of encryption in consumer products like Apple's iPhones. \nIn a postelection email to employees, Apple CEO Cook didn't mention Trump by name but acknowledged that many people had strong feelings about the outcome of the vote. Cook had let it be known during the campaign that he didn't support Trump, although he generally avoided taking a public stance on the candidates. In his email, Cook said Apple would continue to support diversity. [ The Daily Progress news app keeps you up-to-date.

But he added, \"While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple's North Star hasn't changed.\" \nMicrosoft's chief executive was more conciliatory. In a post on LinkedIn, the social networking site that Microsoft is buying, Satya Nadella wrote: \"We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday.\" But Nadella added that Microsoft is committed to \"fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.\" \nFacebook's Zuckerberg, who had previously criticized Trump's call for building a wall on the Mexican border, sounded subdued in a post on his own social network. \n\"I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children,\" he wrote. \"This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line.\" \nThe most combative response came from the CEO at Grubhub, an online food delivery service based in Chicago. Matt Maloney said in an email to employees that he rejects Trump's \"nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics,\" adding that anyone who disagrees should immediately resign \"because you have no place here.\" \nMaloney later backtracked in a tweet that said \"Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees — even those who voted for Trump.\" \nOther companies have taken the election and its aftermath as a marketing opportunity, most notably airlines. British Airways ran ads on Facebook urging people to visit London, using the tag line \"had enough of this house?\" under a photo of the White House. Air New Zealand ran ads on Instagram and elsewhere highlighting the results of the election and inviting people to visit New Zealand. Spirit Airlines promoted a 75 percent off sale for flights to Canada. \n___ \nAP Technology Writer Brandon Bailey contributed to this report from San Francisco.

      "text": "Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives.\nEnlarge Image Beautifully pricey.\nPhoto by Apple Apple is 40.\nIt's time for museums around the world to offer retrospectives. It's time for Apple's design principles to be taught in the universities of the world.\nHere, then, is another step in the deification of the Apple brand. The company on Tuesday released a coffee-table book.\nIt's called \" Designed By Apple In California .\" It's full of sumptuous pictures of its meticulously crafted products of the last 20 years.\nEverything's shot with only perfection in mind. Each product flaunts its best angle. And of course, every page has a glorious white background. Even the cover is a pure white.\nSome might find the price a little less pure. It's $300. You could see that as a bargain. It's roughly 67 cents per picture.\nIf you want to drive a better (but smaller) bargain, there's a mini version of the book for a mere $199.\nYou might still want to whisper to yourself in Jony Ive tones about the care that's gone into this book's design.\nApple's blurb offers that the book is \"printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.\"\nMore Technically Incorrect Comedian Bill Maher introduces Apple's stunning new gun Facebook is a 'cesspool of nonsense,' says John Oliver Man started wildfire to get more Facebook views, police say How often are you going to have gilded matte silver edges in your life? How often are you going to buy a book that Apple says was 8 years in the making?\nIve himself insists in the foreword to the book that it's \"an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are.\"\nIronically, some might see this tome as a swansong. No, not because Apple's design isn't what it used to be.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has already suggested a ban on Apple products . He's already insisted he'll force Cupertino to produce its products where they're designed.\nWhat if Apple rebels? Perhaps the company will become a national pariah, sent underground for its un-American ways. Where, then, will we get design perfection?",

Apple's peach emoji looks like a butt again, world rejoices 0 Share: \nPeaches: An emotional emoji journey. Photo by Daniel Van Boom/CNET \nFear not, iPhone users, the butt emoji is back. \nOf course, there is no actual butt emoji -- there are standards and practices against that sort of thing. But Apple 's initial iOS 10.2 update changed the peach emoji, a longtime representative of the behind, into less of a butt and into more of an actual peach. \nThat grave wrong, protested around social media , has now been undone. The third beta version of iOS 10.2, released today, brings back the peach we all know and love. And people are pretty excited.",

      "text": "The integration of Siri and the PayPal iOS app indicates Apple’s desire to broaden the scope of its virtual assistant. By Roland Moore-Colyer PayPal has joined forces with Apple to enable payments to be made through voice commands to the Siri virtual assistant. iPhone and iPad users with Siri on their devices can simply request money to be sent to another user through a voice command such as \"Hey Siri, send Bill £50 using PayPal,\" which will trigger the payment to be made through the PayPal app on iOS.The new feature is rolling out to users in the United Kingdom today, and 29 other countries, including the United States, China, United Arab Emirates, India, Brazil and Belgium, will also have access to the service. Siri integration PayPal's integration of Siri is indicative of Apple's aim to make its virtual assistant more useful and not limited to only working with native iOS apps. The Cupertino, Calif., company, notorious for keeping its products and services under wraps and not being nearly as open as Google's Android, announced in September it would be enabling third-party developers to tap into Siri to bring the virtual assistant into more apps. Given the likes of Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant can be used to interact with third-party services, opening Siri to developers seems to have been a prudent move by Apple to not allow Siri to be outclassed by other virtual assistants such as Microsoft's Cortana. The smartphone virtual assistant arena appears to be getting crowded pretty quickly; what started out with Siri debuting on the iPhone 4S in 2011, now has Google Now and the search company's artificial intelligence (AI) powered assistant , Cortana, Alexa, and an as yet un-named and un-released assistant from Samsung . Facebook is also getting in on the act with its M for Messenger service , a pseudo AI assistant that is backed up by human support to ensure that the service gets requests right and can be trained to be smarter as it goes along. While the rise of the machines may be some way off, undoubtedly more virtual assistants will make their way into popular devices and software with the aim to takeover the dull everyday tasks that bog down modern human life.",

      "text": "Apple leak reveals the next iPhone with LCD, OLED and dual-camera models Apple leak reveals the next iPhone with LCD, OLED and dual-camera models Apple might just bring out a dramatically redesigned iPhone in 2018. By: FE Online | Updated: November 16, 2016 11:18 AM So, as of now three variants of the ‘iPhone 8’ are expected to come out next year: 4.7-inch iPhone with LCD display and the single camera, 5.5-inch iPhone model with LCD display and dual camera and 5.5-inch iPhone model with OLED display and dual camera. (Instagram: Apple_concepts) \nApple might just bring out a dramatically redesigned iPhone next year. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is well known for revealing Apple’s future plans. Kuo now has revealed the next iPhone which might mark the company’s biggest change in years. Kuo told MacRumours, “We look for new 2017 iPhones to come in three models: one OLED model, and two TFT-LCD models with a 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch display. We believe the OLED and 5.5-inch TFT-LCD iPhones will feature [a] dual-camera. Based on this prediction, our forecast of dual camera adoption rate in new 2017F iPhone models is revised up from 30-40% to 65-75%. We view this increase as favouring Largan’s sales and profit momentum as it is the exclusive supplier of a wide-angle and telephoto lens. It also bodes well for Apple’s dual camera software ecosystem.” The most notable feature is that Apple is finally incorporating the OLED display. Apple devices as of now use IPS LCD display panels. OLED is a very next-gen technology as it works without a backlight which saves battery as well as makes the device lighter and thinner, apart from getting larger contrast ratio. However, other major smartphone manufacturers have been using the OLED for many years now. \nSo, as of now three variants of the ‘iPhone 8’ are expected to come out next year: 4.7-inch iPhone with LCD display and the single camera, 5.5-inch iPhone model with LCD display and dual camera and 5.5-inch iPhone model with OLED display and dual camera. While this time the report does not talk much except the display panels and camera, KGI had earlier made predictions that there is a high chance that iPhone 8 will have a glass front and back, stainless steel metal for premium models. Meanwhile, LG and Samsung have reportedly been fighting it out on who will get Apple’s business for OLED displays. \nAlso read | Apple’s new iOS update to have ‘Panic Button’ only for India; here are the other new features \nMeanwhile, Barclays supply chain analysts believe the next iPhone will have a bezel-less design with two variants of 5-inch and 5.8-inch screens. As it is, it is quite clear that the smaller smartphones will not the dual-camera even in 2018, and the better display panel will still be reserved for the premium variants of the iPhone.  ",

      "text": "Apple Unveils Design Book With 450 Photos Chronicling 20 Years of Products The book is titled Designed by Apple in California It consists of 450 photographs of Apple products Apple has dedicated the book to Steve Jobs \nApple has just announced a hardbound book that compiles 450 photographs chronicling all the products that the company has made in the past. This book has been released to commemorate co-founder Steve Jobs, and it represents Apple's journey since its foundation days. \nThe book is titled 'Designed by Apple in California' and it comes in two sizes - the smaller one with dimensions 10.20x12.75-inch is priced starting at $199 (roughly Rs. 13,500), while the large hardbound book with dimensions 13x16.25-inch is priced starting at $299 (roughly Rs. 20,300). The design of the book is sparse at best, and it contains just Apple product photographs lined up in ascending order one page after the other. \nIn the book's foreword, Design Chief Jon Ive explains , \"While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.\" While it's rather odd of a company to boast of its own achievements, Apple is considered as the pinnacle of success when it comes to design and consumer products. Its evolution in design is worth being documented, but monetised? That's another debate altogether. Ive claims that this gathering of product designs in one book, will give a huge understanding and learning of how products evolved over the years, and be a rich resource for design students in the future.\nIn any case, \"Designed by Apple in California\" is available on the company website in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK and the US, and in select Apple Stores.",

      "text": " Google+\nApple\nBy Nicole Hernandez Globe Staff November 15, 2016\nIt’s never too early to start thinking of gifts for the holidays (40 days until Christmas), and Apple might have just the thing: A book of its past and current products.\nIt’ll just cost either $199 or $299.\nAdvertisement\n“Designed by Apple in California,” dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs , is a collection of 450 photographs that chronicles more than 20 years of design, the company said Tuesday in a press release .\nThe book will be available at select Apple retail locations and online beginning Wednesday in two sizes: small ($199) or large ($299). The small book is about 10 inches by 12.75 inches, while the large is 13 inches by 16.25, according to Apple.\nGet Business Headlines Starting at $269, the Apple Watch , one of the company’s more recent products, could be a cheaper option than the large book.\n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, the company’s chief design officer.\n“We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.”\nAdvertisement\nNone of the Apple stores in Greater Boston was listed as a retail location for “Designed by Apple in California,” so if you can’t wait for the book to arrive from the website, some stores in New York will be selling the tome.\nMore images from Apple of “Designed by Apple in California”:\nApple\nApple\nApple\nApple\nApple\nApple\nNicole Hernandez can be reached at nicole.hernandez@globe.com .

The Apple iPhone 6S Plus. File picture: Reuters. Credit: REUTERS \n“In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cellphones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who've reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,” the association said in a statement on its website. \nRead also: ‘My Samsung Galaxy J5 caught fire’ \nApple did not respond to a request for comment when contacted outside regular hours on Tuesday. \nIn September Apple's rival phone maker Samsung Electronics Co announced a global recall of at least 2.5 million of its flagship Note 7 smartphones due to faulty batteries causing some phones to catch fire.

      "text": "WhatsApp launched voice calling feature worldwide on Tuesday In our tests, Apple's FaceTime used the least amount of data Skype and WhatsApp video calling used similar amounts of data \nWhatsApp on Tuesday announced the mass rollout of its video calling feature, which had been in beta testing till now. With this move, WhatsApp has brought encrypted video calling facility to over 1 billion of its users worldwide, enabling them to make face-to-face calls despite the distances between them. \nBut WhatsApp is not the only app to offer video calling functionality to users. Skype was the first major player in this space, while FaceTime comes pre-installed on millions of Apple devices across the world, giving it a huge user base as well. Each of these apps offers secure video calls and smooth interface, and claims to offer good user experience. ( Also see : How to Get Started With WhatsApp Video Calling )\nHowever, unless you are on Wi-Fi, using Skype, WhatsApp video calls, or FaceTime can be an expensive affair, considering the data consumed and associated charges. We compared the data consumed by WhatsApp, Skype, and Apple’s FaceTime in video calls to find out which uses the least amount. To do this, we made 4-minute calls using each app. \nApple’s FaceTime used the least amount of data in the test, eating up 8.8MB of data in a 4-minute call. Skype and WhatsApp consumed an average of 12.3MB and 12.74MB of mobile data during video calls. All calls were made on Vodafone 3G network in Delhi-NCR telecom circle. The amount of data consumed was calculated as an average of 3 calls made using each app. \nThe video call quality on both WhatsApp and Skype was not great, with choppy video reported at the other person's side. On FaceTime, the video call quality was decent till the other person switched to mobile data as well, after which the video became severely pixelated and lagged considerably. So, FaceTime used less data despite the call quality being better or comparable. \n( Also see : Eight WhatsApp Features That Would Make 160 Million Indians Very Happy ) \nAt approximately 25 paise per MB average cost of data on Vodafone in the Delhi-NCR circle (for a 1GB 3G/ 4G prepaid recharge that costs Rs. 255), a 4-minute video call amounts to roughly Rs. 2.2 - or 55 paise per minute - being spent on FaceTime calls and approximately Rs. 3.1 - or 80 paise per minute - on WhatsApp and Skype. \nNote: We tried making video calls using Google Duo , but the app suspended the video call due to bad network conditions on the same Vodafone network that WhatsApp, FaceTime, and Skype were able to make calls. This is why we couldn't include Google Duo in this comparison.",

      "text": "Rumor: Apple May Make Augmented Reality Glasses Is Apple looking to succeed where Google failed with Google Glass? By Matt Porter \nApple is reportedly exploring the possibility of creating augmented reality glasses. \nAccording to Bloomberg , sources say the glasses would connect to iPhones wirelessly, and be able to show images and information in the wearer's field of vision. Apple has not yet confirmed these rumors, and the sources asked not to be identified. \nBack in January there were rumors Apple was working on a virtual reality headset . We will have to wait and see whether these latest reports are part of this project or something different. \nBloomberg reports Apple has ordered small quantities of near-eye displays for testing, however they are told the AR glasses won't be available until 2018 at the earliest. \nApple is still making a lot of money, however its profits are down this year compared to last. The tech giant may be looking for new avenues to expand into. \nLast month Apple unveiled the new MacBook Pro at a special event, alongside some new Apple TV announcements. \nMatt Porter is a freelance writer based in London. Make sure to visit what he thinks is the best website in the world , but is actually just his Twitter page .",

The iOS 10.3 beta for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch now comes with a SOS feature that allows users to call emergency services upon multiple presses of the lock button. In light of the increased crime against women in the country, the Government of India recently announced mandatory guidelines for mobile phone manufacturers, which states that all mobile phones launched in India from 2017 onwards must have a panic button. Although penetration of the iOS software isn’t at par with Android in the country, but Apple’s initiative could pave way for other device manufacturers",

      "text": "Nintendo\nOne of Apple’s surprise announcements during their September event was that Nintendo was coming in a big way with Super Mario Run . The game, which features Mario running forward and is designed to be played just by tapping the screen with a finger, didn’t have a release date, or a price. Now it’s got both, and the price might be a bit of sticker shock for those used to free-to-play games.\nNintendo has announced the game will be arriving on iOS December 15th, and it’ll have three modes you can try out. But if you want the full experience, you’ll be paying $9.99 for it. As apps go, that’s a premium price, but if anybody can get away with charging ten bucks for a game on iOS, it’s Nintendo, especially for a new Mario game.\nRelated Links:\nPeople Are Already Frustrated At Nintendo For Their Lack Of Stock For The NES Classic Nintendo Is Celebrating The Release Of The NES Classic By Bringing Back Their Power Line For A Weekend\nIt also fits with the company’s larger strategy. It’s easy to forget Nintendo sees itself as a toy company and that games like Super Mario Run or Pokémon Go are little more than experiments as it works out just how it fits in a mobile future. Don’t forget that Nintendo is, to some degree, taking on Apple and Google with their new console the Switch, and is exploring mobile in general. If Super Mario Run can make Apple fans open their wallets, then we might be seeing a very different Nintendo sooner rather than later.\n(via The Verge )",

      "text": "Apple Makes Things Right, Restores Peach Butt Emoji Via iOS 10.2 Beta 3 16 November 2016, 2:32 am EST By Chris Loterina Tech Times Due to public furor, Apple has brought back the controversial peach emoji it recently redesigned in a beta version of the iOS 10. It only got a bit more shiny and realistic.   \nWhile emojis will certainly not replace texts in messages anytime soon, it is increasingly integrated into modern electronic communication. That is why when Apple redesigned the peach emoji for an iOS 10 beta version, the company drew immense amount of flak, prompting a complete turnaround. Realistic iOS Style \nThis issue has two important variables going for it. First, there is Apple's drive to redesign the entire range of emojis available in future iterations of the iOS. In the current beta versions, the changes indicate that the visual language will lean more toward realistic style. \nThe other variable is, of course, the peach emoji itself. It is only one of the two in the Apple stable that are sexual in nature. If you are living under a rock, then you should know that the emoji now also means butt. The other one is, of course, the eggplant. People will not require a tremendous amount of imagination to divine what that means. Emoji Makeover \nSo in the current stable version of the iOS 10, the peach emoji looks like this: (Photo : Emojipedia) \nThe naughty emoji has not only figured prominently in sexting , but it also generally enlivens conversations for instant messaging applications by adding a dash of color and also a bit of humor. Despite its obsession for control over its products, Apple has never been a puritan, so no one expected it to remove it altogether. \nNow, a recently released beta build called iOS 10.2 changed the peach into this: (Photo : Emojipedia) \nYou may be assured that the change has raised a mighty ruckus among the iOS public. While the new design did get better visually, it became more of a peach — or a tomato even — than a butt. For most, the new form defeated the peach emoji's purpose. Some say that the redesign is accidental , but it did not prevent the collective complaint that it has zero appeal. @aminatou wait, the one in SC? what's happening to it?! \n— Lars Gotrich (@totalvibration) November 1, 2016 Old Naughty Emoji \nFortunately, Apple must have been taking notes. The new iOS 10.2 beta has implemented a peach makeover, reverting back into the old form but with a more realistic treatment. It is a bit shiny, but that should appease iOS users who must have been ready to raise their pitchforks to demand the return of the old peach. (Photo : Emojipedia) \nWell, one can argue that the rollout of the beta version of a product is primarily designed to gauge its viability. Apple must have learned that it will have to take great care in touching the world's favorite fruit from now on.  ",

      "text": "If Apple ( AAPL ) ultimately produces smart glasses that prove to be a smash hit, it should send a thank-you card to Alphabet /Google ( GOOGL ) for all its missteps with Google Glass.\nAnd the company might also want to thank Microsoft ( MSFT ) for both showing how an augmented reality (AR) headset can capture imaginations and appeal to developers, and initially focusing on a headset that's only meant to be used indoors. But this assumes that Microsoft won't have enlarged its ambitions by the time Apple's own headset goes on sale.\nBloomberg, which has produced many Apple scoops since hiring the well-connected Mark Gurman away from 9to5 Mac, reported Monday that Apple is thinking about creating smart glasses that would \"connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision, and may use augmented reality.\"\nIt adds Apple has \"ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing,\" and that its glasses would launch in 2018 \"at the earliest.\" Himax ( HIMX ) , which supplied the micro-displays used by Google Glass, rose 2.7% on Tuesday.\nOne big qualifier to Bloomberg's report is that Apple often \"explores\" launching products that never see the light of day. However, the report does fit with one earlier this year from The Financial Times , which said Apple has created \"a large team of experts in virtual and augmented reality and built prototypes of headsets.\"\nApple and Alphabet are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

      "text": "\nFollowing other rumours Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has confirmed that Apple has started development of an Augmented Reality headset, and has ordered small quantities of near eye displays needed for such a device.\nThe headset is believed to be powered by an iPhone, which Gurman calls the “hub” of Apple’s ecosystem and is expected, if development is successful, to hit the market in the 2018 time frame.\nThe glasses are expected to compete with Microsoft’s HoloLens, which also offers an untethered augmented reality experience, rather than Google’s Daydream virtual reality headset, with Tim Cook recently saying “My own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far, because this gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present talking to each other, but also have other things visually for both of us to see.”\nBy being tethered to an iPhone the device will likely have a cost advantage over the HoloLens, which is a compact full PC, but by then Microsoft should have built out an ecosystem of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality OEMs based on its Windows Holographic platform, with a large number of headsets running the OS expected to ship by the end of 2017.\nGurman notes that Apple is currently looking for the next big thing as a follow-up to the Apple Watch, but outside observers may note that Apple has so far failed to follow-up on the success of the iPhone, with the iPad seeing more than two years of year on year reduction in sales and the Apple Watch never really catching on. With the Apple Car rumoured to have been in intense development and then cancelled, it appears Apple’s ability to move the market and provide a serious threat to competitors is becoming less and less of an issue.",

      "text": "Ever since Apple released the iPad, many across the tech industry have openly wondered what Apple’s next big tech breakthrough will be. Sure, the company released the Apple Watch in 2014, but that device, thus far, has been more of a niche product than a revolutionary mass market device bringing in boatloads of cash.\nYesterday, a curious and new Apple rumor emerged. According to Bloomberg, Apple is seriously exploring the idea of developing a pair of smart glasses that can present users with pertinent information via a connected iPhone.\nDON’T MISS: Best Buy Black Friday 2016 ad: iPhone 7, PS4 Pro bundle, TVs, and other huge deals\nApple researches new products and technologies all the time, and it’s no secret that many early-stage Apple research projects don’t often result in a shipping product; remember when Apple was supposedly going to release a car by 2019? Nonetheless, I find this particular rumor about Apple smart glasses to be much more plausible than most rumors regarding Apple’s varied R&D initiatives.\nI’m not necessarily saying that releasing smart glasses is a smart strategic play, but more so that the logistics involved in bringing such a product to market make this specific rumor much more believable than most Apple rumors we’ve seen lately.\nFor starters, societal acceptance of wearing electronic devices on one’s head has shifted, as evidenced by the growing number of VR headsets and the recent release of Snap Inc’s Spectacles. Two, developing a pair of smart glasses is more within Apple’s area of expertise than, say, developing a car. And three, Apple CEO Tim Cook has been rather vocal about augmented reality being an area of technology worth exploration.\nJust this past summer, for example, Tim Cook said that Apple views augmented reality as a “core” technology that Apple is already doing a lot of work with behind the scenes.\n“I think AR is extremely interesting and sort of a core technology,” Cook said. “So, yes, it’s something we’re doing a lot of things on behind that curtain that we talked about.”\nOn a related note, Cook in an earnings conference call this year said that Apple is “high on augmented reality for the long run” while adding that the potential for “AR can be huge.” And in case you need any more convincing, Cook just just a few weeks said that he sees more long-term potential in AR than in VR and that he views the technology as “profound.”\n“[AR and VR] are incredibly interesting,” Cook said. “My own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far, because this gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present talking to each other, but also have other things visually for both of us to see.”\nOn top of that, Apple has filed a number of intriguing AR-related patents has has also made some notable AR-related hires recent months. To the latter point, Apple this past September hired two new engineers with deep backgrounds in augmented reality projects.\nAnd last but not least, reputed analyst Ming-Chi Kuo this month issued a research report claiming that Apple plans to integrate augmented reality into its products in just one to two years, at a minimum .\nTrending right now:\nWalmart will give you a chance to buy the NES Classic every day this week Best Buy just released an updated Black Friday ad: Here’s what’s new Forget Black Friday, Sam’s Club has a serious one-day sales event this Saturday See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Members of the media film the new iPhone 7 at an Apple store in Beijing, China, September 16, 2016. Reuters/Thomas Peter \nA pregnant Sydney woman has suffered second-degree burns after falling asleep on her charging iPhone 7. \n\"I recently purchased an Apple iPhone 7 and accidentally fell asleep with my arm on my phone whilst it was charging. I was woken up by sudden pain, pins and needles, numbness and shortness of breath,\" read the post on the Sydney woman Melanie Tan Pelaez's Facebook . \nPelaez said that the Facebook message was shared to warn her family and friends. However, the post has been shared more than 450 times and she did not expect it to go viral. \n“I went to get dressed and realised my arm was very red, so I then went to the GP and they advised me I needed to go straight to the hospital,” Pelaez told news.com.au . The hospital emergency department ran tests on her heart and blood. \nThe doctor informed Pelaez that she has been burnt by a foreign object and instructed her to check around her bed to see what could be the cause of the injury. Pelaez said that she believed that her iPhone 7 was to blame. She said that the markings on her arm matched the phone and the charger. \nPelaez immediately took the phone into the Apple Store but she was informed that the phone couldn't be the cause of the burnt as it didn't have a distinct smell. She returned the phone to the store and provided some details about the incident. However, she needed to wait for several days before getting a response from the company that the phone was flown to the US for testing. \nThe pregnant woman has been offered a new iPhone 7 from Apple but she declined the offer. She is still paying for the phone under her mobile plan. She could not cancel the plan in her telecommunications provider Optus until it received the phone.",

Learn more... \nWed, Nov 16, 2016, 09:07 GMT - UK Markets close in 7 hrs 23 mins Super Mario Run launch date on Apple lifts Nintendo shares \nSuper Mario Run launch date on Apple lifts Nintendo shares\"/> \nNintendo shares soared as much as 5.5% on Wednesday as it revealed a launch date for its first Super Mario game for mobile devices. \nThe Japanese gaming firm said Super Mario Run would be released worldwide on 15 December for users of Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) 's iPhone and iPad at a cost of $9.99 for US users. \nIt confirmed the app would cost buyers in the UK £7.99, though free access would be available for limited elements of the game ahead of any purchase. \nNintendo has not yet given a date for Android users. \nThe game marks a significant departure from the company's refusal to enter the mobile gaming sector - previously preferring to concentrate on its core console business. \nThe massive success of the Pokemon Go game has helped drive its tentative shift in thinking. \nNintendo's shares more than doubled in July - making it more valuable than Sony (Hanover: SON1.HA - news ) at one point - as the game exploded in popularity and led to half a billion downloads worldwide. \nIt later emerged that the company did not own the licence to the game, erasing some of the added market value. \nIts stock closed almost 3% higher on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Wednesday, with investors seemingly encouraged by its added focus on mobile. \nNeil Campling, analyst at Northern Trust Capital Markets, said: \"To set a low incentive and then a low total cost when engaged could set Nintendo on a differentiated path, which ultimately could be a game changer.\" \nLast month, Nintendo cut its sales and operating profit outlook for the year as the strength in the value of the yen hit its earnings. \nIt said Pokemon Go's popularity had failed to offset sliding sales of 3DS and Wii U games. \nA new hand-held console called Switch had already left investors underwhelmed. \nNintendo recruited Japanese mobile specialist DeNA last year to develop its mobile games with help from Shigeru Miyamoto - the legendary creator of Mario and other Nintendo classics.

      "text": "Apple always has a lot riding on post-incremental iPhone upgrades like 2014’s 6 generation , but especially now that the uber-successful family is on a three-year lifecycle , the 2017 sequel for the 7 must be feeling the pressure to make a big splash.\nHence, we expect more than just a redesign with better cameras, sharper screens, zippier processors and an extra gig of RAM. The iPhone 8 may look nothing like its predecessors, adopting a snazzy but risky all-glass construction , finally ditching obsolete IPS LCD display technology , and perhaps even getting rid of bezels altogether .\nThese are little more than wild guesses at the moment, of course, although an increasing number of knowledgeable analysts and insiders appear to agree on at least one thing. There will probably be three main iPhone versions next year as opposed to only two, letting you choose between single and dual cameras, as well as LCD and OLED panels.\nAccording to KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo, just one top-shelf iPhone 8 model is likely to transition to a fancy organic light-emitting diode screen of unknown size, whereas the other two variants should stick to “traditional” 4.7 and 5.5-inch TFT LCD tech. A dual rear cam setup is obviously tipped to grace the glass rear of the mysterious OLED iPhone 8 in addition to the LCD 5.5-incher, with the smaller, lower-end config retaining its forerunner’s single shooter.\nThe post Three iPhone 8 models again foreshadowed, one OLED, and two with TFT LCD screens appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Mike Murphy November 15, 2016 \nFor the price of an Apple Watch, you can now get a book of pictures of the Apple Watch. \nApple announced today that its next expensive product will not be another wearable, computing device, or dongle, but rather a brilliantly white coffee table book. Designed by Apple in California is both the tagline that has graced the backs of Apple products for the last twenty-odd years, and the name of Apple’s new book, which is a photo-laden look back over some of its most iconic products in that stretch of time. For the cost of watch, here is a picture of one. (Apple) \nThe book will contain 450 photographs of Apple devices, chronicling the company’s design team’s “two decades of innovation.” The book opens with the iMac, the first product former CEO Steve Jobs launched when he came back to the company in 1998, and careens all the way through to last year’s Apple Pencil, which many have seen to be a design failure . \nApple has made some truly great products over the last two decades. The original iPhone kickstarted the mobile revolution that has now led a billion of iPhones being sold in less than 10 years, and billions more smartphones being sold around the world. The iPod upended the music industry when Steve Jobs first promised to put “1,000 songs in your pocket.” And the MacBook was also a very nice line of computers. \nBut in recent years, Apple has fallen into a rut . Its only real new product line in six years, the Apple Watch, has not set the world on fire as the iPod, iPhone, or to a lesser extent, the iPad, did before it. Apple has seen falling revenue, falling growth, and slow iPhone sales in recent quarters , and the company’s newest iPhone and MacBook laptops have underwhelmed. So what better way to remember the good times than to release a greatest hits album? The iPhone that started it all. (Apple) \n“This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years,” design lead Jony Ive said in a release. “We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines,” he added. This seems fitting, given that the book costs about as much as the average college textbook. \nIn the release, Apple said that this book “was developed over an eight-year period.” If that’s the timeframe that the company is working within to produce a picture book, it shouldn’t be that surprising that it hasn’t launched many entirely new products in recent years. \nMuch like Apple’s phones, tablets, laptops, desktops and watches, its new hardbound product brochure will also come in two sizes, for some unexplained reason. The smaller, 13-inch tall book will cost $200, and the larger, 16-inch tall version will cost $300. Both will be available from Apple’s website. It’s unclear whether AppleCare will be offered on the books. It also appears that the book does not have a headphone jack. \nIn case you’re looking for a different stocking-stuffer from Apple this holiday season, it’s worth noting that a 64 GB iPod Touch , a 64 GB Apple TV , a 32 GB iPad Mini 2 , and an Apple Watch Series 1 all cost as much or less than the larger coffee-table book.",

      "text": "​One of the most controversial changes that Apple made on the iPhone 7 was the removal of the headphone jack, and in order to compensate for the lack of a 3.5mm audio adapter, Cupertino decided to include an adapter right in the box, along with headphones using a Lightning connector. Apple has more or less started a new business with all these dongles, but it looks like it’s all a very risky move, as iPhone 7 buyers are already complaining that the Lightning-to-headphone adapter is tearing. Reddit user /u/goldenfelix is one of those experiencing the problem and in a post that reached the front page a few minutes ago, he explained that the dongle is tearing “after less than a month of sporadic use.” While there are signs that the adapter wasn’t really used “sporadically,” it still doesn’t make sense to experience this problem in such a short time after launch, especially because they have become essential access...",

Photo: Apple \nHow much would you be willing to pay to look at 450 photos of Apple products? \nFans of the Cupertino-based tech firm are known for their willingness to dig a little deeper into their pockets than those of the company's competitors. \nBut even the most hardened Apple fan might baulk at the company's latest pitch. \nApple has created a glossy coffee table book showcasing the company's products from the past 20 years - and it's hoping fans will pay up to $300 (€280) to buy it. \nThe book, titled Designed by Apple in California , features photographs of anything from the 1998 iMac to the iPod, various iPhones and Apple Watch. Photos were taken by Andrew Zuckerman and the book is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs, Apple said. \nA small version of the book will retail for $199 (€185), while the larger coffee table edition will run up to $300 (€280) - almost half the price of a new iPhone 7. \nFor that price, Apple fanboys get a linen-bound book \"printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight colour separations and low-ghost ink\" in what the company describes as a \"deliberately spare style\". Chief designer Jony Ive said he hopes the book will serve as \"a resource for students of all design disciplines.\" \nChief designer Jony Ive said he hopes the book will serve as \"a resource for students of all design disciplines.\" \nAnd for Apple fans still wavering, think of it this way: €280 for 450 photos works out at just 62c a photo.

It is also not clear how apps that have already been downloaded by users will be dealt with.\nUber and Apple did not immediately respond with comments.\nA Google spokesperson pointed to policies on Google Play, its app store, which indicate that the company does not allow apps that facilitate or promote illegal activities, but declined to comment further.\nTaiwan transport authorities have begun penalizing UberEATS by fining motorcyclists who deliver the takeaways and suspending vehicle licenses for two to six months, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said in a statement issued on Tuesday.\nUber has been facing similar legal scrutiny in markets across Asia.

(Source: Twitter@Emojipedia/CNN) \nThe peach butt is back after Apple changed the look of its peach emoji earlier this month. \nThe decision came after Apple officials heard the piece of fruit emoji looked much like a rear end. \nApple decided to reverse course again and change it back to look like the original, with just a slightly longer stem. \nEmojis are set by a group called the Unicode Consortium, but tweaks can be made by companies like Apple. \nCopyright 2016 CNN.

      "text": "Consumer watchdog targets Apple over iPhone shutdown bug By Liu Jing | chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2016-11-16 11:16 Chinese buyer shows iPhone 6 and 6 Plus smartphones at a branch of China Unicom in Shanghai, October 17, 2014. [Photo/IC] The China Consumers Association (CCA) has asked Apple to address a sudden shutdown problem associated with its iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s models in China. According to a statement issued by the consumer protection organization on Tuesday, it has received a considerable number of complaints from users of both devices reporting that the smart phones have been shutting off automatically with 50 to 60 percent battery left. The bug persists after a system upgrade. It is also reported to have occurred in both cold environments and at room temperature. Some users complained that their iPhones, after shutting down involuntarily, failed to turn back on without connecting to a power supply. \"Given that iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s have considerable number of users and the problems have been reported by many, China Consumer Association has issued a query to Apple on the abnormal shutdown problem,\" the statement reads. \"CCA will follow the issue closely and protect the legal interests of consumers.\" According to the organization, the questions raised to Apple include what caused the automatic shutdown, whether there is problem with the batteries, how the company will deal with the complaints and what measures the company will take. So far, Apple hasn't publicly commented on the matter. CCA says it expects Apple to respond within ten days. Related Stories ",

REUTERS/Toby Melville/Illustration More TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan plans to ask Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google to pull apps of Uber Technologies available in Taiwan on their app stores, a government official said, upping pressure on the ride-hailing firm that is locked in a dispute with the island. Uber [UBER.UL] operates in Taiwan as an internet-based technology platform rather than a transportation company, which Taiwanese authorities have said is a mis-representation of its service and has ordered it to pay back taxes. However, Uber has said it is communicating with Taiwan authorities and complies with local regulations. \"Uber has not done what it says it will do, so we are looking at another way by requesting its apps be removed from Apple and Google (app stores),\" Liang Guo-guo, a spokesman for Taiwan's Directorate General of Highways, which is handling the matter, told Reuters by phone on Wednesday. Liang said the request would include the removal of UberEATS app, which Uber launched in Taiwan on Tuesday as part of its effort to expand beyond its core taxi-hailing business around the world. It is unclear if the move would succeed in hampering Uber in Taiwan as removing the app would not prevent alternative ways to download it. It is also not clear how apps that have already been downloaded by users will be dealt with. Uber and Apple did not immediately respond with comments. A Google spokesperson pointed to policies on Google Play, its app store, which indicate that the company does not allow apps that facilitate or promote illegal activities, but declined to comment further. Taiwan transport authorities have begun penalizing UberEATS by fining motorcyclists who deliver the takeaways and suspending vehicle licenses for two to six months, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said in a statement issued on Tuesday. Uber has been facing similar legal scrutiny in markets across Asia.

      "text": "print The new MacBook Pro. Very sleek, totally un-upgradeable. AP \nIf you're hoping to buy a cheap MacBook Pro and then upgrade its storage at a later date — tough luck. \nA teardown of the new Apple laptop has found that the SSD storage is soldered in on the models with a Touch Bar, MacRumors reports, making it impossible to remove . \nOld MacBooks — like the now-ancient plastic unibody laptops — were upgradeable, letting users swap out the RAM and hard drives at home after purchase to boost their specs. But Apple has slowly been phasing this functionality out. \nIn recent years, MacBook Pro laptops had the RAM soldered in, and proprietary SSD storage chip — but with a bit of care, it could be removed and replaced with specially made third-party storage chips . \nWith the new MacBook Pros that come with a Touch Bar (a secondary touchscreen that sits at the top of the keyboard), this is no longer an option, according to a user from the MacRumors forum who disassembled his new laptop . The SSD is soldered in. \nSo whether you go for the cheapest 256GB storage, or splash out for 1TB, what you buy is what you get. Permanently. \n(Interestingly, the cheapest MacBook Pro that comes without a Touch Bar does have a removable — though proprietary — SSD storage chip.) \nThis shouldn't really come as a surprise. The new MacBook, which launched back in 2015, also had SSD storage that was attached to the logic board . \nBut it's still disappointing for users hoping to avoid Apple's extortionate rates to upgrade their laptop specs before purchase.",

      "text": "Taiwan plans to ask Apple and Alphabet’s Google to pull apps of Uber Technologies available in Taiwan on their app stores, a government official said, upping pressure on the ride-hailing firm that is locked in a dispute with the island.\nUber operates in Taiwan as an internet-based technology platform rather than a transportation company, which Taiwanese authorities have said is a mis-representation of its service and has ordered it to pay back taxes.\nHowever, Uber has said it is communicating with Taiwan authorities and complies with local regulations.\n“Uber has not done what it says it will do, so we are looking at another way by requesting its apps be removed from Apple and Google (app stores),” Liang Guo-guo, a spokesman for Taiwan’s Directorate General of Highways, which is handling the matter, told Reuters by phone on Wednesday.\nLiang said the request would include the removal of UberEATS app, which Uber launched in Taiwan on Tuesday as part of its effort to expand beyond its core taxi-hailing business around the world.\n \nIt is unclear if the move would succeed in hampering Uber in Taiwan as removing the app would not prevent alternative ways to download it. It is also not clear how apps that have already been downloaded by users will be dealt with.\nUber and Apple aapl did not immediately respond with comments.\nA Google googl spokesperson pointed to policies on Google Play, its app store, which indicate that the company does not allow apps that facilitate or promote illegal activities, but declined to comment further.\nTaiwan transport authorities have begun penalizing UberEATS by fining motorcyclists who deliver the takeaways and suspending vehicle licenses for two to six months, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said in a statement issued on Tuesday.\nUber has been facing similar legal scrutiny in markets across Asia. It entered the Taiwan market in 2013, and its growing popularity has triggered anger from domestic taxi drivers, who staged a massive protest against Uber earlier this year.",

      "text": "Reddit \nWith the new MacBook Pro now shipping to customers, iFixit have got their hands on the new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and have disassembled it and completed their usual teardown. There are quite a few differences between this model and the cheaper 13-inch 2016 MacBook Pro that retains traditional keys; teardown for that model here. \nMuch of the internal component layout has been adjusted to accommodate the inclusion of the Touch Bar. Apple’s latest laptop scores just 1/10 for repairability as Touch Bar is difficult to replace and the battery is glued into the case. Interestingly, the new speaker grilles on the 13-inch model appear to serve no function and are purely cosmetic … \nThe new 2016 MacBook Pro’s do feature better speakers but the grilles on the left and right of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar do not seem to help in any way. \nAs shown in the photos, the speakers are indicated in orange and the grills are indicated in red. The speakers are in the lower half of the case whereas the grilles are situated above. iFixit says the grille doesn’t even go clear through the case which leads them to believe the grilles are purely cosmetic. It appears the new speakers push their improved sound through the vents on the side of the machine. \nLike the cheaper 13-inch, the trackpad (2x larger than the previous model) is easily replaceable as it slides out after removing ten accessible screws. It also appears that the trackpad component is identical in both 13-inch 2016 laptops which means there should be plentiful quantities of replacement parts. \nThat is iFixit’s only positive thing to say about the laptop in regard to repairability, though. The laptop is in no way designed to be user-serviceable. The SSD storage is not upgradeable as it is soldered to the board as is the RAM and processor. The 5-cell battery is also glued down with adhesive which means a lot of pain in the repairability world. \nThe new Touch Bar appears very difficult to replace; iFixit actually broke the component when they pulled it away from the chassis. The flex cable for the Touch Bar also wraps underneath which makes removal even more tricky. \niFixit also notes that because the Touch ID sensor doubles as the power button, which pairs with the Apple T1 chip on the logic board, fixing a broken power switch will likely require replacing the entire logic board. (By the way, the Touch ID button does have a sapphire cover just like the iPhone and iPad Touch ID home button, so scratching shouldn’t be an issue.) \niFixit rated the laptop a measly 1/10 for repairability although this isn’t really a surprise and follows the general trend of Apple products becoming less user-serviceable with time. The speaker grille revelation is perhaps the most interesting find in the entire teardown, the fact that they appear to serve no function other than aesthetics. It seems like Apple wants the design of the 15-inch and 13-inch model to match. See iFixit for the full teardown report. Guides",

      "text": "Everything's peachy as Apple restores emoji's 'bum' features \nCompany has U-turned on cheeky plan to censor much-loved symbol and has reinstated its defining characteristics Booty call: the second generation of the emoji more closely resembled actual peaches, but users were dismayed. Photograph: Alamy Wednesday 16 November 2016 11.06 GMT Last modified on Wednesday 16 November 2016 11.11 GMT Share on Messenger \niPhone users, fear not: Apple is listening to your demands, assuming your demands involve a peach emoji that looks a bit like a bum. If you have other demands, those will have to wait. We’re dealing with the bum issue here. \nThe company had previously caused dismay among users due to a small change implemented in the first beta of iOS 10.2, the next update to its operating system for iPhones and iPads. As part of a general push by Apple to replace classic emoji with new, “realistic” versions, the update contained a new version of the peach emoji. Replacing the angular, contoured peach of the past was a new, rounder fruit, with a less prominent cleft running down its middle. \nUnfortunately, the number of people who send the peach emoji when they mean “peach” is apparently much smaller than the number of people who send the peach emoji when they mean “bum”. Because, you see, the peach emoji used to look like a bum. \nThe change doesn’t seem to have been a deliberate attempt to prevent rudeness among emoji. For one thing, the aubergine emoji remains curiously phallic both before and after the redraw (that was considered so naughty that Instagram started straight-up filtering searches for that emoji from their results entirely, in an effort to combat porn on the platform). For another, the redraw affected almost every emoji on Apple’s platform, with a general push away from the cartoony, exaggerated style that originated years ago to a more photorealistic art style, particularly for objects and animals. \nThat redraw led to generalised objection, with Buzzfeed’s Charlie Warzel arguing that “the ambiguity that helped turn emoji into its own means of expression is being quickly eroded”. But the peach’s redraw was particularly criticised, for removing the most popular use of one of the most popular emoji. Three generations of peach emoji. Photograph: Apple \nApple has apparently heard the complaints; the latest version of the beta features a new version of the Peach emoji. Still redrawn, it now looks like a photorealistic version of the old emoji. Which, in a way, is progress.",

      "text": "TAIPEI, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Taiwan plans to ask Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google to pull apps of Uber Technologies available in Taiwan on their app stores, a government official said, upping pressure on the ride-hailing firm that is locked in a dispute with the island.\nUber operates in Taiwan as an internet-based technology platform rather than a transportation company, which Taiwanese authorities have said is a mis-representation of its service and has ordered it to pay back taxes.\nHowever, Uber has said it is communicating with Taiwan authorities and complies with local regulations.\n\"Uber has not done what it says it will do, so we are looking at another way by requesting its apps be removed from Apple and Google (app stores),\" Liang Guo-guo, a spokesman for Taiwan's Directorate General of Highways, which is handling the matter, told Reuters by phone on Wednesday.\nLiang said the request would include the removal of UberEATS app, which Uber launched in Taiwan on Tuesday as part of its effort to expand beyond its core taxi-hailing business around the world.\nIt is unclear if the move would succeed in hampering Uber in Taiwan as removing the app would not prevent alternative ways to download it. It is also not clear how apps that have already been downloaded by users will be dealt with.\nUber and Apple did not immediately respond with comments.\nA Google spokesperson pointed to policies on Google Play, its app store, which indicate that the company does not allow apps that facilitate or promote illegal activities, but declined to comment further.\nTaiwan transport authorities have begun penalizing UberEATS by fining motorcyclists who deliver the takeaways and suspending vehicle licenses for two to six months, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said in a statement issued on Tuesday.\nUber has been facing similar legal scrutiny in markets across Asia. It entered the Taiwan market in 2013, and its growing popularity has triggered anger from domestic taxi drivers, who staged a massive protest against Uber earlier this year. (Reporting by J.R.

      "title": "Taiwan to ask for removal of Uber apps from Apple, Google app stores",
      "text": "By Reuters / Reuters   7:31   \nTAIPEI (Nov 16): Taiwan plans to ask Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google to pull apps of Uber Technologies available in Taiwan on their app stores, a government official said, upping pressure on the ride-hailing firm that is locked in a dispute with the island. \nUber operates in Taiwan as an internet-based technology platform rather than a transportation company, which Taiwanese authorities have said is a mis-representation of its service and has ordered it to pay back taxes. \nHowever, Uber has said it is communicating with Taiwan authorities and complies with local regulations. \n\"Uber has not done what it says it will do, so we are looking at another way by requesting its apps be removed from Apple and Google (app stores),\" Liang Guo-guo, a spokesman for Taiwan's Directorate General of Highways, which is handling the matter, told Reuters by phone on Wednesday. \nLiang said the request would include the removal of UberEATS app, which Uber launched in Taiwan on Tuesday as part of its effort to expand beyond its core taxi-hailing business around the world. \nIt is unclear if the move would succeed in hampering Uber in Taiwan as removing the app would not prevent alternative ways to download it. It is also not clear how apps that have already been downloaded by users will be dealt with. \nUber and Apple did not immediately respond with comments. \nA Google spokesperson pointed to policies on Google Play, its app store, which indicate that the company does not allow apps that facilitate or promote illegal activities, but declined to comment further. \nTaiwan transport authorities have begun penalizing UberEATS by fining motorcyclists who deliver the takeaways and suspending vehicle licenses for two to six months, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said in a statement issued on Tuesday. \nUber has been facing similar legal scrutiny in markets across Asia. It entered the Taiwan market in 2013, and its growing popularity has triggered anger from domestic taxi drivers, who staged a massive protest against Uber earlier this year. Related Articles",

      "title": "ArsTechnica review explains why Apple had to use AMD GPUs in the 15″ MacBook Pro",
      "text": "Reddit \nOne slightly surprising spec in the new 15-inch MacBook Pro line-up is that even the base model got an AMD GPU. Previously, Apple has offered only integrated GPU in the base model, reserving discrete graphics for the higher-specced models. \nJohn Gruber noticed that the ArsTechnica review explains this: it was the only way to allow the machine to drive two 5K monitors. And the reason for that is that Apple had to use something of a workaround to achieve it … When you hook one of LG’s 5K monitors to one of the new MacBook Pros, what you’re actually seeing on the screen is two pictures stitched together to make a single seamless image. This is because the version of the DisplayPort spec supported by Intel’s GPUs and almost all monitors these days—version 1.2—doesn’t have enough bandwidth to drive a 5K display at 60Hz all by itself. This will change with DisplayPort 1.3, which is right on the cusp of going mainstream, but it’s not here yet. Apple is actually pushing two DisplayPort 1.2 streams to the monitor over the single Thunderbolt 3 cable. \nIntel’s GPUs only support three display streams in total. Given that a single 5K monitor requires two of them, that would mean all of them would be used driving the internal display plus one 5K monitor. AMD GPUs, in contrast, support six streams. This allows 15-inch MacBook Pro models to use four of them to drive two 5K monitors, a fifth to drive the internal display and still have one left over (which could drive an additional 4K display). \nThe Ars review said that Apple likely made the decision to avoid the confusion that would have ensued if some 15-inch models supported two 5K monitors while others were limited to one. By using Intel Iris graphics in the 13-inch model and AMD Radeon Pro across the 15-inch models, Apple got a nice simple story: the 13-inch models support one 5K display, the 15-inch models two. \nThis is also the reason Apple couldn’t opt for faster Nvidia GPUs, says Ars . Power consumption aside—the laptop version of the GTX 1060, Nvidia’s slowest Pascal-based laptop chip, has an 85W TDP where the MacBook Pro’s AMD GPUs are all 35W—Nvidia’s cards support a maximum of four displays. And while Nvidia’s GPUs support DisplayPort 1.3, the Thunderbolt 3 controller and most monitors only support 1.2. \nIt does raise the question of whether Apple might offer an Nvidia-specced option once DisplayPort 1.3 is more widely supported. At that point, an Nvidia GPU’s four display streams could drive the internal display plus up to three 5K monitors. \nWe’re starting to learn more about the innards of the new machine now that they are shipping. We heard yesterday that the SSD is non-upgradable , today confirmed by an iFixit teardown, which also revealed that the speaker grilles appear to be purely cosmetic . Guides",

      "text": "Taiwan to ask for removal of Uber apps from Apple, Google app stores 11/16/2016 4:42 \nTAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan plans to ask Apple Inc <AAPL.O> and Alphabet Inc's <GOOGL.O> Google to pull apps of Uber Technologies available in Taiwan on their app stores, a government official said, upping pressure on the ride-hailing firm that is locked in a dispute with the island. \nUber [UBER.UL] operates in Taiwan as an internet-based technology platform rather than a transportation company, which Taiwanese authorities have said is a mis-representation of its service and has ordered it to pay back taxes. \nHowever, Uber has said it is communicating with Taiwan authorities and complies with local regulations. \n\"Uber has not done what it says it will do, so we are looking at another way by requesting its apps be removed from Apple and Google (app stores),\" Liang Guo-guo, a spokesman for Taiwan's Directorate General of Highways, which is handling the matter, told Reuters by phone on Wednesday. \nLiang said the request would include the removal of UberEATS app, which Uber launched in Taiwan on Tuesday as part of its effort to expand beyond its core taxi-hailing business around the world. \nIt is unclear if the move would succeed in hampering Uber in Taiwan as removing the app would not prevent alternative ways to download it. It is also not clear how apps that have already been downloaded by users will be dealt with. \nUber and Apple did not immediately respond with comments. \nA Google spokesperson pointed to policies on Google Play, its app store, which indicate that the company does not allow apps that facilitate or promote illegal activities, but declined to comment further. \nTaiwan transport authorities have begun penalizing UberEATS by fining motorcyclists who deliver the takeaways and suspending vehicle licenses for two to six months, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said in a statement issued on Tuesday. \nUber has been facing similar legal scrutiny in markets across Asia. It entered the Taiwan market in 2013, and its growing popularity has triggered anger from domestic taxi drivers, who staged a massive protest against Uber earlier this year. \n(Reporting by J.R.

      "text": " DonorDrive\nCINCINNATI , Nov. 15, DonorDrive client, the COPD Foundation today brings supporters the ability to donate with Apple Pay, which is transforming mobile payments with an easy, secure and private way to donate that's fast and convenient.\nThe COPD Foundation now accepts Apple Pay for their series of Breathe Strong events, DIY or fundraise-your-way campaigns, memorial and tribute pages, as well as for general donations. With 75% of mobile donation dollars in The COPD Foundation's fundraising software, DonorDrive, coming through iOS, this will mean substantially more money for their mission of preventing and curing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.\nDonating in apps and on websites accepting Apple Pay is as simple as the touch of a finger with Touch ID, so there's no need to manually fill out lengthy account forms or repeatedly type in billing information.\nTodd Levy , CEO of DonorDrive Peer-to-Peer Fundraising, is delighted to see the organization as one of the earliest adopters of giving by Apple Pay: \"We're thrilled that the COPD Foundation is one of the first nonprofits offering this easy and secure giving option to their supporters.\"\nSecurity and privacy is at the core of Apple Pay. When you use a credit or debit card with Apple Pay, the actual card numbers are not stored on the device, nor on Apple servers. Instead, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element on your device. Each transaction is authorized with a one-time unique dynamic security code.\nApple Pay is easy to set up and users will continue to receive all of the rewards and bene?ts offered by credit and debit cards. When making payments for goods, services and donations on the go in apps or Safari, Apple Pay works with iPhone 6 and later, iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3 and later. You can also use Apple Pay in Safari on any Mac introduced in or after 2012 running macOS Sierra and confirm the payment with iPhone 6 or later or Apple Watch.\nFor more information on Apple Pay, visit: http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/\nFor more information about the COPD Foundation, visit: http://COPDFoundation.org\nDonorDrive Peer-to-Peer Fundraising Software helps nonprofits raise more money. With DonorDrive, organizations like MADD, Children's Miracle Network Hospitals, JDRF, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and NDSS Buddy Walks have raised more than $1 Billion .

      "text": "OS X Certs up! Apple and Google take certificates more seriously As we near 2017, browsers start complaining more about rotten website security, but it’s never been easier to assure yourself you’re safe. Credit: Peter Sayer Senior Contributor, Macworld Nov 16, 2016 4:20 AM \nI was naive and thought that a lot of the issues surrounding Web browser/server security would be resolved with some significant changes agreed to by operating system makers, non-OS browser developers, and the parties that provide verification, called certificate authorities (CAs), which took place January 1, 2016. \nOh, how young and foolish was I. But real improvements have taken place, and nearing the end of 2016, you may already have seen how browsers provide you a more descriptive—and some prescriptive—alert about problems with the certificates passed by a server to a browser to create a secure connection. In some cases, you may already have been blocked from a connection, or required to approve an exception to proceed. \nThis is all good, partly because it helps prevent your information from being captured by malicious parties or swept up by wide-reaching, sometimes illegal government interception—any country, not just your own—and partly because more of what’s happened this year, especially recently, doesn’t require you to make any changes to gain the benefit. \nIt’s not just sniffing. Ne’er-do-wells with the right network position, including malware installed on, ahem, non-Macs and non-iOS devices on a local network, can insert themselves into an unsecured connection and drop in a virus-laden download instead of a legitimate one you thought you were retrieving, among other nasty tricks. This was a possibility with the widely used Sparkle update framework , since patched. But some developers still host their software downloads on unencrypted servers. Apple removes a CA, as do others \nWeb encryption requires that browser and OS makers trust CAs, who use protected cryptographic elements so that when a Web server you visit presents a certificate that identifies the server as associated with a particular domain name, you can be sure it’s a legitimate association. That’s part of the web of trust, and it requires browser and OS makers and CAs to act with integrity and transparency. \nSome CAs slip up with security, with their process of allowing resellers to issue certificates, or with ethics, plain and simple. It’s rare, but CAs can be booted out of the trusted root programs run by Apple, Google, the Mozilla Foundation, and others. (You can find a good summary of root trust at the Chromium Projects site.) \nBack in April 2015, I sniped at Apple for failing to drop CNNIC, a Chinese CA that appeared to be violating security policies. Mozilla and Google acted fast and dropped CNNIC; Apple and Microsoft did nothing. (Microsoft issued a weak security note.) \nWhen a situation presented itself in September, Apple acted with more alacrity. The Mozilla Foundation discovered several weeks ago that the CA WoSign had what a Mozilla blog post described as a “number of technical and management problems.” WoSign operated under its own name, and also had acquired StartCom, a certificate-issuer I used to rely on for my SSL/TLS Web certificates. (You can read all the details in Mozilla’s blog entry.) \nOne of these “problems” was issuing and backdating certificates signed with SHA-1, an outdated encryption algorithm that CAs had agreed, after years of prodding by Mozilla and other trusted root operators, to stop issuing. Because SHA-1 is considered “broken,” meaning malicious parties can potentially spoof a certificate that appears valid, it had to stop being used. (I wrote about the particulars of SHA-1 in December 2015.) \nMozilla presented a lengthy report , as the foundation operates in a community-driven transparent style. WoSign replied, and Mozilla evaluated its responses as unacceptable, and moved to remove WoSign and StartCom from its trusted list as of October 21. \nApple followed suit in a rather public manner: by placing a few paragraphs of text at the top of its Web page that lists its trusted root certificates in early October . Google took longer, finally making a statement and plan at the end of October. Microsoft hasn’t weighed in. \nThat’s a good sign, though disappointing and surprising Microsoft remains behind the eight-ball here, as 18 months ago. \nIn Safari, Firefox, Chrome, and some other browsers—but not Internet Explorer—visting a site protected by a certificate signed by WoSign or StartCom that remains in place generates a security warning . More warnings, less worries \nAs I’ve written about over a couple of years, browser developers have ratcheted up the kind and nature of warnings displayed when you hit a site that’s using ineffectual or badly configured security. That includes every Web page that uses plain http, which sends all data between a browser and server as unencrypted text, as opposed to https, which uses SSL/TLS encrypted connections. \nGoogle’s future Chrome warning about all unsecured pages is severe. \nStarting January 2017, Google Chrome will start displaying the words Not Secure in plain text next to a URL for an http page that it recognizes uses a form to collect a password or credit-card information. Google plans to gradually move to showing a red warning triangle and Not Secure on all unencrypted pages. It’s moved to the phrase Not Secure instead of just an icon, because its product managers found most people don’t know what the warning icon means . \nMore quietly, Chrome apparently also now redirects requests to a secure version of a website if multiple identical versions exist with different names. \nYou may be seeing more routine warnings in Safari, if that’s your browser of choice. I know that I routinely receive warnings about certificate problems when I visit sites that are clearly just a bit out of date: the site’s owner failed to update a certificate, is feeding out a certificate for a domain that’s not listed in its security document, or another error that makes me stop and wonder what’s wrong. I used to use Safari’s method of bypassing a bad certificate, assuming that was just the way the Web rolled, but no longer. I try to report the problem to the Web owner or find the information elsewhere. \nWeb hosting services and other ways in which you might post material on the Web have been gradually moving to offering https by default and at no cost. For instance, Squarespace just announced it would flip on certificates for all its customers with custom domains, and its users could even make an https connection the required method. ( Let’s Encrypt helped Squarespace; the project offers free basic certificates, and I’ve switched all my SSL to theirs.) \nBetter browser warnings, the elimination of outdated encryption, and a general shift to secured-by-default sites, no matter what the content of the site is, has pushed https usage way up. Google has been tracking secured connections via Chrome by platform, and half of pages loaded by desktop Chrome users in October are over https, up about 10 percent over just a few months. \nUltimately, the entire Web will be encrypted, and not for paranoia’s sake. Reducing points in insertion and eavesdropping allows you to live your online life more safely, whether it’s about others tracking your reading habits, your frineds—or your political activism.
