      "text": "| Follow About | \nDefensive Computing is for people who use computing devices for work, not play. Rather than focus on the latest news or devices, this blog aims to be educational. Heavy on facts, light on opinions. Bloomberg says Apple is getting out of the router business Computerworld | Nov 21, 2016 9:45 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. More like this \nBloomberg reported today that Apple is getting out of the router business . I have never owned an Apple router, but based on my research, I tried to steer people away from them on my RouterSecurity.org site. \nOne reason I offered was that Apple has not updated their routers since 2013. Not just the hardware, the software too. Last December, Glenn Fleishman wrote that the cheapest Apple router, the AirPort Express , was last updated in 2012. Apple routers felt abandoned long before Bloomberg reported that they really were abandoned. \nWhat prompted this blog, however, was not the router news, but a sentence in the Bloomberg article \nRouters are access points that connect laptops, iPhones and other devices to the web without a cable. \nThis single sentence has three mistakes. \n1. Routers and access points are two different things. A router can function as an access point, but it is much more than that. Apple never made access points, they made routers. \n2. Routers do not connect computing devices to the web , they connect them to the Internet . The web and the Internet are two different things. \n3. Routers also have wired Ethernet LAN connections. In the old days, routers only supported Ethernet, Wi-Fi came later. Apple routers support Ethernet. \nAll reporters can't be technical experts, but heck, this was a story about routers. \nWorse still, is that no one at Bloomberg corrected this. The company must employ thousands of techies, how is that none of their collective knowledge can make it into a news story? \nLater today, Apple routers were discussed in a Bloomberg video where a reporter claimed that \"Amazon built routers into some of its echo type devices\" (30 seconds in). \nThey did not. Echo devices are not routers. \nFinally, the first article included this (emphasis mine): \nWhile router makers can differentiate the design of their products ... they reliant on advances first made by chipmakers to be able to offer new, higher-performing models. \n\"reliant?\" \nStarting to see a pattern? \nIf you own an Apple router, when the time comes to upgrade, I offer advice on the home page of RouterSecurity.org . The site also has an introduction to routers , which is more needed than I realized.

      "text": "You wouldn’t know it based on the sheer volume of complaints surrounding Apple’s new MacBook Pro models, but the company’s new notebook line appears to be resonating with consumers in a big way. Though Apple’s new laptops have been criticized from all angles for being overpriced and under-powered, Phil Schiller a few weeks back said that initial MacBook Pro orders were quick to set new sales records.\nDON’T MISS: T-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen\n“Our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before,” Schiller said during an interview with The Independent earlier this month. “So there certainly are a lot of people as excited as we are about it.”\nNot only that, but ongoing demand for Apple’s new laptops appears to be holding up as we transition head-first into the busiest shopping period of the year. According to MacBook Pro manufacturer Quanta (via Digitimes ), demand for Apple’s refreshed notebook line is not only strong, but will remain strong all the way through the first few months of 2017.\nQuanta Computer, the sole producer of MacBook Pro products, expects its notebook shipments to be better than expected in the fourth quarter of 2016 and will slip only 2-3% on quarter from the previous quarter, according to company vice chairman CC Leung.\nOrders for MacBook Pro models will remain strong in the first quarter of 2017, stated the sources.\nApple’s Mac line has stagnated a bit recently, in no small part due to Apple’s staggered refresh schedule. Indeed, the recent MacBook Pro revamp marks the first significant update to its Pro notebook in quite a few years. What will be interesting to see, and perhaps future earnings data will bear this is out, is whether or not MacBook Pro sales are taking off because consumers are enamored with the machine’s new Touch Bar or if sales are doing well as users with old machines were simply ready to upgrade to any new machine Apple happened to unveil this year.\nFor any Mac users unsure about whether or not now is a good time to upgrade, it’s worth noting that a minor refresh in 2017 will see Apple lower the price of its MacBook Pro line while also adding support for 32GB of RAM .\nIf you can’t wait that long, there’s still good news to be had. Amazon is still running a promotion where you can pick up Apple’s base model 13-inch MacBook Pro (sans the Touch Bar) for just $1399, representing a solid $100 in savings off the normal $1499 retail price.\nTrending right now:\nT-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen How to get a NES Classic without spending $300 Best Black Friday deals on Apple gear: iPhone 7, MacBooks, iPads, Beats and more See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Turns out that old Apple computers are perfect pots for your plants Today in headlines we never thought we’d write: People are using old macs as planters and it’s actually very chic.\nFrench artist Christophe Guinet, who uses the pseudonym ‘Monsieur Plant,’ turned some classic Apple products into tiny, lush gardens .\nThe project is aptly titled Plant Your Mac! and uses models like the Macintosh Classic, iMac G3 and 65, and Powerbook. Bright green foliage contrasted with the Apple products’ white colors and sleek lines are sure to make every minimalist’s heart beat a little faster.\nBut according to Monsieur Plant himself, the project is meant to make the viewer ask questions about the mingling of nature and technology.\nA photo posted by Christophe Guinet (@monsieur_plant) on Oct 2, 2016 at 12:23am PDT \n“I want to make people conscious that nature exists because we tend to forget it in the city. We’re manipulated by trend phenomenon that creates useless needs,” he told Garden Collage. “We’re continually inclined to consume. Ultimately, the more we consume, the more we destroy,” he said. A photo posted by Christophe Guinet (@monsieur_plant) on Oct 1, 2016 at 10:03am PDT \nIn addition to making commentary on consumerist society, the art might also make a nice Christmas gift for the tech-loving gardener in your life.

      "text": "Apple wants to bring Apple Music to as many places as possible, and to help reach that goal, the company has buddied up with Indian ride-hailing service Ola, which will now offer music to passengers as part of the ridesharing experience.\nUnder the new partnership, Apple Music will be available to passengers through a new service called Ola Play, according to a report from the Los Angeles Times .\nMore: Apple reportedly invests in Omnifone staff and technology to beef up Apple Music\nApple isn’t the only new partner for Ola — the company also partnered with the likes of Sony, Qualcomm, Fynd, and Audio Compass to help beef up its in-car audio offerings.\nSo how will the system work? According to Ola, passengers will have access to a tablet that will offer a range of infotainment systems, including Apple Music. Alternatively, users can download the Ola Play app and control the infotainment straight from their smartphone.\n“Cars were initially built for the driver,” said Ola CEO Bhavish Agarwal at a news conference, according to the Los Angeles Times report. “But with ridesharing, the control needs to be there for the passenger, and Ola Play works along that.”\nNot only is Ola making other partnerships but this is also Apple’s second deal with a ridesharing service. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a hefty $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese company. According to Cook, the partnership will Apple get some insight into the Chinese market.\nIt’s largely thought that Apple itself is hoping to make inroads into the automotive industry. While most rumors indicate that the company has ditched plans to release a car of its own, the company may still be working on the underlying self-driving technology that could help cars drive on their own.\nApple may be preparing to lower the price of Apple Music plans, report says iPlaylist: Apple Music is using your iTunes history to make playlists for you Apple calls on James Corden for comical Apple Music ad",

      "text": "jony ive christmas tree More Claridge's\nLast month we heard that Apple design guru Jony Ive and long-time friend and collaborator Marc Newson had agreed to design this year’s festive tree for the lobby of Claridge’s, one of London’s most prestigious hotels.\nIt’s a tradition that started in 2009, with designers such as Burberry’s Christopher Bailey, Dolce & Gabbana, and John Galliano all having offered their personal take on the Christmas tree in years past.\nClaridge’s has just unveiled Ive and Newson’s work for Christmas 2016, and while the entire installation fills the whole lobby, the tree itself is – as we expected – a minimalist effort. And then some.\nSure, it’s an evergreen conifer, but it looks to have been designed by someone who didn’t have time to get to the store to buy some decorations. Because the tree has nothing on it.\nPerhaps Ive was too busy with other tasks such as designing the next version of the MacBook Pro to unapologetically put back in all the ports that Apple recently removed , though with Ive and Newson’s shared taste for simplicity, it’s safe to assume this is exactly how they wanted it.\nAs for the hotel, on its website it says – probably with some relief – that this year’s design is “much more than a Christmas tree.”\nRelated: 8 things we’ve learned about Jony Ive, from Jony Ive\nWorking with acclaimed British set designer Michael Howells, Ive and Newson have come up with a “magical, snow-covered forest [featuring] four-meter-high light boxes that glow with black-and-white photographic images of snow-covered silver birch trees, set on a pure white floor.”\nIn a joint message posted on Claridge’s website, Ive and Newson offered a few words about the inspiration for their design: “There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology.\n“Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognizing our excitement about the future and things to come.”\nSo what do you think? How does it compare to the pair’s other collaborations, such as the one-off Leica camera or their solid gold earpods ?\nNew satellite tools give scientists fresh insights into evergreens on Earth Watch this robot lawnmower take on a moose, and lose McLaren finds unlikely source of inspiration for future wheel designs",

      "title": "A malformed video file is causing iPhones to crash left and right",
      "text": "iphone mp bug apple plus bestof More Given how effortlessly Apple’s iPhone crunches paginated spreadsheets, image-heavy emails, and video games that rival some home consoles in graphical fidelity, the last thing you’d expect to bring it to its knees is a simple video. But according to multiple reports on Tuesday, that’s just what’s been happening: a malformed clip is rendering some iPhones unstable, causing them to freeze and crash in an endless loop.\nThe video in question, which YouTube channel Everything Apple Pro reports is making the rounds with the innocuous title IMG_0942.mp4, is a short clip that begins with a figure standing by a bed above the word “Honey” in block lettering. Playback proceeds normally at first, but the bug rears its ugly head after 10 seconds have elapsed. The affected iPhone becomes sluggish, then unresponsive, and finally freezes.\nMore: With iOS 10.0.2, Apple squashed the lightning headphones bug and a few others\nThe video appears to crash devices when sent as a link rather than transferred as a file. It doesn’t seem to matter which part of the video’s played, and it appears that Safari, the default web browser on iOS devices, may be the culprit. 9to5Mac speculates that the malformed video triggers a memory leak, or a failure to release temporary data generated while the video is playing.\nWhich phones are affected? As of now, the clip seems to affect iPhone models dating back to 2014. That includes the iPhone 4 and 4s, iPhone 5 and 5s, iPhone 6, 6s, and 6s Plus, and iPhone 7 and 7 Plus running iOS 5.\nMost iPhones which open the clip exhibit a cycle of freezing and crashing, but devices on newer versions of iOS — specifically iOS 10.2 beta 3 — display the “spinning wheel” animation that normally indicates a power cycle. Left long enough alone, they shut down.\nHow to prevent it The easiest way to prevent your iPhone from being compromised is to avoid opening a video link from a sender you do not recognize. But even if the person in question is a familiar face, it’s best to pay attention to the clip in question — you probably want to avoid links to unsolicited MP4 file.\nMore: iOS 10 problems and the solutions to deal with them\nOnce the video begins to play, there’s a brief window of time during which you can prevent a crash by performing a hard reboot.\nOn any model other than the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, you can perform a hard reset by holding the power button and home button at the same time until the Apple logo appears. On the iPhone 7, which lacks a mechanical home button, you can do the same by holding the power button and the volume decrease buttons.\nPerforming a hard reboot won’t affect your contacts, photos, apps, or other data.\nThere may be a fix on the way It isn’t the first time a bizarre bug has rendered iPhone models unresponsive. In 2015, a bug in iOS 8 led a malformed string of text to disable Apple’s iMessage app. Another bug caused iOS to crash when a certain date and time was displayed, and yet another caused Safari started randomly crashing on iPhones. Both were resolved in subsequent versions of iOS and Apple is likely to address this issue just as quickly.\nIf Apple issues a response, we will update this post. For now, though, it is best to be on the safe side where MP4 videos are concerned.\nApple has launched its second iPhone repair program in less than a week iOS 10 problems and the solutions to deal with them Which big iPhone should you buy? iPhone 7 Plus vs. iPhone 6S Plus",

      "text": "apple diversity numbers barely changed tim cook ( ) More Apple may be all about diversity on the surface, but the numbers show that the company hasn’t made strides in becoming more diverse over the last year — its leadership is still overwhelmingly comprised of white men.\nApple has released new data showing that the company’s high-ranking employees are made up of a higher percentage of white men than the rest of the company. Only 20 of Apple’s 107 executives are women, and only 5 of those executives are members of a minority group. Those numbers are pretty much unchanged from a year ago.\nMore: Microsoft to begin rewarding executives for diversity hiring\nOne layer down, things get a little better — but not by much. While women made up 27 percent of management, 65 percent of those managers are white, 23 percent Asian, and 11 percent from other minority groups. This data comes from a form called the EEO-1, which companies must file with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\nApple, along with a number of other companies, has pledged to boost diversity, and has said in the past that increased diversity isn’t just good for society, but also makes sense from a business perspective. While these numbers aren’t that great, Apple says that the data on them does not reflect how the company breaks down its workforce internally, nor how it measures its diversity.\nApple does seem to be moving in the right direction, even if its changes are small — the company’s new hires were 37 percent women and 27 percent underrepresented minorities. Microsoft, on the other hand, seems to be moving in the wrong direction — the company’s latest reports showed that the number of women at Microsoft has declined for the second year in a row. Microsoft blames layoffs in its phone division.\nMicrosoft to begin rewarding executives for diversity hiring Apple Car rumor roundup: Here’s all you need to know about ‘Project Titan’ Some of the biggest names in tech just signed the Equal Pay Pledge",

But the company did not specify how many phones may be impacted.If you have an iPhone 6s that's experiencing the unexpected shutdown, note that your phone must be in working order and not have damage, such as a cracked screen.Apple is urging customers with affected phones to contact a service provider -- an Apple authorized service orovider, Apple retail store or Apple tech support -- before you go to confirm that the battery replacement is available on the day you're planning to visit.",

      "text": "apple patent foldable phone iphone plus bestof More It looks like Apple’s dream of one day creating a foldable phone isn’t dead just yet. The company has been granted a new patent for an iPhone that would be able to fold in half, and even grip onto your clothes — meaning you might not even need to put it in your pocket.\nThe patent itself was applied for in July 2014, and it envisions the use of a flexible OLED display that could itself fold in half, making the device look somewhat like the clamshell-type phones of yesteryear.\nMore: Samsung may follow Apple’s lead and release a glossy black Galaxy S7\nThe patent goes into detail about how the device would work, butkeep in mind that just because Apple has been granted a patent, that doesn’t mean it will ever release the tech to the market. According to the patent, the device could be folded so that the two screen halves touch each other, or so that there’s half of the screen on either side of the outside of the device. More hinges could be implemented, too — so that it could fold into thirds or quarters instead of in half.\n161122090325-apple-patent-folding-screen-780x439 More The patent isn’t just interesting because it shows a foldable phone — it’s also interesting because of the fact that the display is an OLED one. So far, the iPhone has stuck with an LCD display, although some expect that Apple will make the switch to OLED over the next few years.\nHowever unlikely it is that we’ll see a flexible iPhone in the near future, it’s quite possible we’ll see a flexible device from another company. Samsung, for example, has been working on a flexible phone for some time now, and most recent rumors indicate that it will finally be released in 2017. LG is also rumored to be working on a flexible phone.\nFoldable cardboard bike helmet is as effective as a polystyrene one Samsung Galaxy X: Rumors and news leaks The iPhone 7’s display is the \"best LCD display ever,\" according to report",

      "text": "microsoft patent application touch based accessory ifa More Earlier this year, Apple launched a refresh of its MacBook Pro laptop that featured an OLED Touch Bar in place of the traditional functional keys. Now, a patent application might have revealed that Microsoft has plans to field a similar product.\nIn July 2016, Microsoft applied for a patent on a “keyboard with input-sensitive display device,” according to a report from MS Power User . Attached images show a tablet-like screen being used in conjunction with a standard keyboard to allow different types of input beyond that of the Roman alphabet.\nmicrosoft-keyboard More U.S. Patent & Trademark Office\nThe device is intended to make text entry easier for users working with character-based and phonics-based languages, which are prevalent in Asia. The patent states that the error rate for this kind of text input on a standard QWERTY keyboard can be as high as 20 percent for the average individual, a figure that could perhaps be cut by implementing a peripheral of this kind.\nThere simply aren’t enough keys on a standard keyboard to represent each possible character in many such languages, so the process of typing is typically peppered with breaks to choose the desired option from an on-screen menu. Microsoft’s device could cut down on the time lost by users as they switch from keyboard to mouse and back again, as they could choose the right option with a simple tap of the touchscreen.\nMore: No screen’s too small for Doom : Classic game now playable on MacBook Pro’s Touch Bar\nLike Apple’s Touch Bar, the peripheral could be implemented in a variety of different ways. Images attached to the application show the device being used to operate menus that would typically be displayed on the primary monitor.\nMicrosoft has been bullish about new accessories as of late, so it will be interesting to see what becomes of this project. On the one hand, it could be a specialty peripheral aimed squarely at users who work with non-Roman languages, but it could also be used as a direct competitor to the Touch Bar that’s sold as a separate peripheral.\nApple’s new MacBook Pro Touch Bar is powered by a variant of WatchOS MacBook Pro 15 (with Touch Bar): Our first take Check out Apple’s touchy new OLED bar mounted in the new MacBook Pro laptops",

      "text": "Last week was an exciting one with some rumors about Apple’s ( AAPL - Free Report ) iPhone manufacturing in the U.S., Cisco’s ( CSCO - Free Report ) earnings report, Intel’s ( INTC - Free Report ) first AI Day plus lots more.\niPhone Manufacturing In The U.S. \nIn June this year, Apple requested its iPhone assemblers Pegatron and Foxconn to evaluate the feasibility of making the devices in the U.S. While Pegatron refused outright on cost considerations, Foxconn has decided to do the job. The study is likely to show that the cost increase, skill mismatch and supply chain problems (the supply chain is largely in Asia) would make this cost prohibitive.\nThis would raise iPhone prices for consumers/squeeze Apple’s margins. But the study will help Apple negotiate with the government, which might agree to fund skill development and/or subsidize U.S.-made phones. If not, Apple could introduce a luxury line of iPhones manufactured in the U.S. and try to set off the super normal profits on those with the increased cost of phones carrying the government import duty.\nNote that Apple is not the only smartphone maker saddled with the problem. So if all smartphones get more expensive, Apple’s market share may not be affected.\nCisco Earnings Report \nCisco’s first quarter 2017 results topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the top and bottom lines but the guidance disappointed. Switching remains a sore point for Cisco in a market increasingly favoring SDN networks and leveraging the cloud. So it’s not surprising that this segment declined 7%. The company had greater success in security where both advanced threat (up 100%) and web security (up 60%) were strong.   \nIntel A.I. Day \nAt its first Artificial Intelligence (AI) Day in San Francisco last week, Intel announced bold plans to target the deep learning segment that is currently dominated by NVIDIA ( NVDA - Free Report ) GPUs. Intel silicon is also in the mix, but it doesn’t take part in the real training work. Artificial intelligence comprises two main operations: training and inference with training being the more compute intensive. Inference can be handled by Intel CPUs, Xilinx/Altera FPGAs, NVIDIA GPUs, ASICs like Google TPU and in some cases, DSPs. Now Intel is planning to enter the training side very aggressively and hopefully it can stick with the timeline it has set.\nBased on its acquisition of startup Nervana last year, Intel is building a new Xeon processor with Nervana integration. FPGAs are generally used as accelerators and we don’t know yet if Intel will be using the FPGA technology it got through Nervana or Altera, which it also picked up recently. At any rate, Intel promises to deliver 100X the training speed current GPUs offer within three years, which industry expert Patrick Moorhead says is aggressive. Intel expects the chips to start testing in mid-2017 and ship by year end.     \nFake News Drama \nFacebook ( FB - Free Report ) and Google are being pressured by mainstream media (MSM) for influencing the public in favor of Trump. As ridiculous as this sounds, there is a lot of print devoted to trying to prove them guilty.\nGoogle recently started employing artificial intelligence to support its search results that have until now been solely algorithm-based. But as luck would have it, there was a brief period during which time 70news.wordpress.com took the top position, fielding incorrect data on the number of votes earned by Clinton and Trump and claiming to have obtained the information from Twitter.\nThe information was reportedly correct elsewhere on Google but this was enough to earn Google accusations for making money out of “fake news.” So Google has said in a statement, \"Moving forward, we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher's content, or the primary purpose of the web property.\" It is hoped that the inability to generate revenue from fake news will make it harder to produce it.\nFacebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly said that 99% of the news sites posting on Facebook were authentic and that it didn’t want to get into the position of arbiter of truth. \"We do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news,\" said the Facebook statement (the company has now added the fake news part to pacify parties). Facebook also gave an assurance that it would continue to vet publishers to ensure compliance.\n \nCompany\nLast  1 Month\nYTD\nAAPL\n+1.48%\n+16.83%\nFB\n-1.68%\n-2.33%\nGOOGL\n+0.49%\n+7.00%\nMSFT\n+2.25%\n+18.14%\nINTC\n+0.98%\n+16.85%\nCSCO\n-3.85%\n+13.64%\nAMZN\n+2.85%\n+7.08%\n \nOther stories you might have missed-\nCorporate \nIntel-Disney Drone Show : Intel, in collaboration with Walt Disney Imagineering, will be putting up a light show for guests at Disney Springs – the shopping, dining and entertainment district of Walt Disney World Resort. The show will feature 300 Intel Shooting Star drones for the first time in the U.S. These are tiny drones made of styrofoam and plastics, weighing 280 grams and bearing LED lights that can create over 4 billion color combinations and easily be programmed for any animation from a single computer. At the show, the drones will operate with holiday music.\nMicrosoft and the Wind : Microsoft ( MSFT - Free Report ) has agreed to buy 237 megawatts of capacity from Allianz Risk Transfer AG’s Bloom Wind Project in Kansas and Black Hills Corp.’s Happy Jack and Silver Sage wind farms in Wyoming. Microsoft expects that its data centers will get about 44% of their electricity from wind, solar and hydropower sources this year and 50% in two years. The company already has deals for 20 megawatts of solar power and 285 megawatts of wind, according to the blog post.\nGoldman Sachs Upgrades Microsoft : GS analysts Heather Bellini and Heath Terry have upgraded Microsoft to Buy based on its current and prospective growth in cloud computing. The analysts believe that Microsoft with its increased focus on the cloud will benefit from the growth in public cloud spending, which they estimate will go from $32 billion this year to $137 billion in 2020.\nPixel Resellers Taken to Task : Google showed how much a technology company providing basic digital services controls our digital existence. Last week, some people that had bought Pixel phones online for resale by a New Hampshire dealer at a markup had their accounts frozen for violation of terms of service. Since no one really reads these terms of service, the measures came as such a shocker. Google, which attempts to make the devices available to everyone at the same price, has since restored the services (Gmail, online photos and other) with a warning.\nAlibaba-backed Logistics Firm’s U.S. IPO : Best Logistics, in which Alibaba ( BABA - Free Report ) owns a 22% stake, is reportedly looking for a U.S. IPO early next year. The company is valued at $3 billion based on its latest funding round, in which Alibaba, Fosun International Ltd., SoftBank China Venture Capital, Alibaba’s own logistics unit, Cainiao Network, and the World Bank’s private-sector investment arm, International Finance Corp participated.\nLegal/Regulatory \nRussians Fear Apple Call Logs : Russian provider of iPhone hacking tools, Elcomsoft says that Apple maintains a call log of users’ phone calls and other details in its iCloud for up to four months. Apple likely does this to help sync calls across devices, but the storage of private information without explicit consent is problematic.\nMoreover, in its data access guide for law enforcement, Apple says that available iCloud information includes email logs and content, text messages, photos, documents, contacts, calendars, bookmarks and iOS device backups but doesn’t mention call logs. While all iCloud data is encrypted once it’s on the server and in transit, Apple keeps the keys for iCloud accounts in its U.S. data centers.\nAmazon Sues Counterfeit Sellers : Following repeated complaints from different parties including Apple, Amazon is taking action against companies acting as counterfeiters. Last week, Amazon filed a couple of cases against sellers of training equipment (originally developed and patented by Fitness Anywhere and sold by third-parties) and against infringers of patented technology for forklift equipment.\nThese actions aren’t easy because first, the patent holder has to be established, second, new counterfeiters crop up all the time and third, Amazon, given its size has millions of sellers, so it’s hard to track any one seller. So these actions are encouraging. Amazon’s Chinese rival Alibaba also faces the same problem resulting in the alienation of some brands.   \nNew Technology/Products \nApple Considering AR Device : Bloomberg reports that Apple may be experimenting with a Google’s Glass-like AR (augmented reality) device, for which it has spoken to suppliers and ordered a small quantity of related components. But while Google, Samsung, Facebook and others have focused more on VR (virtual reality), Apple, like Microsoft with its Hololens, seems to be more interested in AR. In any event, the device is not expected to launch until 2018 at the earliest.\nWhatsApp Video Calling : Facebook has launched fully-encrypted free video calling for all WhatsApp users across the world. While this obviously sweetens personal communications, it also makes the app more attractive for business users. The recently-talked about job posting feature does the same thing. Facebook had promised to look at monetizing the app once the user base reached critical mass and the company seems to be doing just that.\nAmazon Family Plan : Similar to Apple, Spotify and others, Amazon has launched a family plan that charges $14.99 a month for up to six users. Prime members aren’t getting a concession on this one, although they do have the option of choosing an annual family membership for $149, which then brings down the monthly cost to $12.42.\nWhile other music services offer unique experiences, feature sets, personalized playlists and recommendations, etc, Amazon’s service comes with Alexa so you can just ask her to do your bidding in choosing tracks albums, genres, or whatever else you may be in the mood for.\nAmazon Expands Home Services : Amazon nearly doubled its home services areas with 20 new additions last week. The company offers more than 1200 services such as lawn care, plumbing, electric work, home cleaning and more through this offering. Services are also offered when a customer buys some item from Amazon and needs someone to install it. TV wall-mounting, house cleaning and furniture assembly are reportedly the most popular services at present.\nM&A and Collaborations \nIntel Invests in Self-Driving Cars : At the Los Angeles Auto Show last Tuesday, Intel said that it is putting in $250 million to support the development of self driving and other technology (connectivity, communication, context awareness, deep learning, artificial intelligence, safety and security) for cars all over the world. Intel has said that it is currently involved in 30 vehicle programs, but that number would swell to 49 by 2020. Its order book is already pretty huge at a billion dollars, but this is just the beginning.\nIntel and Google Get Closer : Google and Intel are deepening their relationship with the goal of pushing their respective technologies in the cloud. While Google needs to wrest share versus Amazon and Microsoft, Intel would like to make inroads into the deep learning segment that NVIDIA dominates. The two companies have now decided to go for both product integration and joint marketing to push these efforts, especially among big cloud customers. They have announced that the collaboration will include container management, machine learning, IoT and security.\nMicrosoft-NVIDIA Tie for A.I. : The companies have announced a collaborative effort to promote Microsoft’s A.I. solution through its Azure cloud computing platform. The Microsoft solution is based on GPUs from NVIDIA, the leading provider in the machine learning space. Indicating the considerable prospects, the companies say that A.I. has application across a broad number of industries including healthcare, life sciences, energy, financial services and automotive.\nMicrosoft Ties with Elon Musk A.I. Company : Tesla’s Elon Musk has agreed to use Microsoft’s Azure to develop AI technology for its self driving cars. The Musk-backed startup OpenAI will use NVIDIA-powered Azure N-Series Virtual Machines, which will be available from December. OpenAI was formed in December last year by Musk and Y-Combinator President Sam Altman and others with the goal of ascertaining that self-driving technology remains open and free for all, possibly also as a reaction to Google’s dominance in smartphones.\nAmazon-Hyundai : Hyundai’s connected car Blue Link technology is now getting Alexa integration, so users can get their cars warmed up and ready before they step into them. Or they can ask Alexa to lock the doors as they carry heavy grocery bags into the house.\nGoogle AMD : Google is one company that keeps all its options open. So on the one hand, it uses GPUs from NVIDIA, the current market leader (by far), on the other, it is now using NVIDIA rival AMD’s GPUs. And if that isn’t enough, it’s also into deepening its relationship with Intel for its Nervana-based, non GPU technology, which is yet to make it into the market. So come 2017, training deep neural networks is going to be a very interesting business indeed.\n \nConfidential: Zacks' Best Investment Ideas \nWould you like to see a hand-picked \"all-star\" selection of investment ideas from the man who heads up Zacks' trading and investing services?

      "text": "Also today: Samsung polishes up the Galaxy S7 in a popular new hue, and Apple gets in on the Black Friday action with some unexpected offerings. More Subscribe on YouTube\nEverything went great, except for one (not so) small detail\nHere’s an odd follow-up to story from back in June. At the time, we and a lot of other tech news outlets were excited about the first flight of Facebook’s futuristic Aquila internet-delivery drone, which seemed to go spectacularly well , even flying around well past its expected time in the sky.\nNow, the NTSB is investigating after the drone apparently crashed while landing, something that Facebook didn’t really highlight that day. According to Bloomberg, the 141-foot wide drone suffered a “structural failure” on landing approach and was “substantially damaged” – as in, it couldn’t fly anymore. Facebook noted the failure deep in its post-flight wrap-up , but never really said anything about the drone crashing.\nThe Aquila drone is designed to beam the internet down to areas with no coverage for months at a time. Facebook says it is the first of many drones, and development will continue.\nNow if we could just have Rose Black phones\nIt looks like Jet Black is the new black, as Samsung says it will introduce a shiny black version of their flagship phone, the Galaxy S7. Previously, the Galaxy Note 7, which you may have heard of, was Samsung’s standard bearer of polished ebony, but what with the recall and exploding battery problems, it looks like they decided to fill the vacancy in time for the holidays with the S7.\nApple’s shiny jet black iPhone 7 Plus has been a big hit, and as we’ve seen with gold and rose gold and now jet black, what color a phone is seems almost as important as what the phone can do.\nBecause Apple Stores aren’t crowded enough already\nBeen thinking about some new Apple gear for the holidays? You’re in luck as it appears the tech giant will have some one-day-only Black Friday specials going on… this Friday .\nApple passed on any Black Friday shenanigans last year, but after a few soft earnings reports, it looks like they’re now ready to tempt us with all manner of tech toys, from the usual suspects like the iPhone and Watch, to some things you might not expect, like the new DJI Mavic Drone and the lovable new Cozmo Robot.\nNo Black Friday pricing has been announced yet, you’ll have to wait until Friday, apparently. Apple stores will have expanded hours for the event and of course, you can use the Apple Store app to shop right from your Apple device.\nSamsung may follow Apple’s lead and release a glossy black Galaxy S7 Battle of the sevens: Apple iPhone 7 vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Rose gold is so 2015: Samsung’s pink gold Galaxy S7, S7 Edge are now available",

      "text": "Stay on target iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are falling victim to “touch disease” Apple creates iPhone 6 Smart Battery Case with a questionable design Rest easy, iPhone 6S owners. If your device is randomly shutting down and the only fix is a new battery, Apple’s coming to the rescue. They’ll replace it for you at no cost.\nThey officially announced the swap program just days after the Chinese Consumer Agency lodged a complaint about the issue. According to the CCA, “the number of people who’ve reported this problem is rather many.”\nThere’s an asterisk, as there always is with these things. Apple says that the problem only impacts iPhone 6S in “a limited serial number range that was manufactured between September and October 2015.”\n\nApple’s not just looking after new replacements, either. If you own an affected iPhone 6S and you went to Apple for a repair before the program was announced, they’ll refund your money.\nThat’s a whole lot more generous than what they’re offering iPhone 6 and 6S users whose devices have contracted “ touch disease .” In case you missed it, Apple’s placing the blame for that issue squarely on users, and all they’re offering is a discount on the repair.\n$149 is a whole lot less than the standard $329 they ask for out-of-warranty repairs, but it’s a big slap in the face to owners who’ve been careful with their iPhones and haven’t “dropped multiple times on a hard surface” — which is what Apple says causes touch disease.\nBut hey, if your iPhone 6S has been doubly impacted at least you’ll only be out of pocket for one of the repairs… so you’ll have a few extra bucks to put toward their new $300 coffee table book.",

      "text": "samsung glossy black galaxy s iphone More Looks like Samsung may be going the way of Apple. The company is gearing up to release a glossy black version of the Samsung Galaxy S7, according to a new report from The Investor . The goal of the release will reportedly be to reignite interest in both the Galaxy S7 phone and Samsung as a smartphone maker in general, following the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco .\nAccording to the report, the new color option will launch at some point in December so within the next few weeks, we could see a glossy black Galaxy S7 made available to customers.\nMore: How to factory reset a Samsung Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge\nThis will not be the only black variant of the Galaxy S7 — the device is already available in Black Onyx, but Black Onyx is somewhat of a matte finish. The so-called glossy black finish won’t be matte at all, but will instead by quite shiny, like the Jet Black offering on the iPhone 7. There is a drawback to that finish on the iPhone — it is very prone to scratches and dents.\nIt is also not known where the new finish will be available. It is certainly a possibility that the glossy black option will only be available in Samsung’s home country South Korea, however, it would be nice to see it available elsewhere. Considering Samsung has taken a similar approach by offering the Galaxy S7 Edge in Blue Coral and has released that variant around the globe, there is a precedent for a global release of the new glossy black Galaxy S7.\nAccording to the report from The Investor, since releasing the Coral Blue Galaxy S7 Edge on November 11, Samsung has been releasing an average of 15,000 units per day, so it is possible the company could achieve the same thing with the glossy black Galaxy S7.\nEverything you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Battle of the sevens: Apple iPhone 7 vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Rose gold is so 2015: Samsung’s pink gold Galaxy S7, S7 Edge are now available",

      "text": "Rob Attrell \nNovember 21, 2016 9:01pm \nThe smartphone market has been a massive growth industry for about the last ten years, and with many Android manufacturers seeking to dominate the market for lower cost handsets, it’s to be expected that at some point, most people on Earth will own a smartphone. \nHowever, at the moment, that market growth appears to have slowed down, as most people who want or need a modern smartphone already have one. \nA report from Gartner published this week indicates that the two biggest manufacturers of smartphones, Samsung and Apple, both had decreasing sales in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the year before. What’s more, sales for smartphones worldwide only grew by 5.4 percent from 2015, and this growth has come from a few smaller handset makers that have been growing quickly. \nAfter Samsung and Apple, who held about 20 and 10 percent of the global market share respectively in Q3 2016, came three Chinese companies who actually grew compared to 2015, Huawei, Oppo, and BBK Communication Equipment. Those three companies from a combined 15 percent market share to over 20 percent, while Samsung’s market share fell from 23.6 percent down to 19.2 percent. Apple’s share only dropped 1.5 percent, from 13 to 11.5 year over year. \nThe Galaxy Note 7 recall fiasco has definitely affected sales of Samsung smartphones, but the gains made by Huawei in the last year put it less than three percent behind Apple in market share, and the company could rise to challenge even Samsung’s position in the next couple of years. Source Gartner Jon Duke \n“Huawei catching up with Apple and Samsung”. *Reads article* Absolutely no specific numbers or comparables mentioned for Huawei.. *Rolls eyes*. neo905 \nClick on the Gartner link. It’s pretty obvious they are catching up to Apple. Jon Duke \nI agree. But I’m reading articles on MobileSyrup, not coming here to aggregate my articles and go to other sites. It’s Me \nIf they reduce their prices more they could really catapult themselves into the number one position quickly. Mo Dabbas \nI bought last Thursday a Huawei honor 8 for 420 CAD on a New Egg special. The phone was offered with free accessory bundle including a case, an extra USB cable and charger, USB C to USB A adapter, selfie stick, and JBL bluetooth headphones. The headphones alone sell for 160 on Newegg.Also, not long ago they were selling the Honor 5X for about 300 or so, which is very cheap for what you get.What I’m trying to point out is that what they really need, I think, is more market penetration rather than reducing their prices further. They have a bunch of phones that are taken well globally but never came to north america (like the mate series and the P series). I think if they work out other regions fast they would be able to be in first quickly. zanzee \nGoogle this before your praise this company “huawei copyright nortel”. There’s a reason the USA refuses to allow them to install cellular infrastructure. hoo dat \nNo, there’s not. At the Congressional hearings that Huawei were embroiled in, both the NSA and CIA revealed they had absolutely no evidence to link them to spying or industrial espionage, it basically amounted to unfounded suspicion, rumour and conjecture based on info obtained from Australia that was never able to be verified. neo905 \nBlu phone on the other hand….

      "text": "\nFederal regulators will recommend smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung implement a driving mode that prevents drivers from using certain features that could distract them behind the wheel,  The New York Times  reported on Tuesday.  \nThe feature would be similar to airplane mode, which disables a handset's wireless connectivity, and would restrict any content — like news, video or use of a touchscreen keyboard — that could potentially endanger drivers.  \nThe recommendation is part of a set of safety guidelines the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is expected to release Wednesday. The recommendations aim to slow down a spike traffic deaths that has occurred in the last two years. \nLast year, the number of people killed in traffic accidents jumped by 7.1 percent — the largest increase in traffic fatalities in the last 50 years,  according to a New York Times report published last week.\nThat number climbed again in the first half of 2016 to 10.4 percent, claiming 17,775, according to data collected by the NHTSA and cited.\nAs smartphones have added more features in the last several years, the potential for distraction has also increased, Anthony Foxx, secretary of the US Transportation Department, told The Times.\n“Your smartphone becomes so many different things that it’s not just a communication device,”  Foxx said.  \nThe NHTSA has previously issued a similar set of guidelines that was implemented by automakers that prevents drivers from accessing certain navigation and entertainment features when vehicles are in motion. \nCarmakers also offer a variety of hands-free features that don't require a driver to directly interact with their phone — voice-activated text messaging. Apple has partnered with several car companies to integrate its CarPlay software that pairs a driver's iPhone to the car's infotainment system, allowing them to use features like Apple's voice assistant, Siri. \nPokémon Go developer Niantic recently updated the game to prevent players from using the popular app while driving after a series of accidents were blamed on distracted drivers, The Times said.\nNOW WATCH: It’s surreal to watch this 2011 video of Obama and Seth Meyers taunting Trump about a presidential run \n",

      "text": "Apple Collected 91% Of the Smartphone Industry Profit in Q3, 2016 Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Nov 23, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nIf the latest data from research analytics firm Strategy Analytics is anything to go by, Apple captured a record 91% of the total profit generated by the worldwide smartphone market in the third quarter of 2016. \nIn numbers term, Apple took home almost $8.5 billion of the total $9 billion profit generated by the smartphone industry in the previous quarter. And this is despite iPhone sales slowing down greatly in the previous quarter, with the iPhone 7 launch only barely affecting the numbers since it went on sale towards the very end of the quarter. \nLinda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics, said, “We estimate the global smartphone industry realized total operating profits of US$9.4 billion during Q3 2016. Apple dominated and captured a record 91 percent share of all smartphone profits worldwide. Apple’s ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits. Huawei, Vivo and OPPO are the next three most profitable smartphone vendors globally this quarter, but they are still a long way behind Apple.” \nSamsung was nowhere to be found in the list thanks to the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco that has already cost the company more than $5 billion. Samsung’s loss led to its Chinese rivals Huawei, Vivo, and Oppo grabbing the second, third, and fourth spot respectively in terms of profit share in the smartphone market. However, compared to Apple, these companies took home a measly $200 million in operating profit. Others like Lenovo/Motorola, OnePlus, Xiaomi, and LeEco had to share the remaining $200 million among them in profits. \nThe above rankings of OEMs by profit for the third quarter is more of an exception rather than the norm. Samsung is likely to be back in the list with a strong showing of its flagship Galaxy S7 handset this holiday season.",

      "title": "MacBook Pro: Here’s what you should know before buying the newest release",
      "text": "Apple recently released an upgrade to its MacBook Pro line that's been met with a mixed reaction. Besides the thinner design and increased battery life , the star addition to this new generation is the OLED display \"Touch Bar,\" which allows users dynamic control over context-specific features and shortcuts.\nSome praise the Touch Bar's innovative execution , while others lament the feature's lack of productivity-enhancing customization . One thing everyone can agree on is the new MacBooks are ridiculously expensive . So what else are the critics saying? Here are some factors to consider before taking the plunge on a new MacBook Pro:\nThe Touch Bar is promising, but needs work The Multi-Touch Retina display is a clever idea with plenty of potential. But until developers can implement customization outside of Apple's own applications, it might serve as more of a distraction than a productivity booster. It's branded as the new MacBook's main selling point, but doesn't do enough to warrant purchasing one for this feature alone .\nTouch ID is pretty convenient The Touch Bar has users divided, but there's no denying the Touch ID — located on the right end of the OLED strip — is a useful addition. Not only can it unlock an account without typing in a login and password, but it's also capable of linking with Apple Pay to make fast, secure payments.\nMacBook Pro Touch Bar Source: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP USB-C ports will be great someday — but for now they're super annoying The new MacBook Pros are exclusively equipped with USB-C ports, meaning the technology is here to stay. This is mostly a good thing — USB-C transfers both data and power, which led to the elimination of Apple's MagSafe chargers . But the rest of the world hasn't caught up yet, which means using the new ports are a somewhat frustrating experience, as MacBook Pro owners have to purchase separate adapters for their existing technology. The problem got so bad that Apple actually responded by slashing adapter prices. So USB-C will eventually be good — but for now, they're in the way. One minor consolation: You can charge from any of the laptop's three ports.\nAs always, Apple made an attractive device The new MacBook Pros are thinner, lighter and prettier. This is pretty much how it goes every year, and it's probably one of the reasons Apple customers stick around. Aesthetics matter, and Apple seems to understand that notion more than most.\nMacBook Pro Source: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP But is it worth the expensive price tag? The top-of-the-line 15-inch MacBook Pro sells for $2,800 before tax. The base 13-inch model without the Touch Bar sells for $1,500. Either way, it is expensive. Yes, the MacBook Pro is the gold standard, and yes, Apple products have always been expensive — but this computer comes with a hefty price tag. The new MacBook Pros are sexy and reliable, but can they be labeled as legitimately powerful compared to other options ? That depends on your personal needs.",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 For Immediate Release Chicago, IL – November 22, 2016 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses the eCommerce, Part 2, including Apple (Nasdaq: ( AAPL - Free Report ) - Free Report ), Alphabet (Nasdaq: ( GOOGL - Free Report ) - Free Report ), Alibaba (NYSE: ( BABA - Free Report ) - Free Report ), Mastercard (NYSE: ( MA - Free Report ) - Free Report ) and Visa (NYSE: ( V - Free Report ) - Free Report ). Industry: eCommerce, Part 2 Link: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/96193/online-payments-massive-disruption-solid-opportunities The primary players in the payments space are banks, deriving two kinds of revenue: the first being through fees charged for maintaining certain type of accounts and the second through commissions on payments processed by them. So all the innovation is basically on the transaction side. This is also the side where smaller, third-party players can create niche competencies and larger technology companies like Apple (Nasdaq: ( AAPL - Free Report ) - Free Report ), Alphabet (Nasdaq: ( GOOGL - Free Report ) - Free Report ), Alibaba (NYSE: ( BABA - Free Report ) - Free Report ) and Samsung with their loyal customer base and deep pockets can make a difference. The increased number of players is the primary reason for the margin pressure. The higher volumes are related to expanding payments infrastructure in emerging markets, digital commerce (both business-to-business and business-to-consumer) and new payment processing categories like peer-to-peer to name a few. The cross-border payments landscape is also a big contributor to volumes and an area for disruption given existing system inefficiencies and high cost. Who Are the Stakeholders? Of course the biggest stakeholders and revenue earners are still banks , despite the fact that they are seeing increasing pressure on the retail side, pushing them to invest in technology to bring the kind of convenience millennials expect. The corporate side is more stable because of the increased security and convenience of transacting through banks. Payments networks like Mastercard (NYSE: ( MA - Free Report ) - Free Report ) and Visa (NYSE: ( V - Free Report ) - Free Report ) help authenticate payments made through credit cards issued by banks, collecting a fee for the service. Visa Checkout and Masterpass (the authentication systems for online payments) have been gaining traction. Just last month, Google entered into agreements with the two networks to integrate their services into Android Pay, which allows identity verification through fingerprints instead of a password. The rollout is expected to be completed early next year thus extending Android Pay’s reach and expanding volumes for the networks. PayPal also ended years of haggling with the networks, signing deals with Visa in July and MasterCard in September. These relationships are expected to help PayPal speed up money transfer times in B2B, B2C and P2P transactions. The immediate availability of cash and more choice will make the platform more appealing to PayPal customers. Apple Pay started off with relationships with the two networks, while Android Pay signed an agreement in October that will extend its reach to all merchants linked with the systems. The merchant side integration will be automatic and will roll out early next year. Facebook Messenger rolled out version 1.2 beta in September, which allows the platform to process payments directly in the 30K bots built so far. The number of developers continues to grow and the company is in conversation with Stripe, PayPal, Braintree, Visa, MasterCard and American Express to facilitate the process. The need for security in online payments has driven all these online players to get the recognized authentication brands on board. So the technology players (app makers and some of the service providers/fintech companies) entering the space have been good for them so far. Technology the Disruptor/Opportunity The purpose of applying technology in any given space is to bring efficiency, whether with respect to process or cost of operations or time spent. The payments segment is no different in this respect. Since customers these days carry an electronic device (usually smartphone), this device has become a gateway for making payments, allowing companies like Apple and Google to cut into bank profits. At the same time, these devices have extended banking services to areas without or with limited banking infrastructure, especially in emerging markets, thereby broadening the market for banks. Banks dealing with fintech companies : Payments processing is just one side of the challenge for banks. The truth is, most customers are looking for the convenience of always-on banking services, which is difficult without leveraging the cloud, big data, analytics, the Internet and suitable software. Banks are saddled with high cost of operations and significant regulatory control, which affect their competitiveness with the fintech companies. But it’s not all black for them either. While venture funding has been pouring into startups (KPMG estimates total funding for the year is on track to reach $14.8 billion across 820 deals), very few such companies have survived in the past. True that this time it’s different because of the advantages of cloud computing and involvement of leading tech companies, but banks aren’t sitting on the fence either. Blockchain to the rescue : Initially viewed as a disruptive competitor to centralized banking processes, the distributed ledger system called blockchain is now largely considered a big ally. Blockchain potentially enables simultaneous processing of millions of transactions involving identity verification, authentication and transfer of assets almost instantly, across the world, and without displaying personal information to transacting parties. The resultant elimination of complicated banking processes can streamline bank operations, speed up record-keeping and reduce costs for banks. There is another significant advantage in data storage cost savings because of equally accessible location of data and shared resources between banks. As evident from the above, this involves a sea change in the way banks operate today, not just in their centralized approach, but also in the way they handle customer data and security. This isn’t a problem that will be resolved overnight given that the entire banking system must be overhauled and reinstituted. But it hasn’t stopped banks from investing and exploring the opportunity given the continued competitive pressures. Most of the big banks are tied up with either IBM or Microsoft to test and develop the technology and a full-fledged rollout may not happen for another five or even ten years. For now, the focus is on testing the technology in some segments. In September for instance, Bank of America Merrill Lynch entered into a collaborative agreement with Microsoft to develop a distributed ledger on Azure for trade finance transactions for sale to other parties. Trade transactions are by nature highly manual, time consuming and involve a complicated process vulnerable to document fraud. Blockchain should solve these problems while also significantly lowering the processing time of seven to ten days. Cross-border payments typically take time and involve cost. At the same time, Accenture estimates (as reported by WSJ) that the total value of cross-border transactions through banks is around $25-30 trillion a year. Therefore, this is a very attractive segment for disruption. So in October, Visa announced the Visa B2B Connect, a blockchain network developed in collaboration with payments technology startup Chain. Visa, which is also an investor in Chain, is looking for a share of this business and its solution is compelling: by using Chain’s Core technology, the companies claim that they can process cross-border payments in real time, much like when a Visa credit card is used. Visa has reportedly run a prototype of B2B Connect with 30 banks across 10 countries. But it isn’t alone: Startups R3 and Ripple, and the banks themselves are working on similar solutions. R3, in fact, has already announced the successful testing of its Intel (INTC)-based blockchain solution for bond investing in partnership with CIBC, ING Bank, HSBC, Scotiabank, Societe Generale, State Street, UBS and UniCredit. R3 also leads a consortium of more than 60 of the world's largest financial institutions created to develop commercial applications using blockchain technology for the financial services market. Last Words The online payments landscape will continue to evolve over the next few years as banks, financial services companies and technology companies look for their share of revenue. For banks and financial service companies, it’s a question of protecting their turf, while for technology players, it’s a question of expanding their revenue base. There is unlikely to be any clear winner that will take all the spoils. The government will continue to play a big role in the new paradigm. This is particularly true in case of emerging markets where digitization can take services to more people who are anyway more inclined to use their mobile devices. Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar. They're virtually unknown to the general public.

      "text": "Apple, Salesforce, Google Among Top 25 Companies For Women, As Voted By Female Employees     Palantir CEO Alex Karp Says Going Public Is 'A Possibility' Photo: AP Photo/Ben Margot \nWomen were reporting election-related anxiety and post-traumatic stress flare-ups even before Donald Trump won the presidency. \nNow that he’s President-Elect, many women’s fears of losing fundamental rights are compounded by the realization that the gender equality agenda touted by Hillary Clinton will have to wait at least four more years. \nTrump — who has described working women as “dangerous” — will not be pushing to close the wage gap . (And if you fell for Ivanka Trump’s phony parental leave promises , I have an $11,000 bracelet to sell you .) \nWith a Senate GOP so opposed to women’s advancement they’ve blocked the Paycheck Fairness Act four times, it’s more important than ever for American companies to promote gender equality from within. \nLuckily, some of the country’s biggest, most high-profile corporations seem to be on the right track. \nWomen’s job review startup Fairygodboss released its 2016 list of Best Companies For Women on Friday, ranking each workplace based on reviews by female employees. \nThe women-led job board averaged women workers’ responses to three questions: overall job satisfaction, whether they feel they’re treated fairly versus men, and whether they’d recommend their employer to other women. \nTech giant Apple came out on top , with a score of 78 out of 100. \nNearly three quarters of women employees who reviewed the Cupertino, Calif. gadget company said they felt they were treated as equals, while 78% said they’d recommend their workplace to female prospective employees. Women workers gave the company an average job satisfaction score of 4.1 out of 5. \nTied at number two were professional services firms Deloitte and Accenture, both of which offer 16 weeks of paid parental leave. \nInvestment management firm Vanguard Group and industrial juggernaut General Electric tied for third. The former fared better than the latter with the fair treatment metric; only 66% of women reviewers working at GE said they felt they were treated equally to men. \nCloud computing company Salesforce, often touted as progressive for CEO Marc Benioff’s pro-LGBT stance, came in at four. Auditor PwC was number five. \nThomson Reuters, Cisco Systems, Google, Microsoft, and Bloomberg rounded out the top ten. \nFor Fairygodboss’ full list, see here .",

      "text": "Apple's Jony Ive Might Not Be 'Directly Involved' With iPhone Design Anymore, Experts Say 23 November 2016, 12:29 am EST By Chris Loterina Tech Times Jony Ive has been credited for iconic Apple products since 1998. Speculations, however, revealed that he is no longer involved in product design and this started with his promotion as Chief Design Officer last year. ( Apple ) Advertisement \nThe rumor is that Jony Ive, chief design officer at Apple, may be on the way out or at least out of designing the iPhone . This came amid reports that he is purportedly taking a more backseat role in product design. It Began With A Tree \nThe speculation began gathering steam when a Christmas tree at Claridge was unveiled . It was designed by Ive in collaboration with Marc Newson, who both claim to be friends with the London luxury hotel. \nIf you are scratching your head, wondering how all these business are related, we can backtrack last fall when Ive gave an ominous statement. \n\"If I wasn't doing this, I think I would just be drawing or making stuff for friends,\" Ive told Charlie Rose when asked what he would do if he is no longer with Apple. \"Maybe it would just be Christmas tree ornaments, I don't know.\" The Apple Grapevine Bore Fruit \nNow, Apple watchers are proposing all sorts of wild speculations. John Gruber, a noted Apple pundit, has suggested that Ive is already probably no longer designing iPhones because he is now merely focusing on architectural projects like the Apple campus and a handful of retail stores. Gruber has stated this in The Talk Show podcast where he also said that he is assuming a Jobs-like role at Apple, directing the development of certain products such as the gold Apple Watch or an Apple car by way of a spiritual leadership. \nSome observers are joining the fray. Apple blogger Marco Arment, for example, went as far as saying burn out may be one of the reasons. Criticizing execs is unpopular, but Ive seems stretched thin, burnt out, and bored. \nI’d love to see some fresh design leadership at Apple. \n— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) November 15, 2016 \nApp Advice also cited that the Ive rumor came on the heels of the \"Designed by Apple in California\" book release. It is seen as a tribute to the designer who has made practically all of the iconic products exhibited there possible. More than the recognition of Ive's work, such kind of tribute is also often reserved for someone about to get benched or retired. Clarifying The Apple Rumors \nAfter kicking the hornet's nest, Six Colors founder, Jason Snell is scrambling to douse the controversy he has partly set in motion. In a blog post , he clarified that he did not say Ive is on the way out and that he is only involved in architecture at this point. However, he still cited sources that think Ive is on the way out and this has started with his promotion as chief design officer last year. \nSnell cited the role is largely ceremonial so Ive can spend less time on management. He indicated that product design is now covered by the positions occupied by Alan Dye, vice president of user interface, and Richard Howarth, vice president of industrial design. Both directly report to Tim Cook. \nHowarth seems to be a key figure in this narrative. He took over Ive's previous job and his bio at the Apple website provides a better insight. \n\"Richard joined Apple in 1996 and has been involved in the design of nearly every Apple product since the original iMac,\" Apple detailed . \"Richard leads a multinational team of extraordinarily talented designers, CAD sculptors and model makers responsible for creating and imagining the future of Apple products.\" \nIt seems like Ive has nothing much left to do for products. In the meantime, he is off somewhere designing Christmas trees and, as the speculations pointed out, tending the Apple campus.  ",

      "text": "FMT Reporters | November 23, 2016 Apple's iPhone and iPad are falling victim to a type of crash bug that renders the smartphones unusable after watching a short video. VIDEO INSIDE \nPETALING JAYA: A malicious video spreading on the internet will crash any model of Apple iPhone or iPad. \nThe phones are falling victim to a type of crash bug that renders the smartphones unusable after watching a short video, the Straits Times reported. \nPlaying the video causes iPhones to slow down and eventually grind to a halt. And it doesn’t seem to matter which version of the iPhone people use. \nA video showing the effects of the bug on various iPhone models has been uploaded to YouTube. \nAccording to a report in the Daily Mail, the video from the Sina Weibo-backed video-sharing app Miaopai plays normally in the iPhone’s video player, but once the video is finished it can take up to a minute for the iPhone to lock up, requiring a forced reboot to recover it, according to a report in the Guardian. \nMost people are unaware anything has happened, continuing to use their smartphone until it either won’t turn back on or locks up in an app, the home screen or with a spinning loading logo on a black screen. \nAccording to the Guardian, the bug, which appears to involve the media handling functions of iOS, affects versions of the operating system as far back as iOS 5 and devices from the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 7. The older the smartphone, the faster the lockup occurs. \nHowever, the lockup is not permanent, but requires a soft reset or forced reboot to recover the functionality of the iPhone. \nOn an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus users will need to hold down the power and down volume buttons until they see the Apple logo. On the iPhone 6S, 6S Plus or older Apple smartphones, users need to hold down the power and home buttons until they see the Apple logo, said the Guardian. \nOnce the iPhones reboot, everything appears to function as normal. \nAccording to the Next Web, the bug is most likely sparked because the video is a corrupt file which starts a memory leak chain when it is opened in Apple’s Safari web browser. \nApple’s iOS operating system then fails to handle the problem as it multiplies, rapidly slowing the device down to a stop. \nThe iPhone-freezing video, discovered is a short .mp4 clip of someone standing by a bed with the words ‘Honey’ written across the screen. \nThe Daily Mail reported Android users have reported watching the video without any difficulties.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Research firm Strategy Analytics this afternoon reports that Apple ( AAPL ) during Q3 garnered an “all-time high” share of profits in the mobile market, at 91%, or $8.52 billion, while Chinese brands Huawei , Vivo , and Oppo took the rest.\nXiaomi was in fifth place. All of the top four profited from the decline of Samsung Electronics ( 005930KS ), with its “ Note 7 ” debacle. Samsung had been in second place behind Apple a year earlier, but dropped to ninth place this year with just $10 million in profit dollars.\nThe results are qualitatively similar to a report yesterday by Canaccord Genuity ’s Mike Walkley , in which Walkley estimated Apple profit in smartphones jumped to 106% in the quarter.\nAnalyst Linda Sui is Quote: d as saying that “Apple’s ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits.”\nThe firm’s executive director, Neil Mawston , commented on the strong showing by Chinese brands:\nWe estimate Huawei generated US$0.2 billion of smartphone operating profit worldwide in Q3 2016. Huawei captured 2 percent share of all smartphone profits, taking second spot overall, and becoming the world’s most profitable Android vendor for the first time ever. An efficient supply chain, sleek products and effective marketing have been among the main drivers of Huawei’s robust profitability. Vivo and OPPO followed in third and fourth place and each took 2 percent global profit share. Vivo and OPPO delivered relatively healthy profitability due to disciplined pricing and soaring shipments across Asia.”",

      "text": "Gruber: Jony Ive Continues Playing a Key Role in Apple’s Product Design Posted by Rajesh Pandey on Nov 23, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nThe launch of Jony Ive’s design book and his absence from Apple’s launch event and marketing efforts afterwards sparked speculations that the design guru is no longer playing a key role in designing Apple’s physical products like before. \nThe rumors largely sparked off after the latest episode of The Talk Show in which John Gruber said Ive is not as directly involved with product design as before. Instead, he has been focusing on designs of Apple’s new stores and the company’s spaceship campus. \nClarifying his statement, Gruber today in a post explained that Ive still plays a key role in all things design at Apple. He clarifies that whatever information he has received about Ive’s role at Apple has been second or third-hand which does not particularly make them reliable. \nHe does note that as per his sources Ive has not been devoting the same time to Apple’s product design as before since he is busy with the design of the company’s upcoming spaceship campus and the new retail store design. However, the design of every new product that Apple launches goes through him. In fact, Gruber adds that his role change to chief design officer represents his increased workload and authority. \nDo you think some of Apple’s new products don’t have the same iconic design as their predecessor?",

      "text": "Apple to release a bigger iPhone; ceases SE updates By Staff Writer | Nov 23, 2016 02:54   Getty Images/Noam Galai) A view of the iPhone 7 as seen inside Apple Store Soho on November 11, 2016 in New York City. \nApple will be overhauling the iPhone for its 2017's release. Recent leaks suggest that the tech giant embracing a new technology for its mobile device. \nAccording to Forbes , it has attained reports that Apple is working on three versions for its 2017 iPhone line. While the other two would have carry a TFT-LCD model with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens, the third one will be a massive 5.8-inch with OLED technology. The 5.5-inch and the OLED would reportedly have dual cameras installed. Advertisement \nThe use of OLED in the iPhone puts it on a better position competitively, as it allows the phones to be thinner and lighter that the LCD counterparts. It also has a higher contrast ration and works even without backlight, so it saves the smartphone more power. Advertisement \nOn the flip side, this may cause some struggle for all three devices in 2017's line in terms of sales. Having only one device with OLED might lead to the sidelining of the budget-friendly 4.7-inch variant. Also, with Apple's current trend of increasing its pricing, as seen in its recent MacBook Pro release, may alienate some of its customers, preferring to go elsewhere to get the same specs as a top-tier iPhone with a lower cost. \nThis trend could also be seen with the cancellation of the iPhone SE . Despite being the cheapest and most reliable iPhone for 2016, GameNGuide revealed that, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo , updates for the iPhone SE will cease due to its possible effects to the more profitable main lines, which at this time is the iPhone 7 . There was also a prediction regarding the decline of iPhone 7 sales during the first half of 2017, due in part of a small demand for the device in the Asian market. \nThe iPhone SE was released in March 2016. Priced at $399 for 16GB and $449 for 64GB, packs most of the iPhone 6 in a modest 4-inch body of the iPhone 5 .",

      "text": "\nHONG KONG — Apple has admitted that some iPhone 6S devices can suddenly shut down for no apparent reason. \nThe tech giant is offering owners of the problematic smartphones free replacement batteries. \n“A very small number” of iPhone 6S devices manufactured between September and October 2015 are affected, Apple said in a statement Monday. It didn’t provide details on the battery fault that is causing the phones to unexpectedly go dark. \nApple’s announcement comes less than a week after a consumer watch group in China launched an investigation into the problem. \n“A considerable number” of Chinese users reported their iPhone 6 and 6S devices would suddenly turn off despite showing plenty of battery life, the China Consumers Association said in a statement. The phones would not turn back on even when plugged into chargers, according to the consumer group. \nApple said the battery problem is “not a safety issue.” Its big rival Samsung pulled its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after repeated reports of the devices bursting into flames. Samsung initially said batteries in some Note 7 phones were to blame but is yet to fully explain the cause. \nApple’s battery replacement offer for the iPhone 6S applies worldwide. Owners of eligible phones with cracked screens will have to repair them before getting the new battery, Apple said. \nConsumers were plagued by a similar iPhone problem earlier this year. A software glitch with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus caused the battery icon to display more battery life than was actually left, leaving many people frustrated when their phones appeared to suddenly shut down. The company fixed the problem with an operating system update. \nAnd just last week, Apple acknowledged iPhone 6 Plus devices suffer from “Touch Disease”— when the phone’s touchscreen stops working after it has been bent or repeatedly dropped on the floor. \nThe tech company rolled out a repair program, charging customers $149 to cure the disease.

      "text": "November 22, 2016 , 11:40 PM Apple is one of those stores that rarely has sales, no matter what time of year it is. But a post on its website today indicates that not only will the store of our iPhone dreams be having a sale — it will be a Black Friday sale. In the post , next to an Apple Watch with a calendar notification for this Friday, are possibly the most joyful words of the season: \"Friday can’t come soon enough. Our one-day shopping event will be here before you know it. Come back this Friday to check everyone off your list.\"According to Time , the company didn't participate in the retail holiday last year. And the only Black Friday deal it has ever offered was one for mere gift card bundles. However, this year's teaser hints at far more than gift cards. Will it be a chance to purchase a discounted MacBook Pro with Touch Bar or an iPhone 7 ? Or maybe the new Apple Watch Nike+ ? We have until Friday to wonder which gadgets the company may discount, if any. But one thing's for sure: This Black Friday is already looking up. Advertisement",

      "text": "How Apple lost China to two unknown local smartphone makers 78 reading now twitter TWEET More \nTwo years ago, Oppo and Vivo couldn't crack the top five in China's smartphone market. Now they're on top after elbowing Apple aside, thanks to people like Cheng Xiaoning. \nCheng runs a thriving electronics store in the rural town of Miaoxia, tapping into her WeChat social media account to promote the brands that pay the biggest commission, and in her case that's Oppo and Vivo . While such payments start at about 40 yuan ($7.60), they escalate for more expensive handsets and reach almost 200 yuan for Oppo's high-end smartp ﻿ hones. Vivo and fellow Chinese smartphone maker Oppo are offering cheaper alternatives to the iPhone. Today, Vivo sells more than twice as many devices in China as Apple. Photo: Bloomberg \n\"That's why I like to introduce the Oppo R9 Plus to potential customers,\" she said. \"Business has been perfect, actually never been better.\" \nCheng and tens of thousands of like-minded boosters form the vanguard of the pair's charge against Apple and Samsung Electronics. Working with the local stores that dominate sales in China's far-flung provinces, Oppo and Vivo came out of nowhere to upend the industry order and squeeze out former local darling Xiaomi Corp. Their labels graced one out of every three smartphones sold within China in the third quarter, while the iPhone's market share at 7 per cent stood at its lowest in almost three years. The man who's clobbering Apple: Reclusive billionaire Duan Yong Ping uses a network of local stores in China's far-flung provinces to shake up the country's smartphone market. \nOppo and Vivo trace their origins to reclusive billionaire Duan Yong Ping , dubbed \"China's Warren Buffett\", and employ similar strategies. That includes harnessing the spending power of rural customers away from top-tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. It's where Apple's vulnerable given the iPhone's lofty price tag. \nThey eschewed e-commerce to instead court the stores where three-quarters of smartphone sales take place. Apple has been more reluctant to relinquish the retail experience to local free-agents, who sometimes charge brands for in-store displays and posters. Advertisement \n\"Oppo and Vivo are willing to share their profit with local sales. The reward was an extremely active and loyal nationwide sales network,\" said Jin Di, an IDC analyst based in Beijing. While they declined to detail their subsidy program, she estimates the two were the top spenders in the past year. \"They're doing something different -- they do local marketing.\" Apple's growth sputters \nChina had for years driven Apple's and Samsung's growth. The US company generated almost $US59 billion ($79 billion) of sales from the region in fiscal 2015, which was more than double the level just two years earlier. During that time its shares surged more than 60 per cent. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking up China's promise. But things are getting tougher for the US multinational. Photo: AP \nAt its peak, Greater China yielded almost 30 per cent of its revenue and Apple was neck-and-neck with Xiaomi for the mantle of market leader as users clamoured for the larger iPhone 6 models. Even as the domestic economy began to sputter, Apple CEO Tim Cook spent a good chunk of an earnings call last year talking up the country's promise, saying Apple's investing there \"for the decades ahead.\" \nThen the country's slowdown and regulatory tangles took their toll. Authorities intervened, blocking iTunes Movies and iBooks, ending a period of near-unimpeded growth in the country. The Oppo phone looks like an iPhone, but sells for a fraction. Photo: supplied \nBut perhaps most crucial was the ascendancy of cheaper but just-as-good local alternatives. Oppo and Vivo's gains have come mainly at the expense of lower-tier names thus far, but if they climb further into the premium segment, the US company will need an answer. Some think the 10th-anniversary iPhone due in 2017 could deliver. \n\"Apple needs to offer something cutting-edge to appeal to maturing Chinese smartphone users,\" Counterpoint Research director Neil Shah writes. Oppo and Vivo can use the time until then to cement their positions, he said. \nTogether Oppo and Vivo shipped about 40 million smartphones in the third quarter, about 34 per cent of devices sold in the world's biggest market, according to IDC. In 2012, their combined share was about 2.5 per cent. IPhone shipments plunged more than a third to 8.2 million during the period - less than half of Vivo's. Samsung, which once led the market, now settles for roughly 5 per cent, according to Counterpoint. \nAs Apple has faltered in China, Cook has stepped up his courtship of local decision-makers. He visited the country several times this year, unveiled plans for research centres in Beijing and Shenzhen, and invested $US1 billion in Uber rival Didi Chuxing. Cook said on his last earnings call he remains confident of a return to growth this quarter. \nSamsung declined to comment for this story, while Apple didn't respond to requests for comment. \nIt's unclear how Apple can reclaim lost ground in the interim. Previous attempts to drift down-market -- with the iPhone 5c and SE, for instance -- fizzled as local users shunned seemingly inferior devices. Apple doesn't run a vibrant online social community for users the way some of its local rivals do. And competing on price will jeopardise the industry's fattest profit margins. Mobilising local shop owners \nOppo and Vivo pack high-end specs into a phone that sells for a fraction of its rival's in China, where iPhone 7s start at 5388 yuan ($1024). Consider the Oppo R9 plus: for 2999 yuan, buyers get an aluminium body, 6-inch display, 16-megapixel camera and a battery that claims 19 hours of calls, photo and web browsing. Vivo's high-end Xplay6, with a price tag of 4498 yuan, also undercuts Apple. \n\"Both companies invested heavily in marketing,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia Pacific research director at consultancy Canalys. Oppo and Vivo have a strong grip on the middle market for phones from $US200 to $US500, she said. \"Their offline channel strategy paid off.\" \nThe man who's clobbering Apple started out low on the tech spectrum. Duan made his fortune selling DVD players, telephones and game consoles similar to Nintendo's. Bubugao Communication Equipment, the parent of Vivo, emerged from a restructuring in 1999 that split his company. The billionaire later teamed with long-time colleague Tony Chen and others to found what came to be known as Guangdong Oppo Electronics. \nWhile Duan has kept a low profile since moving to the US in 2001, he occasionally makes his way into the spotlight. In 2006, he bid a then-record $US620,100 to have lunch with investment guru Warren Buffett . Oppo's first smartphone came in 2011, when it unveiled a device with a BlackBerry-like keyboard. The same year, Bubugao created the business that would become Vivo. \nToday, Vivo touts its cameras and Oppo focuses on rapid-charging and battery life. But their offline strategies remain the same: mobilising tens of thousands of private shop owners. Oppo said it sells its products through roughly 240,000 privately owned stores as of June -- six times the global count of McDonald's. Vivo manages about half that, said Jin. Oppo, which doesn't disclose sales figures, said about 90 per cent of its phones were sold offline. \nWhile Xiaomi shot to international prominence with flash online promotions, that success has been concentrated in densely packed cities. That doesn't work so well in the countryside, where novice buyers want advice and demonstrations. By cultivating a physical network, Oppo and Vivo are building a platform difficult to replicate in the short run. 'Keep our heads down and make the correct moves' \nApple, in contrast, has fewer than 40 stores across the country, most of which are in large cities. While its retail network is lauded for helping weave an aura of exclusivity and chic around its higher-priced gadgets, Chinese consumers -- particularly in smaller, poorer cities -- value access to someone local who can work out kinks. That sort of after-sales support is in itself a powerful marketing tool, IDC's Jin said. \nFor now, neither Oppo nor Vivo appear overly concerned with the world's most valuable company. Their executives say they'll stick to their winning strategies, while exploring ways to keep pushing the smartphone envelope. \n\"We have to keep our minds clear in the fast-changing market,\" said Allen Wu, Oppo's vice-president in charge of sales. \"All we need to do is to keep our heads down and make the correct moves.\" \nTo Vivo, that means targeting younger users with higher-performance devices. \"Camera and music will be our key focuses in the future. We are seeing greater customer expectations out of these two areas,\" company vice-president Ni Xudong said. \nThat message resonates with the likes of Chen Siyu, an accountant who uses her Vivo phone at least four hours a day to chat with friends, watch videos and apply for jobs. \n\"I chose Vivo because of its design and photographing capability,\" said the 26-year-old who lives in the town of Pu'tian in Fujian. \"It is not expensive and doesn't slow down after longtime use like many Android phones do.\" \nBloomberg",

      "text": "apple is rumored to be disbanding its wireless router team storefront feat More Apple is apparently preparing to disband its internet router division, with plans to distribute staff to other parts of the company. It seems that the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and the AirPort Time Capsule will all be discontinued sooner rather than later.\nIt’s been three years since Apple last launched a new router, so it’s not too surprising to see the company make this decision. However, there will certainly be plenty of users who are disappointed to find that they’ll have to look elsewhere for a replacement when their current AirPort router gives up the ghost.\nApple has been in the process of shutting down its wireless router team for the past year, according to a report from Bloomberg . It’s expected that rather than laying off staff, most people working as part of the team will be reallocated to projects that bring in more revenue, such as the group charged with development of Apple TV.\nMore: Apple has launched its second iPhone repair program in less than a week\nThis isn’t the first example of Apple exiting a particular hardware category in recent months. In June, the company discontinued its Thunderbolt display , which prefaced a collaboration with LG on brand new monitors targeted toward Mac users.\nIt seems feasible that the company could pursue a similar strategy in terms of its router business. By partnering with another outfit that specializes in that area, Apple could offer a router that’s in keeping with the Mac design aesthetic without having to take on the risks and costs associated with a relatively niche product.\nApple is yet to comment on the future of its router business officially, and AirPort products are still available via the company’s official online store. However, it seems like the writing could be on the wall for this particular sector of Apple’s output.\nWatch Apple’s latest product announcements live, right now Apple is making efforts to unify its cloud services into one location Nvidia job listings hint at renewed graphics chip deal with Apple",

      "text": "Ever since Tim Cook took the CEO position, Apple Inc. ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) has been in headlines for the sheer absence of innovation in the recent devices. Apple, which is considered as one of the most innovative companies in the world, is failing to meet the high-end expectations of its users. Despite being one of the top spenders on R&D , innovation still seems to be on the sideline.\nHowever, recently Apple filed a patent for a foldable iPhone with a flexible design . The design will incorporate a flexible metal-backed OLED display which can be folded in half. Apple has been working on this design for a long time now. \nThe patent has been granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Patent No. 9,504,170 for Flexible display devices, describes as an iPhone with a foldable full-screen display. To achieve this folding design, the most important component is a flexible OLED display. Another important component is a metal structure to support it which is allegedly nitinol (nickel and titanium alloy) that has elastic and unique shape memory capabilities. The screen can be split into upper and lower sections, each containing the processors, sensors and other smartphone circuitry like display controls, camera, CPU and GPU, microphones etc.\n\nThere’s also an alternative design in which the device is split into three parts which will give access to the screen when folded. The split pieces are attached using a single or multi-shaft hinge that supports the rotational motion. The connection between the pieces is achieved by using flexible printed circuit boards. Also, to protect the sensitive OLED display when folded, Apple engineers suggest tensioning members and rollers for dispensing and retracting the display when the hinge rotates.\n\nIt’s High Time for Apple to Adopt OLED Display for iPhone In this dynamic smartphone market, it is only innovation that has the power to attract consumers, especially in the premium segment. The consumers always demand value for the price they pay. Most of the premium smartphones like Samsung Galaxy S series, Google Pixel, HP Elite X3, etc., have been using OLED display for a long time. Apple devices are using LCD display till now. Even the latest iPhone 7 and 7 Plus incorporates an LCD display, but they are said to be the best LCD display on a phone ever.\nHowever, OLED has an edge over LCD with faster response time, better viewing angles, image contrast accuracy and screen uniformity. It is high time for Apple to adopt OLED display to provide a better experience. Coming up with a flexible OLED display will be a much-appreciated move from the company.\nSamsung is Running Parallel in the Race However, it is not just Apple who is working on this innovative design. The smartphone market leader Samsung also recently filed a patent for a foldable phone with a flexible OLED display. After the Note 7 debacle, Samsung will now leave no stones unturned to make its upcoming smartphones an unmatched experience. Apple and Samsung are both gearing up to give each other a tough challenge!\nApple tops the list of the most innovative companies and one of the top spenders in R&D, with a spending of over $10 billion in the fiscal year 2016. But these achievements are not sufficient to sell products. It should reflect on what the company is producing and providing to the end-users. Apple recently launched the new Macbook pro which incorporates a touch bar and touch ID, which are some really innovative features and are highly appreciated in the market. Apple needs to continue to roll out such innovations in its products to maintain its position in the market. 2017 marks the tenth anniversary of the iPhone and we are hoping to see a totally different and futuristic iPhone next year.\n",

      "text": "Narendra Modi App Dominates Apple's App Store in Searches, Downloads Searches about PM Modi's app are trending on Google Play, Apple App Store PM Modi's app is the most-downloaded free app on Apple App Store It is also among the most popular apps on Google Play \nAmid the demonetisation drive, searches for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s official app have hit a new high. This new wave of searches comes soon after the PM sought the public’s view on demonetisation via a poll that is available only on his app. The app is currently topping the trending charts on both Google Play and Apple’s App Store. \nOn the App Store , search terms related to the Narendra Modi app occupy all 10 spots of the Trending list. The scene is not too different on Google Play store either, with 11 out of the top 12 trending apps related to the Prime Modi; in fact, the only remaining app is also related to the new currency notes that became the new currency on November 8. When it comes to downloads, the Narendra Modi app is the most-downloaded app on App Store among free apps, but ranks on No. 18 among the top downloaded free apps on Google Play marketplace.\nThe Prime Minister on Tuesday asked the public to share with him their “first-hand view” on the decision to scrap the old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. Among the questions are: \"Do you have any suggestions/ideas or insights you would like to share with PM Narendra Modi?\", \"Do you think black money exists in India?\", \"Do you think the evil of corruption and black money need to be fought and eliminated?\", \"What do you think of government's move of banning old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes?\" \nSearches for the Narendra Modi app on Google Play may also be boosted by the demand for duplicates of the Modi Keynote app, which claimed to distinguish between authentic and fake Rs. 2000 notes before being pulled from the marketplace.",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe recently unveiled MacBook Pro (2016) complete with its Touch Bar has been praised and criticized in just about equal measure. One of the biggest criticisms levelled at Apple is that RAM is limited to 16GB. Why such a cap on a professional device? \nApple has revealed that the reason for the limit is nothing to do with -- as some may have suspected -- keeping costs down (as if!), but rather due to concerns about battery life. The reasoning may be fairly sound, but the full explanation may not be enough to silence critics completely. \nSpeaking to MacDaddy Apple's Phil Schiller explains that increasing the amount of supported memory would mean using RAM that consumed more power. RAM with higher power consumption means shorter battery life. It was a balancing act. But there is more to the decision, as Schiller explains: \nThe MacBook Pro uses 16GB of very fast LPDDR memory, up to 2133MHz. \nTo support 32GB of memory would require using DDR memory that is not low power and also require a different design of the logic board which might reduce space for batteries. Both factors would reduce battery life. \nHe had previously said: \"To put more than 16GB of fast RAM into a notebook design at this time would require a memory system that consumes much more power and wouldn’t be efficient enough for a notebook\". His latest statement really just expands upon his initial explanation, presumably in the hope that it will convince complainers that the right decision was made. \nWhich side of the fence do you fall? Would you rather the RAM had been increased, or are you happy with less memory and longer battery life?",

      "text": "  \n(Apple) Apple's iPhone 8 is rumored to sport a major overhaul in design and features. \nWhile foldable cellphones have become a thing of the past, big names like Apple and Samsung have started looking into foldable screen technology. Apple was recently awarded a patent for a foldable iPhone design, begging the question: Will the iPhone 8 be foldable? \nAccording to Patently Apple , which first spotted the patent application back in 2014, the Cupertino-based tech giant was recently granted the patent design, which came with illustrations. Seen at the European Patent Office, the design features flexible housing and hinges that allow the smartphone to be bended in half. A three or four-bar linkage system is used. \nApparently, this is not the first time that Apple has been granted a patent for a foldable screen design. They were previously awarded a patent for a foldable iPhone that uses advanced carbon nanotube structures. \nWith this, many are wondering if the iPhone 8 will be a foldable smartphone. It can be recalled that foldable phones, or flip phones, were immensely popular back in the day. Everyone wanted a flip phone, especially Motorola's Razr. Could this trend be making a comeback? Advertisement \nApple isn't the only one that has explored foldable technology. Samsung also filed a patent for a foldable screen , which is rumored to be making it to the Galaxy Note 8. \nAs for its display, it was previously reported that the iPhone 8 would have OLED displays, making it the first in the lineup to sport this technology. However, according to 9to5Mac , only one of the three iPhone 8 variants will have an OLED display. The other two models will have the same TFT-LCD display. Additionally, the dual camera seen on the iPhone 7 Plus will remain on the Plus series, making it to the 5.5-inch variant and not the 4.7-inch variant. \nThe iPhone 8 will mark the flagship's 10th anniversary, which means it will surely be a special one in the series. Because of this, there are also rumors saying that it could be named iPhone 10.  ",

      "text": "Apple has captured a record share of profits in the global smartphone industry in the third quarter, according to new research, despite grappling will falling iPhone sales. \nThird-quarter smartphone operating profit reached $9 billion globally of which Apple took 91 percent of the share, Strategy Analytics said in a note on Tuesday. This amounts to $8.19 billion for the U.S. technology giant. \nApple has the highest profit margins in the smartphone industry thanks to a loyal brand following and the ability to price its iPhones at a premium. And the figures come even after Apple reported three straight quarters of iPhone sales declines . \n\nSpencer Platt | Getty Images One of the first customers to buy a new iPhone walks out of an Apple store in Manhattan on September 16, 2016 in New York City. In its official fiscal fourth-quarter results, which coincides with Strategy Analytics' third-quarter survey, Apple reported an operating income of $11.76 billion overall – not just for its iPhone unit. The U.S. hardware giant does not break out profitability for iPhones separately. Apple's gross margin was 38 percent. \n\"Apple's ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits,\" Linda Sui, director at Strategy Analytics, said in the report. \nPart of the reason Apple has also captured record share is because other players in the smartphone market have declined. \nStrategy Analytics' estimate appears conservative compared to other studies. Earlier this month, BMO Capital Markets said Apple accounted for around 103.6 percent of profits in the smartphone market. The more than 100 percent figure reflects the fact that other vendors such as HTC and LG lost money. \nNo Samsung in sight Sat a long way behind Apple is China's Huawei which managed to grab 2.4 percent of global operating profit share in the smartphone market, accounting for $200 million, according to Strategy Analytics. Huawei's third-quarter smartphone shipments rose 63 percent year-on-year, official figures from the company showed in October. The Chinese technology giant does not break out profitability figures, but it is now the world's third-largest smartphone maker behind Samsung and Apple.\n\nIt has been focusing on selling high-end devices to challenge its larger rivals and boost margins with the company aggressively expanding its marketing efforts. \nChinese start-up brands Vivo and OPPO are in third and fourth place, both capturing 2.2 percent of global smartphone profit each. Both firms have managed to grow rapidly through a strategy of selling low-cost but high-spec phones. \nApple's closest rival Samsung does not feature in the Strategy Analytics report. \n\"Three of the world's top four most profitable smartphone vendors are currently Chinese. Huawei, Vivo and OPPO have not only improved their smartphone product lineups this year, they have also enhanced their operational abilities and kept a tight lid on expanding distribution costs,\" Sui said.",

Apple confirmed these flaws Recently, Apple has been facing customers' wrath owing to hardware glitches in iPhones. Apple confirmed these flaws Has your iPhone gone on the fritz? Does the screen flicker or does your iPhone suddenly power down, even though it had a full battery? Recently, Apple has been facing customers' wrath due to hardware glitches in iPhones. Apple confirmed these flaws on Monday. While the smartphone giant has assured to rectify issues, users continue to grapple with one issue or the other. Hardware malfunction (touch disease) Lately, a hardware malfunction has been causing iPhone users, especially those using iPhone 6 Plus, a lot of trouble. The malfunction, named 'touch disease' can cause the iPhone display to start flickering or the multi-touch function stops working. Apple has admitted to the hardware glitches saying, \"some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device\". To assist its customers in this regard, Apple has launched a new repair programme. In case you are a victim of 'touch disease ' this is what you must do according to Apple: * If you are facing multi-touch issue, bring your iPhone 6 Plus to a participating Apple authorised service provider. * Your iPhone will be examined prior to any service to verify that it is eligible for this programme and in working order. * Apple or an Apple authorised service provider will then repair your device at the price of Rs 9,900 * Pricing offered by Apple authorised service providers may vary * Apple will also cover 5 years insurance after the first retail sale of the unit of iPhone 6 Plus devices Symptoms of touch disease: Flickering screen. But this isn't it, as users have reported that after the grey bar starts flickering, the screen becomes intermittently unresponsive across the entire display. iPhone battery power down Recently, Apple has had to replace batteries for many iPhone 6s users. In this case, phone unexpectedly shuts down. Apple has launched a battery replacement program for this. The smartphone giant has advised customers who might have experienced this issue to visit an Apple Retail Store or authorised service centres with their device’s serial number to confirm eligibility. Unlike the iPhone 6 Plus ‘Touch disease’ issue where Apple is charging $149, the battery replacement process is totally free of cost. In case an iPhone has cracked display or any other defect, owner will be charged extra. Apple is not the sole company having to deal with issues related to hardware and smartphone's battery. This year Galaxy Note 7 smartphones took a toll on the manufacturers and users due to overheating of batteries.

The goal of the release will reportedly be to reignite interest in both the Galaxy S7 phone and Samsung as a smartphone maker in general, following the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco .\nAccording to the report, the new color option will launch at some point in December so within the next few weeks, we could see a glossy black Galaxy S7 made available to customers.\nMore: How to factory reset a Samsung Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge\nThis will not be the only black variant of the Galaxy S7 — the device is already available in Black Onyx, but Black Onyx is somewhat of a matte finish. The so-called glossy black finish won’t be matte at all, but will instead by quite shiny, like the Jet Black offering on the iPhone 7. There is a drawback to that finish on the iPhone — it is very prone to scratches and dents.\nIt is also not known where the new finish will be available. It is certainly a possibility that the glossy black option will only be available in Samsung’s home country South Korea, however, it would be nice to see it available elsewhere. Considering Samsung has taken a similar approach by offering the Galaxy S7 Edge in Blue Coral and has released that variant around the globe, there is a precedent for a global release of the new glossy black Galaxy S7.\nAccording to the report from The Investor, since releasing the Coral Blue Galaxy S7 Edge on November 11, Samsung has been releasing an average of 15,000 units per day, so it is possible the company could achieve the same thing with the glossy black Galaxy S7.\nEverything you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Battle of the sevens: Apple iPhone 7 vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Rose gold is so 2015: Samsung’s pink gold Galaxy S7, S7 Edge are now available",

In fact, during a period stretching from 1998 to 2012, Apple’s vaunted design team, led dutifully by Jony Ive, managed to churn out a seemingly endless number of iconic products, including a wide range of iPods, industry leading notebooks, increasingly slick iMac models, and of course new iPhone models on a consistent basis.\nDON’T MISS: HTC just unveiled one of the best Android phones of 2016, but you can’t have one\nAll that said, it’s hard to ignore that it’s been a while since we’ve seen some thought-provoking new designs emanate out of Apple. Especially if we take a look at the iPhone, Apple’s primary revenue generator, the company has more or less kept the form factor unchanged since the iPhone 6, a device that was released all the way back in 2014. Meanwhile, Android handset makers have managed to churn out quite a few devices that, truth be told, look a lot more slick than Apple’s arguably stale iPhone design.\nNow comes word via Jason Snell, who recently appeared on John Gruber’s “The Talk Show” podcast, that Ive many not be as heavily involved in day to day design duties as he once was.\n“I’ve heard that he has lately been checked out or not as directly involved with product design and that he’s been largely focused on architecture,” Snell said. “Meaning the spaceship campus and the new stores. And that maybe the other top-level executive who’s been working the most with Ive is Angela Arhendts.” Ive of course is still in the mix at Apple but perhaps he’s now more interested in other design-related pursuits.\nInterestingly enough, Snell adds that Ive’s ability to effectively operate unchecked has led to some curious Apple design decisions, such as the hyper-expensive gold Apple Watch (since discontinued) and the company’s ill-fated car design initiative.\nThat said, it’s interesting to note that Apple just released a 400 page book highlighting Apple product designs stretching all the way back to 1998. The book, in effect, is practically an ode to Jony Ive who didn’t really rise to prominence until the original iMac was released in, surprise surprise, 1998. That said, Snell believes that the release of the book — which in and of itself was an unusual product to come out of Apple — perhaps signals Ive’s lessening interest in coming up with bold new designs, at least in the consumer electronics space.\nTo this point, Gruber speculates that Ive’s leadership within the design team at Apple may only be “spiritual” at this point.\nIncidentally, Jony Ive and fellow designer Marc Newson recently created an “immersive Christmass tree installation” in London.\nLooking ahead, all eyes will be on Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 design. Rumored to feature a curved OLED display, there’s no doubt that there’s a whole lot of pressure on Apple to release a fresh design to once again reinvigorate interest in the company’s iconic smartphone.\nTrending right now:\nT-Mobile has some of the best Black Friday deals we’ve seen How to get a NES Classic without spending $300 10 of the best Black Friday TV deals you can buy right now See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Reddit \nAccording to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities, the 2017 iPhone will add wireless charging for the first time. Instead of plugging in a cable, iPhone 8 owners will be able to charge their batteries using a conductive pad similar to how the Apple Watch charges . Although many Android phones support wireless charging with plastic and metal chassis, the report says Apple’s switch to a glass casing for iPhone 8 will enable wireless charging at fast speeds with minimum disruption from frequency interference. \nThe report says that Apple may not bundle a wireless charger with every model — it may be limited to the more expensive, higher-capacity SKUs — but expects Apple to adopt wireless charging aggressively through 2018. Plans are up in the air at this point, of course, but buyers of the low-end models may find they have to buy an additional accessory if they want to charge their phone wirelessly. \nKGI has previously said Apple intends to release three new iPhone devices in 2017 , two models that are more-iterative successors to the existing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , and one major new ‘bezel-less’ design with an OLED display that wraps around the edges and sides of the phone. All three models are expected to feature glass casings which suggests they all will incorporate wireless charging components. \nThe OLED display would technically be about 5.8-inches in size although the active touchscreen diagonal size would be circa 5.2-inches as some of the screen area is being used up on the sides of the product for aesthetic reasons. This iPhone is also expected to feature a Touch ID Home Button somehow integrated into the display itself, eliminating the bottom bezel ‘chin’. The OLED iPhone 8 continues to be described as ‘bezel-less’ but it is unclear how Apple will deal with the top bezel which currently features a speaker and FaceTime camera. \nThe KGI report says that Pegatron will be the sole supplier of the wireless charger as Foxconn is tied up managing the production of the ‘revolutionary’ OLED iPhone. It is not clear whether all iPhones will support wireless charging or whether all iPhones will be bundled with wireless chargers to do it. These may be sold as add-on accessories on some models. Wireless charging is certainly something the public have been asking for but it makes up just one element of the radical new OLED iPhone set to debut late in 2017. Guides",

      "text": "Apple users beware of this new bug and keep your smartphone safe! A newly found bug in the form of a malicious video has been discovered that can cause you iPhone to crash permanently\nThis video link has been first reported by EverythingApplePro, causes any iOS device, be it an iPhone, iPad, or an iPod touch, to completely freeze when opened in Safari. Reboot is the only way to get the back the device in working condition. Users of any iPhone model older than iPhone 7 will need to hold the Home and power button at the same time to reboot the system. iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus users need to long press the Home button and the volume down key simultaneously.\nThe link affects a vast range of iOS versions. Though EverythingApplePro claims that the virus issue does not affect the phone permanently and the device gets back to working mode once it is restarted. Still Apple users need to be careful about the bug intrusion into their expensive devices.\nWhen users tap the link, a 3-second MP4 video opens in Safari. The video link is said to be a corrupted one and can lead to memory leak. The actual problem starts after a few minutes when the phone gradually slows down. Apple is yet to release an update that can fix this malicious link issue.",

      "title": "Apple’s iPhone 8 May Feature An All Glass Case",
      "text": "Apple’s iPhone 8 May Feature An All Glass Case 12:09 pm By Roland Hutchinson \nPrevious rumors has suggested that the back of the new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus would be made of glass. \nNow according to a recent report, the whole casing off the iPhone 8 will apparently be made of glass, this is to support wireless charging on Apple’s new iPhone. \nThe news comes in a report from Ming-Chi Kuo from KGI Securities who has received information from Apple’s supply chain. \nWe believe one of the reasons why new iPhones will switch from metal casing to glass casing is to support wireless charging. In order to ensure a superior performance, we believe it is most appropriate for EMS suppliers to develop and make the wireless charger because then a comprehensive test can be conducted. As Hon Hai needs to deploy most resources to develop and produce OLED iPhone, we expect Pegatron will be the exclusive supplier of the wireless charger. \nAs well as the wireless charging, one model of Apple’s new iPhone 7 is expected to come with an OLED display. There will be two versions of the iPhone 8 Plus, one will have an LCD display the other an OLED display and the iPhone 8 is expected to feature an LCD display. \nApple are expected to launch their new iPhones around September of next year, so we can expect a number of rumors about the handsets before then.",

      "text": "It’s time to party like it’s 1999: Apple has patented a flip-phone.\nAdmittedly, the phone depicted in the patent, spotted by AppleInsider , is rather more advanced than 2004’s Motorola Razr. The patent envisages a phone with a flexible OLED screen on the front, designed to fold in the middle with a more conventionally hinged back, allowing the whole thing to fold in half for portability.\nPatents are not products, of course, and there’s every possibility that Apple may never ship anything using the idea. But it indicates a few potential changes in the company’s thinking.\nApple has yet to make much use of OLED screens. A newer display technology than the backlit LCDs that are used in every iPhone , iPad, Mac and iPod, OLED displays emit their own light without the need for a backlight.\nAs a result, OLED displays have darker blacks and bolder colours, as well as lower power consumption. The company has only used them in the Apple Watch so far, but OLED screens are widely expected to feature in 2017’s iPhone. \nThe patent was filed in July 2014, before the Apple Watch was announced, and what it depicts isn’t yet possible. While bendable or flexible OLED screens have hit trade shows , few shipping products have incorporated them, except for a few curved televisions and smartphones, and none have yet been demonstrated that can bend to the extreme degrees depicted in Apple’s patents.\niPhone 7 review: how good can a phone be if the battery doesn’t last even a day? \niPhone 7 Plus review: 2014 called – it wants its phablet back",

Add sausage and cook, breaking the sausage up with a spatula, until cooked through. \nIn a large bowl combine the vegetable and sausage mixture with the bread cubes and seasonings. Stir and add chicken broth until well moistened but not mushy. Taste and adjust seasonings. Add the apples and cranberries then stir in the egg until well blended. \nPat the dressing mixture into the prepared pan and cover tightly with foil. Bake for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and broil just until lightly browned. \nNote: If using as a turkey stuffing, stuff the turkey just before roasting. When the turkey is finished, remove all of the stuffing to a bowl to serve. \nMore Recipes",

      "title": "Trump tells Tim Cook directly he wants Apple to make products in the USA, promises tax incentives",
      "text": "Reddit \nPresident-elect Donald Trump promised during his campaign that he would ‘get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China’ – and he has now said the same thing directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook. He told the New York Times what he’d said. I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ \nCook reportedly responded with a brief and non-committal comment … [Cook] said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’ \nSuppliers said recently that the idea of Apple doing all or most of its manufacturing in the U.S. is impractical due to the lack of the required vocational skills – and wouldn’t in any case create jobs in the USA. U.S. electronics companies often outsource production, so they don’t always have full control over where their goods are made [and] some manufacturing jobs done in China with human labor could be lost to machines if production moves back to the U.S., economists warn. \nSurprisingly, cost is not a huge barrier – a recent analysis suggesting that US-made iPhones would cost only $30-40 more , a premium many might be willing to pay. \nApple was also cited in regard to another one of Trump’s campaign promises: the Chinese government stating that iPhone sales ‘ will suffer ‘ if the president-elect implements his threatened 45% tariffs on Chinese imports.

      "text": "\nApple's TV app gathers everything you watch on your iPhone and iPad, all in one place! Here's how it works.\nThe TV app is almost ready for the public launch. It is currently only available on the iPhone and iPad in the iOS 10.2 beta or tvOS 10.1 beta .\nApple's TV app is designed to be the one-stop shop for all of your TV and movie watching needs. It gathers your entertainment activities all in one place so you don't have to open 10 different apps when you are looking for something to watch.\nIf you have Apple TV, it will make your TV and movie watching experience a lot more convenient, but even if you don't have an Apple TV, you can still take advantage of the TV apps cool features on your iPhone or iPad. Here's how.\nHow to use the Library in the TV app for iPhone and iPad How to use Watch Now in the TV app for iPhone and iPad How to use the Store in the TV app for iPhone and iPad How to use Search in the TV app for iPhone and iPad \nHow to use the Library in the TV app for iPhone and iPad The TV app on the iPhone and iPad has a section dedicated to all of the movies and TV shows you've purchased on iTunes. You can browse content by movies or TV shows, recently purchased, and genres. When you are ready to watch something, select it and tap the Play button to start watching.\nIf you want to download it onto your device so you can watch it offline, tap the download button. You can then access it from the Downloaded section in the Library tab of the TV app. When you tap a downloaded movie or TV show, it will automatically open the Videos app and begin playing.\n\n\nHow to use Watch Now in the TV app for iPhone and iPad The Watch Now feature of the TV app is where all of the shows you currently watch are stored. If you start watching any show or movie from a service (like iTunes, Hulu, or CBS) that supports the TV app, it will appear in the Watch Now tab at the very top of the page. When you are watching a TV show and you've finished an episode, the next available one will appear in your list. Just tap the title you want to watch and it will open into the appropriate app.\nFor example, if you want to watch the Late Show with Stephen Colbert, tap an episode and it will automatically open in the CBS app and begin playing.\nIf you find content that you want to watch in a different format that what the TV app suggests, tap the More button next to the play button. It looks like an ellipsis (...). This feature will also allow you to navigate to apps that don't support the TV app, like Netflix.\n\n\nHow to use the Store in the TV app for iPhone and iPad If you find a TV show or movie that you want to see, but you don't have the app from the streaming service that supports it, you can get it from the App Store. The TV app has a Store section that spotlights all apps that currently support it.\nThere is a section for services that you can watch content from without needing a cable subscription and a section for services that give you direct access to your cable shows. When you find an app you want to add to your iPhone or iPad, tap Get to download and install it.\nI am a \"Cable cutter\" (though technically, that term isn't correct for me because I've never had cable). So, the Store is very useful to me. I can find apps that will allow me to watch TV shows and movies without the need for a cable subscription.\nWhen you launch an app that is supported in the TV app, you will be asked if you want to connect it to the TV app. Tap Continue to add it to the TV app. When you add a new app, additional content is added to the TV app, providing you with more suggestions for what to watch.\nThe Store tab also connects you to new and trending titles that you can purchase or rent from iTunes.\n\n\nHow to use Search in the TV app for iPhone and iPad Searching for content is the easiest way to find exactly what you want in the TV app. Tap the Search tab and then tap the text field. Enter the movie or TV show you are looking for and suggestions will populate. You can also use the Search tab to browse trending movies and TV shows if you want to jump right to the most popular stuff.\n\nAny Questions? Do you have any questions about using the TV app on the iPhone and iPad? Let me know in the comments and I'll help you out.\niOS \niOS 10 Review iOS 10 FAQ iOS 10 News Hub iOS help guide iOS Discussion ",

Macworld | Nov 23, 2016 4:47 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Adam Patrick Murray MacBook Pro review: The Touch Bar bridges the gap between iPad and Mac \nWith every release of a new iPhone powered by another cutting-edge processor designed by Apple, the rumbling grows. It’s amplified by the perception that the Mac is being delayed and hamstrung by the moves of the Mac’s chip supplier, Intel. It’s the theory that, one of these days, Apple is going to break from Intel and power its Macs with an Apple-designed processor related to the ones in the iPhone and iPad. \nIt’s a story with a certain amount of sense behind it. It seems like several Mac models have been delayed because Intel’s chips just weren’t ready in time, or weren’t ready in enough supply. The latest hubbub about the MacBook Pro being limited to 16GB of RAM is due Apple’s choice of a low-power Intel chipset that couldn’t handle more memory. \nAnd it’s true, the Mac is no stranger to a processor transition. It’s happened three times in the 32-year life of the Mac, so roughly once a decade. Switching it up \nThe first was from the Motorola 680x0 series processors that powered the Mac during its first decade of life. In March 1994, Apple switched to the new PowerPC processor architecture created by an alliance of Apple, IBM, and Motorola. Older code compiled for the 680x0 processor series ran in emulation on PowerPC chips. \nThe second was from PowerPC chips to Intel processors, a transition that was announced in mid–2005 and began in early 2006. Like the previous chip transition, Apple provided emulation technology–this time branded “Rosetta”–that would emulate PowerPC code on Intel Macs. \nThe Mac Pro was the last Mac to transition to Intel processors in 2006. \nOkay, so the 680x0 era lasted 10 years. The PowerPC era lasted 12 years. We’re now almost 11 years into the Intel era. All things being equal, the time seems right for a fourth processor transition, and soon. \nIt could definitely happen. I don’t want to say that it won’t , because Apple’s desire to chart its own course and not be beholden to other companies for key parts of its products is well known. Having proven itself a capable chip designer with the A series, Apple could very well dump Intel and strike out on its own. \nBut I don’t think Apple will. Reasons why Apple would \nBeyond simply establishing its independence from Intel, Apple might choose to move the Mac (or some Mac models) to ARM simply because the job of engineering the iPhone has made Apple very, very good at creating powerful, energy-efficient processors. Once you’ve got the skills to design such powerful processors yourself, it isn’t hard to imagine those same people turning their attention to the Mac. \nTwo-thirds of the Macs Apple sells are laptops. Laptops also need a balance of power and energy efficiency. Presumably an Mac laptop running an Apple-designed chip would follow a similar trajectory, allowing Apple to reduce the size of its battery so it could be even thinner and lighter than today’s models. Or, alternately, the size of today’s models but with more power and battery life. Reasons why Apple might not \nThere are lots of arguments against Apple making ARM-based Macs. None of them are deal-breakers, but they all accumulate to suggest that making a break from Intel chips would be a painful transition. \nIn the past decade, a lot of Mac users have become accustomed to the ability to run Windows in emulation, or use Boot Camp to boot into Windows. Developers can use Windows development environments on their Mac. Game players can reboot and play No Man’s Sky on their iMacs. This is a convenience that would go away should Apple leave Intel behind–or more accurately, it would be a return to a world where running Windows on a Mac was a slow, cumbersome emulated experience. Adam Patrick Murray \nEven an ARM Mac would need more ports than this. \nThe iPhone and iPad have a single data port: the Lightning port. Macs generally have more complexity. Unless Apple’s only ARM Mac ever was a new version of the MacBook–with its single USB-C port–Apple is going to have to integrate other connection types, including Thunderbolt 3. Right now Apple gets a lot of stuff for free by using Intel’s chipsets, but if it goes its own way it’s going to have to license those technologies and build them itself. \nThen there’s the compatibility slog. Older apps will need to be recompiled to run on ARM. Those apps with active developers will probably be fairly easily recompiled, but people use older apps, too. Apple could create an Intel emulator, a la Rosetta, to add compatibility–but at the cost of speed. The Mac has been through this twice before, and it could do it again if it needed to. The real reason it probably won’t \nIf the Mac (and the PC market overall) were a thriving, growing business that was a major part of Apple’s future direction, I would probably be ready to beat the drum for a forthcoming ARM transition. And yet… the Mac is less than 15 percent of Apple’s total business, and its sales are relatively flat in an overall PC market that’s contracting . \nI don’t mean to sound the alarm bell about the Mac–I think it’s got a good future ahead of it, and I’m one of those people who believes there will be a bunch of new Mac models in 2017, despite the empty year 2016 has been for the Mac. Apple \nApple probably shouldn't pull engineers off the top-selling iPhone to develop chips for the Mac. \nBut a processor transition is a major undertaking. It requires a huge engineering effort, both in terms of hardware and software. Mac speeds largely start where iPhone and iPad speeds end; Apple will have to push hard to add even more power to their chip designs to support the higher-end applications of the Mac. And every moment Apple’s chip designers are working on new custom Mac chips is a moment they’re not focused on the next generation of iPhone processors. \nThe Mac’s great strength is that, unlike iOS, it’s a mature platform with users who are comfortable using computers in the traditional mouse-and-keyboard context. Just as it doesn’t make sense for Apple to turn the Mac into something it’s not (like a tablet), it doesn’t make a lot of sense for Apple to force Mac users through a processor transition. The Mac is the platform of stability and “classic” computing interfaces; iOS is where all the change (and growth) happens. \nAnd that strikes at the heart of it: The Mac will continue to grow and evolve, but it will do so within some very specific constraints. Meanwhile, the iPhone drives the bulk of Apple’s revenues and will do so for the foreseeable future–and that’s Apple’s biggest priority. The Mac gets a lot of benefit from riding along with Intel’s chip developments for personal computers, and it saves Apple from having to divert its attention from iOS in order to invest more resources in a small portion of its business. \nNow, watch: Apple will announce an ARM-based MacBook in the spring of 2017. It’s not impossible, not at all. But I’d bet against it. Apple’s got too much riding on the growth and improvement of the iPhone to put its stable platform through an upheaval.

      "text": "| Analysis \nLast week Sal Soghoian announced his job as Apple’s Manager of Automation Technologies had been eliminated , and this week senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi says Apple intends to continue supporting scripting technologies on the Mac. That’s a little reassuring, although “intending to support” is a far cry from “committed to continue developing.” Apple’s commitment to Mac scripting and automation isn’t a sure thing \nMr. Soghoian joined Apple in 1997 as Product Manager of Automation Technologies where he pushed for always better scripting and automation tools for the Mac. Thanks to his efforts, AppleScript, Automator, and command line scripting tools have continued to be core parts of OS X and now macOS. \nWithout his efforts, AppleScript most likely would’ve been cut years ago, which makes it all the more likely the days of system-level Mac automation are numbered. Considering how critical automation tools such as AppleScript are to some professional workflows, that’s a pretty sobering thought. \nWith Mr. Soghoian on the outside now, one 9to5 Mac reader emailed Mr. Federighi to see what Apple plans to do with automation. He responded , \nWe have every intent to continue our support for the great automation technologies in macOS! \nThat sounds good, but it’s a safe bet Mr. Federighi chose his words very carefully. “Intent to support” says that Apple does plan to continue supporting scripting for now. How long that support will last is a mystery, and the wording implies Apple isn’t going to add any new features. \nWhat’s likely is that Apple will leave the current batch of scripting tools in place until they break. Odds are they won’t get any fixes, so scripting will quietly fade away as future macOS updates roll out. That gives everyone who’s reliant on system-level scripting some time to find alternate solutions, or convince Apple to continue supporting them in a meaningful way. \nYou can tell Apple you need ongoing Mac automation support through the Apple Feedback webpage , and you can let company CEO Tim Cook know how you feel on Twitter , too. Both are easy to do, and Apple seems more open to listening than it did in the past. \nStill, it’s looking more and more like Apple isn’t as invested as it once was in the pro market. The Mac Pro has languished since it shipped in December 2013, and Apple’s pro app offerings have been trimmed down to the Final Cut suite. The MacBook Pro went years without a significant update—and still tops out at 16GB RAM when many pros are asking for 32GB—and now the future of scripting is in question, too. \nMaybe I’m just being paranoid and reading too much into Mr. Federighi’s choice of words, but it’s really hard to take what he said as a firm commitment to the future of Mac scripting and automation.

      "title": "Unexpected iPhone 6s Shutdown? Get a Free Battery Replacement for Phones Made Sep. or Oct. 2015",
      "text": "  How-To \nIn light of unexpected iPhone 6s shutdown issues, Apple has since acknowledged that a “very small number” of iPhone 6s models have faulty batteries that need to be replaced . Apple was clear to state that this is not like the whole Samsung exploding battery thing and that this is not a safety issue. \nIf you think that your iPhone 6s is affected by the unexpected shutdown issue and needs a new battery, here’s what you need to do: Back up your iPhone to iTunes or iCloud. Sometimes, Apple will replace your phone entirely or wipe your phone. They can restore it right off the bat if you have it backed up to iCloud. Otherwise, you can restore it from your iTunes backup at home. If you haven’t done this in awhile, do it now—it could take some time. Turn off Find my iPhone . That way, people won’t think you’re on a barge to China or something when they ship your defective phone off to wherever to get it fixed. Erase all the data on your phone . You may or may not want to do this pre-emptively. If it turns out that they need to swap out your phone, you can ask the Apple Genius to do this for you. If you want to do it yourself, go to Settings à General à Reset à Erase all Content and Settings . You can always restore from your backup later. (You did back it up, right?) Visit one of the following locations with your phone: Apple Authorized Service Provider Apple Retail Store …or call Apple Technical Support, if there isn’t one of those nearby you \nOne other reminder : to access your battery, Apple will have to remove your screen. If your screen is cracked or damaged, they are probably going to require it to be fixed before doing the repair/replacement for you. They are going to say that this is because a damaged screen makes it hard for them to access the battery, but speaking from experience, what they usually do at the Apple Store is just hand you a new (probably refurbished, actually) device in the store instead of fixing your existing one on the spot. If you swap out a phone with a cracked screen and a shoddy battery and get a phone with a pristine screen and fixed battery, then you’re getting a free screen out of the deal. Apple has thought of that, though, so be prepared to pony up a couple hundred dollars for a screen repair if you’re going in to get a free battery replacement. \nPersonally, I have an iPhone 6s and I haven’t noticed unexpected shutdown issues. My phone did shut down when I got to 20% battery once, but it doesn’t happen often. \nWhen you go to the store, the Apple folks will pull up your serial number to determine if your phone was affected (i.e. was manufactured between September and October 2015). If anyone gets their phone replaced through this plan, I’d be interested in know what your serial number is. Maybe we can decipher it and save future readers a trip to the store. \nLet me know your thoughts and experiences in the comments below.  ",

      "text": "Joe Fedewa Nov 23rd, 2016 \nSamsung is once again looking to Apple for inspiration. Despite already launching a black Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge , they are rumored to be working on a “Glossy Black” version. We have our first real-life photos of the beauty. \nAt first glance, the “Glossy Black” doesn’t look much different than the Black Onyx that debuted on the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. There appear to be a couple of key differences. The frame that goes around the edges is black instead of silver. The original black S7 Edge got its color from underneath the glass panels ( as shown on the Note 5 ). However, the glossy version has shiny paint over the top of the glass. \nIs it a considerably different look? Not really. We expect Samsung to make the Glossy Black version available in the same markets that saw the Blue Coral color. Are you interested in this new color?",

      "text": "Buying a new Apple laptop isn't as simple as deciding between an Air or a Pro anymore.\nApple recently added three new MacBook Pros to its lineup, making the company's notebook selection more diverse than ever. There's the feature-packed new Pros, the still-worthwhile old Pros, the critic-favorite MacBook Air, and the ultra-portable 12-inch MacBook. Meanwhile, the iPad Pro is increasingly a worthy laptop replacement.\nSo which MacBook is right for you? Here's a breakdown of how Apple's laptops compare that can help you make a decision, whether you're buying for yourself or a loved one:\nMacBook Pro The MacBook Pro is generally a better choice for shoppers who plan to use their laptop for more than just basic word processing and web browsing. Professionals using processor-intensive software like Adobe Photoshop adbe or Final Cut Pro may need the snappier performance the Pro offers. No matter which Pro model you choose, you'll be getting a speedier processor, an option to add more memory (15-inch Pro models only come with the 16GB memory option, double that of the Air), and a sharper screen than the Air.\nApple aapl now offers several Pro laptops to choose from: the new Touch Bar-enabled version (starting at $1,799 for 13-inch , $2,399 for 15-inch ), a similar new Pro without the Touch Bar ( starting at $1,499 and only available in 13-inch), and last year's MacBook Pro ( starting at $1,299 for 13-inch, $1,999 for 15-inch.)\nChoosing Between the 2016 vs. 2015 MacBook Pro The previous MacBook Pro is a solid option for those looking to save some cash but also need more horsepower than the Air can provide. It's $200 cheaper than the new non-Touch Bar MacBook Pro, and offers a brilliantly sharp screen, great battery life, and plenty of power.\nStill, the 2016 edition is probably a better choice for most people, unless you're on a tight budget and really can't get by with an Air. Nearly everything on the new MacBook Pro has been at least slightly improved, with faster performance, a thinner and lighter body, a more colorful screen and larger touchpad. But most importantly, going with the 2016 model and its newer processor helps future-proof you, ensuring your laptop won't get outdated as quickly. That alone could be worth the extra $200.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nThere are other trade-offs to consider here as well. The new MacBook Pro without Touch Bar only comes with 2 USB-C ports, whereas the previous generation Pro includes two USB 3 ports, an SD card slot, an HDMI port, and a MagSafe charging slot. Translation? If you buy the new model, you'll also probably have to spend extra cash on adapters to keep using older, non-USB-C accessories, like external monitors, camera card readers and so on. (USB-C is quickly becoming the standard , but we're in the middle of a dongle-ridden transition period.)\nChoosing Between Touch Bar vs. Non-Touch Bar on the 2016 MacBook Pro The new MacBook Pro's biggest update is the Touch Bar , a touchscreen strip that sits just above the keyboard and replaces the standard function keys. The Touch Bar adds some convenience by displaying different buttons as you need them: If you're sending an email through Apple's Mail app, the Touch Bar may show keys for formatting text or transferring messages to folders. But when you're watching a video in Safari, it may include a slider for scrubbing through footage. The Touch Bar-enabled MacBook also has a faster processor, but the difference may not be noticeable enough to influence a buying decision.\n\nThe Touch Bar is an intriguing concept that's occasionally helpful, but for most people, it's not enough to justify spending an extra $300. A far more useful addition is the Touch ID sensor embedded in the power button, which makes it possible to quickly log into your account, switch between user accounts, and shop with Apple Pay in Safari. Still, $300 is a steep cost for features that are more convenient than necessary, but if you're intrigued by the Touch Bar, the boosted specs could make that cost worthwhile.\nIt's also worth noting that if you want a 2016 MacBook Pro in the 15-inch size, which includes more powerful graphics and a bigger trackpad, you'll have to opt for the Touch Bar version. The only other 15-inch MacBook Pro option is last year's model.\nMacBook Air The MacBook Air, starting at $999 and only available new in a 13-inch size, is now the cheapest option in Apple's laptop lineup. With its long battery life, lightweight design, and solid performance, it's still the best option for most people. But the question is: For how long will that be true? During Apple's most recent Mac event, the company gave no indication that it plans to update the Air any further. Buying the Air may make sense now, but if Apple doesn't upgrade it soon, that advice may change.\nThere are a few other drawbacks to consider about the MacBook Air. Most notably, its screen isn't nearly as sharp as that on the MacBook Pro or 12-inch MacBook models. It also doesn't include the improvements Apple has added to its more modern laptops, like the Force Touch trackpad and flatter keyboard (although the Air's older keyboard is fantastic, perhaps even better.) The Air offers more variety than Apple's newer notebooks in terms of ports (two USB 3, one Thunderbolt 2, and an SD card slot), which means most buyers won't need to purchase extra dongles to use multiple peripherals or charge their phone while using an accessory. But it doesn't include any USB-C ports, a factor that may limit its usefulness in the future.\n\nFor the price, the MacBook Air still offers enough computing prowess to meet basic needs without getting overwhelmed. Those seeking an ultralight laptop primarily for browsing the web, word processing, viewing photos, and streaming media will be satisfied with the Air. Its light weight and long-lasting battery make it particularly great for frequent travelers. All told, the MacBook Air is best for buyers in search of an Apple laptop with more power than the 12-inch MacBook that won't cost as much as a Pro.\nMacBook (12-inch) Apple's 12-inch MacBook is its most portable and slimmest laptop, but it's also very expensive for the level of performance it provides, starting at $1,299 . Unlike Apple's other laptops, the MacBook runs on one of Intel's less powerful Core M intc processors, rather than its Core I lineup. These processors are designed to generate less heat, helping companies like Apple and others make extremely thin and light fan-less computers. This advantage is especially evident in the 12-inch MacBook, which is elegantly designed and highly portable. Carrying around the notebook, which weighs just over two pounds, feels more like toting around an iPad. It also includes a gorgeous screen as well as Apple's new butterfly mechanism keyboard and Force Touch trackpad, similar to those on the latest MacBook Pro models.\n\nWith its less powerful processor, Apple's 12-inch MacBook is mainly targeted at casual computer users looking for a highly portable laptop for browsing the web, working on documents and so on. But the Air is a better choice for most people. It's cheaper, more powerful, and offers longer battery life than its 12-inch cousin. Plus, the 12-inch MacBook only comes with one USB-C port, which can be a nightmare if you have lots of accessories. Unless you truly need a lightweight laptop with an ultra-crisp display that's smaller than the 13-inch MacBook Air, the 12-inch model isn't the best value.\nWhat About iPads? If portability and screen resolution are important to you, it's worth your time to consider Apple's iPad Pro as well. The smaller and more manageable 9.7-inch size starts at $599 , and Apple sells its keyboard case separately for $149. That means for $850 -- roughly $450 cheaper than the entry level 12-inch MacBook -- you can get a 128GB 9.7-inch iPad Pro with Apple's keyboard case.\nFor more, read: Here Are the Best Black Friday Deals for Tech ; Here Are the Best Cyber Monday Deals for Tech ; This Carrier Is Bringing Back Its Free iPhone 7 Deal for Black Friday ; Apple Is Holding a Black Friday Shopping Event \nThere are major differences to consider, though. Most notably, the iPad Pro runs on iOS rather than macOS, so you're not getting a full desktop experience. Nor does the iPad Pro include any ports other than its Lightning charging slot and a headphone jack. Its official keyboard accessory, meanwhile, isn't as sturdy as the keyboards on Apple's laptops. But it may be worth a look if you want something more affordable that's easy to carry around for jotting down notes, watching Netflix and doing some light photo or video editing.\nShop : New Macbook Pro with Touch Bar-enabled version : starts at $1,799 for 13-inch , $2,399 for 15-inch \nNew Macbook Pro without the Touch Bar: starts at $1,499 and only available in 13-inch\nLast year's MacBook Pro: starts at $1,299 for 13-inch, $1,999 for 15-inch\nNew MacBook Air: starts at $999 and only available in 13-inch\nApple's 12-inch MacBook: starts at $1,299 \niPad Pro: starts at $599 \nThis article originally appeared on Time.com.
