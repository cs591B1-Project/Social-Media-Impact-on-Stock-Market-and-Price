      "text": "0 17 \nDirector David O. Russell certainly works well with Robert DeNiro. They had a big success with “Silver Linings Playbook,” and DeNiro was just great playing Jennifer Lawrence’s father in “Joy.” \nNow Russell and DeNiro are reportedly teaming up again for a limited TV series for Amazon, produced by The Weinstein Company. Another Oscar winner, Julianne Moore, is set to co-star. \nThe word is that Russell’s come up with a modern Mafia tale, perhaps set in the 1990s. Coming from Russell, it won’t be “The Sopranos,” but maybe something with a more comic touch. We’ll see. \nDeNiro is said to be getting $850,000 per episode, for 20 segments. If so, this series will be incredibly expensive. Good for him– his last movie with The Weinstein Company, “Hands of Stone,” earned $4.7 million this summer despite very good reviews. But all the movement now is toward the smaller screen and TV platforms, where the audience is waiting for him. \nTWC, meantime, is also moving in that direction. They recently announced another Amazon deal with “Mad Men” creator Matthew Weiner. Share this:",

      "title": "An Amazon Fire Stick-like music streaming device has launched in the UK",
      "text": "Sony is developing an AI that can create new music from existing songs \nl This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \" Digital Media Briefing \" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nStreaming music startup Electric Jukebox has launched a device similar to an Amazon Fire Stick that plugs into a TV’s HDMI port. \nThe device, named after its parent company, costs £169 ($187), and the price includes a 12-month subscription to the company's music streaming service. \nAfter the first year, Electric Jukebox listeners are switched to an ad-supported version of the service, or they can opt to pay £52 ($57) per year to maintain it in full. The service also comes with a voice-control enabled remote control that can access a 29 million song library. It seems that music services are going after the nearly 90% of UK adults who do not subscribe to any music streaming products. \nStreaming subscriptions may be too expensive for many UK listeners, according to a recent survey conducted by Zuora and YouGov. Only 10%, or 5.2 million, of consumers in the UK subscribe to digital streaming services, like Spotify and Apple Music. The survey suggests that music streaming services should experiment with pricing tiers to attract subscribers, as 48% of those surveyed think on-demand streaming is too costly. The average subscriber pays £7.07 ($7.70) per month for a music streaming subscription. While the initial financial outlay for Electric Jukebox is high, users will pay around £4 ($4.40) per month after their first year. Competitors like Spotify and Apple Music charge £10 ($11.01) per month. Lack of smartphone and offline playback are major feature omissions . Subscribers have to use the new service with a TV or HDMI-enabled device, and Electric Jukebox is making a major bet on the living room. Consumers may want to spend the extra cash to get music subscriptions on all devices, not just their TVs or other devices with an HDMI port. \nCompetitors are investing in UK music services. Apple has reportedly hired 16 employees from subscription service Omnifone, which was created by Electric Jukebox founder Rob Lewis, and filed for bankruptcy this summer, according to TechCrunch. \nIn addition, Apple is scooping up some of Omnifone’s technology, which could include around 50 patents. Although UK consumers have so far been unimpressed by the subscription services on the table, competition is heating up as various music streaming players look to bring the winning offering to market. \nJessica Smith, research analyst for BI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on streaming media devices that sizes up this market by device category and takes a more granular dive into each. \nThe report includes new shipments forecasts, identifies major players, and assesses the advantages and weaknesses of each device category. It also examines how usage and ownership may vary among device categories and the implications of this upswing on various ancillary markets, like advertising and app development. \nDigital TV Research, BI Intelligence Estimates \nHere are some key takeaways from the report: Streaming media device adoption is rising fast as over-the-top (OTT) streaming video services — such as Netflix and HBO NOW — make it easier than ever to ditch traditional pay-TV. We expect global shipments of streaming media devices to grow at a 10% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), from 240 million in 2016 to 382 million in 2021. Over the next few years, we expect the market for streaming media devices to grow and consolidate. In the long term, newer technologies like virtual reality will become a leading connected device segment. However, in the next five years, smart TVs, gaming consoles, and media streamers will remain the top categories by a wide margin. Smart TVs currently dominate shipments, accounting for three-quarters of device shipments in 2015. As people upgrade their TVs, the global installed base of smart TVs will grow from 584 million in 2016 to 896 million in 2021. As streaming media device uptake rises, stakeholders throughout the larger media ecosystem will need to adapt to consumers' changing habits. Legacy TV providers will likely need to offer skinny bundles or their own OTT subscriptions to stay relevant, while advertisers will want to capitalize on the opportunities available in targeting streaming viewers using demographic and behavioral data. App developers, platform creators, and game makers will also have a stake in where and how streaming activity develops. \nIn full, the report: Identifies the major device categories in the streaming media market. Sizes up the current reach and shipments forecast for each device category. Compares and contrasts the benefits and downsides of each device category within the greater streaming media ecosystem. Examines the major players in each device category. Assesses the gap between streaming media device installed base and usage. Explores how this growing market is impacting other industries in its peripherals. \nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide to the streaming media device universe, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT \nThe choice is yours.

      "text": "November 9, 2016 , 4:20 PM Amazon Prime already shops for your groceries and delivers beauty products , but soon, it may contribute to another slice of the chore wheel. According to Engadget , the tech company is trying its hand at keeping house.Job postings in the Seattle area, first spotted by The Seattle Times , requested \"home assistants\" for the company, which is based there. The newspaper says that according to the postings, the position entails “tidying up around the home, laundry, and helping put groceries and essentials like toilet paper and paper towels away.” If Amazon Prime does add this to its many services, it would resemble apps like TaskRabbit , which lets you hire Taskers to help you tackle your chores. Seeing as there have only been two job postings, it's not likely Amazon Prime will be folding your laundry in the very near future. But in a year or two, the service might streamline your week even more than it already does. Dishes? Amazon's got them. Dry cleaning? The drone will pick it up. Bathing? Actually, erm, you should still handle that one.We have reached out to Amazon for comment and will update this story when we hear back. Advertisement",

This block set is the right size for making towers and other structures, and the blocks are a perfect fit for small hands. Best of all, they cost less than $15! Check Amazon rating » Amazon.com Buy from Amazon \nActive toys are always a good choice for toddlers, and this cool balance bike is one that can grow a bit with a toddler, for several years of use. The Skuut Balance Bike has no pedals - toddlers just push along with their legs, which makes it easier for little ones to get the hang of. The bike is lightweight and easy for toddlers to maneuver. Once they've mastered walking along with the bike, they can run with it, too. According to the manufacturer, kids who develop good balance with a bike like this will never need a bike with training wheels. Check Amazon rating » Discovery Toys 5. Discovery Toys Castle Marbleworks \nThis cool toy from Discovery Toys combines a building set with a toddler-friendly marble track. Once the castle pieces are fitted together, you can drop the jingling balls from the top and watch them wind their way around the curves and loops to the bottom of the castle, where they hide inside for a moment before popping out of the drawbridge on the front. This game can be easily be shared by more than one toddler, or kids of different ages. \nOrder through your local Discovery Toys consultant or via the company's online shop.

A silly alien friend is also included with the set, as is a cute spotted dog and a little wheeled vehicle for expeditions away from the rocket. What rocket would be complete without a countdown sequence? Toddlers will enjoy counting down along with the rocket and launching new space adventures.

This set has a base that can be used on the fridge or elsewhere, and individual magnetic letters that fit inside the base one at a time. When the letter piece is in the base, a voice sings a song that tells the name of the letter and the sound it makes. Toddlers love putting the various letters into the base and hearing the music, and this is a great way for parents to start teaching the child the letters that make up his or her name.

      "text": "According to inside sources, Hollywood veteran, Robert De Niro is set to earn big bucks for his part in a new series. The prolific actor is reportedly set to pocket $850K per episode of a new Television show which Amazon purchased for $160million according to Variety. Details about the show's plot haven't been released yet but it is rumoured to be a mafia crime series consisting of eight episodes per season. Amazon's $160million purchase gives it the right to serialise the show for two seasons. Julianne Moore is another Hollywood heavyweight who will star in the series but her wage packet has not been disclosed. \nThis post first appeared on Linda Ikeji's Blog. Read the original story here.

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn The Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new high today as it builds on its rally following Donald Trump’s victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election . The same can’t be said for the Nasdaq Composite or S&P 500 .\nGetty Images The S&P 500 has fallen 0.4% to 2,155.43 at 11:09 a.m. today, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 67.39 points, or 0.4%, to 18,657.08, above its all-time closing high of 18,636.05. The Nasdaq Composite has tumbled 1.4% to 5,177.57 as big tech stocks like Facebook ( FB ), Amazon.com ( AMZN ), Alphabet ( GOOGL ), Netflix ( NFLX ), and Apple ( APPL ) have dropped 3% or more today.\nInstinet’s Frank Cappelleri marvels at the market’s recent strength:\nThe SPX logged its second 1% rally in three days on Wednesday and rose for the third straight session. Now just imagine if that was the whole story…\nWe brought up some similarities to Brexit yesterday – the most salient being that the futures decline stopped just shy of 6% both then and yesterday. But Wednesday’s reversal was stronger early on, and it lasted all session long. The Brexit positive reversal didn’t fully take hold until two days later. With the S&P 500 up again early on Thursday, it appears this turnaround is indeed a step ahead of the game.\nOverall, the three day move is now +3.74% (through Wednesday). As noted in yesterday’s mid-day piece, this is only the third time in 2016 that the S&P 500 has registered a move greater than 3.5% over three trading sessions. The prior two occasions marked key trading lows (in February and June), which led to even more upside in the weeks that followed.\nYesterday’s advance finally allowed the S&P 500 to puncture that formerly pesky downtrend line drawn from the August highs, as well. And just like that, we’re less than 2% from those highs…\nThe discussion is endless… The bottom line is that we’re witnessing history in a multitude of ways this week. The market seems to have the backing to test its highs again soon…It also has the blue print of taking advantage of large three day moves near support… and positive seasonality.\nRhino Trading’s Michael Block isn’t buying it:\nI am keeping the faith and I am hopeful that Trump is good news for the markets and for the world in general. But this market swing seems like too much too soon. The transition is taking form, and in terms of trade, we are one irrational protectionist comment from Team Trump away from a violent reversal there. He campaigned and won on protectionism. Bringing jobs back. Does anyone remember this? Well and good but thanks to eight years of mollycoddling, our frenemies abroad won’t just sit back and take one sided protectionism from us lying down. This isn’t the WWE where Trump beats McMahon because that’s what’s in the script. There is no script here.\nAlong those lines, markets are assuming a united GOP here. But there WILL be deficit hawks pushing back on all the spending being anticipated. I think it all works but it’s not going to be a linear process. I see bond yields going wider and that has consequences. Of course, if growth doesn’t go back to what everyone seems to be hoping here, yields will come back in and the curve will flatten again. I also say that the Fed is too scared to do anything next month. Political uncertainty is going to be used as the rationale for “waiting for more evidence.” Write it down. That means lower for longer is alive and well and that means bonds look good.\nIn the face of what’s being called a “Trump Tantrum,” that’s being a contrarian.",

      "text": "Amazon Echo Dot \nIf you’ve dreamt of being woken up by Jeremy Clarkson, preferably when he’s joined by Richard Hammond and James May, then your wish is about to come true; but only if you’re the proud owner of Amazon’s Echo or Echo Dot wireless speaker and smart home device. The wake up call comes as a special alarm tone created in the name of promotion for the forthcoming show The Grand Tour , starring the trio, and exclusive to Amazon Prime. Prepare for shouting, it’s a #TheGrandTour alarm tone for your Amazon Echo, with @JeremyClarkson , @RichardHammond , and @MrJamesMay . pic.twitter.com/1K6rPQ2kDP \n— Andy Boxall (@AndyBoxall) November 11, 2016 \nThe alarm is found inside the Alexa app, under a new category named Celebrity, and is a specially recorded alarm featuring all three of the former Top Gear presenters. It’s as you’d expect it to be. Hammond is the straight man trying to keep order, May instantly goes off on a tangent, and Clarkson gets the job done — with all the subtlety of his beloved hammer. \nMore: Go here to watch the latest trailer for The Grand Tour \nAmazon’s use of Echo, and the Alexa voice assistant, to promote The Grand Tour doesn’t stop with the alarm tone. Take some time to ask Alexa about her opinions regarding the team, because the responses are rather fun. According to Alexa, Clarkson spends his time asking her to insult Hammond and May, and she questions why James May drives so slowly. Most amusingly of all, Alexa says she really enjoyed Hammond’s performance in The Muppet Babies . \nInterestingly, this may not be the only special alarm Amazon Echo owners will get to enjoy, seeing as The Grand Tour alarm tone is inside its own Celebrity category. Perhaps stars of other, popular Amazon shows will record their own in the future. We can see many being keen to have a Mr. Robot tone, for example. To find the tone, open the Alexa app on your phone, then go to Timers and Alarms , and tap Celebrity . \nThe first episode of The Grand Tour will be shown on November 18 and only for Amazon Prime subscribers. It’s a 12-episode run, which will be streamed weekly. Amazon has a three series deal with the three presenters, after they left the BBC following a row over a bust-up with a Top Gear producer .

      "text": "Flip \nIn two years, Amazon has sold over 4 million units of its smart speaker, Ech o. The Echo is powered by Alexa , Amazon’s artificial intelligence voice technology service capable of ordering users an Uber or controlling other smart devices via “skills.” Since Echo’s launch in November 2014, Alexa has added over 1,000 new skills from its original 14 (more than a seven-fold increase) from third-party developers, partners, and publishers including Patron, Bloomberg, and Fitbit enabling its users to track workouts, receive news briefs, and receive answers from search queries. \nGoogle was not pleased. As the ubiquitous search engine, Google launched its smart speaker contender “Google Home” on November 4, 2016 at $129 significantly undercutting Echo’s $180 (though Amazon has begun more aggressive pricing tactics ) to ensure market dominance of all search and discovery processes across devices. \nAt present, Echo (including its extendable option, Echo Dot, and transactions made from these smart speakers), has netted Amazon over $1.3B in revenue (nearly a 2.5X increase from 2015) and is slated to reach $11B in the next four years. According to R&R Market Research, sales of smart speakers will increase nearly 40% in the next four years driven largely by smart home technology. As is the case with most new tech devices and services, data privacy is becoming a concern and remains an issue with both Google and Amazon’s offerings. \nHardware and services aside, Google and Amazon’s smart speakers may differ most in their mobile apps, Amazon Alexa vs. the Google Home app (previously the Google Cast app). As the former name suggests, Google’s app is built to integrate with Chromecast (an additional $35) to allow the user to stream entertainment controlled by Google’s smart speaker to connected devices. For a further breakdown of Google and Amazon’s latest smart speakers (across major specs, voice control, sound and music, and much more), see the following infographic from influencer marketing company, Mediakix : Google Home vs. Amazon Echo",

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\nAmazon\nAmazon's Alexa has had a voice since it launched with the Amazon Echo last year. But now it has a face. Sort of.\nThe Nucleus is a non-Amazon-branded product; it's a video intercom meant to take the frustration and fear out of video calling.\nBut, through a partnership with Amazon, it has Alexa baked into it, making the product way more interesting.\nThe Nucleus is a video intercom first and foremost, though. Nucleus sent over a few units for me to test, and overall I'm impressed.\nIt has a 7-inch screen with a resolution of 1280 x 800 — pretty much the Amazon Fire tablet HD's screen — that looks pretty good. The camera, which has a built in shutter is 5mp, which in my experience produced solid results when video calling.\nThis is an always-connected device, and it can connect to the internet through either Wi-Fi or Ethernet, and comes with all the pieces needed to set it on a table or mount it to a wall.\nBest of all, it looks pretty nice. For a first-generation product, it stands out in a \"hey, what's that?\" sort of way, which in this case is a good thing.\nSetting the Nucleus up was a surprisingly simple process. I plugged its single power cable into a power brick and was off to the races. I was guided, through clear, simple-to-understand language, through an automatic software update, and was asked to create a Nucleus account.\nThis is technology meant for the layperson, and it's clear the creators took time to make setup pretty seamless.\nAmazon\nThe final part of the setup process is entering your Amazon credentials. It's optional, but that's what enables the Nucleus to function as an Alexa device. I'd only ever set up one of those, the Echo, and I'm impressed that once I logged in, the Nucleus was able to control all of my smart-home devices. It's every bit an Echo as the Amazon-branded hardware. And it was weird saying \"Alexa, turn off the bedroom lights\" and having both products say \"Ok\" in unison.\nTo be clear, the Nucleus can do anything any Echo product does, which is a major value add given it's supposed to be in multiple parts of your house.\nOnce I was all set up I took the product for a spin. Since this is effectively an always-connected camera, Nucleus has taken privacy seriously. There's a \"do not disturb mode\" where you won't receive calls, a \"privacy mode\" that lets you screen and accept an incoming call, and a physical shutter.\nIf you disable all of those, calls will automatically connect, which is fine for a call to grandma, but can be less than ideal depending on where your Nucleus lives.\nSince I was sent multiple units, I lent one to a less tech-literate friend. He got through the setup process just as quickly as I did, but there was one hitch I think Nucleus should clean up with a software update. You can connect multiple Nucleus devices that live locally or remotely, but the process is a pain point.\nYou have to drill into the settings, and send an E-mail with a special code to the person you want to connect with. It would be far more simple to have an \"add friend\" button on the home screen, with that code which you can text or read off to your family member or friend over the phone.\nAmazon\nOnce connected, though, I tried a video call and it went really well. I could close the shutter without ending the call, and the privacy settings worked. The video quality wasn't full-HD, but both of us were on a Wi-Fi connection in relatively dim parts of our apartments, so any camera would have struggled. Still, the connection was excellent, only a couple of words were dropped in a 10-minute conversation.\nAlthough many of us have Skype or FaceTime compatible devices in our pockets of all times, it was oddly satisfying to video call someone on a dedicated device. My friend called it \"Jetsons-like,\" and I agree. The process of adding other Nucleus devices could be a little easier, but there's no denying the utility and \"cool\" factor here.\nThe Nucleus can function as a smart-home hub and a portal to an older, or less tech-literate relative, and it plays both roles very well.\nNucleus 2 Pack, $398, available at Amazon\nNucleus 3 Pack, $597, available at Amazon\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.

      "text": "Amazon \nThe novel and the satire were born at the same time in this series of misadventures befalling the romance-besotted mad knight errant and his sane sidekick. The nested stories are very much rooted in post-medieval Spain, but the pratfalls are timeless; self-delusion knows no cultural barriers. Bleak House, by Charles Dickens (1853, 960 pp.) Amazon \nThe great English novelist, here at his most grown-up, doesn’t do lawyers any favors. Following the money, he uses a single lawsuit over a dwindling inheritance to expose society’s role. But this is still Dickens: funny, heartfelt, and redemptive. War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy (1869, 1,296 pp.) Amazon \nOn top of everything else the Russian master accomplished in this historical novel about the Napoleonic era in Russia, he really nailed the title. By shifting focus from the battlefield to the home front and back, he captured the total effect of war on armies and aristocrats, husbands and wives. Middlemarch, by George Eliot (1872, 880 pp.) \nEliot was a world-builder in the classic sense; her fictional Middlemarch is an English town like many others, exemplary of bourgeois mores and the site of many parallel plots. The epic is made ordinary, and vice versa. The Brothers Karamazov, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1880, 824 pp.) Amazon \nEurope’s original existentialist might have gone darker in Crime and Punishment , but he captures a larger universe here, from the portrait of a family whose members achieve Christly heights and Trumpian lows to cerebral set pieces that would blow most novellas out of the water. In Search of Lost Time, by Marcel Proust (1913–1927, 4,215 pp.) Amazon \nIt isn’t cheating to say that Proust’s series is really a novel. Even more than a few others here, this is a unified work — gorgeously written, recursive but not repetitive, and profound even when chronicling the shallowest of socialites. Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia, by Rebecca West (1941, 1,181 pp.) Amazon \nInterest in West’s book, a category-killer in several categories (travel book, cultural history, memoir), revived during the Balkan wars in the '90s — which is appropriate for a book written on the eve of Nazi invasion. But as a wholly engrossing, never-flagging work of poetic journalism, it’s always worth reading. The Man Without Qualities, by Robert Musil (1943, 1,744 pp.) Amazon \nIf Musil’s colossus of philosophical and social fiction seems to peter out, that’s because he never finished it. But dissipation of the novel, whose title character is a reflective blank, mirrors the decadence of Viennese society around World War I — prosperous, rule-bound, beautiful, and doomed. The Lord of the Rings, by J. R. R. Tolkien (1955, 1,178 pp.) Amazon \nThe trilogy is available in single volumes and best read that way. The pioneer of modern fantasy was also its perfecter, because he knew what it meant to create a universe. A professional linguist, Tolkien didn’t just invent; he used everything he’d learned and made it new. Life and Fate, by Vasily Grossman (1959, 896 pp.) Amazon \nThough often compared to War and Peace , the long-suppressed World War II novel has more in common with war journalism, which Grossman practiced as a Soviet reporter on the front. He emerged from bloody battle with both a great story and a sly critique of the century’s two great monsters — Hitler and the one at home. The Power Broker, by Robert Caro (1974, 1,336 pp.) \nBefore he embarked on his multivolume biography of Lyndon B. Johnson, Caro wrought justice on Robert Moses, cementing the uber-bureaucrat’s reputation as a destroyer of New York’s urban fabric in a masterpiece of very longform adversarial journalism. Shogun, by James Clavell (1975, 1,192 pp.) \nA triumph of research and plot over character and subtlety, Clavell’s historical novel about an Englishmen who goes native with the first Japanese shogun is the first among equals of the James Michener era of middlebrow informational epics. Canopus in Argos: Archives, by Doris Lessing (1979–1984, 1,228 pp.) Amazon \nThis may the deepest dive into sci-fi (Lessing called it “space fiction”) that any Nobel Prize–winner has ever attempted — five linked novels telling the universe’s secret history in the stories of interrelated planet-civilizations. Come for the fiction, not the science. The Stand, by Stephen King (1978/1990, 823/1,152 pp.) Amazon \nThe original edition of King’s apocalyptic moral fable and the “Complete and Uncut” updated version both have their partisans. Good and evil are complicated but simply drawn, as in his more typical horror fiction. But given the space, King excels at texture. Which is to say, if you’re in for 800 pages, you might as well go uncut. The Pillars of the Earth, by Ken Follett (1989, 816 pp.) Amazon \nLike Lessing and King, suspense writer Follett went for broke in a genre new to him. Like the groundbreaking (and fictional) Gothic cathedral that rises in the course of his 12th-century-British historical work, the best seller soars, sprawls, and brims with humanity’s gargoyles. The Hunchback of Notre Dame, by Victor Hugo (1833, 940 pp.)",

      "text": "Amazon Kindles are great gifts for kids. (Photo: Amazon)\nWe’ve scoured the web to find you the best deals on good products. While Reviewed.com may receive a small share of the revenue from your purchase, editorial opinions are independent from any business sales.\nStarting today and extending through Cyber Monday (or until supplies last), Amazon is offering discounts on some of its devices through the certified refurbished store . Inside you'll find deals on the Amazon Echo, three versions of the Fire TV, and Kindle e-readers.\nIf you don't mind the refurbished tag, this is the lowest price we've seen on the Echo so now's the time to snag one up. Especially as the list of compatible devices continues to grow every day. For a voice controlled hub for all of your smart home needs, it's hard to beat the extensiveness the Echo and Alexa, the Amazon voice-assistant, offers.\nAs far as the Fire TVs go, there's a reason they're some of our top pick for the best streaming devices out there—especially if you're an Amazon Prime member (or want to be ). And the Kindles? Well, there's a reason e-reader is basically synonymous with Kindle. We'll leave it at that.\nThese are only a small sample of the deals Amazon has been promoting for its countdown to Black Friday event . Until the big day hits after Thanksgiving, Amazon will continue to roll out new deals throughout the day every day.\nSmart Home\nAmazon Echo (Certified Refurbished) ( $119.99, SAVE $51 ) Home Theater\nFire TV 1st Gen. (Certified Refurbished) ( $49.99, SAVE $44.01 ) Fire TV Stick, 1st Gen. (Certified Refurbished) ( $24.99, SAVE $10 ) Fire TV w/ Alexa Voice Remote (Certified Refurbished) ( $64.99, SAVE $25 ) Amazon Kindle E-reader\nKindle Paperwhite (Certified Refurbished) ( $79.99, SAVE $29.01 ) Kindle Voyage (Certified Refurbished) ( $119.99, SAVE 49.01 ) Kindle for Kids Bundle ( $99.99, SAVE $24.99 ) Kindle Accessory Bundles\nKindle Essentials Bundle ( $114.97, SAVE $15 ) Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle ( $159.97, SAVE $20 ) Kindle Voyage Essentials Bundle ( $254.97, SAVE $25 ) USA TODAY\nThe best Black Friday deals on Amazon right now",

      "text": "\nAccessorize your Echo Dot to fit the decor of every room in your house!\nThe Amazon Echo Dot allows you to access the power of Amazon's voice-controlled A.I. assistant Alexa from wherever you are in the room, with all that tech crammed into a package about the size of a hockey puck. And if you end up opting for the black color option, it'll really look like there's a hockey puck sitting on your end table. Or your kitchen counter. Or wherever you end up placing them around your house. \nAmazon offered the bare minimum of color options — white or black — which is pretty standard for tech products, but not ideal for a product that ideally will fully integrate into the decor of different rooms in your house. You want something with some texture and muted colors to blend in, rather than stand out.\n\nThat's why you definitely need to check out these sweet cases for the second generation of the Amazon Echo Dot. There are two material styles to choose between — leather and fabric — and each have their own aesthetic charm, with unique colors options. The leather options would definitely pair well if you've got a leather couch in your living room or den, while the fabric options — available in Charcoal, Indigo, and Sandstone — adds some much needed texture over the smooth plastic housing.\nThe cases have vents and cutouts so the speakers won't be muffled at all when installed. To install, simply line up the USB and headphone jack on the Echo Dot with the corresponding cutouts in the case and you're good to go!\nThe Echo Dot is affordably priced at $50, meaning you'll probably end up buying a few to create a network throughout your house. And the cases are also reasonably priced at $15 for the fabric ones, and $20 for the slightly classier leather options. All told, you can buy a more fashionable Echo Dot for $70 or less — still a steal compared to, say, Google Home .\nSee at Amazon \n",

      "text": "UK music fans can now subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited UK music fans can now subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited Posted: Tags : Amazon - Amazon + Amazon is a company of many different ventures. While they may be most well-known for their online shopping site and free 2-day shipping with their Prime subscription service, that's far from the only thing that the company has its hands in. The Fire tablets, Kindle e-readers, Alexa voice assistant, and solid cloud storage via Amazon Drive are just a few of the other services that the company has to offer, and just about a month ago the company took the wraps off of yet another program - Amazon Music Unlimited. Amazon Music Unlimited is the company's answer to the likes of Google Play Music, Spotify, Apple Music, etc., and it does look like a really solid option - especially if you're a loyal Amazon customer or user of their own hardware. The service allows you to listen to millions of songs without any sort of advertisements or streaming limits, and starting today, music fans in the United Kingdom can now subscribe to it. There are multiple tiers to subscribe to, and they work out as follows - £3.99/month - Access to Amazon Music Unlimited on one single Echo device. £7.99/month - Access to Amazon Music Unlimited on numerous gadgets, including phones, tablets, Echo devices, etc. Alternatively, you can also pay £79.99/year for the same plan, but you'll be looking at an annual savings of £15.98. £9.99/month - Access to Amazon Music Unlimited on multiple gadgets if you're not already a subscriber to Amazon Prime. Family Plan - At some point before the year is over, Amazon will introduce a sort of family plan in the UK that will allow you to share access to Amazon Music Unlimited with up to 6 people, but the company has to to announce exact pricing for this option. There's still a lot of room for Amazon Music Unlimited to grow. The new music streaming service from Amazon might not be revolutionary or ground-breaking, but it's nice to see that the company is working hard on expanding it to as many markets as possible. The service is still in its infancy, so while it may not be all that exciting right now, there's still a lot of room for it to grow in the near future and beyond.",

      "text": "Tweet Shares 4 We’re friends, right? Friends share things. Important things. Things like, the best ways to get your kid to sleep. The secret way to lose the last 10 post baby pounds. And, of course, the best items she has ever bought on Amazon. \nSo, here we go, the TOP 11 ITEMS I have ever bought on Amazon (and our readers have LOVED them as well!). They’re useful. They’re fun. They’ll make life awesomer! 1. Instant Pot Pressure Cooker Raise your hand if you’ve EVER forgotten to defrost the chicken breast for dinner. 5pm and you have nothing but a frozen block of chicken. No worries. Just throw that frozen chicken into your Instant Pot, and in a quick 14 minutes, you have perfectly cooked chicken, ready to be shredded and put into your dish. This Instant Pot is a total game changer for every busy woman. It acts as a slow cooker, rice cooker, pressure cooker and MORE. Get rid of ALL your appliances and just keep this. I am obsessed, use it almost daily, and can’t wait for you to try it! You can learn a lot more in THIS post. \n2 . Blanket Scarf This is currently my FAVORITE accessory. I love that there are a million ways to wear it. I love how big and warm it is. I love how you can throw it on with a casual t- shirt and jeans or use it to dress up a cozy dress. Did I mention I love the price? I own it in camel and really want it in black . There are many different colors and versions.They also make wonderful gifts for the women in your life. All my kids’ teachers are receiving these this year! \n3 . Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons \nOne of my dear friends told me about this book and it’s AMAZING. If you have younger children or grandchildren learning to read, this is your greatest asset. Not exaggerating. It breaks down learning to read into 100 short lessons that build upon each other. In about 15 minutes a day, your kid WILL be reading. It’s worked on all of Missy’s kids and I’m a believer now as well! 4. Bissell Steam Mop Mopping the floors used to be something I dreaded. It took forever and made a wet mess. Now I can clean my floors, killing 99% of bacteria, all with water and steam in about 5 minutes. This thing is AWESOME. Remind me to tell you about the time I used it to steam my kids’ boogers off the wall. (Sick, I know.) Curious as to all the ways you can use a steam mop? Be sure to read THIS POST . 5. Bare Minerals Bare Skin Concealer As someone who runs off very little sleep, I’ve learned the power of a good concealer. This stuff is powerful. I love it and reccommend it to everyone because it’s so light, but covers well. If you’re looking to try a concealer that works, and won’t break the bank, this is it. I use it daily and won’t ever change! 6. Magformers The toys that never get old! My kids and I play with these together and it’s a joy each time. They are essentially, magnetic building blocks in lots of different shapes and colors. They come in lots of different sets, but this one is my favorite because it’s huge! These are high quality, appeal to ALL ages, and will last forever! If you ever need some alone time, bust these babies out! 7. Fake Bake Flawless Darker \nBeen searching for the BEST sunless tanner? Afraid to try sunless tanner in fear of turning into something resembling an Oompa Loompa? I’m telling you, this is your new best friend. I use it all through the dark days of winter and always have a nice healthy glow when I do. I’ve tried a lot, and this baby is THE BEST. Oh, an extra tip, invest in this mitt to apply. It makes a world of streak-free difference. 8. Hobo “Lauren” wallet If you haven’t seen my review of the Hobo on Facebook, you’re missing the greatest wallet ever made. No Joke. My girlfriend spoiled me on my 30th birthday with one, and it’s been my favorite gift of all time. They are so spacious. Literally, a place for everything. Great to throw in your diaper bag, purse or grab as a clutch! Not to mention, they last forever – she’s had hers almost 10 years. Again, worth every penny. 9. Plasma Cars If you haven’t jumped on the plasma car obsessed train, you aren’t living. My kiddos (and occasionally my husband) are CONSTANTLY on these. They are ride on toys, propelled by wiggling the steering wheel and your body. They can book! I feel like these appeal to all ages of kids, and adults! We have so much fun with them and I’ve had many friends agree – they’re the best! 10. Harry Potter Illustrated Books What can I say? I’m a little bit of a sucker for anything Harry Potter. Especially, these stunningly beautiful books, and I’m not alone – check out the reviews! They’re big. They’re solid. They’re the perfect book to read as a family. A lot of great memories made, and to be made with these favorite books. Also, my friend RAVES about the Harry Potter audio books . The reader is AMAZING! He does all the voices and is so fun to listen to. Traveling for holidays will be so much better with this to listen to! And SWEET DEAL right now…you can get 2 of them FREE when you sign up for audible . (FREE trial!).",

The best books of the year, according to Amazon Nov. 15, 2016, 8:00 AM 3 \nFlickr/sabin paul croce \nThis year has been a great year for reading. But if you're wondering which new books are worth your time, consider Amazon Books' annual list of the best books of the year. \nAmazon Books' editors read thousands of pages before settling on their ranking, which includes a number of memoirs as well as books from debut authors. \n\"The main challenge for us was that there were a number of great books to choose from,\" Amazon Books Editor Chris Schluep said to Business Insider. \"In the end, we picked [the top book] for a few reasons: first, it's a great piece of literature, second, it's the one that stuck with us the most, and third, it's a book you look forward to picking back up.\" \nFrom a post-apocalyptic thriller to a heartbreaking portrait of modern America, here are Amazon's top 10 books for 2016. \nAll captions are by the Amazon Books editors.

The alternative is to buy a pair of passive speakers and a stereo receiver . I've had both types of setups over the years, and my ears have always preferred this style. The only weird thing to get over is the fact that you control this audio setup's volume through a knob on the speakers. Once you get over that, it's smooth sailing.People generally like this pair of Edifer speakers, some have even used them in their turntable setups. They have two audio inputs, so you can use them with your turntable, but also attach your computer or phone to them to play your digital music. You could even get fancy and buy this adapter , turning them into a pair of Bluetooth speakers.

      "title": "Morrisons' bounce back shapes up with same-day delivery Amazon tie-up",
      "text": "The dream team is very much in business .\n\nYes, that's right: Amazon and Morrisons have developed their tie-up to launch the aptly named Morrisons at Amazon service.\n\nFrom today, Amazon Prime customers in selected areas can order a full Morrisons shop online via the Prime Now app. Orders will then be picked at a local Morrisons store and delivered the same day by Amazon, either within one hour (that'll set you back £6.99) or in a two hour slot for free.\n\nIt will launch in selected postcodes within London and Hertforshire.\n\n*Read more*: Analysts welcome a full year of growth for Morrisons\n\nThe initiative widens the Morrisons wholesale supply services available to Amazon customers. It launched in June and has since been rolled out to thousands of Morrisons products.\n\nThe supermarket said the developments were \"capital light\" for it and while still early days, should go some way to contributing to the £50m-£100m incremental profit opportunity it identified at the 2015/2016 preliminary results.\n\nDavid Potts, chief executive, said: \"As food maker and shopkeeper, we have unique skills to help build a broader new Morrisons through capital light growth. Morrisons at Amazon is another exciting joint opportunity and makes Morrisons good quality, great value-for-money products available to even more customers.\"\n\n*Read more*: #Marmitegate is back - but this time it's at Morrisons\n\nThe supermarket has so far reaped the rewards of being associated with Jeff Bezos's e-commerce behemoth. In February when it was revealed Morrisons had secured a major agreement with Amazon to sell hundreds of products via Prime Now and Pantry, its share price soared 5.4 per cent.\n\nAmazon launched the food delivery service Pantry in a new headache for the nation's supermarket stalwarts, already battling the rise of German discounters Lidl and Aldi.\n\nIt marked part of Morrisons' six-pillar turnaround plan \"to make the supermarket strong again\", allowing the firm to grow volumes while still remaining capital light.\n\nEarlier this month, it announced like-for-like sales were up 1.6 per cent in the third quarter, marking a year of positive same-store sales.",

      "text": "TOP 5330889 \nAmazon continues its “ Countdown to Black Friday ,” offering new deals each day until next Friday (and likely, if we’re being honest, all the way up to Christmas Day). Today, there’s an especially good offer – up to 50 percent off Crocs, one of (if not THE) most comfortable shoe brands on the market. \nIn total, 18 pairs of Crocs are available at this one-day-only discounted price. This includes pairs for men , women , boys and girls . Some of the designs are classics, like this awesome camo version . Normally $50, this pair of Crocs is half off today (Photo via Amazon) \nOthers are of the newer, increasingly popular variety, like these loafers (which are also available in black): Normally $75, these loafers are actually 54 percent off today (Photo via Amazon) \nPerhaps the most astounding aspect of this sale, however, is that apparently Crocs makes snow boots . Who knew? Normally $100, these snow boots are on sale for $60 (Photo via Amazon)",

      "title": "Oodles: A solid e-book reader, if you can ignore its looks (review)",
      "text": "By Gerson Noboa \nIt’s amusing to know that, even with the rise of e-books, tablets, and Amazon’s Kindle services and devices, recent studies show that Americans are reading less than in previous years. The media probably blames millennials, as they always do, but what are you going to do? I figure people can’t stop scrolling through their Facebook timelines in search of memes. \nBooks are easier to get and read than ever, thanks to improved channels of distribution and the ubiquity of connected devices. For those who want to read but are on a budget, there are several free alternatives in the Play Store ready for your reading pleasure. One of these options is Oodles , which offers quality e-books and audiobooks for the always-welcome price of zero. Nada! \nPrice: Free Setup The main screen gives you quick access to the available e-books and audiobooks, while also allowing you to access your library. \nWhen you first open the app, it asks you to create an account. Fortunately, for those of us who don’t like to create accounts, especially when the only account creation methods are Google and Facebook, there’s a “Sign-in later” option. It makes you wonder why the app asks you to create an account so early in the first place, especially if it isn’t required at all for the app to work properly. After this, you’re ready to use the app. Overview \nThe main screen of Oodles shows two carousel-style sections: one for free e-books and another one for free audiobooks. Clicking on either will yield a grid (or list, it depends on the screen) with the available options. You’ll also have the option to swipe between different views, such as Categories, Top Books, and Top Authors. Think of the way the Play Store is organized and you’ll get an idea of what you will find here. Everything looks neat and works quickly enough. \nWhen you choose a specific book, you’ll be directed to the book’s detail page. This will show the cover at the top, along with detailed information about the book and the option to download it. There’s also suggestions at the bottom, based on the book you chose. Since the available books here are probably not well-known, this is a crucial option and it’s nice that the developer decided to add it. \nYou can also browse your library of e-books and audiobooks, all neatly organized and with a percentage bar that shows you your current progress on that specific book. You can also import books you already own but are stored in your SD card or internal memory. E-books \nThere’s a lot to say about this part of the app, so much that it merits a section of its own. When you finally download your books and are ready to consume them, you are treated with the reading screen. \nI have mixed feelings regarding this specific activity, since some things work so well but, on the other hand, it looks outdated and out of place in a world where Android apps have gotten much more beautiful than they were just a couple of years ago. Gingerbread called. It wanted its interface back. \nThe screen has a top and a bottom bar, each one with different controls and options. The problem is that these icons look like they were brought in a time machine right from the days of Gingerbread. \nSome buttons even have a gradient color, something that is frowned upon in today’s design. Actually making things worse is the fact that not all of them are gradients. There’s no consistency between design languages here. \nAnyways, regarding the functionality of the buttons themselves, they all work more or less like you would expect. At the top, you’ll find a list button which will let you browse the chapters of your book and jump to any of them directly. There’s also a button to save bookmarks (actual bookmarks, you know, not the browser-related ones). \nNext to it you’ll find a search function that works rather well. There’s also an overflow menu for getting to the app’s settings (I will come back to this later), book information, and increase/decrease font size (even though there’s a dedicated button for that at the bottom). \nAt the bottom you’ll find more useful stuff, such as brightness control, toggle between day and night modes (awesome), rotation lock, and the aforementioned font size changer. There’s also a slider to move between pages, and a button to return to the page you were reading before acting on this slider. \nThe book part is invisibly divided in three columns. Hitting the center part will toggle the top and bottom bars, leaving more screen state for reading your book. Touching the right side will take you to the next page, while the left region will take you to the previous page. Swiping will also move you through the pages. These gestures and tap recognitions work swiftly enough, although swiping too fast generates a wonky animation. Specific book information is available in one click. There’s also the option of browsing similar books. \nJust as a Lannister always pays his debts, I am fulfilling my promise of coming back to the settings section. The options available here are actually richer than the options for the app itself. There’s options for changing appearance, margins, page turning, dictionary, colors, text, etc. Possibly every aspect that can be configured has some kind of entry. That’s really cool, but what’s with the design? If the icons weren’t Gingerbread enough, this settings app looks completely out of date. \nThe whole reading screen looks (and probably is) a library written by other developer and integrated to this app. There’s nothing wrong with that, but at least some additional work could have been made in order to avoid such an inconsistent experience. Audiobooks \nYou can download your audiobooks in different parts (as opposed to a single big file) to make it lighter for your internet connection. The player for audiobooks works exactly as expected, with the book cover front and center, and then your regular buttons to play, pause, rewind, and similar events that you expect. There’s very little to say about it other than it works and audio quality is decent enough for an audiobook. Ads \nBeing a free app by an independent developer, ads are expected. These come in two different flavors: a banner at the bottom of the screen, and a full-screen ad when you leave the reader screen. \nI never hide my hate for full-screen ads, and I won’t start today. It’s really unfortunate that user experience has to be interrupted in such an abrupt manner in order to get the revenue to pay the bills. That’s the way the current market is, however, and there’s nothing in the near future that will change this. At least I haven’t seen a full-screen video ad yet. Options Here’s the option screen, where you can configure the two of them. \nTouching the gear button at the top of the main screen will take you to the app’s settings screen. Even though it seems full, it’s probably the settings screen with the least amount of options I’ve ever seen. \nYou can change your language, although it’s limited to English and another language that I can’t understand (sorry for the ignorance). \nA kind of cool feature comes in the form of reminders. You can ask the app to remind you at a specific time that you need to stop being lazy and read those books you downloaded. These can be configured for any time of the day, any day of the week. \nThere’s also the option to remove ads (thankfully) and share the app with your friends. Other than that, there’s no noteworthy aspects to analyze further. Conclusion \nOodles does a good job in categorizing and providing a nice one-stop place to download e-books and audiobooks. The problems start to show up when you’re reading the books themselves, with a really outdated library to handle the situation. \nIf you can ignore the fact that the reading interface looks like the apps you used on your Samsung Galaxy S2 back in 2011, then you can use Oodles to satisfy your reading needs.",

      "text": "See how Amazon packages ship with less than :60 in human hands Populism is sweeping the nation, but it's likely just getting started. Donald Trump's win is a wake-up call that voters are angry with a system that's made middle-class jobs tougher to come by, and increased inequality. \nAs pronounced as the trend already is, it's only just the beginning, experts say. Looming technological advances will wipe out more jobs, broadening the base of disenfranchised, unemployable and frustrated citizens. Meanwhile, elites with the skills to flourish in the digital economy will get richer. And governments will have to figure out how to help struggling citizens. \nTrump has suggested bringing back jobs to the U.S. from overseas. But even if these jobs return, they may soon vanish in a tide of automation. \nManufacturing jobs aren't the only ones at risk. Pizza delivery guys, garbagemen, radiologists, retail workers, truck drivers, call-center workers and cab drivers are among the most obvious casualties. \nThe World Economic Forum has estimated that five millions jobs will be lost by 2020. A 2013 Oxford study estimated that 47% of U.S. employment is at risk of being computerized. Economist Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary, expects that more than one in three men in their prime working years will be out of work in 2050 . \n\nThe technology world is going through tremendous advances in artificial intelligence that are powering everything from self-driving cars to apps that help diagnose cancer . Many benefits await society. The change is so profound that some have started to call artificial intelligence the new electricity. But like all technologies, it's a double-edged sword, and a lot of people are about to get shocked. \n\"It's going to get worse. The inequality will get worse. There's going to be more anger and social upheaval,\" said Martin Ford , author of Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future. \"What we're seeing is in large measure because of technology.\" \nRelated: Amazon only needs one minute of human labor to ship your next package \nTrump ran on issues of immigration and trade . Ford argues this is because it's easiest for people to point a finger at another person, be it a worker in China or an immigrant. \nThe true culprit, as Ford sees it, is new technologies that have made it increasingly possible to automate traditional middle class jobs. The education required to hold down a middle class gig is increasing. There are new jobs, but most don't guarantee the lifestyle of yesteryear. Median American wages have been flat for decades, even as the country's economy grows -- concentrating wealth in fewer hands. \n\"We talked 20, 25 years ago about the need for more than a high school education,\" said David Colburn, a history professor at the University of Florida. \"Now we're talking about the need for more than a community college education. And in some cases, we're talking about a greater need than just a college education.\" \nWe're already seeing signs of how unemployment could run rampant, triggering a broader populist backlash. \nThis week, Domino's began delivering pizzas with drones in New Zealand. When an autonomous drone can make deliveries, there's little need for humans to drive cars or trucks. Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) also is investing heavily in drone delivery. And Starbucks ( SBUX ) has reportedly talked with Google ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) about delivering coffee via drone. \nCar and tech companies like Google, Uber, Ford ( F ) , Toyota ( TM ) , Intel ( INTC , Tech30 ) , Daimler, Samsung and GM ( GM ) are investing in autonomous vehicle technology. This October, Budweiser delivered beer in Colorado thanks to a self-driving truck. \nRelated: Is Uber's push for self-driving cars a job killer? \nOur shift to the convenience and low prices of online shopping also risks accelerating these trends. Retail jobs are already shifting from brick and mortar stores to e-commerce warehouses. \nWhile new jobs may sound like a good thing, this is actually dangerous for workers' job security. Warehouse work is far easier for a machine to learn, according to Ford. It's much simpler for a robot to learn to box up a package in an Amazon fulfillment center, rather than standing at a Macy's checkout counter, making small talk with a customer. Warehouses are controlled, predictable environments -- brick and mortar stores are not. \nSo what do we do about this? We could try and bring factories back from overseas, as Trump has suggested. Yet much of the work available in factories appears to have a shelf life due to robots' increasing capabilities. \nSome are suggesting that governments pay citizens a regular stipend, a concept called a universal basic income. \nRelated: Google drones deliver Chipotle burritos at Virginia Tech \n\"The universal consensus from the smartest people in the world is that universal basic income is a given,\" said John Marshall, chief innovation officer at Lippincott, a creative consultancy that convenes expert panels for its clients on issues such as basic income. \"It's something that society won't be able to function without.\" \nYet figuring out how such a system could be afforded -- and not turn a country into a nation of slackers -- is unclear. Several countries, including Finland and the Netherlands, are taking the concept seriously. \n\"I don't think we're anywhere near the brainpower we need focused on this problem to solve it,\" Ford said. \nCNNMoney (Washington)   11:40 AM ET",

      "text": "A Christian priest and a Muslim imam are friends in a new commercial from Amazon. (Amazon via YouTube) Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos doesn’t tweet a lot, but on Thursday he was moved to share a new television commercial for Amazon Prime and praise the ad team behind the concept.\nThe ad, which was just uploaded to YouTube , shows two friends getting together for a cup of tea. One of the men is a priest and the other is an imam. There is no dialogue as the two men are shown hugging hello and chatting. After some time, both men struggle to stand from a seated position and then they hug goodbye.\nMoments later, the men are both on their phones using Amazon to order gifts for one another. Watch the ad to see what the gifts were and how the men used them.\nLove this TV commercial for Amazon Prime. Very proud of our ad team. https://t.co/E8ceXs4nte \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \nThe expression of interfaith friendship is clearly meant to strike a nerve, as people in the United States grapple with issues of intolerance and division especially in relation to religion and Muslims and their place in the country in the wake of Donald Trump’s presidential victory. Trump campaigned on a promise to require a national registry for Muslim immigrants.\nThe Irish Independent newspaper reported that the ad, which is also showing in the U.K. and Germany, is about “selflessness and thinking of other people,” according to Amazon.\nA spokesman for the Seattle-based retail giant told The Independent: “Our casting reflects this: the gentleman playing the vicar is a practicing vicar in London, the gentleman playing the imam is a devout Muslim and the principal of a Muslim school. We used an actual church and mosque for our scenes within the places of worship.”\nBezos last tweeted a week ago, when he offered his congratulations to Trump, saying he would give the president-elect his “most open mind” while wishing Trump “great success in his service to the country.”\nEarlier on Thursday, Bezos also used Twitter to promote “The Grand Tour,” an Amazon original motoring series starring Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May.\nLong wait is over… Clarkson, Hammond, May are back… #TheGrandTour premieres tonight in UK, US, DE, JP. And globally in Dec. pic.twitter.com/dfQjGGuDFW \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \n ",

      "text": "Amazon Tackles Islamophobia In Heartwarming Christmas Ad A good reminder that we all have more in common than meets the eye. 11/18/2016 10:47 am ET Carol Kuruvilla Associate Religion Editor \nAmazon chose to highlight a moment of friendship between a Christian and a Muslim in their Christmas advertisement this year ― and it’s exactly the kind of interfaith solidarity the world needs to focus on right now. \nAmidst reports that Islamophobia is on the rise in the United Kingdom and the United States, the online retail giant launched an advertising campaign on Wednesday that promotes the message that you don’t need to follow the same religion to be a good friend to your neighbor. \nIn the ad, an imam pays a visit to his pal, who happens to be a priest. The pair catch up and joke about the aches and pains of old age. At the end of the visit, both coincidentally decide to purchase the same gift online for each other ― kneepads that help them kneel while they pray. \nAlthough the ad is scripted, its stars are real religious leaders from the U.K . The priest is Rev. Gary Bradley , vicar of a church in London, and the imam is Zubeir Hassam, principal of the Muslim School Oadby, in Leicester. Amazon YouTube The priest and imam featured in Amazon's 2016 Christmas ad are religious leaders in real life. \nHassam told The Telegraph that even though it was a commercial, the script seemed to mirror his life. \n“This is what I do in the community – I didn’t do any acting I was just being myself,” he said . “With all the bad publicity we have got this is a very, very positive ad showing that people of different faiths can get together.” \nAccording to the Guardian , Amazon consulted with the Church of England, the Muslim Council of Great Britain and the Christian Muslim Forum to make sure that the commercial was respectful of each religious tradition. \n“We think it is an authentic and charming story,” said Simon Morris, director of advertising at Amazon. “We think it is a legitimate story. We are conscious that some people may be sensitive to it. It is about selflessness and thinking of other people.” \nChristmastime in the U.K. is a busy season for advertisers , with companies spending millions of dollars on campaigns and battling with each other to make the biggest splash. The BBC reports that retailers in the U.K. are expected to spend more than $6.9 million dollars on ads during the 2016 holiday season. \nThe campaign will run in the U.S., the U.K., and Germany this year.

      "text": "\nControl your home's lighting using Alexa and these smart bulbs.\nAmazon offers an affordable way to start building out a voice-activated home automation system for your house or apartment with their Amazon Echo and Echo Dot powered by their A.I. assistant, Alexa. On its own, you can use Alexa to play music and find news, sports and other information. But things get really interesting when you start to connect Alexa up to smart devices, including connected LED bulbs and smart switches, around your house.\nThere are a number of light options compatible with Alexa. We've broken things down based on the different brands and ecosystems that each have their own compatibility with smart lights and smart switches that you'll ultimately be able to control via Alexa on your Amazon Echo.\nPhilips Hue Samsung SmartThings Insteon Hub WeMo switches and outlets Lutron dimmers and switches \nPhilips Hue \nPhilips Hue is the leader in smart bulbs, and are downright cool. You can connect up to 50 Philips Hue bulbs, lamps and lighting strips via the Philips Hue Bridge, so chances are you could convert all your home's lighting over to the Philips Hue system. Whether you're looking for 60W equivalent white LED bulbs , bulbs that feature 16 million colors , or LED light strips for futuristic accents , There's a reason why so many people have gone with Philips Hue.\nAlexa syncs right up to the Philips Hue Bridge, which means you'll be able to set up different lighting groups for your rooms and IFTTT recipes on your phone, then also control everything with the sound of your voice via your Amazon Echo. There's a lot of fun to be had here, as Philips Hue lights can be synced up to your music for epic dance parties, and otherwise customized in countless different ways to suit your lifestyle.\nIf you're interested in getting started with Philips Hue, you're best off getting a starter kit. There are a couple different options to consider:\nPhilips Hue Starter Kit w/ two bulbs and one Bridge — $69.99 on Amazon Philips Hue Starter Kit w/ two bulbs, one bridge and an Amazon Echo Dot — $99.99 on Amazon Philips Hue Starter Kit w/ two A19 bulbs, one Bridge and one Dimmer switch — $125.47 on Amazon Philips Hue Starter Kit w/ three White and Color Ambiance bulbs and one Bridge — $142.77 on Amazon No matter which starter kit you choose, the beautiful part of going with Philips Hue is that it's super easy to add extra bulbs or other elements to your ecosystem later.\n\nSamsung SmartThings \nSmartThings provides a full suite of options for home automation, which includes a few options for smart lights. You'll need a [SmartThings Hub] to get started, but from there you can connect plug-in smart switches for appliances, lamps and outdoors, and in-wall dimmers which support dimmable LED and CFL technologies along with legacy support for incandescent, halogen, Mark 10, and magnetic lighting loads.\nYou can also connect smart bulbs from Philips Hue or Osram to your SmartThings Hub, along with a host of other super handy home automation products that all work within the SmartThings ecosystem.\nIf you're mainly interested in smart lights, you can get a SmartThings Hub and an Osram bulb bundle . If complete home automation is your ultimate goal, you might be more interested in the SmartThings Home Monitoring Kit , then build your own lighting arsenal from the available SmartThings-compatible lighting options .\n\nInsteon Hub \nInsteon's offerings for smart home lighting mostly include in-wall dimmers and switches and plug-in dimmers . They do offer their own programmable, dimmable LED bulbs, available in two styles: 8W LED bulbs and 12-watt recessed bulbs . You can use the Insteon app to set bulbs into groups for scheduling and creating scenes, then take control via Alexa.\nTo start building out your Insteon smart lighting ecosystem, you should get the Insteon Starter Kit , which comes with the necessary Hub, and two Dimmer Plugs, perfect for setting up a voice controlled bedside lamp. From there, you'll need to buy compatible bulbs as you need them.\nInsteon's system is a decent option for those looking for home automation, but overall their lighting options are somewhat lacking.\n\nWeMo switches and outlets WeMo offers Wi-Fi enabled smart switches and outlets that you can control via Alexa. The WeMo Light Switch can be used to replace any light switch in your home, letting you schedule and control your lights and appliances without the need of a central hub.\nThis one is better for the DIYers out there who are interested in manually creating their own home automation network with in-wall switches and plug-in adapters to control lamps and other small appliances. Those looking for hassle-free installation and smart bulb options are best looking elsewhere.\n\nLutron dimmers and switches Lutron Caseta Wireless products offer a selection of smart dimmers and switches that connect via the Caseta Wireless Smart Bridge. Connect your Smart Bridge to Alexa allows you to control all the dimmers and switches with your voice.\nCheck out the Lutron Caseta Wireless Smart Lighting In-Wall Dimmer Kit or the Plug-in Dimmer Kit to see what this system is all about. This is another route that's going to require DIY effort with initial setup and is also lacking branded LED bulb options, but the Hub is compatible with a bunch of other smart devices from leading brands including Ecobee, Nest, Honeywell, Logitech, and Sonos.\nWhich should you get? \nThanks to Alexa's compatibility with a variety of smart light systems, you've got several great options for automating and customizing your home. Which system you go with will greatly depending on your current living situation.\nIf you're living in an apartment and are just looking to control some funky lighting options via Alexa voice controls, Philips Hue is your best bet. Buying a starter kit is a great investment that you can take with you as you move — and with the lifespan of LED lighting well exceeding a decade, you'll enjoy the freedom to rearrange, expand and easily move your Philips system wherever you go.\nIf you're a homeowner looking to integrate IoT devices throughout your home, you'll want to buy an Alexa-compatible hub that shares a wide range of compatibility with other brands and products, such as SmartThings or even a Wink Hub 2 , then build out your smart bulb and other devices to the exact specifications of your home.\nAnd if you're in the process of planning a home renovation, it might be worth looking at WeMo, Insteon, and Lutron's in-wall switches or dimmers to convert your existing home wiring into a smart lighting system that you can then control with your voice. Don't just update the look of your home — upgrade its functionality, then let Alexa control it all with the power of your own voice.\n",

      "text": "Coming off a third-quarter in which Ross Stores Inc. reported a same-store sales increase of 7%, Wedbush analysts say the off-price retailer’s in-store experience is driving traffic through the doors and keeping Amazon.com Inc. at bay.\n“More than half of Ross Stores’ comp was driven by traffic, suggesting at least a +4% traffic increase year-over-year,” Wedbush wrote in a Friday note. “Given the struggles most retailers are having navigating traffic challenges, we believe this speaks to how relevant the treasure hunt experience is to the customer. We see no reason to expect any near-term impact from Amazon or other e-commerce players.”\nWedbush rates Ross ROST, +4.36% stock outperform and raised the price target to $71 from $67.\nRoss reported sales of $3.09 billion for the quarter, up from $2.78 billion last year and ahead of the $2.96 billion FactSet consensus. Earnings per share were 62 cents, up from 53 cents and ahead of the 56-cent FactSet consensus.\nRoss shares are up 4.4% in Friday trading.\nSee also: Ross Stores raises outlook as profit tops target\nSee also: Wal-Mart could give Amazon a run for its money this holiday season\nCowen & Company analysts walked away from a meeting at the company headquarters this summer believing Ross is Amazon-resistant AMZN, +0.57% due to the moderate prices of Ross’ goods, the off-price retailer’s lower-income demographic and the aforementioned “treasure hunt experience” as well. Moreover, Ross has millennial appeal.\nWhat can artificial intelligence do for retail? (2:34) Customers return about 23% of their purchases both in-store and online, costing retailers $643 billion per year. Can artificial intelligence eliminate returns through virtual 3D try-on?\nAfter the earnings, Cowen said Ross is its “top pick” in the sector.\n“We are encouraged to see the third quarter comp beat driven by traffic and basket increases, with strength broadly seen across geographies,” Cowen analysts wrote in a note published Thursday.\nCowen rates Ross shares outperform and raised its stock price target to $74 from $67.\nAnalysts at Stifel aren’t quite as bullish about Ross, favoring competitor TJX Cos. TJX, +0.49% for three reasons: TJX dominates the off-price market, it has greater growth prospects and a higher dividend yield.\nSee also: Online retailers tighten vice grip on department stores\n“We reiterate our hold rating [on Ross shares] as we believe that the anticipated success of the entry into new markets and the continued improvement of Ross Stores and dd’s despite [the anniversary of] peak margins is nearly fully reflected in the share price,” Stifel wrote in a Thursday note.\nDd’s Discounts is a moderately-priced chain of 172 stores located across 15 states.\nStifel raised Ross’ price target to $68 from $60.\nSee also: TJX beats but holiday outlook falls short\nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets believe Ross has momentum, “driven by a continuing increase in traffic, with share gains from mid-tier department stores, improving merchandising at key categories including home with better buying and opportunistic use of packaway, and a new store maturation curve which should alone add low-single-digit percent to comps,” analysts said in a Thursday note.\nPackaway seasonal merchandise is stored by off-price retailers to sell at a later time.\nRBC rates Ross shares sector perform and raised their price target to $68 from $65.\nRoss shares are up 27.1% for the year so far. the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.28% is up 6.7% for the same period.\nMore from MarketWatch Social Media Companies Tackle Fake News and Abuse Donald Trump's Possible Cabinet Picks Kellyanne Conway Discusses How to ‘Drain the Swamp’ Related Topics U.S. Stocks Markets Investing",

      "title": "Which home audio system should I buy? Your ultimate Christmas 2016 guide",
      "text": "Amazon, Google and Sonos are all offering sophisticated speaker systems that offer either multi-room audio, voice control, or both. Scott Wilson weighs up the pros and cons of each. \nA few years ago, selecting a system for listening to music at home was easy. Typically you’d pick up an inexpensive mini hi-fi system for the bedroom and maybe splash out on some separates and good speakers for the living room. All you really had to worry about was whether you needed a CD auto-changer.\nIn 2016, the landscape is very different. All-in-one music systems are generally geared towards those who want to play music from their phones or computers via Bluetooth, and now these are slowly but surely being made obsolete by connected systems designed to stream to every room in our homes.\nIf you’ve decided that you’ve outgrown your tinny Bluetooth speaker and you want to enter the future, the three key brands offering the most sophisticated experience are Sonos, Google and Amazon. Despite the advanced technology inside each, they’re surprisingly affordable, making them an attractive proposition for anyone browsing Amazon for pre or post-Christmas ideas.\nHowever, the expectations of each system may not match the experience. This feature looks at the pros and cons of each of the big three systems and should help you decide whether you need to upgrade at all.\n\nDo I actually need to go multi-room? \nThe first thing you’ll need to decide is whether you really need to go multi-room or not. If you only want to stream music in one room, a simple Bluetooth speaker or system will be fine. Once connected, Bluetooth is stable over short distances and visitors to your home will be able to connect quickly and easily with their phones. However, it creates a direct link to the audio output of your device, meaning that any email alerts or notification sounds will be heard over the system as well.\nMulti-room systems such as Sonos or Google Home are much more sophisticated. If you have enough speakers, you can use a single app to play different music in different rooms or have the same track play in all rooms. Also, they’ll only play the music through your speakers, not any other notification sounds. However, to make the most of it you’ll need to spend a lot of money on speakers and have a decent Wi-Fi network. If you struggle to use your laptop in the living room because the router is in the kitchen, a multi-room system is pointless.\nDo I need voice control? \nThe latest development in home audio is voice control. If you own an iPhone or Mac with Siri, you’ll know how it works: ask it to play what you want and you save yourself having to deal with iTunes. It’s debatable whether most of us actually use it much, but that hasn’t stopped Amazon and Google from developing their own voice control systems.\nVoice control makes far more sense in a home context than on a mobile device, particularly for selecting music. Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s voice technology allow you to select music based on artist or mood, which is perfect for when you’re feeling indecisive. In a kitchen setting, where you may not have clean hands to select music from your phone, voice control is particularly useful.\nHowever, if you’re a heavy listener of music with obscure taste, the lack of precision involved in using voice control to select music may become irritating. Sonos doesn’t feature voice control, but being able to use its control app to tie in services such as Mixcloud and SoundCloud as well as Spotify will be a major selling point to some. There’s also the privacy issue: Amazon and Google’s voice control systems are always on and listening. If you’re not comfortable with the possibility of your data being harvested, don’t invest in voice control.\n\nSonos \nSonos is the original multi-room system, and despite a few of its products looking a little dated, it’s still one of the best options in terms of sound quality. The recent Play:5 ($499, while expensive, sounds incredible for its size. You can pair two of these speakers, but the stereo sound that comes out of one is more than enough for the average living room.\nBeyond the high-end model, there’s the entry-level Play:1 ($199) and mid-range Play:3 ($299) speakers. The Play:1 is as small as a Beats Pill , but it sounds better than most portable Bluetooth speakers for a similar price. The Play:3 is slightly more powerful and is not much more money for a speaker that’ll fill small living rooms and bedrooms with ease.\nBesides a whole home of Sonos devices being very expense, Sonos has a few drawbacks. While you can use it with almost any music service (except YouTube), the proprietary Sonos app’s sub-menus are a labyrinth, and you have to use it for everything except Spotify. There’s no Bluetooth either, so if you’re having a party then guests will need to download the app (which is potentially an advantage depending on how much of a playlist control freak you are). Also, it doesn’t support high resolution audio playback, so it’s MP3 only.\n\nAmazon Echo \nAmazon’s Echo speaker ($179.99) has the potential to change the streaming business. Amazon is offering owners of the Echo the opportunity to subscribe to its new Music Unlimited streaming service for just $3.99 a month – a huge discount on the $9.99 of Spotify and Apple Music. Despite its tiny size, it sounds better than it looks, though it’s better suited to smaller rooms or kitchen use.\nIts most useful feature is that because it’s always connected to the internet, it doesn’t need to be connected to a phone or laptop to use. Instead, you use its voice-control system Alexa to select what music you want to play, using either Amazon’s service or a Spotify account. This can be hit and miss: Asking it to play Three 6 Mafia’s classic ‘Tear Da Club Up ’97’ can confuse it – the voice recognition is good, but it struggles with some of the Memphis classics.\nThe second generation model also has a Bluetooth connection, so you can connect your device the old-fashioned way if the voice control gets irritating. While it’s an affordable connected home device you can use to control lights and temperature, it’s not a proper multi-room system – you can’t pair two for stereo sound or stream the same music in different rooms of the house.\n\nGoogle Home \nThe newest addition to the world of wireless audio is Google Home. Like Amazon Echo, it’s a home audio system that doubles up as a connected home control center. Each speaker is cheap ($129), and, unlike Amazon Echo, offers a proper multi-room audio experience. They look better than Amazon’s devices, but there’s not much difference in sound quality – decent, but certainly not a patch on the Sonos Play:1, whose bass is fuller andmuch more capable of filling a room.\nWhere Google Home excels over the Amazon Echo is voice control. As you’d expect from a company that has been dominating most of the globe’s search traffic, Google Home’s digital helper is better at recognising commands and obscure band names than both Alexa and Siri. However, perhaps its most useful feature is direct integration with YouTube, which is the world’s most popular destination for streaming music.\nGoogle Home comes with a six-month subscription to YouTube Red , which it can use to access the video streaming site’s almost limitless collection of music. It’s more expensive than the $3.99 of Amazon Music Unlimited, but the power to demand obscure techno and disco 12″s while chopping vegetables is something you can’t always get from Spotify.\n\nIf you already own an expensive hi-fi system \nIf you own an audiophile hi-fi system, you might assume you won’t be able to get audio streaming from your phone or laptop. However, it’s actually very affordable to add wireless streaming capabilities to any hi-fi system or separate with an auxiliary cable, as long as you don’t mind a dongle being attached.\nGoogle’s Chromecast Audio is one of the least expensive options ($35), and streams music from your devices over Wi-Fi. So long as your service is compatible (see below), you can get your music playing by selecting the Chromecast as a device from within the app itself. Its connections are also fit for audiophiles: as well as the standard 3.5mm jack, there are stereo RCA connections and an optical input.\nAmazon has its own solution to this problem, the Echo Dot ($49.99). It’s essentially the company’s Echo device minus the speaker, so you can order pizza from your hi-fi if you want. It works over both Bluetooth so it’s easy to pair with any device no matter what service you’re running, but it lacks the superior connectivity of the Chromecast Audio, sporting just a 3.5mm jack.\nIf you want to start a Sonos system, the company has its own conversion device, the CONNECT . It’s expensive ($349) and bulky compared to its rivals, but has the best set of connectors – RCA, and both optical and coaxial digital outputs. For the money it costs to buy though, you could buy two Echo speakers. Whether it’s right for you comes down to how invested you are in the Sonos ecosystem.\nWhat’s the most universally compatible streaming service? \nAnother important thing to consider when buying a multi-room system or streaming device is whether it’s compatible with your streaming service of choice. This isn’t a problem if the device supports Bluetooth, but if you’re using Google Home over Wi-Fi for example, you might run into problems. Google, which has its Play Music service, has a vested interest in keeping Apple Music off its system.\nThe most universally supported streaming service, unsurprisingly, is Spotify. With 40 million paid subscribers worldwide, companies need it to be compatibile with their products or they’re alienating the biggest chunk of the streaming market. Sonos, Amazon Echo, Google Home and Chromecast Audio all support it. The fast-growing Apple Music however, is limited to Sonos compatibility out of these systems.\nSo which one is best? \nThe best advice for buying a home audio system now is the same as it’s always been: listen to different devices in a store before you buy anything. However, if sound quality is your priority, don’t invest in Amazon Echo or Google Home – Sonos, an existing hi-fi system connected to Chromecast Audio or one of the many standalone Bluetooth speaker systems on the market will give you a markedly better listening experience for the same money.\nThere are also several other multi-room systems on the market: Sony, Samsung, Philips, LG, Bose and Denon offer their own product ecosystems if you don’t want to go with Sonos, but these also have no voice control. If you’re a Tidal subscriber and high resolution audio is important, then Bluesound has the edge over Sonos, which doesn’t support digital formats for audiophiles.\nIf you don’t care about sound quality, Google Home has arguably the better voice control system, but Amazon Echo will give you as much music as Spotify for just $3.99 a month. If the connected home aspect is important, but you don’t want to sacrifice sound quality however, there is one option. Sonos users will soon be able to control their devices with Amazon Echo speakers thanks to a recent partnership. The best option if you want good sound and voice-controlled multi-room system? Buy some Amazon Echo Dots and use those to control a Sonos system. Your ears will thank you, even if your wallet doesn’t.\nScott Wilson is on Twitter \nRead next: The 8 best budget turntables that won’t ruin your records \nThe post Which home audio system should I buy?

      "title": "Amazon Tackles Islamophobia In Heartwarming Christmas Ad",
      "text": "Amazon chose to highlight a moment of friendship between a Christian and a Muslim in their Christmas advertisement this year ― and it’s exactly the kind of interfaith solidarity the world needs to focus on right now.\nAmidst reports that Islamophobia is on the rise in the United Kingdom and the United States, the online retail giant launched an advertising campaign on Wednesday that promotes the message that you don’t need to follow the same religion to be a good friend to your neighbor.\nIn the ad, an imam pays a visit to his pal, who happens to be a priest. The pair catch up and joke about the aches and pains of old age. At the end of the visit, both coincidentally decide to purchase the same gift online for each other ― kneepads that help them kneel while they pray.\nAlthough the ad is scripted, its stars are real religious leaders from the U.K . The priest is Rev. Gary Bradley , vicar of a church in London, and the imam is Zubeir Hassam, principal of the Muslim School Oadby, in Leicester.\nAmazon YouTube The priest and imam featured in Amazon's 2016 Christmas ad are religious leaders in real life. Hassam told The Telegraph that even though it was a commercial, the script seemed to mirror his life.\n“This is what I do in the community – I didn’t do any acting I was just being myself,” he said . “With all the bad publicity we have got this is a very, very positive ad showing that people of different faiths can get together.”\nAccording to the Guardian , Amazon consulted with the Church of England, the Muslim Council of Great Britain and the Christian Muslim Forum to make sure that the commercial was respectful of each religious tradition.\n“We think it is an authentic and charming story,” said Simon Morris, director of advertising at Amazon. “We think it is a legitimate story. We are conscious that some people may be sensitive to it. It is about selflessness and thinking of other people.”\nChristmastime in the U.K. is a busy season for advertisers , with companies spending millions of dollars on campaigns and battling with each other to make the biggest splash. The BBC reports that retailers in the U.K. are expected to spend more than $6.9 million dollars on ads during the 2016 holiday season.\nThe campaign will run in the U.S., the U.K., and Germany this year.\nAlso on HuffPost A Human Chain Of Solidarity A Human Chain Of Solidarity 1 of 5 Share this slide:\nBenji Bear More: Muslim Christmas Amazon Interfaith Christian Suggest a correction ",

      "text": "\nAmazon continues to show interest in the auto industry.\nThe tech giant will sell vehicles in Italy via a new partnership with Fiat Chrysler, Reuters reported. Italian buyers will be able to purchase three Chrysler models — the 500, the Panda and the 500L — on Amazon with an “additional discount,” Reuters noted.\nAmazon will contact buyers after they click online and help them finalize the purchase at a physical dealership. It’s not clear if Amazon has its own inventory of vehicles. The entire process takes two weeks, Reuters reported.\nThis is another key step signaling Amazon’s ambitions for auto sales. In August, the company introduced Amazon Vehicles , a new section of its website that includes specifications, prices, images, videos, and customer reviews for thousands of new and classic cars. In addition, prospective buyers can ask owners questions about their cars.\nEarlier that month, Amazon unveiled a program called “Prime Now. Drive Now,” which lets L.A. and Orange County members of Amazon’s $99 per year Prime program book 45-to-60-minute test drives in the 2017 Hyundai Elantra. Members schedule test drives through Amazon’s Prime Now portal and are directed to a local dealership if they want to purchase.\nAmazon also has Amazon Automotive , which allows users to upload information about their vehicles and find the right parts to keep them up to speed.\nThe Amazon Vehicles announcement, the Hyundai partnership and recent deals to integrate the company’s digital assistant Alexa into various car brands point to the possibility that “Amazon is increasing its focus on the $1.2 trillion in annual new/used car sales,” reported Morgan Stanley in a note from August.\nMorgan Stanley also wrote that Amazon has a better chance of getting into used car sales, where it won’t be burdened by legal barriers like dealer franchise laws that prevent direct new car sales over the internet.\nAnd it’s not just vehicle sales that Amazon is interested in. Amazon’s streaming video service will begin airing a new series called The Grand Tour from ex-Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May. Here’s a tweet from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos this week:\nLong wait is over… Clarkson, Hammond, May are back… #TheGrandTour premieres tonight in UK, US, DE, JP. And globally in Dec. pic.twitter.com/dfQjGGuDFW \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \n",

In such tense times, popular retailer website Amazon sets a great example of interfaith solidarity via its latest Christmas commercial.\nThe ad showcases the warm friendship between a Christian priest and a Muslim Imam who also happen to be neighbours. In a heart-warming twist, both men coincidentally end up buying online the same gift for each other - kneepads that help them kneel while they pray.\nLet’s hope that other brands take cue and use their wide reach to spread love and positivity.\nClick on the link below to view the video:",

Amazon gives heartwarming message to religious intolerant world thru’ Christmas Ad November 20, 2016 Top Stories , World Leave a comment \nSpark of light in Darkness ! \nIn a world of Donald Trump, Modi, Netanhayu and many such people, Amazon thankfully came up with the message of religious tolerance high lightening a moment of friendship between a Christian and a Muslim in a Christmas Ad. The company released a new commercial this week highlighting a warm relationship between a priest and an Imam. Amidst increasing Islamophobic reports of religious intolerant incidents day by day especially in the United Kingdom and the United States, the online retail giant launched an advertising campaign on Wednesday that promotes the message that you don’t need to follow the same religion to be a good friend to your neighbor. \nIn the ad, an imam pays a visit to his pal, who happens to be a priest. They cracked jokes about the aches and pains of old age. At the end of the visit, both coincidentally decide to purchase the same gift online for each other kneepads that help them kneel while they pray. The priest is Rev. Gary Bradley, vicar of a church in London, and the Imam is Zubeir Hassam, Principal of the Muslim School Oadby, in Leicester. \n“This is what I do in the community – I didn’t do any acting I was just being myself,” Hassam told The Telegraph said. \n“With all the bad publicity we have got this is a very, very positive ad showing that people of different faiths can get together.” \nAccording to the Guardian, Amazon consulted with the Church of England, the Muslim Council of Great Britain and the Christian Muslim Forum to make sure that the commercial was respectful of each religious tradition. “We think it is an authentic and charming story,” said Simon Morris, director of advertising at Amazon. \n“We think it is a legitimate story. We are conscious that some people may be sensitive to it. It is about selflessness and thinking of other people.” \nChristmas time is a busy season for advertisers, with companies spending millions of dollars on campaigns and battling with each other to make the biggest splash.",

      "text": "View on Amazon The Netatmo Presence is an exceptionally good, easy to install outdoor security camera that can replace your porch light. Read TechHive's full review \nNetatmo's outdoor home security camera costs more than most because it does double duty as a porch light (an outdoor LED floodlight, actually). It connects to your Wi-Fi network, but must be hardwired to your home's electrical system. This is easy if you'll be replacing an existing porch light (provided you don't mind doing electrical work). The absence of subscription fees make the Presence less expensive in the long run, but it does cost quite a bit more up front than competing cameras. What to look for when shopping \nMost home security cameras perform the same basic functions—they detect an event, record the event, and send you an alert—but they don’t all perform them the same way. And some cameras have special features that go beyond those basics. Here are some common features you’ll encounter while shopping and why they’re important (we’ve listed them in alphabetical order). In each of the reviews that follow this buyers’ guide, we’ll discuss how each camera delivers on these features. \nAlerts: Home security cameras push notifications to your smartphone when they detect events. Without watching the live feed all day, this is the only way to keep tabs on your home in relative real time. Depending on the camera, it may send text alerts when it detects motion, sound, a face (known or unrecognized), or all three. Some can send alerts to multiple people, usually anyone else in the household using that product’s app; others will send emails in addition to text messages as a failsafe in the event you can’t access your mobile device. Flir \nThe Flir FX’s battery backup ensures the camera will continue to operate during a power outage. \nBattery backup : Power outages happen, and clever burglars cut electricity before breaking into your home. When that happens, your camera goes dark and, if there’s a crime taking place, you lose all forensic evidence. For this reason, some cameras can also run for a short time on battery power. It’s a feature worth looking for. \nCloud recording: Many manufacturers offer cloud storage plans with their camera. With one of these, your recorded video is sent to a remote server and stored for a predetermined time— usually anywhere from 24 hours to a week—and then deleted to make space for new videos. Though sometimes free, these cloud plans usually require a monthly subscription, but are worth it both for their convenience and if you want a surveillance record during a vacation or other extended time away from home. Netatmo \nThe Netatmo Welcome supports facial recognition and can alert you when people it doesn’t recognize come within its field of view ( our review ). \nFacial recognition : A few newer cameras are experimenting with facial recognition. This feature could more accurately be called “facial identification,” as in practice it’s much better at distinguishing a face from, say, a lamp, than it is at actually distinguishing between one person’s face from another’s. If you opt for a camera with this feature, know that it typically learns faces through increasing exposure to them, so be prepared to spend a lot of time in front of the lens. \nLocal storage: Some cameras include memory-card slots in lieu of, or in addition to, cloud storage, so you can store video right on the device. It’s an attractive feature as it can eliminate the cost of monthly storage fees. The downside (if there isn’t a cloud backup) is that if a crook steals your camera, he takes your forensic evidence with it. \nMobile app: Most of today’s home security camera’s are accessed primarily through a smartphone/tablet app. In addition to offering you a reliable way to view the camera’s live feed, it should offer plenty of options for customizing the way the camera performs. The ability to customize notifications, adjust motion and sound detection sensitivity, and set detection areas are some of the key features to look for. The app should also be intuitive and easy to master. Myfox \nAny home security camera worth its salt will support motion detection. \nMotion detection: Assuming you’re monitoring your home when it’s empty, motion detection is one of the most desirable features in a security camera. Built-in sensors pick up movement within the camera’s field of view and trigger video recording. Because these sensors are sensitive to any movement—event a shift in lighting or leaves blowing outside a window—it’s important the camera system also offer the ability to narrow the range of detection, adjust the sensor’s sensitivity, or otherwise customize this feature to cut down on false alerts. \nNight vision : Most break-ins occur after dark, so this feature is nearly as important as motion detection. Technically, most home security cameras support infrared LED illumination, versus true night vision based on image intensification or thermal vision. Be that as it may, some camera’s will switch to night vision automatically in low-light conditions, while others allow you to customize when and how it should be activated. \nPan/Tilt/Swivel : Most security cameras—including all the ones in this guide—can be manually tilted and swiveled to focus on a certain viewing area, but this is a purely set-it-and-forget it feature. A true pan/tilt camera is equipped with a motor so that you can move its lens—or even follow a moving object if you’re watching a live feed—using its app or browser-based app. Nest Labs \nThe Nest Labs Nest Cam delivers higher-than-typical 1080p video resolution. \nResolution: No amount of security video will help you if it’s blurry, jittery, or otherwise distorted. Look for a camera that offers the highest possible resolution. Most currently offer 720p (often referred to as “high definition” or HD), but some newer cameras are coming out with 1080p (often referred to as “full HD”). Keep in mind higher-res cameras use more Internet and Wi-Fi bandwidth and battery life. Many cameras also offer a software zoom feature (which is not the same thing as having a physical zoom lens). \nScheduling: Scheduling features allow you to tell the camera to turn on and off, detect motion, and/or send alerts at specified times. This is useful when you, say, only want to be notified when your kids get home from school or just want to monitor your home when you’re away. It also reduces the amount of false alerts. \nSecurity: There have been plenty of headlines about hackers compromising home cameras, baby monitors, and other Wi-Fi devices to spy on people, so be sure to check what steps has each manufacturer taken to eliminate this problem. Look for a camera that supports up-to-date wireless security protocols, such as WPA2, and make sure it encrypts Internet transmission of your your user name, your password, and the live feeds. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password. Logitech \nLogitech’s Circle home-security camera features two-way audio. \nTwo-way audio: While the idea of a security camera implies eyes-on monitoring, the ability to also hear what’s going on gives you a more complete picture of what’s happening on the home front when you’re away. It can also alert you to something occurring out of the camera’s field of vision. This feature can also allow you to speak through the camera, a great tool for remotely commanding an unruly pet or startling an intruder in the act, but be aware that you might need to plug in a powered speaker for this feature to work. \nViewing angle: The camera’s field of view determines how much it can see. As you’re probably monitoring a single room, you want a wideviewing angle. Most current cameras fall in the 130-degree range. These wide angles can sometimes cause image distortion at the edges in the form of a fisheye effect, particularly when used in smaller rooms, but it’s not like you’re going to use a security to capture snapshots for your photo album. \nWeb client: Many cameras can be accessed through a web portal as well. This is useful for times when you don’t have access to your mobile device or a wireless connection. The web app should closely mirror its mobile counterpart, so you don’t need to learn a whole new set of controls. \nWireless range : One of the benefits wireless cameras offer is the ability to move them around your home. Ideally, your home security camera should be able to maintain a Wi-Fi connection no matter how far you move it from your router, even in a large home. Some cameras come with an ethernet port as well, so you have the option of hardwiring it to your local network. A camera that supports power-over-ethernet (PoE) eliminates the need for an AC adapter and relies on just one cable (but your router or switch will also need to support PoE. Another alternative would be to use a POE injector.) Our home security camera reviews \nYou’ll find hands-on reviews of 10 of the latest home-security cameras attached to this buyers’ guide. We’ve improved our site navigation so that clicking on the product names below will take you directly to that review. \nAlternatively, you can use the navigation menu at the top of the story, labeled ‘More Stories in this Series.’ If you’d like to read each review one after the other, use the arrows at the bottom of each page. \nWe will expand this collection of reviews over the coming months and will add new definitions and features to look for as they come up.

      "text": "Amazon will host its first esports event for casual games on the Appstore next month Posted Announcing the finalists for the 10th Annual Crunchies Awards \nAmazon is expanding its investment in esports, with the announcement of its first-ever esports tournament focused on casual gaming to be hosted on its Amazon Appstore. Called the “ Champions of Fire Invitational ,” the event will bring together sixteen of the industry’s top video game streamers, who will compete for shares of a $100,000 cash prize on December 2nd, 2 to 9 PM PT. The event will be live-streamed to the Amazon-owned streaming site, Twitch. \nCBS Sports Network will also air a two-hour special with highlights from the event, and streams will be made available on Amazon.com, Amazon Fire TV, and other social media networks that offer livestreams, the company says. \nWhat’s interesting about this event is that it will be focused on casual gaming – a move that Amazon is likely hoping will entice a broader group of viewers to tune in. Typically, video game streaming and has skewed more towards younger, male viewers, according to data from Twitch . But that’s something the streaming network has been trying to change by launching channels for creative content, and airing specials from Bob Ross and Julia Child . \nThe participants in this new event will compete across five of the top-rated games in the casual gaming category, including Disney Crossy Road, Pac-Man 256, Bloons TD Battles, 8 Ball Pool, and the new Fruit Ninja Tournament Edition. The matches themselves will be face-paced, and each game has a $30,000 Grand Prize available. \nThe lineup of players includes several top names in esports, such as Boxbox, Professor Broman, Northernlion, lolRenaynay, Brian Kibler, and others. \nAmazon already has a number of investments in video gaming, and, more recently, we’ve seen it strengthening its ties with Twitch with more crossovers between the two companies. \nFor example, in September, Amazon showed off its first games built by Amazon Game Studios that featured direct integration with Twitch. These games, built on Amazon’s game engine platform for developers, Lumberyard, allow gamers to stream broadcasts in real-time, overlaid with stats, to Twitch’s video network. \nFollowing that news, Twitch rolled out its own variation on Amazon’s membership program, called Twitch Prime , which offers subscribers ad-free viewing, free loot, access to special features, like video uploads and clips on mobile, among other things. \nFor this new tournament, Amazon is partnering with eSports Productions to put on the event at Paris Las Vegas. Tickets to watch the tournament in person are available for free, from the event’s website here . \n“Competitive video gaming has seen huge growth, and we see tremendous customer value in expanding the tournament experience to include the casual mobile games played by millions of people today,” said Aaron Rubenson, Director, Amazon Appstore, in a statement about the esports tournament. “The Champions of Fire Invitational will see some of the top gaming pros square off in the same fun games our customers can download and enjoy today from the Amazon Appstore.” \nIn other words, Amazon is also using the event as a means of marketing is Appstore marketplace, by highlighting some of its top titles along with promoting the esports competition itself. 0",

      "text": "(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is exploring live sports streaming and has held talks with leagues including the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Football League for live game rights, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. Amazon has held discussions to create a premium, exclusive sports package with a Prime membership. However, details are still not clear, the Journal reported on Monday.\nThe e-commerce giant's Prime loyalty programme offers original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video, as well as one-hour delivery of purchases, for an annual fee of $99.\nAmazon has also reached out to smaller leagues such as Major League Soccer, the Atlantic Coast Conference, college sports network Campus Insiders, 120 Sports, National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse and World Surf League for game rights, according to the Journal.\nThe company has also contacted traditional TV networks for game rights they are not using, the report said. (http://on.wsj.com/2eZJ4dy)\nAmong those approached include Univision Communications Inc [UVN.UL] for Mexican football league games, Walt Disney Co's ESPN and ONE World Sports, the report said.\nAmazon, the NBA, the NFL and the Major League Baseball were not immediately available for comment.\n\"We don't comment on any partnership, potential or otherwise, until appropriate,\" World Surf League spokesman said.\nMLS confirmed the talks with Amazon but declined to comment further.\nACC, 120 Sports, NLL, MLL and Campus Insiders could not be immediately reached for comment.\nAmazon's move comes as sports fans increasingly rely on the internet to watch video at the expense of traditional cable and satellite connections.\nTech-giants such as Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc have signed up deals to beef up their video services.\nTwitter has a deal with the NFL to stream its Thursday night games during the 2016 regular season, while Facebook streamed some U.S. men's Olympic team games in partnership with the NBA.\n(Reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",

      "text": "Best Black Friday Deals at Amazon, Costco, Walmart Televisions iStockphoto \nAccording to NerdWallet, Costco will have a slew of TVs at highly competitive prices on sale during Black Friday weekend, including: \nVizio 70-inch class 4K Ultra HD LED LCD home theater display for $980. Vizio 65-inch class 4K Ultra HD LED LCD home theater display for $690. Samsung 65-inch class curved 4K SUHD smart LED LCD TV for $1,580. Samsung 40-inch class 4K Ultra HD Smart LED LCD TV for $290. LG 70-inch class 4K Ultra HD LED LCD TV for $1,100. \nShelton of FatWallet.com points to Walmart, which has 11 models in its doorbuster stable. Included in the collection are some red-hot 4K Ultra HDTVs, discounted for the first time this year at Walmart. Walmart’s deals include a Samsung 50-inch Smart 4KTV for $398 (shaving $230 off the regular price) and a “special buy” Phillips 55-inch Smart 4KTV for $298. (\"Special buy\" TVs may be manufactured exclusively for the retailer and come with fewer features.) \n“Traditionally, TVs are one of the best doorbuster deals to try to nab and this year 4K TV doorbusters will be very promising,” says Shelton. “This will be a good year to grab a TV doorbuster and step up to 4K at a big savings if you haven’t already. Expect to see a few stores offer doorbuster discounts on newer curved 4K OLED models, although folks should expect prices well above $1,000 for this new technology.” \nBased on personal experience, I’d roll with the 50-inch Samsung for $398. Glaser of DealNews.com agrees: “Not only is this deal $100 less than the best price we've seen for this set before, it's $37 below our Black Friday prediction.” \nMeanwhile, on Thanksgiving Day, Best Buy is offering a Toshiba 49-inch 4K UHD Google Cast Smart HDTV for $200. This year, the long-standing electronics retailer will open its doors at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day. Eager shoppers can pick up this high-definition television for more than half-off the retail price ($450), says Kristin Cook, a shopping expert at BensBargains.com.",

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase.\nAmazon\nIf you're in the market for a budget-priced, full-size tablet, Amazon has just released an updated version of the Fire HD 8 . This year's model has three big hardware improvements: 50% more RAM, more battery life, and double the internal storage. There's also a cool software feature that's now available.\nRAM is system memory, having more of it means you'll be able to load applications more quickly. It'll also be able to keep things like browser tabs open for longer. More storage means you'll be able to fit more movies, music, and books on your device without having to upgrade your storage. That said, you can always pop in a MicroSD card if need be. More battery life is self explanatory; the Fire HD 8 now gets 12-hours worth, more than enough to last through an entire international flight.\nThe big software change, which is now avilable to the entire Fire Tablet line, is Alexa support. Alexa works on Fire tablets the same way Siri works on iOS devices. You can ask Alexa questions about the world around you, to play your favorite song, or load your latest must-have app. If you've never used Alexa before, you're in for a treat. I use an Amazon Echo , and it's been a game changer for me.\nBesides that, everything has stayed the same, which is a good thing because the 8-inch Fire HD was already a pretty solid product. It has a quad-core processor, stereo speakers, front- and back-facing cameras, and an HD screen. I used my first Fire tablet a few months ago and came away impressed. Amazon makes good hardware with excellent software. Of course, the best way to get the most out of an Amazon tablet is being a part of their ecosystem.\nSo if you're a Prime member , you'll instantly have access to millions of songs and movies.

      "title": "Marshall Kilburn Bluetooth speaker review: Vintage style and throwback sound",
      "text": "on Amazon The Marshall Kilburn is a fun, bold, vintage-style–and vintage sounding–Bluetooth speaker. \n“That’s a Bluetooth speaker? That looks so cool,” was the first thing my wife said when she saw the Marshall on our counter-top. Of the half-dozen or so Bluetooth speakers I’ve had in for review over the past several months, none have struck up as much conversation as the Marshall Kilburn. The only other speaker I’ve had in for review that’s garnered as much attention has been MartinLogan’s sleek Crescendo. \nFans of Marshall guitar amps will want to know, however, that the company behind the famous Marshall Stack doesn’t actually build this speaker. The amplifier manufacturer licensed its brand to a third party, Zound Industries, the Swedish company behind Urbanears headphones. \nBut that doesn’t take away from the Marshall Kilburn’s ability to command your attention. It’s old-school style is both retro and edgy. Lifting the Kilburn, you’re immediately taken by it’s density. Something can feel heavy but not be dense . The Kilburn feels totally solid, like the analog amplifier head unit it resembles. That bulk makes the included imitation leather strap, which has a smooth velour underside, all the more useful. The strap attaches to each side with brass-colored buckles and a prominent hex-key rounded screw. \nThere’s nothing dainty or understated about the Kulburn. Give the Kilburn an evening gown to wear and it’ll come out of the dressing room wearing leather combat boots. Theo Nicolakis \nThe Marshall Kilburn’s rotary knobs and toggle power switch add to the speaker’s vintage flair. \nThe speaker’s main controls, located on the top, protrude from a brushed, gold-colored face plate recessed in thick, imitation leather that hugs the Kilburn’s circumference. Smooth-operating rotary knobs adjust volume, bass, and treble. The latter two are an endangered species on modern portable speakers. An old-school toggle switch turns the unit on and off. An audible “click” lets you know the control is engaged. Capacitive touch controls have no place here. Even the slightly protruding buttons for source selection and Bluetooth pairing give you both a tactile and audible cue that the Kilburn has granted your desire. The design is straightforward, unmistakable, and gets the job done immediately. There are no hierarchical menus, no multiple taps, and no frills. I love it. Under the hood \nThe Kilburn is a rear-ported design with two 3/4-inch dome tweeters and a single, four-inch woofer crossed at 4200Hz. The drivers are powered by Class D amplifiers and the system’s stated frequency range is 62Hz to 20KHz. \nThe Kilburn’s rechargeable battery boasts a strong 20 hours of run time if you’re using it at 50 percent volume. Bluetooth 4.0 and a 3.5mm input are the only two options for feeding this vintage-styled speaker, but there is no aptX support. There’s also no companion app, so you don’t get the added features of stereo pairing, EQ, or other enhancements that a few of the competing Bluetooth speakers in this price range offer. Theo Nicolakis \nThe velour-lined strap is slick and stylish. \nThe Kilburn has rubber feet that elevate the speaker about a half-inch and do a good job of isolating the cabinet from whatever surface you place it on. The feet could also be a lifesaver should you spill something next to the speaker, as it’s not rated for water resistance. Don’t like my attitude? Tough \nI don’t know quite why, but I liked this speaker despite the many reasons I shouldn’t. It is by no means the best-sounding Bluetooth speaker I’ve auditioned lately; it’s certainly not the most accurate. It exhibits a consistently two-dimensional, flat sound with restrained dynamics and off-axis coloration. \nDespite all of that, I found it fun to listen to every time I turned it on. Its vintage look is matched by an uncommonly vintage sound, reminding you that music is an experience. Bass lines were smooth and sounded just right. Played through a Pioneer XDP-100R digital audio player, the 192kHz/24-bit FLAC version of The Police’s classic cut, “Every Breath You Take,” from Synchronicity, and the 48kHz/24-bit FLAC version of Meghan Trainor’s “All about that Bass,” from her album Title , served up classic examples. (Bluetooth speakers don’t stream high-res bitstreams, they down-sample them, so don’t let the source material confuse you.) Both songs were smooth and balanced, neither too punchy nor too reserved. \nSure, the Kilburn doesn’t have the same “thwap” that the Oppo Sonica , Bose Soundlink III or JBL Xtreme do, but oddly I never longed for it either. The Kilburn presents bass notes as foundational musical elements, as opposed to making bass become that guy who needs to be the center of attention at every party. Theo Nicolakis \nYou can control both bass and treble on the unit—a feature that you don’t often see in powered speakers. \nDuring my listening sessions, I also noted that the Kilburn never over-emphasized a piano’s or a guitar’s body, as some other Bluetooth speakers tend to do. Over-emphasizing an instrument’s body may initially give a euphonic impression, but it gets fatiguing very quickly. For example, the guitar on Simon & Garfunkel’s “The Boxer” always knew its place. \nPlaying the MQA version of “Lush Life,” from Lady Gaga's and Tony Bennett’s Cheek to Cheek , the Kilburn didn't reproduce the song with pristine accuracy, but it did capture its emotion. For example, the accompanying piano’s high notes were a bit syrupy without the characteristic crispness striking the ivory keys produces. Cymbals likewise took a polite back seat on the sound stage. Nevertheless, I found myself surprisingly engaged with the music playing in the background even though it exhibited a clearly boxy sound. \nRocking to Tom Petty’s “Here Comes My Girl” or jazzing it down to Grover Washington Jr’s “Winelight” showed that the Marshall loved these genres. The saxophone in “Winelight” was smooth and warm even though it gave ground on the top end. While the Kilburn is a rear-ported design, placing it right against a wall surprisingly didn’t turn bass lines into a muddy, boomy mess. Marshall \nThe Kilburn is a rear-ported design. \nIf you’re wondering how the Kilburn would play at a party or outdoors, you’ll be happy to know it will get along pretty well, but it won’t top our best performers in this category. It didn’t quite get to the same ear-bursting levels that the UE Megaboom or JBL Xtreme could reach. I also wouldn’t recommend cranking up both the source and the Kilburn to max at the same time. If you do, this speaker will get a bit harsh. While you could argue that’s vintage sound, that’s the one aspect of vintage I can do without. TechHive Recommends \nIf you like your music and and your gear old style, you will simply fall in love with the Marshall Kilburn. It’s a smart, spunky speaker with plenty of attitude. The audiophile in me won’t use this speaker for reference and, from a purist point of view, the Kilburn has its sonic shortcomings. But you know what? The Kilburn doesn’t care. It simply rocks, on its own terms. Whether you’ll find those terms acceptable is a different story. To comment on this article and other TechHive content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

      "text": "\nThe certainty behind video games on Black Friday (and the lead-up to it) is that it'll be the year's biggest titles that are on sale. It's expected that the likes of Titanfall , Battlefield , and Gears of War  will all be discounted, usually heavily.\nMaybe it's the calm before the storm, but some of the more interesting Wednesday sales are from some of the more unexpected places. Games like Steamworld Collection  and Assault Suit Leynos  are featured. Of course, plenty of stuff that started yesterday  is also here, so it isn't like it's only lesser-known titles that are the gems.\nAlso worth noting is that some Steam hardware went on sale too. The wacky Steam controller and the Steam link both have their prices slashed, making this the perfect opportunity to finally see what those are all about.\nThat's about it for Wednesday, a/k/a The Last Day Before Thanksgiving, a/k/a The Day Before Shit Gets Bananas. And, hear you me, it's gonna get bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S.",

      "title": "Judge orders striking pilots delivering Amazon cargo back to work",
      "text": "By DAVID KOENIG and MAE ANDERSON  06PM NEW YORK -- A federal judge on Wednesday ordered pilots for a cargo airline that delivers Amazon packages to go back to work.The judge in Cincinnati said that it was in the public's interest to end the strike because holiday shoppers expect to receive their packages on time.\"Imagine Christmas without Amazon!\" U.S. District Court Judge Timothy S. Black wrote in his ruling.About 250 pilots for ABX Air went on strike early Tuesday in a dispute over working conditions and time off. Dozens of flights and more than 1 million pounds of cargo were held up.The airline went to court to end the strike, saying its timing threatened to leave millions of dollars' worth of freight undelivered to homes and stores during the Christmas shopping season.ABX parent Air Transport Services Group Inc. said pilots would begin returning to work Wednesday night. The Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike was causing ABX to cancel about 75 flights a day. Besides Amazon, ABX's other major customer is Deutsche Post AG's DHL delivery service.Analysts said an extended strike would have forced Amazon to put more of its deliveries in the hands of UPS, FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service.The strike's impact would be short-lived - a few days, said Satish Jindel, president of logistics adviser SJ Consulting Group. \"I don't think it's going to disrupt e-commerce or Amazon,\" he said.Even before the judge's ruling, Morningstar retail analyst R.J. Hottovy noted that Amazon and other retailers have contingency plans to deal with disruptions of any sort - from weather to strikes - during the holidays. Amazon has spread its deliveries among a larger number of carriers, from the post office down to small providers, he said.Amazon has been trying to reduce its dependence on UPS and FedEx since those companies delivered millions of packages late during the 2013 holiday season. This year, Amazon leased planes from ABX and another cargo carrier, Atlas Air, and began building its own ground-transport system.The surge in online shopping - which is growing faster than in-store shopping - and promises of free shipping have put additional stress on delivery companies like ABX.The ABX pilots say management violated their contract to keep planes flying. The union says the company is denying vacation time for some pilots and compensatory time off for others just to keep all its planes flying.\"We are doing all sorts of emergency shifts because we don't have enough people,\" said Tim Jewell, a union officer who flies Boeing 767 jets for ABX. \"It's taking a tremendous toll on our families.\"Jewell said pilots will abide by the judge's order and return to work, \"but manning and staffing will continue to be a problem.\"ABX argued that the union was violating federal law by conducting a strike before checking off the necessary steps that federal law requires before a work stoppage in the airline industry.ABX President John Starkovich said the company would continue negotiations and arbitration to settle its differences with the union.Labor relations at railroads and airlines are governed by a federal law that dates to the 1920s and makes strikes difficult. Most airlines haven't had a strike in many years, although pilots for Spirit Airlines walked off the job in 2010. Related Topics:",

Dozens of flights and more than 1 million pounds of cargo were held up.\nThe airline went to court to end the strike, saying its timing threatened to leave millions of dollars' worth of freight undelivered to homes and stores during the Christmas shopping season.\nABX parent Air Transport Services Group Inc. said pilots would begin returning to work Wednesday night. The Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike was causing ABX to cancel about 75 flights a day. Besides Amazon, ABX's other major customer is Deutsche Post AG's DHL delivery service.\nAmazon and Google want you to get a digital home assistant for Christmas — even if you didn't ask for one Tracey Lien The holidays have traditionally been an important time for the consumer tech world, with electronics makers placing big bets that shoppers will venture into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales with open minds and open wallets.\nBut for some manufacturers, this year might be more important than others.\n... The holidays have traditionally been an important time for the consumer tech world, with electronics makers placing big bets that shoppers will venture into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales with open minds and open wallets.\nBut for some manufacturers, this year might be more important than others.\n... (Tracey Lien) Analysts said an extended strike would have forced Amazon to put more of its deliveries in the hands of UPS , FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service.\nThe strike's impact would be short-lived — a few days, said Satish Jindel, president of logistics adviser SJ Consulting Group. \"I don't think it's going to disrupt e-commerce or Amazon,\" he said.\nEven before the judge's ruling, Morningstar retail analyst R.J. Hottovy noted that Amazon and other retailers have contingency plans to deal with disruptions of any sort — from weather to strikes — during the holidays. Amazon has spread its deliveries among a larger number of carriers, from the post office down to small providers, he said.\nAmazon has been trying to reduce its dependence on UPS and FedEx since those companies delivered millions of packages late during the 2013 holiday season. This year, Amazon leased planes from ABX and another cargo carrier, Atlas Air, and began building its own ground-transport system.\nThe surge in online shopping — which is growing faster than in-store shopping — and promises of free shipping have put additional stress on delivery companies like ABX.\nThe ABX pilots say management violated their contract to keep planes flying. The union says the company is denying vacation time for some pilots and compensatory time off for others just to keep all its planes flying.\n\"We are doing all sorts of emergency shifts because we don't have enough people,\" said Tim Jewell, a union officer who flies Boeing 767 jets for ABX. \"It's taking a tremendous toll on our families.\"\nJewell said pilots will abide by the judge's order and return to work, \"but manning and staffing will continue to be a problem.\"\nABX argued that the union was violating federal law by conducting a strike before checking off the necessary steps that federal law requires before a work stoppage in the airline industry.\nABX President John Starkovich said the company would continue negotiations and arbitration to settle its differences with the union.\nLabor relations at railroads and airlines are governed by a federal law that dates to the 1920s and makes strikes difficult. Most airlines haven't had a strike in many years, although pilots for Spirit Airlines walked off the job in 2010.\nAssociated Press\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune UPS International Brotherhood of Teamsters",

      "text": "Best 'Black Friday' 2016 Deals: Amazon, Apple, Best Buy, Target And Walmart   Samsung Is Going To Include An Ai Assistant In Its Next Phone \nBlack Friday is nearly here and to celebrate, I have rounded up all the best deals from my guides to Amazon, , , And Walmart to present the best of the best. Let’s break them down: \nNote: my thanks to BestBlackFriday.com which has worked with me to collate these deals and create order from the inevitable annual chaos Black Friday 2016 has some fantastic offers and some you should avoid. Image credit: Target via BestBlackFriday \nStar Buys Toshiba 49-inch LED 4K Ultra HDTV w/ Built-in Chromecast (49L621U) for $199.99 (save $250) – Best Buy Phillips 55-inch Class Smart 4K UHDTV for $298 – Walmart – a standard brand at a stunning price \nBlack Friday general TV tip: always remember to check the specific TV model when retailers release them before making a purchase. Even the best manufacturers have weak models in their line-up that you are better off avoiding, so do your research. Any iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus – get up to a $250 Best Buy Gift Card with installment billing agreement with Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T – Best Buy – a massive gift card win iPad Pro 9.7″ starting at $449 (save $150.99) – Target - the cheapest iPad Pro deal iPad Air 2 (All Models) for $125 Off - Best Buy - as above Apple Watch Series 1 starting at $198 (save $71.99) – Target – Best best Series 1 deal, $22 less than Best Buy. There are no Series 2 discounts this Black Friday from any retailer Samsung Galaxy S7 or S7 Edge + $250 Gift Card + Samsung Gear VR Headset + $50 Oculus Content Pack with activation of the phone – Target – beats Best Buy’s similar deal as it includes the $50 Oculus Content Pack Microsoft 12.3″ Surface Pro 4 Bundle with Signature Type Cover for $599.99 (save $400) – Best Buy - a ‘Doorbuster’ worthy of the name Xbox One S 1TB Battlefield 1 Special Edition Bundle + Xbox Wireless Controller for $299.99 (save $114.99) – Best Buy – the extra controller deal is hidden but comes free with any 1TB bundle making this a winner Xbox One S 500 GB Battlefield 1 Bundle + Gears of War 4 + Extra Controller for $249.99 (save $170) – Dell - not from the retailers listed, but added as it is too good to miss and far above the standard $250 Black Friday deal for one game and a single controller Sony PlayStation 4 Uncharted 4 Bundle + Ratchet and Clank and The Last of Us (Remastered) Games for $249.99 (save $50) – Best Buy - two additional games compared to the standard $250 bundle DJI Phantom 3 Standard Drone for $369 (save $130) – Walmart – a red hot product and $30 cheaper than the next best deal Amazon Tap for $89.99 (save $40) – Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet for $74.99 (save $25) – Amazon – was $84.99 for Black Friday 2015 Walmart Black Friday gaming offers are strong in 2016. Image credit: Walmart via BestBlackFriday \nSolid Deals \nThe best of the Solid Deals. While the offers above are truly superb, these deals are too good to leave behind if you’re interested in any of these products: Apple iPhone SE starting at $9.99/mo. for 24 months, 0% APR for qualified Verizon, Sprint, and AT&T customers – Best Buy LG 40-inch 1080p LED HDTV (40LH5000) for $149.99 (save $130) – Best Buy Xbox One S 500GB Minecraft Favorites Bundle for $249.99 (save $50) – Best Buy PlayStation 4 Slim 500GB Uncharted 4 Bundle for $249.99 (save $50) – Target HP 15.6″ Laptop w/ AMD A10 Quad Core Processor for $259.99 (save $140) – Target Roku Express Plus for $25 (save $14) – Walmart DJI Phantom 4 White Quadcopter for $999.99 (save $200) – Best Buy FitBit Charge 2 for $129 (save $20) – Walmart - a price you will also found widely elsewhere, but still a solid deal FitBit Alta for $99 (save $30) – Walmart – as above Best Buy iPhone deals are strong, but watch out for some weaker iPad and Apple Watch offers. Image credit: Best Buy via BestBlackFriday \nTreat With Caution \nAlong with the best of the best comes the worst of the worst. When shopping this Black Friday be very care to avoid these deals, for the following reasons: Apple Watch Series 2 starting at $369 – Best Buy (and others) - misleading as this is not a discount, but the standard retail price. Take $105 in Kohl’s Cash if you want to pay $369 for the Series 2 now iPad Pro 9.7″ Tablet (All Models) for $125 Off - Best Buy - Target offers this for $150.99 off, so why pay more? iPad Mini 2 32GB for $199 (save $70) – Walmart – an old model likely to be discontinued in early 2017. Put the money towards a Star Buy iPad deal instead Otterbox Defender for Samsung and Apple for $25 (save $14.96) – Walmart – regularly on sale throughout the year for under $15 Alcatel POP 4 Plus 16GB 4G LTE Unlocked Cell Phone for $49.99 (save $100) – Best Buy – a mediocre phone with poor storage. Put the money towards a better smartphone offer Xbox 360 500GB Forza Horizon 2 Bundle for $129 (save $50) – Walmart – an old, dead console available pre-owned from GameStop for $50 after rebate. Ignore when a new Xbox One S 500GB bundle costs just $120 more Google Chromecast for $25 (save $10) – can be found cheaper in the off season 32-inch 720p LED TV, $69.99 – Amazon – very cheap, but no brand mentioned (see Black Friday TV tip above and there are simply too many great, premium brand TV offers available this year to risk this Insignia 7-inch Portable DVD Player with Swivel Screen for $39.99 (save $40) – Best Buy – a largely dead product category and not a premium brand RCA 9-in. Portable DVD Player for $53.99 (save $36) – Target – as above, and poor customer rating as well \nFor a full breakdown of Black Friday deals at Amazon, Apple, Best Buy, Target, Walmart plus eBay, Microsoft and Samsung please find the links below: \nBlack Friday Guides On Forbes",

These are Amazon's best deals you can get before Black Friday Nov. 24, 2016, 12:05 AM 11,798 \nThe Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nAmazon \nThe biggest shopping week of the year is here! \nAs usual, Amazon is leading the charge for the online e-commerce space with thousands of expected \"lightning\" deals. Not far behind are stores like Walmart and Target. They're ramping up their online deals in the hopes of giving The Everything Store a run for its money this holiday season. \nThat said, it's still difficult to compete with Amazon. The company has a seemingly endless stream of Black Friday deals being released on a staggered schedule from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, with new offers appearing as often as every five minutes. \nSince not all of these deals are created equal, the Insider Picks team is doing its best to separate the duds from the big-ticket items actually worth buying — so you don’t have to. \nIf you need some general holiday shopping help, we've put together a lot of holiday gift guides for specific products and categories. So if you're thinking about picking up a drone , a Bluetooth speaker , something for your favorite geek or iPhone lover, or music lover , you're in luck. \nWe also have guides specifically to hit certain budgets, so if you're looking for a great tech gift for under $100, or a great gift from any category for under $50, we have you covered. \nOur guides even cover some good do's and don'ts for holiday shopping and some good gift ideas for people who might be harder to shop for, like your coworkers or your father-in-law . \nIf you're looking for the best deals right now , keep refreshing this page, we'll be making sure those deals are on this list. \nThis story is developing. Bookmark this page and stay tuned for Insider Pick's Black Friday coverage on November 25, 2016.",

      "title": "Judge orders striking cargo pilots back to work: &apos;Imagine Christmas without Amazon!&apos;",
      "text": "A federal judge on Wednesday ordered pilots for a cargo airline that delivers Amazon packages to go back to work.\nThe judge in Cincinnati said that it was in the public's interest to end the strike because holiday shoppers expect to receive their packages on time.\n\"Imagine Christmas without Amazon!\" U.S. District Court Judge Timothy S. Black wrote in his ruling.\nAbout 250 pilots for ABX Air went on strike early Tuesday in a dispute over working conditions and time off. Dozens of flights and more than 1 million pounds of cargo were held up.\nThe airline went to court to end the strike, saying its timing threatened to leave millions of dollars' worth of freight undelivered to homes and stores during the Christmas shopping season.\nABX parent Air Transport Services Group Inc. said pilots would begin returning to work Wednesday night. The Teamsters union, which represents the pilots, said the strike was causing ABX to cancel about 75 flights a day. Besides Amazon, ABX's other major customer is Deutsche Post AG's DHL delivery service.\nAmazon and Google want you to get a digital home assistant for Christmas — even if you didn't ask for one Tracey Lien The holidays have traditionally been an important time for the consumer tech world, with electronics makers placing big bets that shoppers will venture into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales with open minds and open wallets.\nBut for some manufacturers, this year might be more important than others.\n... The holidays have traditionally been an important time for the consumer tech world, with electronics makers placing big bets that shoppers will venture into Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales with open minds and open wallets.\nBut for some manufacturers, this year might be more important than others.\n... (Tracey Lien) Analysts said an extended strike would have forced Amazon to put more of its deliveries in the hands of UPS , FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service.\nThe strike's impact would be short-lived — a few days, said Satish Jindel, president of logistics adviser SJ Consulting Group. \"I don't think it's going to disrupt e-commerce or Amazon,\" he said.\nEven before the judge's ruling, Morningstar retail analyst R.J. Hottovy noted that Amazon and other retailers have contingency plans to deal with disruptions of any sort — from weather to strikes — during the holidays. Amazon has spread its deliveries among a larger number of carriers, from the post office down to small providers, he said.\nAmazon has been trying to reduce its dependence on UPS and FedEx since those companies delivered millions of packages late during the 2013 holiday season. This year, Amazon leased planes from ABX and another cargo carrier, Atlas Air, and began building its own ground-transport system.\nThe surge in online shopping — which is growing faster than in-store shopping — and promises of free shipping have put additional stress on delivery companies like ABX.\nThe ABX pilots say management violated their contract to keep planes flying. The union says the company is denying vacation time for some pilots and compensatory time off for others just to keep all its planes flying.\n\"We are doing all sorts of emergency shifts because we don't have enough people,\" said Tim Jewell, a union officer who flies Boeing 767 jets for ABX. \"It's taking a tremendous toll on our families.\"\nJewell said pilots will abide by the judge's order and return to work, \"but manning and staffing will continue to be a problem.\"\nABX argued that the union was violating federal law by conducting a strike before checking off the necessary steps that federal law requires before a work stoppage in the airline industry.\nABX President John Starkovich said the company would continue negotiations and arbitration to settle its differences with the union.\nLabor relations at railroads and airlines are governed by a federal law that dates to the 1920s and makes strikes difficult. Most airlines haven't had a strike in many years, although pilots for Spirit Airlines walked off the job in 2010.\nAssociated Press\nCopyright © 2016, Hartford Courant UPS International Brotherhood of Teamsters",
