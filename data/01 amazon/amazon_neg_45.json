      "text": "By Sophie Tatum\n(CNN) — An ornament being sold on Amazon is receiving some unique criticism because of its political nature.\nThe product — which is now listed as “currently unavailable” — is a “Make America Great Again” hat ornament. The hat won notice during the Donald Trump presidential campaign — with Trump himself wearing the headgear on many occasions over the course of his White House bid.\nHowever, the ornament’s reviews on Amazon have become somewhat of a sounding board and venting outlet for critics of the President-elect.\n“Came with an entire crate of white hood ornaments. Great bargain! Downside: My tree is now on fire,” a user under the name Shaenon K. Garrity posted.\nAnother Amazon user wrote, “It was really strange. Once I put it on the tree, the message on it changed.”\nHowever, not all comments were critical.\n“Made my Christmas tree great again!” wrote one user who gave the product five stars.\nAs of Thursday afternoon, the product had 1.3 stars out of 5 from customer reviews.",

      "title": "China takes on Amazon’s Echo with the LingLong DingDong smart home device",
      "text": "linglong dingdong chinas response echo ta More China’s smart home market is anticipated to reach $22.8 billion by 2018, so it’s no wonder they have their virtual assistant. The LingLong DingDong is China’s answer to the Amazon Echo with Alexa.\nSimilar to the Echo, the LingLong can track schedules, play music, and give information about the weather and stocks. This powerful little tool could help introduce voice-activated technology including the Echo into Chinese markets.\nIts design is simple, standing 9.5 inches tall and weighing only three pounds. It features a round top that transitions into a square base and comes in three different colors. Everything about the design is meaningful. The physical design is meant to represent the idea that heaven is round and earth is square, a concept that is central to the design language of the LingLong. The colors also have various meanings: white for purity and red for posterity.\nThe device costs the equivalent of $118 and is available in two languages: Mandarin and Cantonese. Due to the complex nature of each language, it was not feasible to feature them both within the same device. With all the variety in dialect and accent, achieving 100 percent voice recognition was a challenge, but the creators are confident that at least 95 percent of users will be understood.\nMore: Control the new Neato smart vacuum by voice via Alexa\nView photos\nlinglong-dingdong_1 More While development of the LingLong was already underway when the Amazon Echo made its debut in 2014, the creators still looked to the device for inspiration. While they were unable to obtain a physical Echo, they were able to learn from the marketing materials provided by Amazon.\nCharlie Liu, LingLong’s senior marketing manager, said, “Their launch influenced us a lot.” While the LingLong is primarily used to stream music, the company is looking toward the future. They will be unable to expand without third-party support such as Amazon has received for the Echo. Where LingLong has about 10 third-party services, Amazon boasts more than 4,000.\nThe device is not without its setbacks with some users reporting challenges connecting to Wi-Fi and being challenged by certain speech limitations, but they hope with the support of other companies they can continue to improve. The company hopes that one day Amazon will want to launch Echo in China and could use their existing voice engine to do so.\nAs Matt Damon scales ‘The Great Wall,’ China is building a bridge to Hollywood Primed for growth?

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nOK, so on Thanksgiving there are certain blessings you’re contractually obliged to be thankful for. However, one thing we would love to be in the position to be grateful for would be owning our very own fully stocked game room — complete with pinball machines, pool tables, and maybe even a working jukebox thrown in for good measure.\nThat’s where U.K.-based game room specialists Liberty Games come in . And they’ve just come up with a way to make our dream basement even dreamier by adding an Amazon Echo, Raspberry Pi and Logitech Harmony Hub to it. The result? A smart game room you can bring to life with just your voice.\n“We picked some of our most popular products for the demo,” Stuart Kerr, head of digital at Liberty Games, told Digital Trends. “We modified a pool table by adding a Raspberry Pi into the mix so that you can release the balls with a voice command. We also set up the arcade machine so you can fire up a credit and pinball machine that can fire off a ball. Finally, we rigged up the jukebox — because it looks so cool when it pulls out a CD on command.”\nMore: Is there an Echo in here? How Google Home compares to Amazon’s Bluetooth speaker\nThe demo was created as part of a fun ‘hack’ by members of the team, but Kerr said it’s a service they would certainly be willing to offer any customers looking to add a bit of extra flair to their geek cave. He noted that it is also something that is far more manageable with 2016-era tech than it would have been even a few years back.\n“If you go back a couple of years before the Echo came out, this could easily have added an extra $10,000 on top of the cost of the games room to set up a bespoke system for doing this,” he said. “With the technology as it is today, an Echo costs [$180] and a Raspberry Pi cost is just [$35]. It’s made it much more affordable.”\nThe team’s not stopping here, either. “There are some dart boards with pressure sensors built into them,” Kerr continued. “We think it would be possible to have one recognize your score when you throw a dart and then to have that fed back through the Echo.”\nWell, we’re sold! Just tell us who we make the check out to.\nAmazon is having a 1-day sale on the Echo, $40 off We have a Raspberry Pi 3 bundle deal for everyone This $115 Raspberry Pi 3 bundle has everything you need to start your DIY journey",

      "text": "An ornament being sold on Amazon is receiving some unique criticism because of its political nature.\nThe product — which is now listed as “currently unavailable” — is a “Make America Great Again” hat ornament. The hat won notice during the Donald Trump presidential campaign — with Trump himself wearing the headgear on many occasions over the course of his White House bid.\nHowever, the ornament’s reviews on Amazon have become somewhat of a sounding board and venting outlet for critics of the President-elect.\n“Came with an entire crate of white hood ornaments. Great bargain! Downside: My tree is now on fire,” a user under the name Shaenon K. Garrity posted.\nAnother Amazon user wrote, “It was really strange. Once I put it on the tree, the message on it changed.”\nHowever, not all comments were critical.\n“Made my Christmas tree great again!” wrote one user who gave the product five stars.\nAs of Thursday afternoon, the product had 1.3 stars out of 5 from customer reviews.",

      "text": "linglong dingdong chinas response echo ta More China’s smart home market is anticipated to reach $22.8 billion by 2018, so it’s no wonder they have their virtual assistant. The LingLong DingDong is China’s answer to the Amazon Echo with Alexa.\nSimilar to the Echo, the LingLong can track schedules, play music, and give information about the weather and stocks. This powerful little tool could help introduce voice-activated technology including the Echo into Chinese markets.\nIts design is simple, standing 9.5 inches tall and weighing only three pounds. It features a round top that transitions into a square base and comes in three different colors. Everything about the design is meaningful. The physical design is meant to represent the idea that heaven is round and earth is square, a concept that is central to the design language of the LingLong. The colors also have various meanings: white for purity and red for posterity.\nThe device costs the equivalent of $118 and is available in two languages: Mandarin and Cantonese. Due to the complex nature of each language, it was not feasible to feature them both within the same device. With all the variety in dialect and accent, achieving 100 percent voice recognition was a challenge, but the creators are confident that at least 95 percent of users will be understood.\nMore: Control the new Neato smart vacuum by voice via Alexa\nlinglong-dingdong_1 More While development of the LingLong was already underway when the Amazon Echo made its debut in 2014, the creators still looked to the device for inspiration. While they were unable to obtain a physical Echo, they were able to learn from the marketing materials provided by Amazon.\nCharlie Liu, LingLong’s senior marketing manager, said, “Their launch influenced us a lot.” While the LingLong is primarily used to stream music, the company is looking toward the future. They will be unable to expand without third-party support such as Amazon has received for the Echo. Where LingLong has about 10 third-party services, Amazon boasts more than 4,000.\nThe device is not without its setbacks with some users reporting challenges connecting to Wi-Fi and being challenged by certain speech limitations, but they hope with the support of other companies they can continue to improve. The company hopes that one day Amazon will want to launch Echo in China and could use their existing voice engine to do so.\nAs Matt Damon scales ‘The Great Wall,’ China is building a bridge to Hollywood Primed for growth?

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nOK, so on Thanksgiving there are certain blessings you’re contractually obliged to be thankful for. However, one thing we would love to be in the position to be grateful for would be owning our very own fully stocked game room — complete with pinball machines, pool tables, and maybe even a working jukebox thrown in for good measure. \nThat’s where U.K.-based game room specialists Liberty Games come in . And they’ve just come up with a way to make our dream basement even dreamier by adding an Amazon Echo, Raspberry Pi and Logitech Harmony Hub to it. The result? A smart game room you can bring to life with just your voice. \n“We picked some of our most popular products for the demo,” Stuart Kerr, head of digital at Liberty Games, told Digital Trends. “We modified a pool table by adding a Raspberry Pi into the mix so that you can release the balls with a voice command. We also set up the arcade machine so you can fire up a credit and pinball machine that can fire off a ball. Finally, we rigged up the jukebox — because it looks so cool when it pulls out a CD on command.” \nMore: Is there an Echo in here? How Google Home compares to Amazon’s Bluetooth speaker \nThe demo was created as part of a fun ‘hack’ by members of the team, but Kerr said it’s a service they would certainly be willing to offer any customers looking to add a bit of extra flair to their geek cave. He noted that it is also something that is far more manageable with 2016-era tech than it would have been even a few years back. \n“If you go back a couple of years before the Echo came out, this could easily have added an extra $10,000 on top of the cost of the games room to set up a bespoke system for doing this,” he said. “With the technology as it is today, an Echo costs [$180] and a Raspberry Pi cost is just [$35]. It’s made it much more affordable.” \nThe team’s not stopping here, either. “There are some dart boards with pressure sensors built into them,” Kerr continued. “We think it would be possible to have one recognize your score when you throw a dart and then to have that fed back through the Echo.” \nWell, we’re sold! Just tell us who we make the check out to.",

      "text": "The Insider Picks team writes about stuff we think you'll like. Business Insider has affiliate partnerships, so we may get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nAmazon \nParents looking for a way to entice their kids to read more have a new tool in their arsenal: Amazon has launched a Kindle for kids . \nThey've taken a couple of plays from their Fire Kids Edition Tablet playbook, but have also made some different choices. Unlike the tablet, the hardware in this Kindle is identical to the standard Kindle Amazon sells to adults. \nIt has a six-inch touchscreen, weeks worth of battery life, and enough storage space to hold thousands of books. Unlike the regular Kindle though, all Kids Edition Kindle's come with a free outer case and a two-year protection plan. This is the same \"no questions asked\" protection plan Amazon has bundled with the Fire Kids Edition. It should take a load off your mind if you're worried about your kid breaking their new toy, I mean, reading device, in the first week. \nMaking a Kindle for kids makes sense, because unlike a tablet, the only thing you can do with a Kindle is read. This cuts down on potential distractions. The weeks-long battery life is another benefit; I have enough trouble keeping my own devices alive, never mind relying on a kid to keep theirs charged. \nSome of Kindle's built-in software can also encourage kids to begin reading more and more challenging material over time. The built-in dictionary is only a tap away, and any word a kid looks up is automatically added to a \"vocabulary builder\" for future reference. Many children's books have a feature built in called Word Wise, which puts easily understandable definitions near difficult words. \nThese tools, combined with Kindle's \"FreeTime\" parental controls, make the Kindle for Kids a compelling product for kids who want to be able to read all their favorite books wherever they go. Those same tools help the kid feel more self sufficient, by easily letting them look up words and build their vocabularies without any help. All in a device that can easily slip in a backpack or day bag. \nIf a kid in your life is already a voracious reader, this should be a no-brainer, but it could also be a useful tool for kids who struggle with traditional books. The fact that it's covered by a two-year warranty is icing on the cake. \nKindle for Kids Bundle , $99.99, available at Amazon Disclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.

The Segway miniPRO is the next evolutionary step of two-wheeled, self-balancing personal transporters. Segway and Ninebot utilized decades of combined industry knowledge to create smarter software, stronger hardware, and safer features. The miniPRO's precision sensors automatically react to the rider's movements and maintain stability over a variety of indoor and outdoor terrains. The knee control bar provides innovative steering precision that allows you to maneuver more effectively than two-wheel hover boards.\n",

      "text": "Amazon had launched its 'Global Selling Program' in India in May last year. New Delhi: Global e-commerce giant Amazon will now ship Amul products to consumers in the US, a move that will help the Indian dairy major to increase its exports.\nUnder its partnership announced today, Amazon under its Global Selling programme will offer Amul's Ghee and GulabJamun to consumers in America. The range will gradually be increased to add other products like cheese and butter.\n\"There are 30 lakh Indian NRIs in the US. We have been exporting our dairy products to the US for the last 20 years but it was mostly to local stores with Indian population in the vicinity.\nWith this partnership, we are targetting to reach every nook and corner of the American market,\" GCMMF (Amul) Managing Director R S Sodhi told PTI. He added that Amul exports Rs 30-35 crore worth of dairy products to the US market annually.\n\"We are looking at increasing our export, which is 1-2 per cent of our turnover currently,\" he said. GCMMF, which sells its products under the Amul brand, is owned by over 3.6 million milk producers.\nIts turnover stood at over Rs 23,000 crore in FY2015-16. Amazon had launched its 'Global Selling Program' in India in May last year. It facilitates access for Indian sellers to sell their products to consumers across the globe.\nThe programme has witnessed 70 per cent increase in seller base as compared to last year with over 18,000 Indian sellers selling over 25 million products globally across nine of Amazon's global marketplaces.\nThe programme offers end-to-end solution that includes assisting sellers with imaging, logistics, tax advisory and remittance. \"We are excited to help fuel the brand's growth in the US market by offering unprecedented reach to consumers. Through this programme, we will offer Amul an end-to-end solution and help the brand cater to the growing appetite for quality Indian food products amongst global consumers,\" Amazon India Director and GM (Seller Services) Gopal Pillai said.",

They will be someone we will take seriously,\" Ms Tesija said. \nWoolworths has the advantage of being an entrenched player in the supermarket business, she said. \n\"Woolies has a number of different stores and the best locations in major cities in the country; and they built that over 91 years which Amazon can't replicate anytime soon.\"",

      "text": "We shared how to get a free $10 at Amazon courtesy of Mastercard . If you successfully added it to your account, you were supposed to have until January 14th, 2017 to use the credit. Unfortunately when the code expired ( make sure you’re subscribed to the free alerts service we have on deals like this ) people that had added it to their account but not used it were no longer able to use it. People in that situation should have just received the following e-mail from Amazon:\nThe E-mail Hello,\nIn connection with the MasterCard 1-Click promotion, we ran a limited-supply offer of $10 off of a qualifying purchase. You were unable redeem the offer prior to it expiring due to high popularity and the limited supply of offers available. Because you are a valued cardmember, I’ve added a $10 Amazon.com promotional certificate to your account.\nYour available balance appears in the payment section when you place a qualifying order for new items shipped and sold by Amazon.com. Eligible funds will be automatically applied to your qualifying order(s). This promotional balance doesn’t appear in Your Account (you’ll only see gift card balances there). To view the Terms and Conditions for using your promotional funds, go to our Help pages:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/?nodeId=201134220 \nWe look forward to seeing you again soon!\nOur Verdict If you were able to get the offer added, enjoy the $10 credit. I suspect there is a legal reason why Amazon suddenly decided to honor the $10 credit, but regardless it’s good to see. You can always say thank you to this site for informing you of this deal by using our Amazon affiliate link , we will receive a small commission for any items you purchase.\nIf you missed this deal, make sure you’re signed up to get instant alerts about deals like this – there is no charge we just want to help you out.\nThe post Didn’t Use Your $10 Amazon Mastercard Promo? You Still Get The Credit appeared first on Doctor Of Credit .\n",

      "text": "Amazon deletes over 500,000 sketchy reviews in massive cleanup effort Mike Wehner Pin it Share Amazon has long had a problem with fake reviews, but an even bigger problem might be reviews of products that were received either for free or at a large discount with the promise that a review would follow. Now, Amazon is finally cutting them out. Even if a positive review wasn’t actually a condition of a complimentary product, the numbers suggest that reviews from customers who received these special deals were often significantly higher than the product’s average. That bias, whether intended or not, is harmful to the entire review system, and following on Amazon’s pledge to do something about it, the company has culled over 500,000 of these sketchy reviews from tens of thousands of its products. DON’T MISS: Ultimate guide to the best Black Friday deals on Apple iPhones, iPads, Macs and more Review analysis site ReviewMeta tracks the ridiculous number of reviews that flood into Amazon every day, and as TechCrunch reports, the site’s data shows a sharp decline not only in the number of incentivized reviews on Amazon but also a dip in the overall average rating of all reviews. ReviewMeta found that over 500,000 reviews have been deleted, with an average rating of 4.75/5. 71 percent of those reviews were flagged as having been incentivized. The overall average for all reviews dipped by about one-tenth of a star when Amazon’s ban went into effect. It’s a big step towards making Amazon’s review system trustworthy again, but it’s not a catch-all. Amazon’s “Verified Purchase” tag is still the best way to spot reviews that are the most trustworthy, but short of banning reviews from all non-verified purchasers as a whole, incentivized reviews — including ones that aren’t labeled as such — will continue to exist.

      "text": "Print Subscribe \nUS-based e-commerce giant Amazon plans to invest an additional $3 billion in India, which is emerging as a critical area of growth, and to compete with local rivals Flipkart and Snapdeal. \nAmazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos announced on Wednesday, “Amazon will invest $3 billion more in India. This is in addition to the $2 billion announced in 2014,”. With this announcement, Ammazon made total investment in the country to over $5 billion. \n“We have already created some 45,000 jobs in India and continue to see huge potential in the Indian economy,” Bezos said at the annual gala of U.S. India Business Council (USIBC) which was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Advertisement \nIn July 2014, Amazon pumped in $2 billion in its India operations which is said to be exhausted over the time. That announcement was seen as an open challenge to local rival Flipkart, India’s largest e-commerce firm, which had announced just one day earlier that it raised $1 billion from Tiger Global, Naspers and other investors. \nApart from its strengthening it Indian e-commerce business, Amazon will also utilize the fresh $3 billion to invest in building out its web services unit in India. \n“We’ve seen tremendous growth since our launch three years ago. Jeff captured it best when he said Amazon India has surpassed our most ambitious plans. As we’ve said before, based on the momentum we’ve seen so far and the opportunity ahead, India can be our biggest market after the US over the long term,” Bezos said after receiving USIBC’s Global Leadership Awards. \nAt the event, Star India, a subsidiary of 21st Century Fox, also said it will invest an additional $5 billion over the next three years. \n“In less than two years, about 20 per cent of USIBC member companies have already invested $28 billion India,” USIBC chairman John Chambers announced in the event. 39",

      "text": "videos Advertisement Amazon’s 35 Days of Deals Challenged by Walmart’s Cyber Week Deals, Starting early on Black Friday By Dipannita Nov 23, 2016 11:57 PM EST 2016 Leaked Black Friday Ads reveal cheapest deals on TV drones, Xbox One, iPhone 6 and more to grab at the lowest prices to find. Advertisement \nWalmart has come up with a different sales strategy this year to attract a huge number of customers in the Cyber Week and it will also give Amazon's 35 days of deal a great competition. The shopping week will start earlier and offer shoppers numerous deals and discounts to save big in the holiday shopping season. \nWalmart has revealed its Cyber Week deals that will kick off earlier this year, reports TechTimes . According to the news outlet, it takes off on Black Friday and this is being done to counter the 35 days of deals offered by e-commerce giant Amazon. However, it is not just Cyber Week that has been preponed. In fact, the Black Friday deals would also start earlier and kick off on Thursday itself. Advertisement \nNotably, last year saw Walmart making an early start and it took off with the Cyber Week on Saturday of the Thanksgiving weekend. This year, it has gone a step ahead and taken it to Black Friday and it is going to prove a treat for customers as they stand to gain amazing deals. Still, it remains to be seen how the strategy will affect Amazon's 35 days of discounts that was announced last week. \nComing back to deals, there is a lot for the shoppers to buy as there is a huge range of choices from across brands and prices. According to Steve Breen, SVP of Merchandising at Walmart, they have tripled the online product assortment and thus, are able to offer lot more new brands and choices to customers throughout the season. \nOne can select from brands like Nerf, Google, and Samsung at Walmart stores. Other brands like Ray-Ban, Michael Kors, UGG can be accessed from its marketplace sellers. The site has altogether 23 million items, a remarkable increase of 8 million in comparison to last year. So, it does not matter whether one shops at the store or online, one can save on everything one wants throughout the season. \nThis expansion is definitely going to benefit customers. However, the multinational retailer has not done away with the minimum limit required for free shipping. It still stands at $50, which most customers pass during the Black Friday and Cyber Week period. Advertisement ",

      "text": "BLU has decided it fit to spoil Black Friday shoppers in the UK, already spoiled by Amazon’s weeks-long sales event , with a new phone. Unfortunately, customers eager to buy a phone from a manufacturer with a sketchy software track record, — benign in many ways, insecure in others — will have to wait well past Cyber Monday to claim dibs on this phone.\nPre-orders are up on Amazon.co.uk for the BLU VIVO 6, a phone that takes things up and away from the VIVO 5R with an improved processor (the octa-core MediaTek Helio P10) with 4GB of RAM to back it up, a 5.5-inch full HD display, a 13-megapixel Sony IMX258 main camera. With Android Marshmallow, a front-facing fingerprint sensor, a 3,130mAh battery and 64GB of storage (with microSD expandability up to another 64GB), this all totals a very slight £184.99. It even comes with free delivery, too!\nBut you better make your choice of gold, grey or rose gold by December 2nd to lock in this price. Sorry, US mates, nothing on this for you, yet.\nThe post BLU VIVO 6 launches pre-orders in UK for £185 appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "\nFri, Nov 25, 2016, 4:42 PM AEDT - Australia Markets closed Woolies views Amazon as a real threat AAP – 21 minutes ago View Photo \n\nWoolworths is preparing for the \"Amazon threat\" by setting up a special team to deal with the online retail giant's potential arrival in Australia. \nAmazonFresh, the online supermarket subsidiary of the American e-commerce company, is reportedly planning to launch in Australia as early as next year. \nWoolworths says it sees Amazon as a serious disrupter, and chairman Gordon Cairns revealed the group has set up a team to look at the \"threat\". \n\"We didn't want to distract people in the supermarket business worrying about how to compete with Coles and Aldi today (with) worrying about Amazon so we have set up a separate unit,\" Mr Cairns told the group's annual general meeting on Thursday. \nHe said US retail expert Kathryn Tesija, a director on the Woolworths board, has been providing coaching and insights. \nThe former US Target executive also told shareholders that Amazon was a real threat. \n\"They are a formidable competitor. They will be someone we will take seriously,\" Ms Tesija said. \nWoolworths has the advantage of being an entrenched player in the supermarket business, she added. \n\"Woolies has a number of different stores and the best locations in major cities in the country; and they built that over 91 years which Amazon can't replicate anytime soon.\" \nColes and German discount retailer Aldi have declined to say whether they have also set up teams to analyse the potential threat Amazon would pose. \nA spokesman for Coles said the group was focused on continuing to deliver competitive food prices, while an Aldi spokesperson said it welcomed competition and was committed to being the price leader. \nRoy Morgan Research chief executive Michele Levine doubts the arrival of Amazon would spark another price war. \n\"Amazon would target people who are early adopters of technology and can afford to pay the service that solves their problems,\" she said. \n\"If Amazon can bring a really good grocery delivery service that gives people what they want, when they want it and they get fresh produce, they can probably charge more for it. \n\"That's where the winning disrupter will be rather than cutting margins further.\" \nWhile the supermarket giants are moving towards online shopping, their technology is still \"a bit clunky\", Ms Levine said. \n\"Amazon is definitely an extraordinary company. It's hungry and it is looking at Australia as a small but affluent market with rich pickings to be had.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook ",

Seems like these are exclusively to Amazon, gonna give it a go, glad I held off the HD 558 I posted a few days ago :p They'll be a different experience to those. Less sound stage and a more \"in head\" experience. Probably better lower end though being closed.",

      "text": "By SHANNON O'CONNOR / STAFF WRITER\nPublished: Nov. 24, 2016 Updated: 3:04 p.m. Here are 5 shows on Netflix, Amazon you should binge watch after Thanksgiving Print Photo Share Pin It More Galleries Rachel Bloom, left, stars as Rebecca Bunch and Santino Fontana stars as Greg Serrano in \"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.\" EDDY CHEN, THE CW Related article » The dishes have been licked clean, the football games have ended and the turkey coma is finally setting in, so what is there to do now? Binge-watch some TV.\nThere is no better day to indulge in the cultural phenomenon than the day after Thanksgiving. So jump in (or stay in) your pajamas, find a comfy position on the couch and boot up Netflix or Amazon to one (or, if you are feeling adventurous, all) of these shows.\n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\"\nIt’s back! After months of hype and promotion, the four new 90-minute installments of “Gilmore Girls” are finally here . Take a trip back to Stars Hollow, Connecticut, and revisit Lorelai, Rory, Emily, Luke and all the other colorful townsfolk fans have come to adore. Whether you have been a long-time Gilmore fan or are just discovering the series (in this case, bonus because you get to binge more!) these installments should provide some laughs, tears and nostalgia. To accompany this binge, I suggest copious amounts of coffee, pop tarts and tater tots. Also keep pizza and tacos nearby, you know, just in case. All previous seasons are currently streaming on Netflix and the new episodes arrive on Nov. 25 at 12:01 a.m.\n\"Good Girls Revolt\"\nIn the past few weeks journalism has been an issue of much discussion, so there is no better time to dive into Amazon’s new series “Good Girls Revolt.” The series is loosely based on Lynn Povich’s book of the same name and is a fictionalized account of Povich and her female co-workers' struggle with a sexual discrimination case against Newsweek magazine over pay and gender equality in 1969. Though the show is set a few decades in the past, it brings to light many issues still plaguing women in the workforce today (ahem, the pay gap). All episodes of the series first season are available on Amazon.\n\"Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\"\nMusical lovers and people who love a good Southern California joke or reference, here's a show for you. Rachel Bloom’s “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” is the musical-comedy extravaganza about a young New York hotshot lawyer who uproots her high-powered life to follow her old high school boyfriend back to West Covina only to find that he is in a serious relationship. Laughs, heartbreak and big (paradoxical) musical numbers ensue, but it is the heart in the show that will keep you coming back (although the music is pretty catchy, too). All episodes of the first season are available for streaming on Netflix. Season 2 is currently airing on The CW.\n\"Black Mirror\"\nIf you are in the mood for some more serious TV fare, try the bizarre but captivating anthology series “Black Mirror.” The series, which returned for a 6-episode third season late last month, tackles complex storylines that contribute to society’s greatest fears, including blackmail, technology and social media. And be ready for some twists and surprises. The show may make you paranoid, but just remember it is fiction (for now). All episodes are streaming on Netflix.\n“The Crown”\nThough at this point you may be a bit tired of politics and government, Netflix’s latest series “The Crown” about Queen Elizabeth II shouldn't be missed. Though we have seen versions of the Queen’s life on screen before, this 10-part series not only focuses on the life of Elizabeth herself but the lives of those around her. Fans of series such as “The Tudors” or “Reign” will undoubtedly be drawn to this British monarchy tale that has critics raving. All episodes of the first season are streaming on Netflix.\nRelated: 'Gilmore Girls' stars Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel dish on new Netflix episodes Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off",
