      "title": "Fiat Chrysler partners with Amazon to sell cars to Italian customers online",
      "text": "Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said it has teamed up with US internet giant Amazon to start selling cars online offering an additional discount.\nInitially only Italian buyers will be able to purchase their cars with a simple click online and the offers on Amazon.it will be limited to three models – the 500, the Panda and the 500L.\nFCA said the choice was deliberate because the Panda is Italy’s biggest selling car, while buyers of the 500 and its larger 500L version embody the young and adventurous nature this initiative is trying to appeal to.\n“The time has arrived to give consumers a new, more efficient and transparent way to choose a new vehicle,” Gianluca Italia, responsible for Fiat Chrysler in Italy, said during an online press conference.\nThe manager at the world’s seventh largest carmaker said the partnership will appeal to buyers looking for deals from the comfort of their own home, adding that existing promotions will be improved by up to 33 percent for online customers.\nHe said research had revealed that half of Italians were willing to buy a vehicle online but 97 percent still preferred to pick it up at a traditional dealer.\nSo, after making their clicks online, buyers will be contacted by Amazon to decide on a dealer where they can finalize their purchase and pick up the car. The vehicle should be ready within two weeks of the initial click.\nReuters \nThe post Fiat Chrysler partners with Amazon to sell cars to Italian customers online appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "\nWhat it's like to get acquired by Amazon When your small startup gets acquired by a megacorporation like Amazon the impact is life-changing. \nThat's exactly what happened to Cambridge entrepreneur William Tunsall-Pedoe back in 2012. \nThe artificial intelligence (AI) guru sold his voice recognition app Evi to Amazon for a reported $26 million (£21 million), becoming an Amazon employee in the process. \nNow, in an interview with Business Insider , Tunstall-Pedoe explains what it was like to go from working for yourself to being part of a much larger beast. \n\"I went from running a 30 person startup to having a role in an organisation that's over 150,000 people, which is obviously a big change,\" said Tunstall-Pedoe. \n\"As a startup you're constantly stressed about funding. Particularly if you're running it. We weren't profitable so we were always burning cash. You've got this constant stress of a business that's essentially always dying. \n\"You raise a funding round, you have 'x' months of cash and before that money runs out you've got to raise more money or become profitable.\" \nEvi was essentially an AI-powered app that allowed people to search for things and find answers either by typing a question into a search box or asking a question out loud. The app also supported a number of actions, including calling people and other phone functions. \nTunstall-Pedoe is one of several British entrepreneurs to sell their artificial intelligence business to a large Silicon Valley firm. VocalIQ founders Blaise Thomson, Martin Szummer and Vishal Chatrath sold their Cambridge voice recognition startup VocalIQ to Apple for up to $100 million (£80 million) , while the founders of DeepMind (Demis Hassabis, Mustafa Suleyman, and Shane Legg) sold their company to Google for up to $650 million (£522 million) . London-based Magic Pony Technology also sold its machine learning technology to Twitter this year for $150 million (£120 million) . \n\"Once you're in a megacorporation, the business is financially secure. So you can focus entirely on all of the engineering and the product,\" explains Tunstall-Pedoe, who worked at Amazon for three and a half years before leaving in February. \nWhile at Amazon, Tunstall-Pedoe held a senior product role in the team that designed, built, and launched Alexa and the Amazon Echo product. \nOn leaving the company, Tunstall-Pedoe said: \"That was really difficult. I really love Amazon. It's a very good business. It's obviously very successful. A few milestones happened at the same time: 10th anniversary of the business [Evi] was quite a big psychological one. September last year I realised I'd been doing this 120% for 10 years.\" \nTunstall-Pedoe is now investing in other startups in the UK and overseas, particularly those that are focusing on AI and machine learning.

      "text": "In a bid to compete against Amazon, India’s Flipkart is now looking at adding new categories to its e-commerce platform. The company, which was launched in India in 2007, plans to move into groceries space and revamp its furniture business in the coming year. When it was launched in India, Flipkart’s first products were books and today they have products across categories including apparels and home appliances. As the company turns 10 next year, Flipkart is aiming to struggle its way out of slowing sales and profits. Groceries and furniture are not new for Flipkart as the company has already experimented with the segments. Earlier this year, Flipkart shut down its groceries delivery arm ‘Nearby’ owing to lack of demand.",

      "text": "PRWeb November 21, 2016 at 03:00 AM EST BoarerPitchford.com Harrow’s Gate #18 on Amazon' \nIndie-author Lawrence BoarerPitchford has been climbing the Amazon charts and has hit #18 on the Amazon’s Hot New Release bestseller’s list. “I didn’t expect this so soon, but it is a riveting story filled with lots of action and adventure, so what’s not to like?” stated the author. When asked about the racier love scenes, he replied, “Passion and lovemaking? I believe most people rather like that.” \nThis book has blasted out into the market, giving readers feelings of hopeful longing for simpler days where men are chivalrous, the women are elegant, and neither the men or the women cower in the face of life’s challenges. Harrow’s Gate paints a fantastic picture of young love, in a world where dreadnoughts prowl the sea lanes, and gas-lamps shower the cobblestone streets in a soft orange hue. This is science fiction and steampunk forged into a wondrous tale of risk and reward. \nIn a far-off outpost along the border of the Rema desert, the Desert Ghosts ply their trade. Harrow’s Gate is the place where humans and aliens meet, money exchanges hands, and trade goods flow from east to west. But, it is the mysterious and timeless arch that gives the town its name – Harrow’s Gate. It is a place where the desert begins, and the path to the impassable White Desert lures only the heartiest adventurers. \nThe author said, “Over the holidays the novel is only 99 cents. This is less than the cost of a cup of coffee at a café - far less than the cost of downloading a movie from one of the video outlets, or even the price of a theater ticket. I think 99 cents is a great deal for a week of exciting entertainment, and hours of adventure and romance!” Harrow’s Gate is available for download, and it also can be found in paperback. \nLawrence BoarerPitchford is the author of such works as Thadius, The Lantern of Dern Blackhammer, Sawbones, In the World of Hyboria (Book 1 Grim Determination and Book 2 The Ties that Bind), as well as the cheeky novel Tales of Mad Cows and Brothels. \nLawrence works and lives in the Sacramento region of California. His work can be found on Amazon Books, Smashwords, Barnes & Nobles, and iBooks. Take a moment to explore http://www.BoarerPitchford.com and visit t Stock Market JSON API Terms and Conditions .",

(Although you can’t name timers or set multiple ones; which Amazon really should fix.) But, with a new Alexa skill from recipe site Allrecipes, the Echo should become even more useful when cooking . Users can download the skill from the Alexa app on their phone and then use it to query a database of some 60,000 recipes. You can search based on ingredients or dish name, and ask Alexa how to cook the meal step by step.\n\nIt looks kind of useful? I’m not immediately sold, I have to say.

      "text": "Amazon's Marketplace Business Model Is Spreading (AMZN) By Matthew Johnston | November 20, 2016 — 6:00 PM EST \nWith as much as half of the items offered by Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) now being sold by third-party vendors, the marketplace model of the online retail giant is starting to catch on with more traditional retailers. \nThe most recent adopter of the model, Crate & Barrel, began offering items on its website from outside sellers earlier this week. In doing so, the home-goods retailer joins the ranks of other retailers like Walmart Stores Inc. ( WMT ) and Macy’s Inc. ( M ), in providing a greater assortment of merchandise to their customers by allowing third-party vendors to use their websites as platforms for selling their own wares. More Options and Less Inventory Risk \nAs quoted in the Wall Street Journal, chief operating officer for Crate & Barrel, Michael Relich, argues, “The benefit to the consumer is huge, because now we have a much wider assortment and more options.” \nBeing able to offer greater variety to customers is significant, but being able to do so without having to increase inventory is the other benefit to adopting the market place model. Retailers can now offer specialty or niche items on their websites without having to worry about being able to sell them as the inventory risk for such items falls on the third-party seller. Brand Identity Risks \nThe flipside, however, is that retailers take on brand risk as any problems that occur with a third-party seller reflect back on the retailers brand identity . That brand identity risks being severely damaged by outside vendors whose merchandise and services may not adhere to the same quality standards as the host retailer. \nAmazon has had recent problems of third-party sellers offering counterfeit items on its site, prompting the online retailer to file lawsuits against the suspected culprits. But Amazon is not the only victim, as eBay Inc. ( EBAY ) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. ( BABA ) are two other major online retailers with an apparently large number of counterfeit and fake items. (To read more, see: Amazon Sues Counterfeit Sellers . ) Marketplace Model Competition \nYet, despite the risks, over 250 retailers, looking to offer more options to their customers, have added items from third-party vendors over the past several years, according to the Wall Street Journal. \nThis mass adoption of the marketplace model means that the companies like eBay are going to be facing increasing competition, not only for customers but vendors as well. The vendor side of eBay’s business is especially important since, unlike Amazon and other retailers, all of eBay’s wares are provided by third-party sellers.

      "title": "Troy Wolverton commentary: Smart speakers Google Home, Amazon Echo convenient yet creepy",
      "text": "A pair of smart speakers: Amazon’s Echo, left, and Google Home By The (San Jose, Calif.) Mercury News  02 AM \nHaving a smart speaker like Amazon Echo or Google Home in the house can feel like you’ve stepped into the future. \nIt can also feel creepy. And sometimes, really annoying. \nAll these impressions coursed through me over the last several days as I tested Echo and Home. I’m still not sure I’d want one in my house, but I can certainly understand their appeal. \nHome debuted last month as Google’s answer to Echo, which Amazon first released two years ago. Both look like simple speakers, because they lack screens and have few buttons. \nBut looks are deceiving. Sure, both can serve as wireless speaker systems. But more significantly, they serve as conduits for powerful artificial intelligence algorithms that can do everything from answering basic questions to ordering products and services to controlling a connected home. \nBoth smart speakers do a very good job at this latter role. I asked bunches of questions of both speakers and made lots of requests. In the vast majority of cases, both understood what I wanted the first time I asked them and responded or complied right away. \nI asked them to order an Uber. I asked for restaurant recommendations and to play a particular channel on Pandora. And I asked them about the latest exchange rate between euros and dollars. In each of those cases, they had a ready answer or followed my request without problem. \nIt was like being on board the Starship Enterprise, being able to talk to a disembodied computer with the expectation that it would understand and follow my every command. \nBefore asking anything of either speaker, you have to use a trigger word to essentially wake it up. With the Echo, it’s simply “Alexa.” With Home, it’s “OK Google.” Both speakers were very responsive when called upon — and much more reliable in that respect than Apple’s Siri on my iPhone 6s, which has similar capabilities. I’m constantly repeating “Hey, Siri”— the iPhone’s trigger phrase — because Apple’s intelligent assistant only responds about half the time I call it. \nOut of the box, both smart speakers will do quite a few things. They can tell you how many calories are in a McDonald’s Big Mac, add items to a shopping list and even tell you jokes. But both have their limitations. If you ask the Echo what’s happening in the stock market, it will play you a pre-recorded news clip that may or may not have updates on the major stock indices. When I asked Home the same question, it said it couldn’t do that yet — even though it’s supposed to be able to. \nSome of these limitations can be solved by simply rephrasing your question or request. In most cases, though, you have to teach the speakers new tricks by adding on features or connecting them to other services using their corresponding smartphone apps. \nSo, if you want to order an Uber through Echo, you have to link your Uber account to it via Amazon’s Alexa smartphone app. If you want to use Home to order your Chromecast to start playing music on your stereo system, you have to set that up in the Google Home smartphone app. \nFor the Echo, many of these add-on capabilities come through what Amazon calls “skills,” which are kind of like apps for the speaker. These skills can help Echo match some of the Home’s built-in capabilities — like translating from one language to another. But they also give it a decided advantage over Google’s device when it comes to connecting to home automation products. \nYou can link Amazon’s gadget to a whole slew of smart home products, including not only popular ones like Google’s Nest thermostats and Philip’s Hue lightbulbs, but also more obscure devices like connected coffee pots, smart sprinkler controllers and smart meat thermometers. At least for now, by contrast, Home has a more limited set of products it can connect to or control. \nOne thing to note about these add-on services: connecting them to your smart speaker can be tedious because you generally have to add them one by one. \nAdditionally, in some cases, customizing your device may require you to dive deep into the settings of one of the apps. For some reason, Echo gave me restaurant recommendations based on my old work address, even though I linked it to my personal account and haven’t worked in that office for two years. Changing my Echo address to my home address required a web search, because I couldn’t figure out on the Alexa app where to change that setting. \nYou also may wonder why you might want or need a smart speaker, even if you are interested in stepping into the future. Much of what you can do with Echo or Home you can do already with a smartphone or computer using the intelligent assistants that are built into the iPhone, Android devices and the latest Windows PCs. \nAt least when I got it to respond to me, Siri often handled my questions and requests just as well as Echo or Home. In some cases, it was better, such as when I asked it for restaurant recommendations. In addition to pointing me to the top restaurants, Siri went on to ask me if I wanted to call them or if I needed directions, something neither the Echo or Home did. In other cases, it was worse. Unlike with the Echo and Home, I couldn’t get Siri to play a particular station on Pandora. \nAnd there’s another thing to consider when it comes to Echo and Home, and that’s privacy. It’s that factor that’s dissuaded me from having one of these devices in my house in the past. Both devices work by listening for your voice at all times, something that just feels creepy. Both promise to only keep what you say immediately before and after your trigger word or phrase, but I worry about them listening in — even innocently — on my private conversations and moments. \nWhen it comes to privacy, Google in particular hasn’t always been upfront about its practices or even kept the promises it’s made to consumers; it’s been investigated by the FTC multiple times and had to pay a $22.5 million fine a few years ago. And both it and Amazon have an interest in collecting and keeping as much data as possible on their customers for marketing purposes. And both companies keep a record of all questions and requests users make through their smart speakers. \nSo, as cool as I think it is to have an intelligent assistant only a catchphrase away, I’m not convinced yet that I need or want one. I hope that’s OK, Google. \nTroy Wolverton is a technology columnist for The Mercury News. Reach him at or follow him on Twitter @troywolv .",

      "text": "Author Lawrence BoarerPitchford #18 on Amazon's Hot New Release!\nSacramento, California (PRWEB) November 21, 2016\nIndie-author Lawrence BoarerPitchford has been climbing the Amazon charts and has hit #18 on the Amazon’s Hot New Release bestseller’s list. “I didn’t expect this so soon, but it is a riveting story filled with lots of action and adventure, so what’s not to like?” stated the author. When asked about the racier love scenes, he replied, “Passion and lovemaking? I believe most people rather like that.”\nThis book has blasted out into the market, giving readers feelings of hopeful longing for simpler days where men are chivalrous, the women are elegant, and neither the men or the women cower in the face of life’s challenges. Harrow’s Gate paints a fantastic picture of young love, in a world where dreadnoughts prowl the sea lanes, and gas-lamps shower the cobblestone streets in a soft orange hue. This is science fiction and steampunk forged into a wondrous tale of risk and reward.\nIn a far-off outpost along the border of the Rema desert, the Desert Ghosts ply their trade. Harrow’s Gate is the place where humans and aliens meet, money exchanges hands, and trade goods flow from east to west. But, it is the mysterious and timeless arch that gives the town its name – Harrow’s Gate. It is a place where the desert begins, and the path to the impassable White Desert lures only the heartiest adventurers.\nThe author said, “Over the holidays the novel is only 99 cents. This is less than the cost of a cup of coffee at a café - far less than the cost of downloading a movie from one of the video outlets, or even the price of a theater ticket. I think 99 cents is a great deal for a week of exciting entertainment, and hours of adventure and romance!” Harrow’s Gate is available for download, and it also can be found in paperback.\nLawrence BoarerPitchford is the author of such works as Thadius, The Lantern of Dern Blackhammer, Sawbones, In the World of Hyboria (Book 1 Grim Determination and Book 2 The Ties that Bind), as well as the cheeky novel Tales of Mad Cows and Brothels.\nLawrence works and lives in the Sacramento region of California. His work can be found on Amazon Books, Smashwords, Barnes & Nobles, and iBooks.

      "text": "November 21, 2016 at 06:43 AM EST BoarerPitchford.com Harrow's Gate #18 on Amazon's Hot New Release Bestseller's List for Steampunk PRWeb \nIndie-author Lawrence BoarerPitchford has been climbing the Amazon charts and has hit #18 on the Amazon's Hot New Release bestseller's list. \"I didn't expect this so soon, but it is a riveting story filled with lots of action and adventure, so what's not to like?\" stated the author. When asked about the racier love scenes, he replied, \"Passion and lovemaking? I believe most people rather like that.\" \nThis book has blasted out into the market, giving readers feelings of hopeful longing for simpler days where men are chivalrous, the women are elegant, and neither the men or the women cower in the face of life's challenges. Harrow's Gate paints a fantastic picture of young love, in a world where dreadnoughts prowl the sea lanes, and gas-lamps shower the cobblestone streets in a soft orange hue. This is science fiction and steampunk forged into a wondrous tale of risk and reward. \nIn a far-off outpost along the border of the Rema desert, the Desert Ghosts ply their trade. Harrow's Gate is the place where humans and aliens meet, money exchanges hands, and trade goods flow from east to west. But, it is the mysterious and timeless arch that gives the town its name - Harrow's Gate. It is a place where the desert begins, and the path to the impassable White Desert lures only the heartiest adventurers. \nThe author said, \"Over the holidays the novel is only 99 cents. This is less than the cost of a cup of coffee at a café - far less than the cost of downloading a movie from one of the video outlets, or even the price of a theater ticket. I think 99 cents is a great deal for a week of exciting entertainment, and hours of adventure and romance!\" Harrow's Gate is available for download, and it also can be found in paperback. \nLawrence BoarerPitchford is the author of such works as Thadius, The Lantern of Dern Blackhammer, Sawbones, In the World of Hyboria (Book 1 Grim Determination and Book 2 The Ties that Bind), as well as the cheeky novel Tales of Mad Cows and Brothels. \nLawrence works and lives in the Sacramento region of California. His work can be found on Amazon Books, Smashwords, Barnes & Nobles, and iBooks.

      "text": "Amazon Offers $100 discount off 13-inch MacBook Pro Without Touch Bar Monday November 21, 2016 2:20 AM PST by Tim Hardwick Amazon has slashed $100 off the official price of Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Pro sans Touch Bar, offering the machine at $1,399 instead of £1,499, presumably for a limited time. Spotted by AppAdvice , the discount is for the stock 13-inch model, which comes with a 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, and 256GB storage. Meanwhile, for anyone still debating whether a Touch Bar equipped MacBook Pro is for them, Red Sweater has released a free Mac app that simulates the OLED keyboard strip as a bar on the screen. Touché is essentially a test bed for developers, but still includes a fully functioning Touch Bar that dynamically changes based on the app currently in use, allowing anyone curious to see how it augments the physical keyboard. On a more frivolous note, Facebook iOS developer Adam Bell has managed to hack Apple's new Touch Bar to run classic first-person shooter Doom . Doom runs on pretty much everything… but can it run on the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar? https://t.co/juJGlFIXFW pic.twitter.com/kr5rM0LVmn",

      "title": "Alibaba Cloud expands data centers as its steps up challenge to Amazon, Microsoft",
      "text": "Alibaba is planning to launch four new data centers across the world, the Chinese e-commerce giant said on Monday, as it steps up its competition against Amazon and Microsoft in the rapidly-growing cloud computing market. \nThe data centers will be located in Dubai, Tokyo in Japan, Germany and Sydney, Australia. It takes the number of Alibaba Cloud data centers outside of China to eight, with the Chinese technology giant now on nearly every major continent. \n\"With the addition of those four data centers, it will cover our customers globally,\" Ethan Yu, general manager of Alibaba Cloud Global, told CNBC in a phone interview. \nIn each market, Alibaba Cloud has formed joint ventures (JV) and partnerships. In Dubai, Alibaba has formed a JV with Meraas Holdings called YVOLV. In Germany, Alibaba has partnered with Vodafone to open its first data center in Europe. Alibaba will use Vodafone's data center in order to sell its cloud services. In Japan, a JV with Softbank called SB Cloud Corporation was formed earlier this year. \n\nNigel Treblin | Getty Images The Sydney data center will come online \"within a few weeks,\" Yu told CNBC. The executive said Alibaba was not disclosing the financial terms of the deals but there are revenue sharing agreements in place. The JV with SoftBank will be 60 percent owned by SoftBank with 40 percent owned by Alibaba, the companies said earlier this year.\n\n‘Rapid expansion’ Alibaba's global expansion is a bid to challenge the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Google, who combined control over half of the worldwide cloud market, according to data from Synergy Research Group. Alibaba is much smaller than Amazon Web Services (AWS) which leads the market, but is growing very quickly. \nIn its latest fiscal quarter ended September 30, Alibaba reported revenue from its cloud computing division that increased 130 percent year-on-year to $224 million. This outpaced the growth seen by Microsoft, Google, and Amazon's cloud units. \nAlibaba's cloud unit has 2.3 million customers of which 651,000 are paying customers. Yu said the company's next milestone is 1 million paying users but offered no timeframe on when this would be achieved. The cloud business is also still unprofitable with the focus still on scaling. \n\"We are not looking at profitability as the near term goal. For now, our goal is to keep expanding our market leadership and therefore we will continue to make investments and develop that for rapid expansion,\" Yu told CNBC. \n\nConcerns over Trump presidency? Alibaba Cloud – also known as Aliyun – has been helped by supportive government regulation in China, which has the development of cloud computing a priority. Domestic players like Alibaba have benefitted while foreign vendors have found it difficult to enter the market. \nThis is a differentiator for Alibaba Cloud and is attractive for international businesses trying to crack the Chinese market. \n\"We have a strong flavor of China and Asia. We are the true cloud that can provide a global infrastructure to our end users and are connected globally especially in China,\" Yu told CNBC. \nAlibaba currently has two data center locations in the U.S. and Yu said the company has seen a \"big number\" of customers using cloud services to expand their U.S. footprint. \nBut technology companies are trying to figure out what a Donald Trump presidency means for their business. The president-elect has touted the idea of a 45 percent import tariff on Chinese goods, though it's unclear if this plan will go through. \nYu said it's too early to tell what effect Trump's policies will have. \n\"We will be in a much better position in a few months down the road. For me, a very positive relationship between China and the U.S. will be helpful for all business moving forward. From our perspective, we will focus on our business first,\" Yu said.",

It's a killer deal. \nThe Logi Circle can records at 1080p, so resolution is sharp and precise. Live video streaming is also in HD, so your house is viewable wherever you are, and any video can be recorded or downloaded for 24 hours from Logi's secure, private cloud. It's also portable - the camera can be taken off it's magnetic stand and taken on-the-go around the house, if you so want. Lastly, a super cool feature, unique to the Circle, is the ability to have the camera create a 60 second video summary of the previous 24 hours, if you need a recap of a catch up on the day's events at your home. \nThe Logi Circle is available in white and black , and both have $70 off. It's not clear how long this deal will last, so get on it quick before stock runs out. Source:",

      "text": "Putting Google Express and Amazon Prime to the test Get more coupons by creating more email addresses Kelly Reinke, WATE Published: November 20, 2016, 1:30 am Updated: Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) \nKNOXVILLE ( WATE ) – Amazon Prime has a new competitor in the online shopping market: Google Express. Google Express allows shoppers to purchase items from a variety of retailers, like Walgreens, Whole Foods and Bed Bath & Beyond, in one place online. WATE 6 On Your Side ordered the same items on both sites on the same day to see how the prices and delivery time compared. \nBefore ordering, shoppers can decide to order as a member or non-member. Membership on both Amazon Prime and Google Express free shipping on eligible orders. It costs $95 dollars a year on Google Express for free shipping. However, for an order to be eligible for free delivery, it has to reach the store minimums before taxes or fees in select delivery areas. Most store minimums are $15. If you are not a member of Google Express, delivery of eligible orders starts at $4.99 from each store you shop. In comparison, a membership on Amazon Prime costs $99 per year. If shoppers do not order as a member, shipping can cost $8.99 for same-day delivery. \nFor this test, WATE 6 On Your Side ordered the same three items on both sites as a member – hairspray, headphones and dog treats. The total on Google Express was $37.10 after shipping costs and taxes were included. The total on Amazon Prime was $43.26 after shipping costs and taxes were included. \nTwo days after the order, all three items from Google Express arrived. However, only one order from Amazon Prime came. We still had to wait for the hairspray and dog treats from Amazon Prime. Those items came a day later, which was three days after the order was placed. \nFor the three items we purchased, we found Google Express was cheaper and faster than Amazon Prime as a member. 5 online shopping tips to save you money Shop on the right day : Several studies show that Sunday is the best day to shop for plane tickets. A study released by Airlines Reporting Coporation found the average plane ticket price on Sunday was more than $70 cheaper than the prices on Monday, the most expensive day. Leave items in your cart: Retailers do not like unclosed deals. Stores that will send coupons or deals the next day include JC Penny, Office Max and Bed Bath & Beyond, Find a coupon: Online promo codes and paper coupons are a great way to save money. You can find most promo codes on aggregation sites which include Coupons.com, CouponFollow and DealsPlus. Get more coupons by creating more email addresses: Stores love to send coupons and deals to your email. Imagine how much money you would save if you got several newsletter copies from multiple email accounts. Compare prices: To prevent overpaying, get the PriceBlink browser add-on. It is available for Chrome, Mozilla, and Safari. The browser saves you time by pulling prices for the same product from a number of retailers. Share this: ",

The £79.99 price refers to the latter. \nBUY NOW: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite for £79.99 at amazon.co.uk \nYou'll also have to put up with ads if you go for the £79.99 offer, but luckily the ad-free version of the Paperwhite is also discounted, and can be picked up for £89.99. \nThose looking to pick up the Wi-Fi and 3G model without ads will pay £149.99 – another saving of £30. \nWatch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week \nLet us know if you go for the Paperwhite deal in the comments. 0 shares",

      "text": "HARROW'S GATE Hits #18 on Amazon's Hot New Release Bestseller's List for Steampunk   \nIndie-author Lawrence BoarerPitchford has been climbing the Amazon charts and has hit #18 on the Amazon's Hot New Release bestseller's list. \"I didn't expect this so soon, but it is a riveting story filled with lots of action and adventure, so what's not to like?\" stated the author. When asked about the racier love scenes, he replied, \"Passion and lovemaking? I believe most people rather like that.\" \nThis book has blasted out into the market, giving readers feelings of hopeful longing for simpler days where men are chivalrous, the women are elegant, and neither the men or the women cower in the face of life's challenges. Harrow's Gate paints a fantastic picture of young love, in a world where dreadnoughts prowl the sea lanes, and gas-lamps shower the cobblestone streets in a soft orange hue. This is science fiction and steampunk forged into a wondrous tale of risk and reward. \nIn a far-off outpost along the border of the Rema desert, the Desert Ghosts ply their trade. Harrow's Gate is the place where humans and aliens meet, money exchanges hands, and trade goods flow from east to west. But, it is the mysterious and timeless arch that gives the town its name - Harrow's Gate. It is a place where the desert begins, and the path to the impassable White Desert lures only the heartiest adventurers. \nThe author said, \"Over the holidays the novel is only 99 cents. This is less than the cost of a cup of coffee at a café - far less than the cost of downloading a movie from one of the video outlets, or even the price of a theater ticket. I think 99 cents is a great deal for a week of exciting entertainment, and hours of adventure and romance!\" Harrow's Gate is available for download, and it also can be found in paperback. \nLawrence BoarerPitchford is the author of such works as Thadius, The Lantern of Dern Blackhammer, Sawbones, In the World of Hyboria (Book 1 Grim Determination and Book 2 The Ties that Bind), as well as the cheeky novel Tales of Mad Cows and Brothels. \nLawrence works and lives in the Sacramento region of California. His work can be found on Amazon Books, Smashwords, Barnes & Nobles, and iBooks. Take a moment to explore http://www.BoarerPitchford.com and visit the author on Facebook, Twitter, and Goodreads.",

      "text": "SHARES Jeff Bezos \nTry to buy signature men's wear from Donald Trump's corporate website , and you'll be directed to Amazon.com, where a navy blue necktie will cost you $29.99 and a cashmere blue coat runs close to $110. \nIt's the same Amazon that Trump harshly criticized during his campaign, saying it operated a monopoly with an unfair tax shelter that's somehow propped up by CEO Jeff Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post . \n\"Believe me, if I become president, oh do they have problems,\" Trump said at a rally in February. \"They're going to have such problems.\" \nMuch of his anger was directed at the Post , which assigned at least 20 reporters to investigate his life during the campaign and published particularly damaging stories about his philanthropy, or lack thereof. \nBut what kind of problems could a Trump presidency actually inflict on Amazon , the site that's the default marketplace for his branded men's dresswear. @CNBCNow: Trump on Amazon: \"If I become president, oh do they have problems. They're going to have such problems\". • $AMZN \nNothing in the president-elect's proposed tax policy would hurt Amazon. In fact, quite the opposite is true. \nThe business tax rate would be reduced to 15 percent from 35 percent today, which would likely bolster Amazon's net income now that the company actually makes money. As for sales tax, Amazon collects it on items shipped to the 29 states and the District of Columbia where it's required. \nMeanwhile, any connection that Trump tries to make between Amazon's business and the Post's influence ranges from conjecture to nonsense, like when the president-elect suggested that Bezos uses the newspaper's losses as a way to lower taxes paid by Amazon. \nBezos bought the newspaper in 2013, more than 16 years after Amazon's IPO. The e-retailer has operated at either a loss or at near breakeven from the beginning. Amazon shares \n\"We see this as a defensive, reactionary tactic, where Trump used a mirage of attack points to attempt to implicate Jeff Bezos and, by extension, the credibility of The Washington Post investigation,\" Gene Munster , an analyst at Piper Jaffray, wrote in last week. \"We do not believe that the mechanics are in place for Trump to impact Amazon.\" \nMunster, who recommends buying Amazon shares, doesn't see any potential antitrust violations because the company controls only about 5 percent of U.S. retail sales. \nStill, Amazon shares sank for four straight days after the election, before recouping much of their losses. The stock is down 3.5 percent since Election Day, closing at $760.16 on Friday. \nThere are broader issues of potential concern to Amazon and its investors. \nFor one, Trump's proposals on immigration and foreign worker admissions could turn away H-1B visa candidates, who depend on employment to stay in the country, or even make the U.S. a less-desirable place to work given the political setting. Amazon, like all big tech companies, hires engineers and developers from around the world. \nAnd, of course, there's the macroeconomic environment. show chapters <p>McNamee: Amazon is the great democratizer of our economy</p> <p>Roger McNamee, Elevation Partners co-founder, shares his take on the markets following Donald Trump&#039;s election.</p> Thursday, 17 Nov 2016 | 5:31 PM ET | 05:52 \nAbout 70 percent of Amazon's $107 billion in 2015 revenue was tied to commerce. Trump's views on trade and his threat to place a 45 percent tariff on goods from China may be entirely unrealistic, but any added barriers could harm Amazon. An increasing number of products on the marketplace are sold by foreign companies, and the relative free flow of goods enables Amazon to keep down prices. \nBut while retail accounts for the vast majority of revenue, all of the profit is coming from Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud-computing division. In the third quarter, AWS generated operating income of $861 million, while income for all of Amazon was $575 million. \nWith retail and computing, Amazon is building its market share and lowering costs for businesses and consumers. Longtime tech investor Roger McNamee said that even in a down economy, Amazon will flourish because it can grab business from competitors with less scale. \n\"I view Amazon as a democratizing force in the economy, both in retail and in software,\" said McNamee, adding that Amazon is the only stock he's bought since the election. \"In any scenario, and especially one where the economy is shrinking, Amazon will be one of the last companies standing.\" \nNone of that's to say that Amazon won't have some problems with a potentially acrimonious administration. Munster said an investigation, should Trump launch one, would have the potential to \"swing U.S. opinion.\" \nBezos wasn't shy about his anti-Trump views during the election, at one point tweeting that he'd save a seat for him on his Blue Origin spacecraft and later criticizing his attempts to intimidate the press. @JeffBezos: Finally trashed by @realDonaldTrump. Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace \nElsewhere within Amazon, executives were getting across a message that became quite familiar in the election's aftermath. Don Katz, CEO of Amazon's Audible audiobook division, wrote a memo to employees to try to boost their spirits. \nKatz touted Audible's decision in 2007 to move the company to Newark, New Jersey, and help the city rebound by investing in education and job growth. While the overall tone was uplifting, Katz was clearly addressing the elephant in the room. Here was his message to anyone who felt at risk following the results: \n\"As a company we will not tolerate a sensibility internally that diminishes anyone who works here because of who he or she is — from where someone comes from to who someone chooses to love — and we will also stand behind any employee whose civil rights or dignity is challenged from outside Audible any way we can.\" Ari Levy Senior Tech Reporter Related Securities ",

      "text": "100% CLEAN report malware 6 screenshots Scan the Amazon database and extract the Amazon Standard Identification Numbers for the products in a specified category via this tool Amazon is one of the largest digital commerce markets available to household or company-level players. It features a vibrant life, both demand and supply wise, a fact that has led to many complementary utilities being developed. Amazon Scraper is one such application, allowing users, as the name implies, to quickly search the entire or partial database for products matching the search query. Can process the entire database in a few minutes As with most similar scraping tools, speed is the essential factor and the program can process thousands of entries in just a few minutes. The setup is very simple and newcomers will not face any issues in quickly issuing scrape commands, as the only input necessary is a valid search query. Any text strings can be employed and users have the option of targeting a specific market (e.g. www.amazon.ca), or the main, generic site. Similarly, one can search using keywords, which should generally yield the best results, but also with IDs or URLs – the latter options are great for highly focused searches. Ensuring scrape tasks do not prolong well into infinity is performed by selecting a product category to query and one can even limit processes to specific single or multiple sub-categories. Transfer results to a CSV file A notable feature is the ample frame containing the built-in browser, allowing one to preview content before issuing commands. Once the initial setup is satisfactory, scrape tasks can be started with a simple mouse click on the “Search” button. When the process is complete – a few minutes, depending on the Internet connection, one can export retrieved Amazon Standard Identification Numbers to CSV format. A viewer allows one to check IDs and URLs, before writing a new file to disk. A fast Amazon scraping application that can query using specific keywords In conclusion, Amazon Scraper is an asset for anyone regularly trading items on Amazon. It allows users to scrape product IDs quickly, complete with their corresponding URLs and to generate CSV documents. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS",

We're going to try to come up with bands of people and walk across the country, and just not get ourselves killed or eaten, and hook up with people we think are not insane or horrible or in some way murderous. That's exactly what it's going to be like.\" Post-election anxiety about putting the ruined party back together. Imagined, pre-election, by a Republican. I'm listening to the podcast of the episode of \"This American Life\" that aired on October 28th. The quote above is an answer to the question framed by host Ira Glass: \"This is the big question for all these guys — what's their party going to be after November 8? What's it going to stand for?\" All these guys were \"center-right\" Republicans — \"basically Reagan Republicans,\" guys with \"old school conservative ideals.\" The guy answering the question is Rob Long of the podcast \"Ricochet.\" It's funny listening to the show now, because without saying as much, it's obviously premised on the assumption that Donald Trump is going to lose. I know \"funny\" isn't the word many people would use to describe the period of American life that began on Election Day night, and I'm sorry if I'm a bad person for finding it very funny. It's not that I'm happy with Trump. I wasn't a Trump supporter, but I couldn't stand Hillary either. I'm just experiencing a lot of the aftermath of the election as very funny. Like, why did we just spend the weekend talking about \"Hamilton\"? Posted by Ann Althouse at 6:22 AM",

      "title": "Amazon hosting $100K eSports tournament as tech giant continues to invest in gaming",
      "text": "Amazon continues to invest in eSports.\nThe tech giant on Monday announced the Champions of Fire Invitational , a new eSports tournament it will host via the Amazon Appstore.\nOn Dec. 2 in Las Vegas, 16 top gaming celebrities will play five popular casual mobile games and compete for a cash prize pool of $100,000. The event will be live-streamed on Amazon-owned Twitch, as well as via Amazon Fire TV, Amazon.com, and other social media networks. CBS Sports Network will air a two-hour highlights TV show on Dec. 12.\nThe single elimination tournament will feature five games: Disney Crossy Road, Pac-Man 256, Bloons TD Battles, 8 Ball Pool and the all new Fruit Ninja Tournament Edition. Matches will only take a few minutes, while each game has a $30,000 grand prize.\n“Competitive video gaming has seen huge growth, and we see tremendous customer value in expanding the tournament experience to include the casual mobile games played by millions of people today,” Amazon Appstore Director Aaron Rubenson said in a statement. “The Champions of Fire Invitational will see some of the top gaming pros square off in the same fun games our customers can download and enjoy today from the Amazon Appstore.”\nAmazon is partnering with eSports Productions for this tournament. The Amazon Appstore, an Android-based app marketplace that powers app downloads on Amazon’s tablets, was previously involved with an eSports mobile tournament this past summer , but only as a sponsor and not a host.\nThis is another recent move, since Amazon acquired Twitch for nearly $1 billion in 2014, that signals the company’s interest in new verticals like eSports and live-streaming.\nThe company last month unveiled Breakaway , its first title that has deep Twitch integration. It also showed off two other new titles; one of the games includes the ability for users to wager loyalty points that can be exchanged for in-game rewards — effectively moving Amazon into the emerging area of eSports betting.\nSince acquiring Twitch, Amazon has also quietly grown its Amazon Game Studios team and recently acquired gaming content platform Curse. The company, which has 140 open positions for Amazon Game Studios, has created an ecosystem it describes as a “ sandbox of innovation ” that includes Twitch, Lumberyard, AWS, and Curse.\nIn another result of Amazon’s Twitch acquisition, the Seattle tech giant in September announced Twitch Prime , a new bundle of Amazon Prime benefits specifically aimed at gamers. Prime members will get discounts on game pre-orders and new releases, a rotating selection of free digital titles, in game bonuses, and an ad-free Twitch experience that includes a free monthly Twitch channel subscription.\nTwitch now has more than 1.7 million active streamers, with 100 million viewers who watch an average of 421 minutes per month.",

      "text": "Walmart is kicking off Cyber Monday on Black Friday. Reuters \nWalmart is kicking off its Cyber Monday deals three days early on Black Friday. \nAfter launching Black Friday discounts online on Thanksgiving, the retailer will release a fresh batch of online deals at 12:01 a.m. ET on Friday, November 25. \nInstead of referring to the second event as Cyber Monday, Walmart is calling it \"cyber week,\" since the deals will be available for a week starting Friday. (Walmart will also launch yet another round of deals on Cyber Monday). \nThe retailer is launching cyber week deals earlier to showcase its newly expanded online offering. \nThe company has nearly tripled its online assortment to 23 million products from 8 million last year in an effort to catch up to Amazon, which sells more than 353 million products (12 million directly and the rest from marketplace sellers, according to 360pi ). \nAs a result, Walmart.com now carries many items that shoppers wouldn't be able to find in a Walmart store, including products from brands like Michael Kors, Ray-Ban, and UGG. \nTo prevent customers from getting overwhelmed by all the new products, Walmart made improvements to its \"recommendation engine,\" which so far has led to a 20% increase in customer engagement with items the website recommends. \nIt has also built a new software called Electrode that helps its web pages load 33% faster, according to Walmart. \nHere are some of the cyber week deals that shoppers will be able to take advantage of starting Friday: Samsung 60\" 1080p HD Smart LED TV for $579 with $80 Walmart Gift Card ($1,120 savings)",

      "text": "Share \nHave you ever looked back through your purchase history on Amazon? While mine is a mix of household necessities and the Ghosts of Christmas and Birthdays Past, there are some real head scratchers in there, too. I knew I couldn't be the only one, so I asked some brave coworkers to dig through their Amazon account and share one of their weirder buys. (Image credit: Dabney Frake ) Last-Minute Karl Lagerfeld Costume \nDabney : Last Halloween, I needed a last-minute costume and found myself buying some fingerless leather gloves , a white ponytailed wig , and hand fan . Karl Lagerfeld was born in minutes. 30 Feet of Bubble Wrap \nBrittney : For Halloween last year, I went to a cocktail-themed costume party and dressed up as a gin and tonic. I had to DIY my entire costume, so to get the fizzy look of tonic water I layered bubble wrap over a dress. I didn't need that much, but 30 feet was the smallest amount I could find (popping what was left over made for a great stress reliever, though.) White Rhinoceros 3D Woodcraft Construction Kit \nArlyn : My Amazon history reminded me that I picked up this bad boy in 2008, so the memory of why is pretty vague. The only thing I can think of (according to the timing) was that I bought it for my rhino-loving fiancé who likes to tinker and build random things, but considering I have no recollection of seeing this in any home of his or mine, it was probably never built, and perhaps he was as clueless as to why this was being gifted to him as I am right now about why I bought it. (Image credit: Amazon) Bear Hands Oven Mitts \nTara : I needed oven mitts. I saw these in a roundup on Kitchn and bought them immediately because they're both visually amusing and a word pun. If your oven mitt can give you a chuckle, then I say that's a win. The American Girls Premiere Computer Game \nNora : So as a girl who spent her childhood dressing up as a pioneer for fun, I inevitably worked in theater right out of college. I had a discussion with one of my fellow interns about the American Girl computer game where you got to create plays using your favorite characters, and how it led her to become a director. In a fit of madness I ordered the game for one cent without considering that a game produced in like 1994 wouldn't be compatible with my Mac. It's still at my mom's house, since I can't bring myself to throw it away. Secrets of the Shopping Mall by Richard Peck \nCarrie : Published in 1979, I searched out a copy of this book last year to include in a birthday gift to my childhood best friend. It had made a big impression on us and I only need to drop a few plot points to explain why: fleeing the King Kobra street gang, teenagers Barnie and Teresa hide out in a New Jersey mall and decide to make it their new home. Just as they are settling in and learning how to outwit mall security, they are captured by a posse of runaway, disaffected teens who had already taken up full-time residence in the mall, spending their days posing as mannequins. Could things get worse? Yes. Barnie and Teresa find themselves in the middle of a turf war between the Store People and the Mouth Breathers who rule the mall parking lots. Time called Secrets of the Shopping Mall, \"Lord & Taylor of the Flies\" and that, really, should be recommendation enough. (Image credit: Amazon) Anchor Hocking Glass Cowboy Boot Mug \nAdrienne : I'm like, a world-record, award-winning dish breaker. Drinking glasses, tea cups, rocks glasses, wine glasses, salad bowls — it doesn't matter what it is; if it's breakable, I've broken it. And it's not just dropping (though that's certainly the bulk of my breaking history), I've also been known to slam a plate against the faucet accidentally. Heck — I even broke a tea cup's handle off the other day, with my own strength when picking it up. \nSo I was dating a fella not too long ago, and he had these amazing glass cowboy boot mugs. These things were perfect for cold or hot drinks, and he loved them. And of course, I broke one. The funny thing is I don't even remember how I broke it — I was simply too paralyzed with horror at what I had done to record the memory. But I can tell you this: Finally finding one of the babies for sale on Amazon after I cleaned up the broken shards of the one I had broke was almost enough to put back together the broken shards of my heart. \nAnd actually, now that I'm looking at this mug, it's not really all that weird and I might need to buy one for myself! (Or like, four, you know, for breakage back-ups.) \nYour turn! Tell us the weirdest thing in your purchase history.",

      "text": "COMMENTS The singer-actress, who got her big break on Amazon's 'Transparent,' tells THR she recorded a new album while shooting the 'Harry Potter' spinoff on location in London. \nWhen Alison Sudol was growing up, her parents both worked as acting teachers, which of course meant she had no interest in becoming an actor. \"I never had any illusions about the industry,\" says Sudol, whose family moved to Los Angeles from Seattle when she was 5. \"I wanted nothing to do with that heartbreak.\" \nInstead, she pursued music, releasing her first of four piano-driven indie albums in 2007 under the name A Fine Frenzy. But she became frustrated with the music business. \"I found movies to be such a beautiful escape,\" she says. So she enrolled in acting classes (not her parents') and aced her third audition, to play a singer on Amazon's Transparent . But it was a meeting with casting director Fiona Weir in spring 2015 that led to her biggest role yet: Queenie, the ethereal mind-reading witch in Warner Bros.' Harry Potter spinoff Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them . \n\"When I was first auditioning, Queenie was a traditional bombshell. I definitely never would have gotten the role if that remained the main focus because I never saw myself as that,\" says Sudol. \"She's soft and nurturing, and we need more female characters like that to show young women you can be feminine and that actually can be a strength.\" \nThe breakout role has brought the magic of music back to her life. While shooting Fantastic Beasts in London, Sudol took the train to Bristol on her days off to record a new album she plans to release under a different moniker. \"Acting was a really beautiful complement to the music because music on its own is really hard,\" she says. \"It's hard to constantly delve into your psyche and unearth these deep and often painful feelings and hold them out in front of people and say, 'Here's the most vulnerable part of me.'\" \n***",

      "title": "BoarerPitchford.com Harrow’s Gate #18 on Amazon's Hot New Release Bestseller's List for Steampunk",
      "text": "Indie-author Lawrence BoarerPitchford has been climbing the Amazon charts and has hit #18 on the Amazon’s Hot New Release bestseller’s list. “I didn’t expect this so soon, but it is a riveting story filled with lots of action and adventure, so what’s not to like?” stated the author. When asked about the racier love scenes, he replied, “Passion and lovemaking? I believe most people rather like that.” This book has blasted out into the market, giving readers feelings of hopeful longing for simpler days where men are chivalrous, the women are elegant, and neither the men or the women cower in the face of life’s challenges. Harrow’s Gate paints a fantastic picture of young love, in a world where dreadnoughts prowl the sea lanes, and gas-lamps shower the cobblestone streets in a soft orange hue. This is science fiction and steampunk forged into a wondrous tale of risk and reward.\nIn a far-off outpost along the border of the Rema desert, the Desert Ghosts ply their trade. Harrow’s Gate is the place where humans and aliens meet, money exchanges hands, and trade goods flow from east to west. But, it is the mysterious and timeless arch that gives the town its name – Harrow’s Gate. It is a place where the desert begins, and the path to the impassable White Desert lures only the heartiest adventurers.\nThe author said, “Over the holidays the novel is only 99 cents. This is less than the cost of a cup of coffee at a café - far less than the cost of downloading a movie from one of the video outlets, or even the price of a theater ticket. I think 99 cents is a great deal for a week of exciting entertainment, and hours of adventure and romance!” Harrow’s Gate is available for download, and it also can be found in paperback.\nLawrence BoarerPitchford is the author of such works as Thadius, The Lantern of Dern Blackhammer, Sawbones, In the World of Hyboria (Book 1 Grim Determination and Book 2 The Ties that Bind), as well as the cheeky novel Tales of Mad Cows and Brothels.\nLawrence works and lives in the Sacramento region of California. His work can be found on Amazon Books, Smashwords, Barnes & Nobles, and iBooks. Take a moment to explore http://www.BoarerPitchford.com and visit the author on Facebook, Twitter, and Goodreads.",

      "title": "Netflix says Amazon paid a whopping $250 million for its new Jeremy Clarkson show",
      "text": "print \nGetty/Gaye Gerard \nAmazon paid about $250 million dollars for its new show “The Grand Tour,” a 12-part series from Jeremy Clarkson and the “Top Gear” team, according to Netflix content boss Ted Sarandos. \n“The Grand Tour” is a huge moment for Amazon in its bid to rival Netflix as the top producer of high-quality streaming content. Netflix even mentioned the show in its most recent earnings report, saying the company assumed it would make Amazon “as global as YouTube and Netflix.” Amazon is poised to expand its video service to over 200 countries, likely starting in December, according to the Wall Street Journal . \nIf “The Grand Tour” is Amazon’s calling card in its worldwide ambitions, it didn’t come cheap. Conventional wisdom had said that Amazon paid around $160 million for it. But Sarandos claimed Amazon paid much more. \n“That’s an under-reported number,” Sarandos told The Telegraph . “It was about a quarter of a billion dollars. We’ll be able to figure out later what it was that made the show the show. It’ll be interesting with 'Grand Tour' to see how much of that is the players, who in many cases are big personalities, but what elements of 'Top Gear' will people miss?” \nAmazon is doubling its spend on video content in the second half of this year, compared to last year, CFO Brian Olsavsky said previously. Amazon last disclosed its investment amount on video content back in 2014, when it spent a total of $1.3 billion. \nSarandos said that Netflix pursued the show, but implied Netflix didn’t think it was worth what Amazon paid. \n“We made a play for that show, definitely,” Sarandos said. “But we’ve had every season of 'Top Gear' on Netflix in most territories in the world, so we had a better sense than most of what the audience was for 'Top Gear' on our platform. We knew what it was worth.” \nNetflix is no stranger to shelling out money, however. It plans to spend $6 billion on content in 2017. \nAdditional reporting by Eugene Kim.

      "text": "Gardening 101: Amazon Mist Sedge November 21, 2016 6:00 AM BY Julie Chai Amazon Mist Sedge, Carex comans : “New Zealand Hair Grass” Resembling a fabulously dense head of hair, Carex comans ‘Amazon Mist’ has always reminded me a bit of Cousin Itt from the Addams Family. It’s got a perfectly symmetrical form, its blades are always in place, it always looks about the same length…and you’ll never know what’s underneath all those long strands. All of which, in my mind, makes it a perfect addition to any small garden space: Photography by Meredith Swinehart except where noted. Above: Also known as New Zealand hair sedge, this grass grows in clumps that usually top out at about a foot tall and wide (though it can get taller and much wider in certain conditions). Its fine blades are frosty green on top and nearly white underneath, which gives a shimmering effect when it blows in the wind or the sun hits it at the right angle. Above: “ Carex ‘Amazon Mist’ is one of my go-to grasses because it pairs well with so many other plants, and it grows in a small, neat clump that looks beautifully delicate when spilling over the front of a pot,” writes Julie Chai. “This Carex has super thin blades that are pale green and silver on the undersides, giving it a shimmery look.” Above: Three varieties of sedge, including ‘Amazon Mist’ (in the middle) are available for sale at Atlantic Avenue Garden . Photograph via Atlantic Avenue Garden. Cheat Sheet Evergreen in areas with mild winters. Can be used as a short-lived lawn substitute. Happy companions include yarrow, salvia, lavender, black mondo grass, fescue, nemesia, and bacopa. Keep It Alive Thrive in a range of sun exposures. Water regularly as it’s growing in; mature grasses require little water. Best to plant in spring or fall. \nAbove: For more, see DIY Outdoor Planter: Summer-to-Fall Leaves . You can best take advantage of the natural good looks of ‘Amazon Mist’ by planting it where foliage can spill, such as the front of a container or hanging basket, at the edge of a retaining wall, or in a rock garden. This versatile grass needs minimal care—just comb through it with your fingers now and then to remove any brown blades. Are you thinking of adding grasses to your garden design?

Sacramento, California   \nIndie-author Lawrence BoarerPitchford has been climbing the Amazon charts and has hit #18 on the Amazon’s Hot New Release bestseller’s list. “I didn’t expect this so soon, but it is a riveting story filled with lots of action and adventure, so what’s not to like?” stated the author. When asked about the racier love scenes, he replied, “Passion and lovemaking? I believe most people rather like that.” \nThis book has blasted out into the market, giving readers feelings of hopeful longing for simpler days where men are chivalrous, the women are elegant, and neither the men or the women cower in the face of life’s challenges. Harrow’s Gate paints a fantastic picture of young love, in a world where dreadnoughts prowl the sea lanes, and gas-lamps shower the cobblestone streets in a soft orange hue. This is science fiction and steampunk forged into a wondrous tale of risk and reward. \nIn a far-off outpost along the border of the Rema desert, the Desert Ghosts ply their trade. Harrow’s Gate is the place where humans and aliens meet, money exchanges hands, and trade goods flow from east to west. But, it is the mysterious and timeless arch that gives the town its name – Harrow’s Gate. It is a place where the desert begins, and the path to the impassable White Desert lures only the heartiest adventurers. \nThe author said, “Over the holidays the novel is only 99 cents. This is less than the cost of a cup of coffee at a café - far less than the cost of downloading a movie from one of the video outlets, or even the price of a theater ticket. I think 99 cents is a great deal for a week of exciting entertainment, and hours of adventure and romance!” Harrow’s Gate is available for download, and it also can be found in paperback. \nLawrence BoarerPitchford is the author of such works as Thadius, The Lantern of Dern Blackhammer, Sawbones, In the World of Hyboria (Book 1 Grim Determination and Book 2 The Ties that Bind), as well as the cheeky novel Tales of Mad Cows and Brothels. \nLawrence works and lives in the Sacramento region of California. His work can be found on Amazon Books, Smashwords, Barnes & Nobles, and iBooks. Take a moment to explore http://www.BoarerPitchford.com and visit the author on Facebook, Twitter, and Goodreads. \nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/11/prweb13868531.htm",
