      "text": "Home > Cloud > Web Search Helps Spot Lung Cancer Early, Microsoft Study Finds Web Search Helps Spot Lung Cancer Early, Microsoft Study Finds Nov 10, 2016 Dina Bass | Bloomberg Getty Images Advertisement \n(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. researchers want to give patients and doctors a new tool in the quest to find cancers earlier: web searches. \nLung cancer can be detected a year prior to current methods of diagnosis in more than one-third of cases by analyzing a patient's internet searches for symptoms and demographic data that put them at higher risk, according to research from Microsoft published Thursday in the journal JAMA Oncology. The study shows it's possible to use search data to give patients or doctors enough reason to seek cancer screenings earlier, improving the prospects for treatment for lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. \nTo train their algorithms, researchers Ryen White and Eric Horvitz scanned anonymous queries in Bing, the company's search engine. They took searchers who had asked Bing something that indicated a recent lung cancer diagnosis, such as questions about specific treatments or the phrase \"I was just diagnosed with lung cancer.\" \nThen they went back over the user's previous searches to see if there were other queries that might have indicated the possibility of cancer prior to diagnosis. They looked for searches such as those related to symptoms, including bronchitis, chest pain and blood in sputum. The researchers reviewed other risk factors such as gender, age, race and whether searchers lived in areas with high levels of asbestos and radon, both of which increase the risk of lung cancer. And they looked for indications the user was a smoker, such as people searching for smoking cessation products like Nicorette gum. \nHow effective this method can be depends on how many false positives -- people who don't end up having cancer but are told they may -- you are willing to tolerate, the researchers said. More false positives also mean catching more cases early. With one false positive in 1,000, 39 percent of cases can be caught a year earlier, according to the study. Dropping to one false positive per 100,000 still could allow researchers to catch 3 percent of cases a year earlier, Horvitz said. The company published similar research on pancreatic cancer in June. \nMicrosoft's research arm is working on a variety of different technological approaches to improving cancer care and diagnosis. In September, the company published research on using machine learning algorithms to better tailor customized combinations of cancer drugs to a particular tumor and an effort to one day allow scientists to program cells to fight disease. \n\"These are diseases that present with very general symptoms and so they often take some time for a physician to route a patient with those symptoms to a lung cancer diagnosis or a pancreatic cancer diagnosis,\" said Trever Bivona, an associate professor of hematology and oncology at the University of California, San Francisco. \"While this would need to be rigorously tested I could envision how this could be a useful adjunct to the current paradigm of diagnosis.\" \nIn many cases, these cancers are found late, when treatment is unlikely to be successful, or even an option. That's why the team is searching for new ways to increase early detection, said Horvitz, who has a medical degree and is a long-time artificial intelligence researcher. \n\"I have very stark memories of my first lung cancer patient as a medical student. I remember saying is this operable? He had just come in, but the lung cancer was already in his brain,\" Horvitz said. \"The prospect we could save patients' lives' with one or more methods of pre-screening is intriguing.\" \n\"This is a very powerful tool,\" said Joe Gray, a professor of biomedical engineering at Oregon Health & Science University. \"We are interested in identifying cohorts of patients that might be at risk of cancer. One of the difficulties we have in the general community is if we really want to focus on developing better screening, how do you find them?\" \nThe work may also be able to identify new, previously unknown risk factors for lung cancer and correlations with environmental issues, Horvitz said. The search data showed a possible association between lung cancer and older homes, which may not have been constructed to avoid the build-up of radon gas, and with frequent air travel, he said. It would be worth further study on whether these factors do increase the risk of developing lung cancer, Horvitz added. \nNow that the study has determined the web search approach can work, researchers and clinicians need to figure out ways to use it, with patient consent. One option, said Horvitz, is to offer users apps that provide patient monitoring and could be used to alert them to red flags.Horvitz and Gray are also trying to design a study that will get cancer patients to volunteer to have their medical records and search logs examined to find even stronger causality between cancer symptoms, risks and diagnosis.",

      "text": "Follow Microsoft to revamp its documentation for security patches Microsoft has eliminated individual patches from every Windows version, and Security Bulletins will go away soon, replaced by a spreadsheet with tools More like this Use   \nWith the old method of patching now completely gone—October’s patchocalypse eliminated individual patches from every Windows version—Microsoft has announced that the documentation to accompany those patches is in for a significant change. Most notable, Security Bulletins will disappear, replaced by a lengthy list of patches and tools for slicing and dicing those lists. \nSecurity Bulletins go back to June 1998, when Microsoft first released MS98-001 . That and all subsequent bulletins referred to specific patches described in Knowledge Base articles. The KB articles, in turn, have detailed descriptions of the patches and lists of files changed by each patch. The Security Bulletins serve as an overview of all the KB patches associated with a specific security problem. Some Security Bulletins list dozens of KB patches, each for a specific version of Windows. [ Also from InfoWorld: The 10 Windows group policy settings you need to get right . | Survive and thrive with the new OS: The ultimate Windows 10 survivor kit . | Stay up on key Microsoft technologies with the Windows newsletter . ] \nThe Security Bulletin system is archaic and has led to all sorts of silly conclusions. As the volume of monthly patches has grown into the hundreds, it’s also become unwieldy. I groan when I read a headline that says, “This month is a particularly heavy patching month because there are xx more Security Bulletins than usual,” or “We have x Security Bulletins, of which y are rated Critical and z Important.” The numbers and ratings don’t matter. Microsoft’s dumping the artifice created by the Security Bulletins, and to that I say good riddance. The KB system remains, uniquely identifying individual patches, but they’re going to be knitted together differently. \nStarting in January, we’ll have two lists—or, more accurately, two ways of viewing a master table. The Security Updates Guide lists Security-only updates—each KB articles—and identifies it by product. For Internet Explorer and Edge, the Guide lists both the product and the platform (for example, Edge for Win10 version 1607). You can view the monthly release notes (a very abbreviated version of the old Security Bulletin), and you can search for specific security holes by CVE number . The Software Update Summary lists security patches by KB number. \nKeep in mind that we’re only talking about security patches and the security part of the Windows 10 cumulative updates. Nonsecurity patches and Win7/8.1 monthly rollups are outside of this discussion. \nTo see where this is going and to understand why it’s vastly superior to the Security Bulletin approach, look at the lists for November 8, this month’s Patch Tuesday. The main Windows Update list shows page after page of security bulletins, identified by MS16-xxx numbers, and those numbers have become ambiguous. See, for example, MS16-142 on that list, which covers both the Security-only update for Win7, KB 3197867 , and the Monthly rollup for Win7, KB 3197868 . The MS16-142 Security Bulletin itself runs on for many pages. \nNow flip over to the Security Updates Guide . In the filter box type windows 7 and press Enter. You see four security patches (screenshot below): IE11 and Windows, both 32- and 64-bit. They’re all associated with KB 3197867. \nIn the Software Update Summary , searching for “windows 7” yields only one entry, for the applicable KB number (screenshot below). \nHere’s why the tools are important. On this month’s Patch Tuesday, we received 14 Security Bulletins. Those Security Bulletins actually contain 55 different patches for different KB numbers; the Security Bulletin artifice groups those patches together in various ways. The 55 different security patches actually contain 175 separate fixes, when you break them out by the intended platform. \nThere’s a whole lotta patchin’ goin’ on. \nStarting this month, you can look at the patches either individually (in the Security Updates Guide) or by platform (in the Software Update Summary), or you can plow through those Security Bulletins and try to find the patches that concern you. Starting in January, per the Microsoft Security Response Center, the Security Bulletins are going away . \nOf course, the devil’s in the implementation details, but all in all this seems to me like a reasonable response to what has become an untenable situation.

      "text": "With Microsoft Office 365 backup, Veeam breaks into new market by Sonia Lelii Senior News Writer Veeam's beta program for backing up Microsoft Office 365 pulls in 1,500 downloads within a few days of the offering's release. Customers want local protection for Exchange data. This Article Covers Share this item with your network: Related Content Veeam Software still outpacing data protection market – SearchStorage \nVeeam Software has joined ranks of vendors who provide backup and recovery for the software-as-a-service Microsoft Office 365 cloud application. \nVeeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 went into beta last month. The vendor claims about 1,500 beta downloads of the Microsoft Office 365 backup in the first few days, indicating Office 365 users want copies of their email and other data on premises. Download this free guide Archive vs. Backup and Why You Need to Know the Difference \nDifferentiating data backups from archives is one of the most common questions among IT pros when it comes to data recovery. Download this invaluable guide to discover why you need to know the difference between the two, and for important tips and best practices on building or refining the best data archiving strategy for your organization.

We are bringing the data back home, so customers maintain availability.\" \nBrien Posey, a Microsoft MVP, outlined in a SearchDataBackup story the problems customers encounter with Microsoft Office 365 backup. \n\"Microsoft's primary mechanisms for protecting Office 365-based Exchange Servers are geographically distributed database availability groups,\" Posey said. \"Microsoft says they also perform traditional backups of Office 365 servers. However, those backups are used for internal purposes only if they experienced a catastrophic event that wiped out large volumes of customer data. Although Microsoft may occasionally restore data for a customer, the company seems to discourage the practice.\" \nVeeam's Microsoft Office 365 backup is integrated with Veeam Backup & Replication , which means customers can back up to hybrid cloud environments and migrate mailbox data between Office 365 and on-premises Exchange Servers. \n\"It communicates to Office 365 through the organization's credentials,\" Brambley said. \"So, if I put a mailbox in 365, we talk to the administrator's account from 365 and put it in an on-premises data center or Azure. We don't install agents, we just communicate to 365 and the mailbox can be stored wherever the customer wants. Veeam's Microsoft Office 365 backup is integrated with Veeam Backup & Replication. \n\"We are looking to guarantee availability for a SaaS offering . Not every product gets these kinds of great [download numbers], and it tells us that people want backup for 365.\" \nBrambley said customers now have the added benefit of maintaining their own retention requirements. \n\"We had a long discussion about whether we should make this a stand-alone product,\" he said. \"This is a contained separate product . The fact that we are addressing a whole new target audience is a big deal for us.\" \nVeeam expects general availability for its Microsoft Office 365 backup later this year. \nOther backup vendors protect Office 365 and other SaaS applications, such as Salesforce, with cloud-to-cloud backup. In those cases, data from the SaaS apps are copied to another cloud -- usually Amazon Web Services or a cloud managed by the backup vendor. Veeam can use Microsoft Azure for cloud-to-cloud backup, but also will move Office 365 data to the customer site. \nCloud-to-cloud backup apps include Dell EMC Spanning , Datto Backupify and Barracuda Cloud-to-Cloud Backup . Others, such as Asigra Cloud Backup , include it in their main backup application. Next Steps ",

      "text": "A specially crafted web-page can cause Microsoft Internet Explorer toassume a CSS value stored as a string can only be `\"true\"` or `\"false\"`.To determine which of these two values it is, the code checks if thefifth character is an `'e'` or a `\"\\0\"`. An attacker that is able to setit to a smaller string can cause the code to read data out-of-bounds andis able to determine if a `WCHAR` value stored behind that string is`\"\\0\"` or not.Known affected versions, attack vectors and mitigations * MSIE 9-11 (earlier versions were not tested) An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted webpage. Disabling JavaScript should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.DescriptionCertain code that handles CSS properties in MSIE assumes that theproperty value is always a string set to either `\"true\"` or `\"false\"`.To determine which of these two values it is, the code checks if thefifth character is `'\\0'`. However, it is possible to set such values toarbitrary strings, including a smaller string. This causes the code toread beyond the end of the string and allows an attacker to determine ifan WORD stored after the string is `'\\0'`.The vulnerable code is in`MSHTML!PROPERTYDESC::HandleStyleComponentProperty`.This code is heavily branched to handle various types of CSS properties.Luckily, the type being exploited is one of the first to be handled. Thecode appears to assume that the value is provided as a pointer to a`BSTR` which will always have a `WCHAR` at offset +8 that may be `'\\0'`or not. If this `WCHAR` is not `'\\0'`, a CSS property is set to acertain value, otherwise it is set to an empty string. As long as this`BSTR` is always either be `\"true\"` or `\"false\"`, this code works asexpected. However, it is possible to provide an arbitrary value for this`BSTR`, which can be shorter than 4 `WCHARs`. This would causing thecode to read a `WCHAR` outside of the memory used to store that `BSTR`.Known properties of the type that leads to the vulnerable code pathinclude `textDecorationBlink`, `textDecorationLineThrough`,",

      "text": "Adobe Flash Player Android 7.0 (via Pixel) \nOn the Microsoft Edge front, vulnerabilities discovered in the Windows 10 browser enabled system-level remote code execution. To better understand system-level access, you have to look at how device operating systems are layered in a security sense. At the top layer, consumers will see the applications they normally use. Under that are device drivers with low privileges followed by device drivers with high privileges further underneath. The final, bottom layer consists of the operating system’s central core, aka the kernel, that controls everything. Running a malicious program below the “user” layer grants a hacker special privileges that can go undetected by the device owner. \nMore: One of the ‘Celebgate’ hackers has just been sent to prison for 18 months \nAccording to The Register , Lokihardt managed to successfully exploit Microsoft Edge’s security hole(s) in a mere 18 seconds, whereas the length of time it took Qihoo 360’s team to hack Microsoft Edge was not provided. In fact, the Qihoo 360 team reportedly worked on developing its trio of attacks for a period of six months prior to this week’s event. \nHowever, despite all that preparation, the Qihoo 360 team was forced to rework their Edge browser attack within a span of 30 hours. That’s because Microsoft plugged three of the four available vulnerabilities in a Patch Tuesday update released prior to this week’s hacking event. \nThe details surrounding vulnerabilities exploited during PwnFest won’t be released to the public right away, but rather provided directly to the vendors so they can issue an immediate fix. The hacking event is still ongoing as of this publication, so there’s a good chance we could hear more about successful exploits during the main two-day security conference.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nSkype users on Windows, Android, iOS, and OS X will now be able to test out new features for the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service as part of a new Insider program, exclusively for Skype. Announced shortly after Microsoft’s debut of the new Xbox Insider Program, Skype joins much of Microsoft’s major software platforms, to enable more frequent updates with better-tested features. \nThe idea behind the Insider Program is a simple but effective one: have a section of the user base opt-in to be beta testers before a worldwide rollout of software updates. That takes some of the pressure off of Microsoft’s internal testing teams, letting more features roll out on a speedier basis, without risking more bugs and flaws in the software. \nIt’s a scheme that’s worked very well with Microsoft’s Windows 10 as well as its Office software suites, and now we can expect the same sort of benefits for Skype. \nRelated: Microsoft’s Office Insider now has its very own Insider Fast Ring \nSkype users can now sign up to become part of the Insider program and will gain early access to features and performance improvements. While it’s likely they will have to contend with a few more bugs, reporting them early will help Microsoft iron those out before extending broader availability. \nAs The Verge points out, this scheme is already yielding early releases for Insiders. Users on OS X will find themselves able to use a new search tool for emoticons, to make sifting through them that bit easier. Call forwarding and voicemail options have also been expanded on the platform, while Android and iOS users should find a few early release bug fixes in their Insider releases. \nAnother takeaway from this news is that Microsoft is taking Skype seriously. At a time when it is refocusing and consolidating its efforts, clearly it’s doubling down on Skype as its communication tool of choice. Skype now joins the firm’s other mainstream products with its new Insider Program, and it will be interesting to see how the service evolves going forward.

It compares an organization's instance of System Center Operations Manager with Microsoft's best practices and produces \"a health check and risk assessment\" based on that comparison. \nThe assessments get displayed in graphical form in the Operations Management Suite. They include numerical weightings on any actions to take (see screenshot): [Click on image for larger view.] Screenshot of System Center Operations Manager Assessment preview. Source: Microsoft blog post . \nUsers of the tool get recommendations that are based on Microsoft's \"best practices that were collected over the years from Microsoft Knowledge Base articles and field engineers across multiple environments, industries and scenarios,\"   announcement. \nThe new assessment tool isn't turned on by default. IT pros have to enable the rule for a specific management server, as described in the announcement. They also have to configure a \"run as\" account within the Operations Management Suite. \nOnce installed, the System Center Operations Manager Assessment preview is designed to run for seven days to perform a health check. The scan can be reduced to a one-day period, at minimum, if wanted.  ",

      "title": "Microsoft Issues Another Fix for Surface Pro 3 Battery Problem",
      "text": "  this week quietly issued yet another firmware fix for Surface Pro 3 devices experiencing battery-charge reporting problems that have led to degraded performance over time. \nThe latest system firmware update, version 38.11.50.0, was issued on Nov. 7 and is described as addressing a problem \"where the full charge capacity of the battery is misreported to the operating system and device firmware,\" according to the Surface Pro 3 update history page . This new firmware release sounds much like an Aug. 29 firmware update (version 38.10.90.0) that also was designed to fix this problem. \nIt turns out that Microsoft likely isn't patching its previous firmware update with this new release. Instead, the two firmware update releases (August and November) are fixing software problems that affect two different batteries used in Surface Pro 3 devices. The August firmware patch was for Simplo batteries, while the November patch is for LGC batteries, according to a forum post explanation by Microsoft MVP Barb Bowman. \nSurface Pro 3 users had reported having battery issues even after the August firmware update was released, so the explanation for those continued problems could be that there were two battery makes to fix and just one got patched, assuming that Bowman's explanation is correct. She noted that her forum comments were just unofficial information summarized from an unnamed \"Surface contact.\" \nBowman added that the latest firmware update has some quirks before it can successfully install. For instance, the operating system \"must think that the battery is at 40% charge or greater\" for the patch to take effect. That circumstance could be a barrier for some Surface Pro 3 users, and Bowman said that she didn't know how to trick the OS into seeing the battery charged at 40 percent. If the firmware update still doesn't fix the problem, Surface Pro 3 users, at best, can pay $29 for Microsoft support, she added. \nMicrosoft has specific instructions regarding the installation of this new firmware update. It shouldn't be installed using the Surface Docking Station. Instead, users should just power the machine using \"the standard AC power adapter.\" Users also should disconnect USB devices and external monitors before applying the firmware update. \nAfter applying the firmware update, it takes \"several charge and discharges\" for the battery information to start getting properly reported,   FAQ on the Surface Pro 3 Battery . \nMicrosoft has claimed that the battery charge issue was just a problem for a small number of Surface Pro 3 users. It's not supposed to have affected other Surface models. \nIn other Surface news, Microsoft today announced that its \"most powerful\" Surface Book with Performance Base product and its Surface Dial navigation device for graphics designers are now available at retail outlets. Both devices were first announced as part of Microsoft event held in New York City in late October that showcased the Surface as a creative graphics tool. The Surface Book with Performance Base literally refers the bottom half of the device, but Microsoft doesn't sell it separately from the removable screen, as noted in a Thurrott.com article by reporter Brad Sams.

      "text": "\nDoesn’t time fly?\nIt’s hard to believe, but Microsoft’s backwards compatibility service between the Xbox 360 and Xbox One will officially be a year old as of November 12, and it’s showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon.\nIntroduced as part of Microsoft’s ‘New Xbox One Experience’ at the tail end of 2015, the feature launched with over 100 Xbox 360 titles being made available for adopters of its current-gen successor, with over 170 having been introduced since.\nRecent months have seen classics like Red Dead Redemption and Mass Effect 2 & 3 added thanks to fan feedback, but one highly-requested game has still been missing. Well, until today, anyway.\nEA’s Skate 3 is now available on the service, meaning fans can continue to chase their dream of forming the greatest skate crew ever with their friends. The Skate franchise “fundamentally changed the skateboarding genre,” by introducing various features never-before-seen in the genre according to the blog post, including a free-flowing control scheme – Flickit – and a Skate School feature that lets players practice their skills.\nIf you already own Skate 3 on Xbox 360, you should now be able to find the title ready to download on Xbox One and, as an added treat, Microsoft has teamed up with EA to offer the game’s San Van Party Pack DLC for free until November 20.\n",

      "title": "Microsoft Improves Azure SQL Premium for Big Data Analytics",
      "text": "New in-memory data technology that makes short work out of big data analytics is now available on Microsoft's Azure SQL cloud database. \nAzure SQL's in-memory capabilities are now generally available, Microsoft announced this week, setting the stage for brisk and advanced cloud-based analytics. As the term suggests, in-memory processing relies on data stored in a RAM to accelerate database performance. Rather than wait for data to wend its way from storage components and arrays to a server's processor, in-memory databases can access information much more rapidly courtesy of a server's own memory bus and its comparatively faster data transfer speeds. Accordingly, in-memory database servers are often outfitted with massive amounts of RAM. For example, in a \"scale-up\" configuration, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (HPE) ConvergedSystem 900 systems for SAP HANA, the German business software maker's in-memory database, can contain up to 16 TB of system memory. Microsoft is now offering in-memory support to Azure SQL customers with Premium database tier subscriptions. And those customers can expect a big performance boost, according to Rohan Kumar, general manager of Microsoft's Database Systems group.\"In-memory technology helps optimize the performance of transactional (OLTP), analytics (OLAP), as well as mixed workloads (HTAP),\" wrote Kumar in a blog post . \"These technologies allow you to achieve phenomenal performance with Azure SQL Database—75,000 transactions per second for order processing (11X [performance] gain) and reduced query execution time from 15 seconds to 0.26 (57X [performance gain]).\"Further, customers can use Azure SQL's in-memory features to blaze through database workloads at no extra cost, he added. For example, customers under a P2 database plan can achieve 9X and 10X improvements in transactions and analytics queries, respectively, without paying extra. A handful of features comprise Azure SQL's newfound performance-boosting capabilities, including in-memory OLTP (online transaction processing). This latency-reducing technology increases data throughput, enabling high-speed trading and rapid data ingestion from internet of things (IoT) devices. Another feature, clustered columnstore indexes, slashes data storage footprints by up to 10X, accelerating reporting and analytics workloads, claimed Kumar. Used with Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP), Azure SQL's non-clustered columnstore indexes that forego the time-consuming extract, transform, load (ETL) process, enabe real-time analytics that query the operational database directly. Of course, the competition isn't sitting still. On Nov. 8, SAP announced the impeding release of HANA 2 , the follow-up to the company's cloud-friendly, in-memory computing platform. HANA is a big moneymaker for SAP, growing into a near-$2 billion business since it was introduced in December 2010. On Nov. 30, the company plans to release a new version of the blisteringly fast database, complete with new artificial intelligence algorithms and bring-your-own-language capabilities intended to help developers build and deploy a new generation of intelligent applications. Mirroring the white-hot container development trend, customers can also expect new SAP HANA microservices in the cloud. They include a batch of text and natural language data processing features (Text Analysis Entity Extraction, Text Analysis Fact Extraction and Text Analysis Linguistic Analysis) along with a new Earth Observation Analysis service. The latter, available in beta, uses satellite data from the European Space Agency (ESA) enabling researchers to analyze historic information about the world's vegetation, soil and water conditions.",

      "text": "0 Panos Panay, Corporate Vice President for Surface Computing holds the new Microsoft Surface Book i7 laptop at a live event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, October 26, 2016. Reuters/Lucas Jackson \nIn the ever-developing tech world, hybrid devices have risen up the ranks and are taking the market by storm. At the forefront of the battle are the tablet/laptop 2-in-1 devices, which are arguably being led by Microsoft’s Surface Book i7 and Lenovo’s Yoga 910. \nREAD: Surface Book 2 vs 2016 MacBook Pro: Specs, features and price comparison \nOn October 26, Microsoft introduced the Surface Book i7 -- sometimes referred to as the Surface Book 2 -- which upgraded from its predecessor in relatively humble ways. The design is generally unchanged, though the new device is noticeably heavier and thicker. But while these traits are not ideal, the Redmond-based company has included enough features that more than make up for it. \nThe Surface Book i7 is at least 3.63 pounds and is thickest at 22.8mm. It does, however, come powered by the sixth generation Intel Core i7 processor and is partnered with the Nvidia GeForce 965M graphics chip. The discrete GPU and its cooling units are installed into the keyboard of the device. This means that once the display is detached from its Performance Base, the same power is not experienced. \nAnother improvement that Microsoft made for the Surface Book i7 is better battery life. The device can reportedly run for 16 hours on a full single charge while hooked onto the base and 12 hours when detached. Price starts at US$2,400 (AU$3,156) and it is available for pre-order at Microsoft. \nREAD: Microsoft offers to pay Macbook owners to switch to Surface \nThe Lenovo Yoga 910, on the other hand, is powered by the seventh generation Intel Core i7 processor and an Intel HD Graphics 620 chip. The CPU proves that Lenovo did not cut any corners in terms of power, which is sometimes an issue with hybrid devices. The upgraded technology allows the CPU to work at its most efficient without overheating. \nThe company boasts that the Lenovo Yoga 910 will last 9 hours on a single battery charge, which is significantly less than the Surface Book i7. It does, however, flip over completely to turn into a laptop and notebook, unlike its Microsoft competitor that needs to be detached. The Lenovo hybrid's pricing begins at US$1,330 (AU$1,750).",

      "text": "All Android apps for Microsoft's Office suite will be compatible with Chrome OS All Android apps for Microsoft's Office suite will be compatible with Chrome OS Posted: Tags : Android - Android + Microsoft - Microsoft + Chrome OS is a rather peculiar operating system, but before 2016 is officially in the history books, it'll be getting an update that will allow Chromebooks to natively run Android apps. This is a move that will do nothing but wonders for Chrome OS's lack of app support, and in preparation for the official release at the end of the year, Google is currently beta testing the new software and app support on the supported devices that the beta is available on. Owners of the Pixel Chromebook, Asus Flip, and Acer Chromebook R11 currently have access to the beta, and as more and more people are testing it out, some users have been reporting that they've been blocked from downloading the Microsoft Office Android apps. This certainly is a bummer to hear as the Office apps for Android are incredibly feature-rich and are great productivity tools, but Microsoft was quick to release an official statement on the matter to reassure us that we shouldn't let this news get us too bummed out. 9to5Google reached out to Microsoft about this matter, and a spokesperson for the company responded with the following message - Our strategy has not changed. Office for Android is supported on Chrome OS devices via the Google Play Store. While Google Play on Chrome OS is in beta, we are partnering with Google to deliver the best experience for Chromebook users and plan to make the apps available on all compatible devices by general availability. So, if you're a frequent user of Microsoft Office and were worried that it wasn't working while testing out the beta for Chrome OS, you can rest easy knowing that you'll be covered once the operating system exists the beta stage. Even with this said though, it is worth keeping in mind that you'll need to be an Office 365 subscriber in order to access all of the features that the Office apps have to offer. As per the rules that Microsoft has set, any device with a screen of 10.1-inches or larger (basically any Chromebook) will not be able to edit, print, or create any sort of files or documents unless they are a paying subscriber for the service. However, if you're already a frequent user of the Office mobile apps, it's likely that you do subscribe to Office 365.",

      "text": "By David Morgan | WASHINGTON \nDonald Trump’s White House victory moves Apple, Pfizer, Microsoft and other big U.S. corporations much closer than they have been in years to winning a big tax break on $2.6 trillion in foreign profits. \nTax reform is shaping up as among the most fruitful areas for cooperation between Trump and his fellow Republicans, who held control in Tuesday’s elections of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. \nTrump and congressional Republicans have separate, but similar, tax reform plans. Both would slash tax rates on businesses, simplify and cut individual taxes, and let companies bring overseas profits into the country at a low tax rate, raising prospects for a sweeping deal on taxes. \nBipartisan support for corporate tax reform has been growing as multinational companies have amassed tax-deferred profits abroad and brought continuous lobbying pressure over a decade for a tax break on them. \n“On tax policy, he’s basically adopted the House blueprint as his approach,” said Rohit Kumar, co-leader of the tax policy services practice at Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL]. \n“There’s a better chance that something happens next year than there has been at any point in the last several years.” \nAt the heart of the issue is a law that lets U.S. companies hold foreign profits overseas without paying U.S. corporate tax on them, unless and until those profits are brought into the United States, which is known as repatriation. \nCorporations have $2.6 trillion stashed abroad under this law. That money could be repatriated any time, but businesses choose not to because it would incur the 35 percent statutory corporate income tax. \nTrump and House Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, would still need to agree on how to pay for lower corporate tax rates and on whether U.S.-based multinationals should pay U.S. taxes on future foreign profits. \nTrump and congressional Republicans would also need support for tax reform from Democrats if they intend to present the package as a benefit for the country as a whole, analysts say. \nSuch proposals have stumbled before on Democrats’ objections that they are corporate give-away, and on Republicans’ insistence that they be paired with a cut in the corporate income tax rate. \nDemocrats could still block legislation they dislike from reaching the floor of the Senate, which requires a super majority of 60 votes to advance a measure, but there are procedural maneuvers Republicans could use to bypass them. \nThe one-time surge in revenue that would result from repatriation could help fund another cornerstone of Trump’s campaign platform — a pledge to boost the economy through big investments in U.S. highways, roads, bridges, airports and seaports. \nInfrastructure spending was not a campaign priority for congressional Republicans. But a new job-creating program could appeal to Democrats and be valuable to lawmakers in the 2018 mid-term elections. \nThe four companies with the largest profits held overseas are: Apple Inc ($200 billion), Pfizer Inc ($194 billion), Microsoft Corp ($108 billion) and General Electric Co ($104 billion), according to March estimates by Citizens for Tax Justice, a corporate income tax watchdog group in Washington. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2eBx2BO ). \nThe European Commission in August hit Apple with a 13 billion euro ($14.3 billion) bill for back taxes, fanning concerns among other U.S. multinationals and U.S. officials that their untaxed foreign revenues could be vulnerable to further European penalties. [nL8N1BB32W] \nApple CEO Tim Cook told an interviewer in September that he expects to repatriate billions of dollars in global profits to the United States in 2017 but did not say how. [nS8N1BD000] He said in another interview that the company would not bring money back unless there was “a fair rate” and said he was optimistic that tax reform would occur next year. \nBUSINESS SUPPORT \nThe House tax plan, which Ryan and other leading Republicans promoted throughout the campaign, would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, force multinationals to repatriate existing foreign earnings and adopt a “territorial” system that would largely end taxation of U.S. companies’ foreign income. \nTrump is calling for a steeper rate cut to 15 percent, and he has proposed a 10 percent tax rate for repatriated overseas profits held in cash, payable over a decade. \nSome are optimistic that those differences can be overcome. \n“In the end, there are no differences that can’t be solved on the tax issue,” said Republican Representative Tom Cole. \nThe House Republican plan has had significant support from business. \nKumar’s PwC advises the Alliance for Competitive Taxation, which lobbies on tax reform for over 40 companies ranging from Alcoa Inc and Cisco Systems Inc to Alphabet’s Google Inc, Procter & Gamble Co and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. \n“We know what we want,” said Dorothy Coleman, a tax policy expert at the National Association of Manufacturers, referring to a lower corporate tax rate, adopting a “modern, competitive” territorial system, and a permanent R&D credit among other wishes. \nThe House’s corporate tax plan would cut revenues by more than $890 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The same research group says Trump’s corporate plan would reduce revenues by $2.6 trillion. \nTrump and Republicans in Congress view tax reform as a way to jump-start economic growth and job creation. \nBusiness lobbyists say that higher tax revenues from a growing economy would address much of the House plan’s shortfall. Trump advisers say revenue erosion posed by the president-elect’s plan would be overcome by growth and policy initiatives including a more aggressive approach to trade. \n(Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Stuart Grudgings) Share This:",

      "text": "The new Surface Book's Performance Base fixes all the flaws of the original. (Photo: Reviewed.com)\nWe’ve scoured the web to find you the best deals on good products. While Reviewed.com may receive a small share of the revenue from your purchase, editorial opinions are independent from any business sales.\nLast year, Microsoft surprised everyone with its ultimate laptop/tablet combo, dubbed Surface Book . I really enjoyed using it, but lamented its high price tag and it was held back by buggy hardware. It was a beautiful, expensive laptop...one whose screen tears off to become a clipboard-style tablet.\nJust in time for the holidays (and for new MacBook Pros to finally arrive), Microsoft's reinvested in its laptop line by adding the new Surface Book with Performance Base (MSRP $2,399, $3,299 as tested). This Surface Book gets an extra kick in the pants from a faster Nvidia graphics chip in a redesigned keyboard base. The tablet portion hasn't been redesigned, but you'll not only get improved graphics but also longer battery life.\nIf you were iffy about the original Surface Book, then those concerns generally apply here. But, if you thought the first Book wasn't quite powerful enough, the Performance Base version helps shore up those weaknesses, and makes the product even more lustworthy.\nMicrosoft Surface Book with Performance Base - Buy now for $2,799.99\nAbout the Surface Book with Performance Base This new version of Surface Book keeps the beating Intel heart of the current Book, and mates it to a keyboard that has a more powerful Nvidia graphics processor and more battery inside. There are three versions of this laptop, and the one we were able to try is the top-of-the-line model that sells for the eye-watering price of $3,299:\nIntel Core i7-6600U dual-core processor 16 GB RAM 1 TB PCIe solid state drive 13.3-inch 3000 x 2000 IPS touchscreen Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M graphics with 2 GB GDDR5 VRAM (in keyboard dock) WiFi AC/ Bluetooth 4.1 What We Like The kinks are ironed out.\nThe last time I used a Surface Book, the end result was a mixed bag. The model I sampled was prone to glitches—not what you want from a super expensive, premium-grade 2-in-1. And I wasn't the only one complaining, either.\nNotetaking and sketching are awesome with Surface Book's included pen. (Photo: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt)\nThankfully, most of these issues have been resolved at this point, and a lot of them were due to Intel's 6th generation chips, which had problems in many competing systems, too. I found the Surface Book with Performance Base perfectly usable, with little issue whether in full laptop mode, or even with the screen torn off and used as a tablet.\nA spec bump in some key areas.\nSome might kvetch that the new, super-expensive Surface Book with Performance Base isn't that different. It still uses a 6th generation Intel Core i7 chip in the display, meaning the detachable tablet portion is unchanged from its introduction late last year. Is that the end of the world? Well, no. Even though Intel's just debuted its latest 7th gen processors, I've found that they don't add a whole lot into the mix. These dual-core i7 processors are solid at this point.\nWhere the Performance Base changes the narrative is in graphics performance and battery life. The original discrete GPU models of Surface Book have a custom Nvidia graphics chip that helped it get a leg-up on its competition but wasn't anything to write home about. The Performance Base swaps that for a spicier Nvidia GTX 965M with 2 GB GDDR5 memory onboard. It won't game or crunch data like a Razer Blade , but it'll give a much-appreciated boost when running through demanding tasks.\nThe redesigned keyboard is satisfying to use. (Photo: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt)\nBattery capacity is up around 30%, all stuffed inside the redesigned Performance Base keyboard. In our intensive PCMark 8 Home battery life test, we saw a decent increase of runtime. Up from around four and a half hours, we saw nearly five hours in the test with the Performance Base version. If you're a road warrior who demands a power and battery life that can work as long as you, this new version of Surface Book should be on your list.\nSleek, and still unorthodox as all getout\nBitter about the 2016 MacBook Pros? If you gravitated towards Apple's notebooks because they're beautiful and go against the grain, then meet the hipster laptop of your dreams. Surface Book with Performance Base delivers fast internals in an unforgettable, unique enclosure. If you're looking at paying Apple prices for a notebook, Surface Book might not make you shy like a startled mustang.\nBut the inclusion of a lovely pen ( recommended by our comic artist pal Braden Lamb ), the versatility of using the screen as a standalone device for watching a video or reading, is something that the MacBook Pro can't do. Sure, the Mac has a skinny Touch Bar above the keyboard, but it still doesn't have a full touchscreen like Surface Book. Additionally, the Surface Book lets you log in with your grinning face instead of using a fingerprint, a technology that, when it works, makes the Mac's TouchID sensor seem like it's old hat.\nWe think the dynamic fulcrum hinge is as beautiful and unique as it was last year. (Photo: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt)\nEven though I'd recommend the HP Spectre X360 and even the cheaper Surface Pro 4 to people on a tighter budget, Microsoft's 2-in-1 solution with this new Performance Base is tailor-made for more demanding professional users.\nNo-compromises on ports and a high-quality keyboard\nPerhaps the most annoying \"updates\" to the 2016 MacBook Pros came in the form of transformed ports and a keyboard that's been reduced to barely moving. Surface Book with Performance Base has none of these drawbacks. It might not have the awesome potential of a Thunderbolt 3 port like competitors from Razer and Dell, but everything else makes it feel ready to get real work done now, today, in the present.\nSurface Book with Performance Base retains the handy SD card reader and twin USB 3.0 ports that professional users expect. The keyboard dock, redesigned to fit a hotter, faster graphics processor, has a new keyboard to match. Redesigned though it may be, it's another A+ Microsoft keyboard—super comfortable and responsive to type on for long sprints.\nGet the latest deals, news and reviews from Reviewed.com Email Address What We Don't Like Battery life in tablet mode isn't great\nWhile I truly admire the ability to undock the display from the Surface Book, the un-updated bits of Surface Book still smart just a tiny bit. The so-called \"clipboard\" is a cool party trick, but its short 2-hour battery life means you won't be binge watching Netflix on its gorgeous 13.3-inch display. Instead, you'll be limited to short bursts of content, quick batch edits in Lightroom, or a few chapters in a Kindle book.\nI've used the Surface Book clipboard to edit stories with the Surface Pen, and for that usage, Surface Book with Performance Base is as extraordinary to use as before. Journalists who like to red-pen material just like in the good ol' paper days would do well to look into a Surface for editing and notetaking.\nSure, you can use Lightroom like this...but don't count on the tablet lasting very long. (Photo: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt)\nNo Thunderbolt 3 in a year when everyone's added it.\nSo, Apple took away the MacBook Pro's normal USB ports and replaced them with Thunderbolt 3 ports. Mac fans are already bellyaching about needing adapters in order to use their current accouterments.\nThat gives the Surface Book immediate compatibility with today's devices, but there's a catch. I'd imagine, without an extensive redesign, Microsoft was unable to sneak in a Thunderbolt 3/USB-C port. One of these future-proofed ports would have gone a long way to bridge the gap between today's needs and tomorrow's devices, but I'd imagine that we'll have to wait for the inevitable Surface Book sequel to roll around.\nFull-size USB ports are welcome, but we're waiting for a Thunderbolt 3 to be added to the mix. (Photo: Reviewed.com / Brendan Nystedt)\nAs it stands, competing devices from HP , Dell , and Razer all give you the power of Thunderbolt and the flexibility of USB-C, giving them a slight port advantage over the updated Surface Book with Performance Base.\nShould You Buy It? It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up. Thanks to its boost in battery and graphics potential, Microsoft has given Surface Book a great shot in the arm. It's the highest-performing 2-in-1 we've tested thus far, and it underscores that Surface wants to win over pro and creative users. It's far from the reinvention that some people were hoping for, and if you were annoyed with the old one, this one has the exact same foibles.\nThe concept didn't need a whole lot more to push it over the edge, and the extra oomph of the Performance Base make it that much more interesting. Of course, you're still looking at a really expensive device. Given that this will trounce a similarly-equipped 13-inch MacBook Pro in intensive graphical tasks, the extra price doesn't seem like a big ask.\nThrow in the detachable tablet and the useful Surface Pen, and the unique value proposition makes Surface Book more interesting than what Apple has to offer on its Pro offerings. Of course, quad-core models like the Razer Blade and Dell XPS 15 give you more computing power for your money. Where Surface Book shines is as a device that has few legitimate rivals. Its blend of performance, design, and flexibility are hard to find elsewhere. Even though it costs a pretty penny, Microsoft still has a special laptop in this supercharged Surface Book.",

      "title": "Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft stocks drop following Trump victory",
      "text": "Shares of Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc and other technology companies sank on Thursday as Wall Street sold them to pay for infrastructure names that could benefit from potential economic stimulus spending by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Before his unexpected victory in Tuesday’s election, investors had worried about uncertainty that a Trump presidency might create, but traders in the past two days have been looking to business sectors that might stand to benefit.\nAmazon fell 4.7 percent to its lowest level since July, while Alphabet dropped 2.3 percent. Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp lost about 2.7 percent each. “I don’t think there’s anything in the new administration that’s going to be negative for tech stocks,” said Michael Yoshikami, head of Destination Wealth Management. “It’s just that other things are more in demand, and so there’s a rotation.”\nIn his acceptance speech, Trump reiterated his commitment to increased infrastructure spending, while striking a conciliatory note and avoiding references to controversial campaign promises.\nThe S&P 500 technology index .SPLRCT dropped 2 percent on Thursday and was on track for its steepest daily decline in two months, while the materials index .SPLRCM rose 1.27 percent. The industrial index .SPLRCI jumped 2.1 percent, helped by a 3.8 percent surge in Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N). Banks also rallied on expectations that Trump would roll back financial regulation.\nThe technology sector recently traded at about 16.2 times expected earnings, in line with the S&P 500 .SPX, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. The materials sector traded near 15.9 times expected earnings. Thursday’s loss leaves Apple, which is struggling with lackluster iPhones sales, up 1.9 percent in 2016, lagging the S&P 500’s 6 percent rise.\nReuters \nThe post Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft stocks drop following Trump victory appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Google Reports Vulnerability In Flash, Windows \nMicrosoft is promising that once the update is installed, the full charge capacity of the Surface Pro 3 will be corrected after a couple of charge and discharge cycles. Hence, users should not expect to see a big jump on their device’s fuel right away. The company also pointed out that for units that did not suffer the battery issue, their owners shouldn’t worry about anything. \nThe Redmond company released the new update in response to complaints from users that began to surface way back when the Surface Pro 3 tablets with Simplo batteries started shipping. Newowin has learned that the LGC batteries that came with the Surface Pro 3 tablets drained quickly after a full charge. \nThere were users who complained that their units were not charging at all. Some users also said that their Surface Pro 3 device couldn’t function without plugging it in. Users of devices with problematic batteries have since been raising their concerns to Microsoft, so it’s just right for the company to finally roll out a fix for the issue.

      "text": "Russia has launched a case against US IT giant Microsoft over alleged violation of the country’s competition law, Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service said on Thursday.\nAnatoly Golomolzin, deputy head of the anti-monopoly watchdog, said Microsoft was suspected of violating the Russian law on the protection of competition for misusing its dominant position in the Russian software market, Xinhua news agency reported.\nThe investigation was prompted after Russian computer security company Kaspersky Lab accused Microsoft of making the Russian anti-virus manufacturers unable to compete with Microsoft by reducing the adaptation time of Russian anti-virus software producers from two months to six days in its latest Windows 10 operating system.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has been urging state entities and local companies to use domestic software out of concerns over security and reliability.\nAccording to Russia’s Minister of Communications Nikolay Nikiforov, the government has produced a list of nearly 2,000 Russian software products that state-run companies should use instead of foreign brands.\nIANS \nThe post Russia launches case against Microsoft over alleged violation of competition laws appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "By Ben Moore Neowin LLC @@benmoore214 · 34 minutes ago with 1 comment \nDonald Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election has created uncertainty within the tech sector in general and about some specific policies, including net neutrality . Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer (CLO) at Microsoft, published a letter on the election results earlier in the week. He first congratulated both Trump and Pence on their election, before addressing key areas of concern for Microsoft and the wider tech industry. \nSmith first acknowledged those that felt left behind by the election results. He wrote, “in a time of rapid change, we need to innovate to promote inclusive economic growth that helps everyone move forward,” a responsibility he said should be shared among those in government, the private sector and by individuals. \nThe CLO then discussed the importance of innovation in public policy, advocating for education reform, more modern labor laws, and restructured benefits for “the tens of millions of Americans that are working part-time, acting as an independent worker, or participating in the expanding tech-based gig economy with companies such as Uber and Lyft.” \nSmith also supported the idea of a culturally conscious work environment, citing how Microsoft’s workforce represented 157 different countries in addition to its racial, ethic, gender and linguistic diversity. However, it's worth remembering that gender equality was brought into the spotlight back in 2014 when Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was criticized for his response to a question on how women should go about asking for raises. \nThe legal chief said that the government and tech sector need to work together “to strike a balance that protects privacy and public safety in what remains a dangerous time,” as people will not use technology that they do not trust. As an example of the company's commitment to privacy, Microsoft won an appeal over the US government's access to data stored on foreign servers, which Smith hailed as a major victory for privacy earlier this year. \nSmith concluded, “It’s a day that provides an opportunity to look beyond disagreements and divides, identify bold solutions to common problems, and find new ways to work together. It’s a good time for all of us to listen and to learn from each other.”",

      "text": "Last month, Microsoft unveiled the new Surface Book with Performance Base at a slick event in New York City, and now there are reports that the first wave of pre-orders are starting to ship. More Last month, Microsoft officially unveiled its first major revision of the Surface Book laptop. Now, there are reports that the first wave of pre-orders on the device are starting to ship out to customers, and new stock is becoming available.\nSome users that pre-ordered the Surface Book with the new Performance Base peripheral are now beginning to receive their tracking codes, according to a report from MS Power User . This suggests that the hardware will be shipping imminently, if it hasn’t already entered the distribution process.\nThe biggest change to the second iteration of the Surface Book is the introduction of the Performance Base. This component allows the system to make good on the promise of a hybrid device — it’s a fully functional laptop when you want it to be, and a high-spec tablet when that’s more convenient.\nMore: Microsoft files a patent enabling Surface Pen wireless charging via accessories\nThe result is a system that’s more than capable of handling just about any task that’s thrown at it. With the Performance Base locked in, the new Surface Book boasts an impressive 16 hour battery life, and a new GPU that apparently offers double the graphical performance of its predecessor.\nThe Surface Book with Performance Base edged out the 2016 MacBook Pro in the Digital Trends comparison between both systems . However, it has to be said that competition was very tight, even if the Surface Book’s hybrid capabilities and its top-notch display allowed Microsoft’s laptop to edge out its biggest competition.\nIf you’ve been holding off on ordering your Surface Book with Performance Base, now might be the time to strike if you’re looking to receive the device ahead of the holidays. Models with 256GB and 512GB of storage are available now with no shipping delays, while the 1TB variant is scheduled to be available from November 28.\nLenovo Yoga 910 vs. Microsoft Surface Book: Two supercharged 2-in-1s duke it out Everything you must know about Windows 10 Creators Update and Surface Studio Microsoft unveils pricey but powerful Surface Book update, Surface Studio at NY event",

      "text": "A recent hacking event saw several teams remotely executing malicious code through vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge, one of which was accomplished in a mere 18 seconds. Information about these vulnerabilities will be supplied to Microsoft first. More On Thursday during the PwnFest 2016 event within Seoul’s Power of Community security conference, a team from vulnerability firm Qihoo 360 and South Korean security researcher JungHoon “Lokihardt” Lee demonstrated two different hacks that took advantage of vulnerabilities within Microsoft Edge, completing one in a mere 18 seconds. The internet browser was running on a 64-bit version of Windows 10 Anniversary Edition (aka Redstone 1), and enabled these teams to remotely execute code at the system level.\nPwnFest is a “festival” that encourages hackers and security firms to target specific platforms as a means of demonstrating how vulnerabilities they find can be used in the wild. Participants receive a cash prize while platform developers receive information about vulnerabilities and how they are exploited. In the end, participants and general consumers are the two big winners stemming from the event.\nThat said, here are the targets and their cash rewards:\nPlatform/OS/Device Base Reward Extra Reward Microsoft Edge\nWindows 10 x64 Redstone 1 $120,000 $20,000 Android 7.0\nNexus 6p and Pixel $120,000 $20,000 Microsoft Hyper-V\nWindows Server 2016 $150,000 none Google Chrome\nWindows 10 x64 Redstone 1 $120,000 $20,000 Apple iOS 10\niPhone 7 Plus $120,000 $60,000 Apple Safari\nMacOS Sierra $80,000 $20,000 Adobe Flash Player\nMicrosoft Edge\nWindows 10 x64 Redstone 1 $100,000 $20,000 VMWare Workstation Pro 1.2\nWindows 10 x64 Redstone 1 $150,000 none As for the participating teams, there appear to be six. Here they are with their targets:\n360Vulcan\n360Alpha\n360Marvel Lokihardt Team Pangu\nJH Microsoft Edge Microsoft Edge Apple Safari VMware Workstation 12.5.1 VMware Workstation 12.5.1 Adobe Flash Player Android 7.0 (via Pixel) On the Microsoft Edge front, vulnerabilities discovered in the Windows 10 browser enabled system-level remote code execution. To better understand system-level access, you have to look at how device operating systems are layered in a security sense. At the top layer, consumers will see the applications they normally use. Under that are device drivers with low privileges followed by device drivers with high privileges further underneath. The final, bottom layer consists of the operating system’s central core, aka the kernel, that controls everything. Running a malicious program below the “user” layer grants a hacker special privileges that can go undetected by the device owner.\nMore: One of the ‘Celebgate’ hackers has just been sent to prison for 18 months\nAccording to The Register , Lokihardt managed to successfully exploit Microsoft Edge’s security hole(s) in a mere 18 seconds, whereas the length of time it took Qihoo 360’s team to hack Microsoft Edge was not provided. In fact, the Qihoo 360 team reportedly worked on developing its trio of attacks for a period of six months prior to this week’s event.\nHowever, despite all that preparation, the Qihoo 360 team was forced to rework their Edge browser attack within a span of 30 hours. That’s because Microsoft plugged three of the four available vulnerabilities in a Patch Tuesday update released prior to this week’s hacking event.\nThe details surrounding vulnerabilities exploited during PwnFest won’t be released to the public right away, but rather provided directly to the vendors so they can issue an immediate fix. The hacking event is still ongoing as of this publication, so there’s a good chance we could hear more about successful exploits during the main two-day security conference.\nMicrosoft releases patch for zero-day Flash and Windows Kernel exploit Oh, look!

      "text": "0 A Microsoft Surface Book i7 laptop rests on a tabletop at an event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 26, 2016. Reuters/Lucas Jackson \nAffinity Photo is now available on Windows after launching on Nov. 10. Windows users can buy the best Mac app of 2015 for free as a beta version. \nAffinity Photo is the alternative for Photoshop featuring many of the same functions and workflows. Its beta version on Windows shares exactly the same back-end as the Mac version. It means that files are 100 percent compatible between both platforms. \nIt has a super fast feature when it comes to retouching images. It also features a RAW editing and file compatibility including PSD files used in Photoshop. It allows users to work in any colour space including the RGB, CMYK, Grayscale, LAB, End-to-end CMYK workflow with ICC colour management and 16-bit per channel editing. \nIt also features customisable effects with a huge range of high-end filters. The filters can be applied as live layers enabling the user to edit, mask or erase away the effects. \nThe beta version includes HDR merge, focus stacking, macros, tone mapping, batch processing and 360 degree image editing. \nThe Windows system hardware requirements include Windows-based PC with mouse or equivalent input device and DirectX 10-compatible Graphics Cards and above. A 2GB RAM is compatible but a 4GB RAM is recommended. The hard disk must have 780MB of available space but it requires more during installation. Windows 10, Windows 8.x, and Windows 7 (Service Pack 1; Aero enabled) are the operating systems compatible with Affinity Photo. \nThe company has not yet released the price for the Windows version. The Mac version cost US$49.99 (AU$65.86). \nAffinity Photo does not require subscription to receive updates or to keep using the software.",

Anatoly Golomolzin, deputy head of the anti-monopoly watchdog, said Microsoft was suspected of violating the Russian law on the protection of competition for misusing its dominant position in the Russian software market. The investigation was prompted after Russian computer security company Kaspersky Lab accused Microsoft of making the Russian anti-virus manufacturers unable to compete with Microsoft by reducing the adaptation time of Russian anti-virus software producers from two months to six days in its latest Windows 10 operating system.

      "text": "The virtual touchpad on the latest test version of Windows 10.\nPhoto by Microsoft Here's a little something to get excited about if you're a Windows 10 watcher on the lookout for new features.\nMicrosoft on Wednesday released its latest Windows 10 Creators test version , which includes a virtual touchpad that lets you control external monitors from tablets without having to attach a mouse.\n\"Use it just like you would a physical touchpad to control content on the connected screen,\" software engineer Dona Sarkar said in a blog announcing the new build.\nTo enable the feature, you press and hold on the taskbar and select \"show touchpad button.\"\nOtherwise, there are very few new features in the test build, according to Mary Jo Foley, who watches Microsoft for CNET sister site ZDNet. She noted some Sticky Note updates, including support for \"Insights\" in more languages. \"Microsoft also improved Windows Ink Workspace in this build with various tweaks,\" she said.",

      "title": "Microsoft and Google working together to support Office Mobile on Chromebooks - Digital Trends",
      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nMicrosoft has made a concerted effort over the last couple of years to provide solid cross-platform support for all of its applications and services. Indeed, supporting iOS and Android along with their Windows 10 ecosystem is a cornerstone of its “cloud-first, mobile-first” productivity solutions strategy. \nChromebooks have always been a strange outlier. While users of Google’s Chrome OS-based notebooks have always been able to access Microsoft’s Office Online products, there has never been a dedicated app like the Office Mobile suite that has long been available for iOS, Android, and Windows 10. That is about to change, albeit in a roundabout way, as 9to5Google reports . \nMore: Office Mobile is free for editing docs on machines with smaller than 10.1-inch screens \nRelatively recently, Google added the ability for Chrome OS to run Android apps and access to the Google Play Store. The move dramatically increased the value of a Chromebook, providing the minimal notebooks with sudden access to hundreds of thousands of Android apps. Microsoft’s Office Mobile apps for Android are among those that should now be available to Chromebook users. \nHowever, some users ran into issues downloading Office Mobile on their Chromebooks earlier in the week, leading to some speculation that Microsoft was deliberately blocking the apps. As it turns out, it is the opposite, as Microsoft has since stated, “Our strategy has not changed. Office for Android is supported on Chrome OS devices via the Google Play Store. While Google Play on Chrome OS is in beta, we are partnering with Google to deliver the best experience for Chromebook users and plan to make the apps available on all compatible devices by general availability.” \nIt is important to note the kind of Chromebook an Office Mobile app, be it Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote, runs on is an important consideration. While Microsoft lets users edit Office documents for free using the apps on devices with screens smaller than 10.1 inches, larger devices must have an active Office 365 subscription to edit documents. \nClearly, Microsoft recognizes the growing influence of Chromebooks, which continue to sell at volumes that make them a small but growing portion of the potential market for Microsoft’s productivity solutions. And so it should come as no surprise that Microsoft is working closely with Google to ensure that when Chromebook users are editing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, and taking notes, that they are using Office Mobile.

      "title": "U.S. multinationals eye foreign profits tax break with Trump win | Reuters",
      "text": "WASHINGTON Donald Trump's White House victory moves Apple ( AAPL.O ), Pfizer ( PFE.N ), Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) and other big U.S. corporations much closer than they have been in years to winning a big tax break on $2.6 trillion in foreign profits.\nTax reform is shaping up as among the most fruitful areas for cooperation between Trump and his fellow Republicans, who held control in Tuesday's elections of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\nTrump and congressional Republicans have separate, but similar, tax reform plans. Both would slash tax rates on businesses, simplify and cut individual taxes, and let companies bring overseas profits into the country at a low tax rate, raising prospects for a sweeping deal on taxes.\nBipartisan support for corporate tax reform has been growing as multinational companies have amassed tax-deferred profits abroad and brought continuous lobbying pressure over a decade for a tax break on them.\n\"On tax policy, he's basically adopted the House blueprint as his approach,\" said Rohit Kumar, co-leader of the tax policy services practice at Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers [PWC.UL].\n\"There's a better chance that something happens next year than there has been at any point in the last several years.\"\nAt the heart of the issue is a law that lets U.S. companies hold foreign profits overseas without paying U.S. corporate tax on them, unless and until those profits are brought into the United States, which is known as repatriation.\nCorporations have $2.6 trillion stashed abroad under this law. That money could be repatriated any time, but businesses choose not to because it would incur the 35 percent statutory corporate income tax.\nTrump and House Republicans, including Speaker Paul Ryan, would still need to agree on how to pay for lower corporate tax rates and on whether U.S.-based multinationals should pay U.S. taxes on future foreign profits.\nTrump and congressional Republicans would also need support for tax reform from Democrats if they intend to present the package as a benefit for the country as a whole, analysts say.\nSuch proposals have stumbled before on Democrats' objections that they are corporate give-away, and on Republicans' insistence that they be paired with a cut in the corporate income tax rate. \nDemocrats could still block legislation they dislike from reaching the floor of the Senate, which requires a super majority of 60 votes to advance a measure, but there are procedural maneuvers Republicans could use to bypass them.\nThe one-time surge in revenue that would result from repatriation could help fund another cornerstone of Trump's campaign platform -- a pledge to boost the economy through big investments in U.S. highways, roads, bridges, airports and seaports.\nInfrastructure spending was not a campaign priority for congressional Republicans. But a new job-creating program could appeal to Democrats and be valuable to lawmakers in the 2018 mid-term elections.\nThe four companies with the largest profits held overseas are: Apple Inc ($200 billion), Pfizer Inc ($194 billion), Microsoft Corp ($108 billion) and General Electric Co ( GE.N ) ($104 billion), according to March estimates by Citizens for Tax Justice, a corporate income tax watchdog group in Washington. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2eBx2BO ). \nThe European Commission in August hit Apple with a 13 billion euro ($14.3 billion) bill for back taxes, fanning concerns among other U.S. multinationals and U.S. officials that their untaxed foreign revenues could be vulnerable to further European penalties.\nApple CEO Tim Cook told an interviewer in September that he expects to repatriate billions of dollars in global profits to the United States in 2017 but did not say how. He said in another interview that the company would not bring money back unless there was \"a fair rate\" and said he was optimistic that tax reform would occur next year.\n\nBUSINESS SUPPORT\nThe House tax plan, which Ryan and other leading Republicans promoted throughout the campaign, would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, force multinationals to repatriate existing foreign earnings and adopt a \"territorial\" system that would largely end taxation of U.S. companies' foreign income.\nTrump is calling for a steeper rate cut to 15 percent, and he has proposed a 10 percent tax rate for repatriated overseas profits held in cash, payable over a decade.\nSome are optimistic that those differences can be overcome. \n\"In the end, there are no differences that can't be solved on the tax issue,\" said Republican Representative Tom Cole. \nThe House Republican plan has had significant support from business. \nKumar's PwC advises the Alliance for Competitive Taxation, which lobbies on tax reform for over 40 companies ranging from Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) and Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) to Alphabet's Google Inc ( GOOGL.O ), Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ).\n\"We know what we want,\" said Dorothy Coleman, a tax policy expert at the National Association of Manufacturers, referring to a lower corporate tax rate, adopting a \"modern, competitive\" territorial system, and a permanent R&D credit among other wishes.\nThe House's corporate tax plan would cut revenues by more than $890 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The same research group says Trump's corporate plan would reduce revenues by $2.6 trillion.\nTrump and Republicans in Congress view tax reform as a way to jump-start economic growth and job creation. \nBusiness lobbyists say that higher tax revenues from a growing economy would address much of the House plan's shortfall. Trump advisers say revenue erosion posed by the president-elect's plan would be overcome by growth and policy initiatives including a more aggressive approach to trade.\n\n(Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Stuart Grudgings)",

In particular, loading apps and downloading games will be faster.\nIn the notes, the company lays out what they’ve done to make the Xbox One run smoother. “We’ve been doing a lot of work to speed up your Xbox. From navigation and opening apps to download times and Cortana’s responsiveness, the whole experience is getting smoother and faster.”\nThe update has landed just a few weeks before the Xbox One S launches in Japan for the first time. It’s certainly got be a positive that Japanese users get the benefit of the update right from the get go.",

This will basically be a way for people to meet others, and then set up games to play together. LFG, otherwise known as Looking for Group and this just allows you to pair down the kind of groups you are looking for.\nAchievement rarity, is a way for people to see just how many people in the Xbox One community have gotten a certain achievement.

      "text": "Home » News » World News » Russia probes Microsoft over alleged competition law violations Russia probes Microsoft over alleged competition law violations 6 hours ago | 11-11-2016 IANS NK World , Moscow, Nov 11 : Russia has launched a case against US IT giant Microsoft over alleged violation of the country's competition law, Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service said on Thursday. Anatoly Golomolzin, deputy head of the anti-monopoly watchdog, said Microsoft was suspected of violating the Russian law on the protection of competition for misusing its dominant position in the Russian software market, Xinhua news agency reported. The investigation was prompted after Russian computer security company Kaspersky Lab accused Microsoft of making the Russian anti-virus manufacturers unable to compete with Microsoft by reducing the adaptation time of Russian anti-virus software producers from two months to six days in its latest Windows 10 operating system. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been urging state entities and local companies to use domestic software out of concerns over security and reliability. According to Russia's Minister of Communications Nikolay Nikiforov, the government has produced a list of nearly 2,000 Russian software products that state-run companies should use instead of foreign brands. vgu/",

      "text": "0 A Microsoft Surface Book i7 laptop rests on a tabletop at an event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 26, 2016. Reuters/Lucas Jackson \nIf reports are to be believed, the Microsoft Surface Book i7 offers incredible graphics performance and battery life. It’s unique and it’s blazing fast. The amazingly extended battery life is something that most laptops lack. The Surface Book i7 offers twice the performance of the original Surface Book. \nAs per PC World , the hybrid, convertible laptop is a beautifully crafted 13.5-inch tablet with PixelSense screen supporting both touch and pen. The keyboard hosts the wonder graphics chip that takes the performance of the Microsoft Surface Book i7 well past any other laptop in its category. \nThe “Dynamic Fulcrum Hinge” is still there despite reports that Microsoft would drop it. In terms of design, it looks very similar to its predecessor. The PixelSense screen has a resolution of 3200x2400 pixels. It uses Intel’s dual-core 6th-gen Skylake Core i7-6600U chipset, SSD from 256GB to 1TB and 8GB and 16GB LPDDR3 options. \nHowever, many tech enthusiasts are not happy with the processor as many laptops are already using the 7th Generation Kaby Lake chipsets. It will be clear when using the laptop that Samsung has focused mainly on the graphics performance. The Microsoft Surface Book i7 uses a stunning Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M chip with 2GB of GDDR5 RAM. \nThe GPU is faster and hotter. Hence, the company has added a second fan and large air vents to keep the laptop cool. Even after more than an hour of torture, the GPU in the Microsoft Surface Book i7 refused to take a bump. \nAs per CNET , the Surface Book i7 is an expensive one, starting at US$2,399 (AU$3,150) for 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. Upgrading it to 1TB of storage and 16GB RAM will make one shell out US$3,299 (AU$4,330). \nThis could very well be the biggest downside of the Microsoft Surface Book i7 laptop as one can get a more affordable Windows laptop or tablet at a much lesser price. The hybrid is even more expensive than the Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. \nStay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on the Microsoft Surface Book i7.",

      "text": "Posted: Nov 10 2016, 10:21pm CST | by IANS , in News | Latest Business News Photo Credit: Getty Images \nRussia has launched a case against US IT giant Microsoft over alleged violation of the country's competition law, Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service said on Thursday. Don't Miss: Black Friday 2016: Everything You Need to Know Now \nAnatoly Golomolzin, deputy head of the anti-monopoly watchdog, said Microsoft was suspected of violating the Russian law on the protection of competition for misusing its dominant position in the Russian software market, Xinhua news agency reported. \nThe investigation was prompted after Russian computer security company Kaspersky Lab accused Microsoft of making the Russian anti-virus manufacturers unable to compete with Microsoft by reducing the adaptation time of Russian anti-virus software producers from two months to six days in its latest Windows 10 operating system. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin has been urging state entities and local companies to use domestic software out of concerns over security and reliability. \nAccording to Russia's Minister of Communications Nikolay Nikiforov, the government has produced a list of nearly 2,000 Russian software products that state-run companies should use instead of foreign brands.

      "text": "Youtube Microsoft Office Lens for iOS gets Immersive Reader and Frame Guide tools \nMicrosoft has updated Office Lens for iOS with new features. The document scanning app now gets Immersive Reader and the Frame Guide features. \nPreviously, you could capture an image using Office Lens and then insert the image into OneNote to take advantage of Immersive Reader. With today’s updates, the Immersive Reader is now built directly into Office Lens. Immersive Reader recognizes text, then highlights it and reads the text out loud at the same time, helping you focus and boost reading skills. \nIn addition, the update adds a new tool within Office Lens called Frame Guide, which empowers the visually impaired with cues that help them capture images in Office Lens. After enabling Voice Over in the app, you will be able to get real-time voice guidance—like “move right,” “move up,” and more—to take the right picture when you can’t see, have low vision, or blindness. \nSource Author: Sneha Bokil Sneha Bokil is a tech enthusiast and is currently using Nexus 5X but she still treasures her Nokia N70 (M).

This new version of the system features its own 4K Blu-ray drive which makes it one of the cheapest options for consumers looking to invest in a 4K Blu-ray Player. In Australia at least , the Xbox One S is also topping the 4K Blu-ray Player charts as well. \nXbox business lead at Microsoft Australia, Jeremy Hinton, said of the console’s success, “We’d like to thank our fans for their continued support and passion for Xbox in Australia. It’s great to see such enthusiasm for the new Xbox One S & Forza Horizon 3, as well as the range of exclusive bundles including Gears of War 4, Battlefield 1, FIFA 17, and Minecraft – all of which are available now.” \nMicrosoft’s head of Xbox games marketing in the United States, Aaron Greenburg tweeted his excitement earlier today. “New @npdgroup data shows @Xbox One best selling US console 4th month in a row,” his tweet said. “Thanks for also making us #1 console in UK & Australia!” New @npdgroup data shows @Xbox One best selling US console 4th month in a row.

      "text": "This is a featured article. Another Metroid 2 Remake Platform(s) Microsoft Windows \nAnother Metroid 2 Remake (also known as AM2R or AM2R: Return of Samus ) is a fan remake of Metroid II: Return of Samus , developed by Argentinian independent programmer Milton \"DoctorM64\" Guasti. The game updates the 1991 version with color, a visual style similar to Super Metroid and gameplay similar to   . After years of development, the game was released for free to Windows-based computers on August 6, 2016, coinciding with the Metroid series ' thirtieth anniversary. However, one day later, Nintendo sent DMCA notices to websites hosting the game, including the official blog and the Metroid Database , forcing their removal. The game is still available through torrents. Contents “ Metroids.Numerous incidents in the past have brought to light the highly destructive power of these life forms, spreading fear across all known planetary systems.Hoping to secure peace in the galaxy,   orders the extermination of the Metroid species. I was the best candidate for the job.Once again I find myself standing alone against the Metroid menace. What horrors await me within the depths of their homeworld? „ — Samus Aran \nThe game's plot is largely unchanged from Metroid II . It now features a Super Metroid -style introduction narrated by Samus Aran (narration above), about the nature of her mission on SR388 . Over the course of the game, Samus's scanners download Logbook entries similar to the Metroid Prime series that reveal additional lore. She can uncover optional areas that include the landing sites of the G.F.S. Thoth and an Anhur-class patrol ship carrying the two ill-fated Galactic Federation teams sent to rescue the previous research team. Metroid II did not feature the final resting places of the three Federation teams. Samus encounters surviving Federation Marines battling a Zeta Metroid that metamorphoses into an Omega Metroid before effortlessly killing them. The mysterious earthquakes linked to the deaths of Metroids are insinuated to be caused by the Queen Metroid herself, as her cries can be heard during the last few in the game. The Logbook reveals that the cave system is located between two tectonic plates on SR388. The game ends with Samus killing off the remaining Metroids, the Queen, and discovering an infant Metroid she later calls the baby . \nAfter the credits, the famous introductory phrase from Super Metroid is heard: \"The last Metroid is in captivity. The galaxy is at peace.\" before \"To be continued...\" appears onscreen. In the best ending , Samus is seen in her Gunship calling the Space Science Academy about the baby, leading into Super Metroid . Edit \nThe endings were conceptualized, drawn and detailed by Azima Khan, an artist who has created several 3D models pertaining to Metroid including the Samus Aran model seen in Rainfall Films' short film Metroid: The Sky Calls . More endings were planned for a future update before development was forced to end. The \"worst\" ending, which depicts a fully-suited Samus and the baby returning to her Gunship. Appears with over 4 hours of play time. The \"middle\" ending, where a helmetless Samus observes the baby in her Gunship. Appears with between 2 and 4 hours of play time. The \"best\" ending, where Samus sits in the cockpit of her Gunship, clad in an Ending Outfit similar to that from Zero Mission and calling Ceres Space Colony about the baby. Appears with under 2 hours of play time. Edit \nAs stated, the gameplay has been updated in the style of Super Metroid and Zero Mission , and now allows for some Sequence Breaking in the way of hidden paths to skip otherwise required items. A Map system, stacking of beams (thereby removing duplicates from Metroid II ), the Power Grip and the previously mentioned logbook have been added, as well as the new abilities to automatically morph into tunnels, autoclimb small ledges, dedicated keys to morph and aim lock, and the ability to breakfall an attack that knocks Samus off her feet in similar manner to Super Smash Bros. ' teching . Moreover, the remake allows abilities to be toggled on and off at will - a feature formerly exclusive to Super Metroid . \nUnlike in the Metroid Prime series, Logbook scans are obtained automatically upon entering new areas, and defeating Metroids and bosses. Items that were not present in Metroid II but later became series staples now appear in AM2R , such as the Gravity Suit , Charge Beam , Speed Booster , Super Missiles and Power Bombs . The \"tractor beam\" effect from the Prime series is present in AM2R , which allows Samus to use her Charge Beam to draw in nearby pickups. \nThe game also features two new areas and several new non-Metroid bosses, including Serris and Genesis , creatures that were present on the Biologic Space Laboratories research station orbiting SR388 in Metroid Fusion . Curiously, Blob Throwers and Septoggs are completely absent from AM2R , and were planned for a future update before the game's cancellation. The number of Metroids has been slightly increased from 48 to 55. The Metroid Detector rises up to 1 after the baby hatches, unlike the original game. \nSeveral changes have been made to the Power Beam . In addition to stacking, the Spazer Beam and Plasma Beams are now stackable, a feat not possible in Super Metroid without glitching. However, as a result of stacking, the beam's rate of fire decreases as the more beams are stacked together, for balancing purposes. Also, the Ice Beam has notably undergone a complete revamp, mirroring Metroid: Other M : instead of freezing enemies in place to be used as a suspended platform like in other 2-D games, almost all frozen enemies would fall to the ground and shatter or if frozen on the ground they would simply shatter after a few seconds. This change was made as there was no situation where the platforming feature could be used, and was quickly rendered irrelevant with the Spider Ball and Space Jump being acquired shortly after. As the most powerful weapon in the game, the Ice Beam was moved from the first area in Metroid II to just before the penultimate area as the final suit upgrade. Log Book entries Exterminate all Metroid organisms on Planet SR388. -Secondary Objectives: Locate and bring assistance to   research and rescue teams. Planet SR388 \"Planetary Designation SR388: A remote planet, absent on most galactic charts. Federation research indicates it is the natural home world of the Metroid species. Its outer crust is hollowed out with massive cave systems which are home to an ecosystem that is yet to be fully studied. The first expedition to SR388 revealed the existence of Chozo ruins.\" Earthquakes \"The massive cave system is located between two tectonic plates, largely flooded by an extremely dense and caustic substance similar to magma. The recent earthquake has altered the cave layout and the hazardous substance has drained to lower levels. The cause of the earthquake is unknown. Initial orbital scan of SR388 detected no instability within this region.\" Research Team \"The scientists constructed a small mobile research site within the cave system. The access tunnel leading to their research vessel has collapsed, and all of their equipment is non-operational. Vital signs of all exo-suits are flatlined. There are no survivors in this site.\" Rescue Team \"The Search & Rescue team was an elite combat group consisting of heavily armed soldiers. Their mission: Locate and extract any surviving personnel from the missing Research team. There are no survivors among the Search & Rescue team.\" GFS Thoth \"The GFS Thoth is a Griffin-class ship. Once an escort of Olympus-class battleships, it was converted into a research vessel. Its crew has continuously helped the Federation explore planets, ancient civilizations and study species throughout the galaxy. The Thoth carries portable drilling machinery for excavations. The ship landed on a small valley. The present dig site connects directly to the underground research lab. An Anhur-class gunship is also nearby, registered to the rescue team. The motion sensor monitor system displays as follows: LEVEL 1 STORAGE - NO SIGNAL LEVEL 1 LOBBY - NO SIGNAL LEVEL 2 COMMS ROOM - NO SIGNAL LEVEL 2 WEST WING - NO SIGNAL LEVEL 3 EAST WING - MOVEMENT DETECTED\" \nThe motion sensor notes are added when Samus explores the ship's interior. Metroids Metroid Species \"The dominant species of SR388. Metroids hunt for any form of energy found in natural or synthetic organisms, leaving behind deceased husks after feeding. They are highly resistant to conventional weapons and possess great adapatability in foreign environments: Estimates suggest a small number of Metroids set loose on a populated planet would lead to the extinction of any present lifeforms. As such, they've drawn much attention from Space Pirates, who have repeatedly tried to use them as biological weapons.\" Life Cycle \"Scans on the native Metroids reveal their most common form in prior incidents is merely the species' larval stage. While there are records of extreme mutations triggered by Space Pirates using abnormal stimuli, the Metroid homeworld of SR388 is seemingly the only environment where the species can naturally transform.\" Alpha Metroid \"The Alpha Metroid has gained immunity to cold temperatures. The loss of several nuclei within its green membrane has left it vulnerable to concussive weaponry. A plated exoskeleton partially covers it. This organism emerges from the molting of its larval form. Though aggressive, it is relatively weak at this stage, and its new appendages have yet to grow to their full length and strength.\" Gamma Metroid \"Metroids at this stage can now transfer negative charges from its nervous system into the horns, releasing electric arcs capable of disrupting weapon fire. The membrane containing its nucleus remains vulnerable, but the Gamma Metroid's exoskeleton has expanded for additional protection. Although its legs have reached their maximum length, they are unsuitable for locomotion. Instead, they can serve to capture prey and drain their energy.\" Zeta Metroid \"After a substantial transformation of its body, the Metroid's power and defenses greatly improve. Though the Zeta Metroid can no longer fly due to its immense weight, its new legs are strong enough to carry it and perform great bursts of speed. The arms can deliver powerful strikes, and its mouth glands can spray a highly corrosive substance. Its two prior forms were akin to a pupal phase. Discarding the Gamma Metroid's exoskeleton marked the beginning of its adulthood.\" Omega Metroid \"The apex predator of SR388. The Omega Metroid exhibits devastating strength; an impact from its claws can severely cripple or kill large animals, while the most heavily armored prey are flung through the air. Despite its towering figure, it can leap and use its weight as a weapon. Glands in the mouth ignite its saliva, turning it into an organic flamethrower. Its membrane has greatly thickened; maximum firepower is strongly recommended. This is the final stage in a Metroid's lifecycle, and very few manage to reach it. Its size is a result of the prior form's muscles rapidly expanding to massive proportions.\" Queen Metroid \"The only Metroid organism naturally capable of producing offspring, the Queen is the heart of the species and mother of every Metroid born on SR388. Her role in the hive has hindered her mobility yet encouraged the development of a long neck and massive head to strike at a distance. Her cell structure indicates she is heavily aged, possibly as old as the lab she is settled in. The years have reinforced her torso to impenetrable levels. The Queen's genetic coding is distinct from the other Metroids, and she may have gone through a unique life cycle to attain her form.\" The Chozo The Lost Race \"The Chozo were an ancient and mysterious avian race. Incredibly advanced, they colonized many worlds, spreading their message of peace throughout the universe. There are historical records and legends of the Chozo visiting other races with whom they shared their knowledge and wisdom. These brief encounters led many primitive cultures to their present-day glory. Some say they helped consolidate the very foundations of  . The fate of this race is unknown. Evidence suggests they slowly vanished from the cosmos over the course of centuries. All that remains on each planet they inhabited are the ruins of their once glorious civilization.\" The Golden Temple \"This temple stands at the base of a hollow mountain. The statues, carved stones and its solid design attest that the structure was built to be a sanctuary, possibly with religious significance. The temple has withstood the test of time, showing the building knowledge and expertise of the Chozo. Scans detect the presence of stationary robotic entities, placed at strategic points inside the structure. No control signals are detected, these units are operating autonomously.\" Breeding Grounds \"This area span a custom built ecosystem that favors the growth of Metroids. The terrain itself is dangerous: tendrils growing along the ground release extremely corrosive chemicals. Opportunistic predators and scavengers can recognize this as an ideal feeding ground, taking advantage of injured or dead animals. The presence of at least one Metroid is expected when venturing in these habitats. The tendrils are determined to be of artificial origin. Synthesized through technologically advanced methods, they absorb nutrients from dead matter.\" Hydro Station \"The massive facility at the center of this reservoir filters and pumps water through enormous pipelines. These pipes come out of the complex and disappear into the surrounding rocks, presumably to supply other buildings further down the cave system with clean water. Though abandoned, most of it remains functional. Robotic activity is detected inside.\" Industrial Complex \"This factory assembles worker drones which are tasked with supplying SR388's facilities with replacement parts that keep them running autonomously. Though time has left its mark, the machines have kept it intact. Some combat drones are also constructed here. Robotic workers are malfunctioning and show signs of aggression.\" Mining Facility \"Cordite crystals are one of the most durable, naturally forming crystals in the galaxy. Though they are not as hard as diamonds, this makes them a more malleable resource. The Chozo found various practical uses for Cordite in constructing machinery or producing works of art. This mining facility supplies Cordite and various other minerals to the nearby industrial complex. The Tower \"The immense Tower houses a weapons R&D facility. The robots patrolling within are combat drones equipped with weapon prototypes and advanced shield plating. They possess superior A.I. and are programmed to fire at any living target, keeping the Tower sterilized of organic matter very efficiently. Proceed with caution.\" Power Plant \"This geothermal plant generates the power to run all the other facilities in the cave complex. Water from the Hydro Station is injected into the system using insulated pipes. Sophisticated turbines use the heat of the local environment, bein extremely efficient with minimal loss of water. The massive amount of energy produced is stored in isolated arrays of power cells. One of these has lost some structural integrity, and any significant change in temperature could overload it.\" Distribution Center \"This facility is a power distribution center. The wiring linked to this facility provides power to various structures within the region. All excess enrgy is stored in portable spherical cells which are distributed throughout the intricate passages of the cave system via vacuum pipes and carrier drones. These cells are filled to maximum capacity: any exposure to beam weapons will destabilize the energy charge.\" The Nest \"This area is infested with thick, globe-like masses composed mostly of crystallized carbohydrates. Those that have yet to harden are constantly moved by the air flow created from the slightest motion of nearby creatures. Only the most adaptable lifeforms can thrive in this ecosystem.\" Genetics Laboratory \"Suspended above an abandoned city are the remains of a laboratory. Scanners confirm there was extremely sophisticated equipment to be found, along with scientific data of incalculable magnitude. Only stasis tanks are left. Organic traces within suggest genetic research and DNA manipulation. Biogenic substances of an unknown age coat the laboratory's walls.\" Hostiles Native Species \"Not much is known about SR388's ecosystem. Prior reports described the fauna as being very hostile; nearly all observed animals have been carnivores, with even the smallest species showing dangerous traits. The harsh environment and the presence of so many predators may have forced an evolutionary arms race, perpetuating a cycle of violence. Extreme caution is advised.\" Ancient Guardian \"This sentry deploys spiked barriers and corners targets into its firin range. Its archaic design constraints it to operate at low power, prevening simultaneous use of its shield and mobility systems. Its arsenal consists of energy weapons with unique patterns. The robot was calibrated to detect foreign creatures bearing stolen equipment. Recent earthquakes seem to have damaged the traction of the unit and spiked barriers. Despite these complications, it remains a considerable threat.\" Arachnus \"A territorial organism. Its armored hide is very resilien and requires at least a high voltage discharge to harm it. Attacking with anything less will only agitate the creature. When enaged, it will roll into a ball and attempt to ram its aggressor. Bombs might be able to propel it in this state. Its saliva has flammable properties and its claws can vibrate at high frequencies to launch sonic waves. Scans detect it has acquired a Chozo relic, granting it unnatural vigor.\" Torizo \"Analysis of this sentinel shows evidence of unknown organic tissue, most of it concentrated in the torso region. The Torizo's armor plating is light enough to give it great mobility, but also leaves it vulnerable to standard weapons. According to Chozo history records, the construction of such advanced types of sentries was performed exclusively by the most gifted. Created with biological matter and mechanical components, this makes it difficult to reliably calculate its combat abilities.\" The Tester \"The unit performs 360° live-fire tests of prototype weapons. Scans indicate the exterior armor is resistant to beam weaponry while the interior is further protected by an energy field that repels solid projectiles. Auto-repair systems in the cannons can mend all damage within seconds; schematics reveal these systems were applied due to earlier models' cannons being exposed to exceedingly violent tests. Similar to your Power Suit, the unit's modular design allows for the addition and removal of equipment.\" Tank Prototype \"Sensors on its head provide it with accurate aim; however, the alloy protecting it has weakened with time, along with the arm and track sections; Attackin these parts may grant you tactical advantages. Hardware scans reveal this tank was to be mass produced. Originally remote controlled, a basic A.I. is now active due to a lack of commands.\" Serris \"An amphibian predator capable of reaching ultra-high speeds, making it the fastest animal on SR388. The layer of skin on its underside serves as a repository organ and is sensitive to sudden drops in temperature. Its many eyes and segmented body allow great efficiency in vision and body movement. When a Serris moves to a new location, it digs passages to channel the water from its previous home to prevent dehydration. This behavior likely flooded the Distribution Center.\" Genesis \"An ambush predator. This blind animal has adapted to hunt in the dark, relying on specialized senses to stalk prey. Its body offers little protection and will attempt to conceal itself in the shadows as a result. Its acidic blood is used as a projectile via autohemorraging. The Genesis naturally hunts in groups, making it a highly successful species with little need to evolve; Its DNA suggests it belongs to the oldest living lineage on SR388, granting its name.\" Items \nNote: Bold denotes new items that have been added to the game. Suit Acquisition: \"Reduces Damage taken by 50%\" Samus Screen : \"Protects extra protection against enemies and dangerous environments.\" Acquisition: \"Liquid friction eliminated - Improved Defense\" Samus Screen : \"Protects from all environmental hazards, no friction while in fluids.\" Beam Acquisition: \"Hold [shoot button] to charge your beam\" Samus Screen : \"Hold [shoot button] to concentrate Beam Energy, release to Fire.\" Acquisition: \"Instantly freeze enemies.

The first encounters with each type of Metroid now feature a short cutscene showing them evolving from their previous form. \nNote: Bold denotes new bosses that have been added to the game. Alpha Metroid - As with the original game, it only takes 5 Missiles to kill an Alpha Metroid. In addition to trying to ram Samus, Alphas can also charge at her at high speeds. Some Alpha Metroids have small talons, or legs, suggesting they are starting to evolve into Gamma Metroids. One chamber in the Distribution Center contains five Alpha Metroids at once. Two more are encountered in the Research Lab sub area, and may have been responsible for the deaths of the Federation research team. Their log entry states that the larva Metroid's transformation into the Alpha stage resulted in the loss of all but one nuclei, leaving its membrane vulnerable to Missiles for all future stages in the Metroid life cycle. Ancient Guardian - The Ancient Guardian is fought on the way out of the Golden Temple, in a short corridor. It blocks off the corridor on both sides with spike -lined walls and attacks Samus from above. It unleashes several attacks: a quick blue laser burst, a set of six purple fire balls that spread out in the air and then disappear, six green fireballs that impact the ground (only leaving a safe spot under the Guardian) and drops a yellow fireball underneath it that spreads across the ground on both ends. When attacking, the Ancient Guardian is invulnerable to damage, but is otherwise easily destroyed with Missiles . The Guardian cannot use both features at once due to its archaic design, which constricts it to operating at low power. The Ancient Guardian was programmed to detect foreign beings carrying stolen Chozo upgrades, and it remains a considerable threat despite damage to it and its spiked barriers caused by the planetary earthquakes. As the Ancient Guardian takes more damage, the spike-lined walls close in, giving Samus less room to fight. The log entry insinuates that it targets Samus due to the Morph Ball and other potential items she has \"stolen\" from the Golden Temple. The Ancient Guardian shares its battle music with The Tester. According to DoctorM64, the Ancient Guardian was an \"improvised\" boss from Chozo Statue sprites in Zero Mission . [1] Gamma Metroid - It takes 10 normal Missiles to kill a Gamma Metroid. In AM2R , they can charge at high speeds which, if it connects, allows them to grab Samus and channel their electrical power into her, before dropping her to the ground. Samus will fall back and be unable to move for a few seconds when they do this, although this can be nullified with the breakfall technique. According to the Log Book entry, Gamma Metroids transfer negative electrical charges from its nervous system to its horns, which allows for the electricity to be discharged in an arc of lightning. The exoskeleton has expanded to provide additional protection to compensate for its nuclei membrane, which remains vulnerable. Their legs have grown beyond the ability to perform locomotion, and the Gamma Metroid instead uses them to capture prey and drain them of their energy. Arachnus - The Arachnus battle combines elements from the fights against the creature in Metroid II and Metroid Fusion , and has been expanded beyond simply firing at the creature. While on the ground, it will launch fiery attacks at Samus or its slashing attacks from Fusion ; unlike Fusion , it fires red fireballs with wide gaps in between their flaming spots or green fireballs that bounce around the room, and its slashing attacks can be fired diagonally upward. It can also curl into its ball form in the air and launch itself at Samus, in a similar manner to Sonic the Hedgehog's Homing Attack. After some time, it will roar and begin to ram into Samus in its ball form. Samus must lay Bombs in a fashion that the Arachnus will be launched towards a set of twelve mounted electrified spikes on the walls. After it hits one set, that set disappears and the Arachnus takes damage. If Samus takes too long to launch Arachnus, it will briefly uncurl to launch fireballs that move horizontally at standing face height and bounce along the walls, which can be avoided by staying in Morph Ball. After it is damaged by the last set of spikes, Arachnus will die and leave the Spring Ball as a reward. Its power and agility are stated to be a result of the item it carried. Torizo - A more advanced version of the live Chozo Statue from Super Metroid is fought as a boss in the Industrial Complex. It spawns from the Chozo Statue after Samus acquires the Space Jump from it. A logbook entry states that this Torizo is partially organic, with a concentration of organic matter on its chest constituting a weak point. This is further implied to be the case for other Torizos, such as the one fought in Super Metroid . The Torizo is initially fought much like in Super Metroid , with its upper body being the main target and its attacks consisting of energy waves and fireball projectile volleys, however its energy waves curve in a similar manner to the Wave Beam instead of moving straight. The Torizo walks much faster the more damage it takes, up to the point where it moves as fast as Samus does when she runs. However, after taking enough damage, the Torizo will appear seemingly destroyed, before it opens up wings and takes flight, and the ceiling rises. There are platforms in the air, and spikes will begin to appear on the ground. Samus must use the Space Jump to destroy the Torizo in its second form. While only its upper body was vulnerable to attacks in the first phase, its entire body can be attacked in the second phase. In this second phase, it will no longer fire energy waves, but instead spit a continuous stream of fireballs, fire egg-like objects from it stomach that hatch into small creatures that briefly chase Samus before disappearing, and attempting to ram into Samus at high speeds four times in succession. Its projectiles can be destroyed for Energy Capsules and Missile Ammo . The Torizo's sprites were designed in 2012. According to DoctorM64, the Torizo originally had wings, but they were difficult to animate, so he ended up giving it a jetpack. He also experimented with a skeletal look for the mechanism. [2] Zeta Metroid - Zeta Metroids will die after being hit with 20 normal Missiles, although Super Missiles will help to speed up battles with them. In AM2R their behavior is similar to their own in Metroid II and the Omega Metroid from Metroid Fusion , being a land-based bipedal creature instead of hovering in midair. The Zeta Metroid will stomp around its chamber and spit a stream of corrosive acidic saliva at Samus, in addition to slashing at her with its claws and charging at her at high speeds. According to the Zeta's log entry, the Alpha and Gamma Metroid stages are the pupal phase of the species' life cycle, and its evolution into a Zeta Metroid marks the beginning of its adulthood. Its immense weight causes it to lose the ability to levitate. The Tester - A spherical mechanism present in a very tall shaft in The Tower. The Log Book states that it performs 360° live-fire tests of prototype weapons. It is a sphere guarded by four side plates, which are resistant to beam weaponry and are used in a drilling-like attack. It also spins in its position while firing streams of missiles as well as the Ice, Wave, Spazer, and Plasma beams. To defeat the Tester, the side plates must be destroyed with missiles, along with its interior shield with beam weaponry, and finally the core of the machine itself, however, the interior shield has an autorepair system and will regenerate over time on Hard difficulty. The Log Book reveals that this was applied after earlier models' cannons were unable to stand up to exceedingly violent tests. Much like Samus's Power Suit, the Tester's design allows for the assimilation and removal of equipment. Partly helping Samus stay close to the machine in the air are numerous Proboscum mechanisms on the walls. The Tester shares its battle music with the Ancient Guardian. DoctorM64 later said that the Tester was an \"excuse for Samus to use all her weapons\", meaning all of the Beams she had acquired by that point. [3] Tank Prototype - The Tank Prototype is battled during the escape from the Power Plant. The prototype attacks with missiles and beam projectiles; the former can be destroyed for pickups. Sensors on its head allow it to aim accurately at Samus, although its armor has weakened over time. It will also slowly move toward Samus, destroying the generators on the ground along the way. Its head, arms and base can be destroyed, which will stop it from accurately targeting, firing beam projectiles, and moving respectively. The prototype's chest is its weak spot, and is guarded by a destructible chest plate. The Log Book states that this mechanism was originally remote controlled, and planned to be mass produced by the Chozo. However, the A.I. is inactive due to a lack of commands, and it has gone rogue. Genesis - The Genesis enemy encountered in Metroid Fusion is fought as a miniboss inside the G.F.S. Thoth . It escaped from the specimen tanks within the ship. Genesis is blind and relies on its hunting senses. Unlike the ones from Fusion , it is agile and stronger, and attacks Samus in the open. Its entire body is weak to damage, forcing it to conceal itself in the shadows in an attempt to avoid harm. It spits corrosive acidic blood via autohaemorrhaging as its main attack, will slash Samus if she gets too close and it climbs on the ceiling and floor. The Logbook entry for this creature states that it naturally hunts in groups and has little need to evolve. Its name was granted from its DNA, which when analyzed, indicated that it belongs to the oldest living lineage on SR388. According to DoctorM64, programming of Genesis was finished only a week before the game's release. [4] Serris - A boss from Metroid Fusion that is fought in an underwater room in the Distribution Center. Serris is the fastest animal on SR388. The skin on its underside, a respiratory organ, can be frozen over with the Ice Beam and attacked with Missiles or Super Missiles to nullify its hardened skin and render it vulnerable to attack. It will swim through the water and destroy platforms made of Missile Blocks as navigates. As Serris takes more damage, it begins to swim faster, however it does not use the Speed Booster like in Fusion . After its death, it segments will detach and it will float in the water for a few seconds before exploding. The Log Book reveals that a Serris will move to another location by digging passages to channel water from its previous home to its new one; this is speculated to be the cause of the Distribution Center's flooding. DoctorM64 later said that he felt Serris was too easy, and would increase the difficulty of its fight if he was allowed to update the game. [5] Omega Metroid - As the Apex predator of SR388, the Omega Metroid is the most powerful of all Metroids, before the Queen. In version 1.0 they 40 Missiles to kill, while version 1.1 reduced the amount to 35 Missiles. In AM2R , like the Zeta Metroid, the Omega Metroid's behavior is combined from Metroid II and Metroid Fusion . It breathes a long stream of fire (an \"organic flamethrower\") from its mouth, which is actually saliva that is ignited by the creature's mouth glands. slashes with its claws and jumps around, with the force of its landing knocking Samus off her feet if she is on the ground when it lands. When it lands from a jump, a small, second weak spot will briefly open up on its lower back, which can be targeted for triple damage. The Log entry states that the Omega Metroid's large size is caused when the Zeta Metroid's muscles rapidly expand to massive proportions during its evolution into the next form. Queen Metroid - The Queen Metroid's cell structure is suggested in the Log Book to be very old, perhaps almost as old as the Genetics Laboratory in which she is found. Her genetic coding is distinct from other Metroids and it is suggested that the creature went through a unique life cycle to attain its form. It is the only Metroid in the natural life cycle capable of producing offspring, and the mother of every Metroid on SR388. The Queen's mobility has been hindered by her time spent in the hive, but this has caused her to develop a long neck and massive head that can strike enemies at a distance, and an impenetrable torso. The Queen is fought in very much the same manner as before, but the battle is expanded. She will launch a number of projectiles from her mouth, which can be destroyed and yield Energy Capsules and ammo. Her head will then seek Samus's position before lunging at her. Her weak spot, her head, is vulnerable to Missiles and normal Bombs , but only while she is attempting to lunge at Samus. When Super Missiles are used, the Queen's red \"eyes\" will flash; when Power Bombs are used, her \"eyes\" will close until after the explosion, but it does no damage. When she has taken enough damage, the Queen will charge a fire ball in her mouth and then launch it at the wall behind Samus, destroying it and extending her chamber. This will repeat at least four times. The Queen will be fought in two corridors and one room where she has more ability to move her head. In the corridors, she will sink or raise her head before launching. In the final room, the Queen will put Samus in her mouth before throwing her away, and can be finished off in several ways. [6] The first way is by shooting 15 Missiles or 3 Super Missiles at her head before she can eat Samus, which will cause her to release Samus from her mouth and shake violently before exploding, leaving no trace of herself behind. The most practical and popular way to kill the Queen requires Samus to allow herself to be eaten, entering her stomach with Morph Ball and laying a Power Bomb to instantly finish off the Queen as in Metroid: Other M ; her head and backside will be left behind, with green blood, or amniotic flood dripping from the ceiling. The Power Bomb can also be laid inside her mouth, which will cause her body to go limp, before exploding and leaving no trace of her behind. Finally, normal Bombs can be laid inside the Queen's mouth or stomach until she dies, although again, none of her body will be left behind if she is killed this way. Samus can also unmorph and exit through the Queen's backside if she uses normal Bombs. It should be noted that the escape route tunnel that was present in the Queen's chamber in Metroid II has been removed in AM2R , and Samus's energy is no longer fully restored after the Queen is killed. The three stages of the Alpha Metroid's life cycle. Ancient Guardian Edit Surface - the surface area of SR388, where Samus lands her Gunship, and later returns with the baby. In the original game, this area was called Phase 1 . As with the original game, Space Jumping too close to the atmosphere results in Samus taking damage. The first Metroid, an Alpha Metroid, is encountered here. The Golden Temple - the AM2R version of Phase 2 , which has been updated with an architectural and visual style similar to Chozodia in Zero Mission . 4 Alpha Metroids are fought here. The Bombs , Charge Beam and Spider Ball can be acquired in the Golden Temple. This area can be revisited via the transportation shafts in the Distribution Center. The Log entry states that it stands at the base of a hollow mountain. It was built as a sanctuary, possibly a religious one, and has not fallen into disrepair like many other Chozo ruins. All of the robotic entities found here operate autonomously, with no control signals to be found. They are placed at strategic points within the temple. Breeding Grounds - Similar subareas of the Golden Temple, Hydro Station and Industrial Complex, engineered for the cultivation and breeding of Metroids. These areas are rife with harmful vegetation , which are explained in the Log Book as synthetic tendrils that absorb nutrients from dead matter. Predating and scavenging animals often take advantage of the terrain here, feeding on carrion. Hydro Station - the AM2R version of Phase 3 . As the name implies, it has been transformed into a water filtering and pumping facility. The Chozo used this area to filter clean water through complex pipelines into further cave systems, possibly including the Distribution Center. Despite it being abandoned, most of the technology is still functional. 6 Alpha Metroids and the first Gamma Metroid are fought here, as well as the Arachnus . Items that can be collected here are the Wave Beam , Spring Ball (guarded by Arachnus), Varia Suit , High Jump Boots , 8 Missile Tanks and 2 Energy Tanks . There are launchers here that connect to The Tower and to the Distribution Center. Industrial Complex - the AM2R version of Phase 4 . It is a factory that assembles Chozo drones, which run autonomously to supply SR388's facilities with replacement parts. The facility has remained remarkably intact and operational considering its age, although robotic workers have begun to malfunction and show signs of aggression. 8 Gamma Metroids and 2 Alpha Metroids are fought here. The Space Jump is acquired here, but Samus must destroy a Torizo before she can leave the room with it. One segment in this area has Samus take control of an Autoad , to pick up stray Super Missiles and drop them onto Super Missile Blocks in order to create a passageway. The Super Missiles, Spazer Beam and Speed Booster are also acquired here. Research Site - the AM2R equivalent of Phase 5 . This is where the Federation research team made their base and were killed by Metroids. Two Alpha Metroids ambush Samus here, which may have been responsible for their deaths. After the Power Bombs are acquired, a shaft above the Research Site leads to the G.F.S. Thoth site. The Log entry reveals that the access tunnel leading to their research vessel has collapsed, and their equipment is no longer functional. Mining Facility - the AM2R equivalent of Phase 6 . 1 Gamma Metroid and 1 Alpha Metroid are fought here. It is a long and winding set of old mining tunnels. Two mining drills can be found here. One of them is non-functional, while the other is used by Samus to get further into the base. Cordite , a substance from Metroid Prime is found here, but in a raw, green crystallized form, and is presumably what the Chozo was mining on SR388. It can still be destroyed with Super Missiles. The Log Book states that Cordite is among the most durable and naturally forming crystals in the galaxy, and a more malleable resource than diamonds. The Chozo found uses for Cordite in constructing both machinery and art. The Mining Facility supplies Cordite and other materials to the Industrial Complex. The Tower - the AM2R version of Phase 7 , which has been greatly expanded. 3 Zeta Metroids and 3 Gamma Metroids are fought in here. The Tower is a weapons R&D factory, and is guarded by aggressive combat drones using advanced shield plating. These robots are programmed to fire at any living target and seek to quickly eradicate any organic matter that may enter the Tower, namely Samus. Upon first arrival, the facility will have no power and some of its rooms will be inaccessible. Samus will find a Morph Ball slot further into the Tower that will turn the power back on. A miniboss, The Tester, is also battled in a very tall shaft, guarding the way to the Plasma Beam . After the Metroids have been killed and the lava subsides, the Power Plant becomes accessible. At the very top of the Tower is a massive statue of two warrior Chozo holding a planet, possibly SR388, in their hands. Power Plant - A new subarea not present in Metroid II , where geothermal power is generated to power all facilities within the complex cave system of SR388. Water from the Hydro Station is transported into the system via insulated pipes, while sophisticated turbines use the environment's heat to ensure efficient power with minimal usage of water. At its heart is a chamber with power cells, one of which is structurally unsound. After Samus uses a Power Bomb , acquired in the same chamber to escape, this cell explodes, the Plant begins to melt down and she is forced to escape. This countdown is scripted, meaning that the \"power cell temperature\" bar that appears during the countdown will only fill as Samus enters new rooms. The Tank Prototype is battled during the escape. As she reaches the entrance of the Power Plant, Samus is stuck behind slowly-unlocking gates, and the Plant explodes, knocking her down and reducing her energy to 5 units. Part of the ruined Power Plant can still be explored after its destruction, and will yield 1 Missile Tank and 1 Energy Tank. No Metroids are present here. Distribution Center - an entirely new area added to the game. The Center's main purpose is to serve as a backtracking hub which connects to prior areas using fast-traveling pipes. In addition, a Morph Ball slot distributes drones across the entire planet carrying energy cells used to power nodes to unlock doors to progress through the Distribution Center or hidden power-ups in previous areas. These energy cells contain excess energy, and when shot with beam weaponry, will explode, creating an electrical field that renders Samus unable to shoot unless she has the Gravity Suit ; Bombs and Missiles will not cause them to explode, and can be used to move them around. The Screw Attack and Ice Beam are now exclusively located inside this Center, and the Gravity Suit is found in a subarea above it, with numerous rooms containing an electrical field similar to that created by the destabilized energy cells. 8 Metroids are battled here: 1 Zeta Metroid, 5 Alpha Metroids at once, and 2 Gamma Metroids at once. Serris is also fought here as a non-Metroid boss, intercepting Samus after she acquires the Ice Beam. The Distribution Center's flooding is suggested to have been caused by Serris. G.F.S. Thoth - a new area not present in Metroid II . The G.F.S. Thoth and Anhur-class patrol ship carrying the two ill-fated Galactic Federation teams mentioned in the Metroid II manual are found here, and Genesis is fought as a miniboss. No evidence of either team could be found in Metroid II . The room where Samus is infected by an X Parasite prior to Metroid Fusion can be visited here. A Hornoad is present inside, the same creature that the X which infects Samus spawns from. No Metroids are present here. The Log Book entry reveals that the Thoth originally escorted Olympus-class battleships , before it was converted into a research vessel. The crew has explored many planets and studied ancient civilizations and species across the cosmos . To this end, it carries portable drilling machinery for its excavations. This area connects directly to the Research Site. There are three levels in the ship. Upon entering the ship, the entry is expanded with information from the display of the ship's motion sensor monitor system. The first level contains the storage area and ship lobby, the second level contains the communications room and west wing, and the third level contains only the east wing and a Save Station . All rooms except the east wing have no signals, while movement is detected in the east wing. This is revealed to be Genesis. S&R Hideout - a new subarea in the first half of AM2R 's equivalent of Phase 8 , where the search and rescue team made their base. Samus will hear gunfire on her first visit, and discover the team still alive, battling an evolving Omega Metroid, before they are killed by it. An Alpha Metroid is fought prior to this encounter. Besides the Metroids, the only thing found here is a Super Missile Tank . The Nest - the penultimate area of the game as the second half of Phase 8, where the (supposedly) final Metroids are fought before the Queen. Three Omega Metroids are battled here, each in rather small corridors. According to the Log Book, the Nest is composed of \"thick, globe-like masses composed mostly of crystallized carbohydrates\", and only the most adaptable bioforms can thrive in its ecosystem. Genetics Laboratory - the final area of the game and the location of the Queen Metroid and the egg from which the baby hatches, serving as the AM2R equivalent of Phase 9 . 8 normal Metroids are fought here as in Metroid II . It now features stasis tubes and organic matter coating the background. The Ice Beam is no longer found here due to the inclusion of Beam stacking, although the broken Chozo Statue where it was found in Metroid II is still present in AM2R . The logs and several visual decorations in the Genetics Laboratory serve to hint at the Chozo being responsible for the creation of the Metroid species. During the Queen battle, she will destroy the walls behind Samus and chase her, extending her chamber in the original game into a corridor. In addition, the small shaft where Samus can escape from during the Queen battle has been removed in AM2R . With the final update to the game, a transportation pipe is added that connects the Laboratory to the Hydro Station. References to prior Metroid titles Edit \nThe game has many Easter eggs and references to prior games   including the Metroid Prime series. Metroid /   - The intro sequence in AM2R shows an image of what is likely Tourian with several Metroid larvae. This same intro's text, as well as logs, describe the Space Pirates ' interest and attempts in using Metroids as bioweapons, in direct reference to both the original game and its remake. Samus wears attire similar to, but different in appearance from, her orange Ending Outfit from Zero Mission in the Game Over and the best ending. The G.F.S. Thoth has a unique Save Station that closely resembles those used in   . Metroid Prime - A log mentions the Space Pirates' use of abnormal stimuli ( Phazon ) on Metroids. The Chozo history records in the Torizo log refers to the Chozo Lore entry \" Statuary \". Cordite minerals can be found in the game, though in their raw, green crystalline form. The intro sequence's text states the existence of several Metroid-related incidents prior to AM2R , covering the entirety of the Prime trilogy. If left idle, Samus fiddles with her arm cannon similarly to Prime's idle animation. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes - The Anhur-class patrol ship belonging to the search and rescue team is the same class as the G.F.S. Tyr that landed on Aether , and also had its entire crew massacred. When Samus steps out of the chamber that grants her the Gravity Suit, her suit's lights are a bright blue while the rest of her body is briefly shrouded in darkness; this is a visual reference to Dark Samus . Several tracks from Echoes are also remixed for the game, including the Chykka battle theme and Great Temple theme. Metroid Prime 3: Corruption - The G.F.S. Thoth is a Griffin-class frigate that once escorted Olympus-class battleships , ship classes that are present in Corruption . Within the Thoth , there is a room with a Mounted Blast Shield door in the background with the 5 combination locks on it. Metroid Prime: Federation Force : The four soldiers fighting the first Omega Metroid have colored armorsuits, which are a subtle nod to the titular characters of Federation Force . Super Metroid : The best ending in AM2R shows Samus contacting the Ceres Space Colony . After the credits the introductory phrase \"The Last Metroid is in captivity. The Galaxy is at peace.\" appears followed by \"to be continued.\" The Moon Walk technique, which was present in Super Metroid , is also present in AM2R . The baby's screeching sound effects are reused from Super Metroid . Metroid: Other M : The banner of the Federation and some Federation personnel's armor suits are based on the designs from Other M . Also present is Anthony Higgs 's Plasma Gun , carried by a large, bulky soldier fighting the first Omega Metroid. The Ice Beam 's functionality mirrors that of its Metroid: Other M incarnation, where enemies frozen in midair fall to the ground and shatter. Metroid Fusion : The research crew's suits are based on Biologic's research team , that Samus later escorts in Fusion 's intro sequence. In that same sequence, the chamber where Samus is infected by an X Parasite can be visited in AM2R near the G.F.S. Thoth site; a Hornoad is present there, which is the creature from which the X that infects Samus spawns. In the nearby G.F.S. Thoth , there is a room with three tanks, containing the brain of the B.O.X. Security Robot , an Evir , and a section of Nightmare 's arm. A shattered fourth tank previously held a Genesis specimen, which is fought as a miniboss . The Arachnus battle, which did not have its own music in Metroid II , now has a remix of the Arachnus-X's theme from Fusion (later remixed into Berserker Lord in Corruption ). The Save Station aboard the G.F.S Thoth slightly resembles the Navigation Rooms from Metroid Fusion as well as the save stations from Zero Mission . The Ice Beam in AM2R is also the final suit upgrade in the game, though this may be for balancing reasons due to the game's beam stacking system rather than a reference to Fusion. Development Edit Artwork created for the game, a recreation of the original game's boxart . \nBlog posts pertaining to development of the game began in 2008, the very first of which stating the game's engine had been in the works for a few years before that. The game was created using Game Maker 7 at one point, before being moved to Game Maker: Studio Master Collection. It was developed almost entirely by Milton Guasti, a devoted fan from Argentina. \nGuasti, a 26 year old man who co-owned a recording studio, became a fan of the Metroid series in the 1990s through playing Super Metroid on emulators. He became interested in gamemaking and downloaded GameMaker when he was 26. Archaic gambling laws imposed by Brazil classified video games as gambling and imposed taxes, making the retail version of GameMaker too expensive for Guasti's budget. However, he was able to procure a license and began to familiarize himself with GameMaker. The seeds for AM2R were planted. Guasti felt that a remake of Metroid II would be suitable as a first game, and played the classic Metroid titles to become familiar with their gameplay and Metroidvania formula. With a remake of Metroid II , Guasti felt it especially important that he capture the uneasy feeling one would get when playing the original game, while modernizing the game in line with Metroid Fusion and Zero Mission . The lack of customers at his recording studio meant that Guasti had plenty of free time to develop AM2R . \nGameMaker alone did not have the resources to develop a game as complex as AM2R , so Guasti downloaded GameMaker Platform Engine, a plug-in containing physics that were more suited for the development of classic-style 2-D adventure games. The resolution of 160x144 in Metroid II was increased to 320x240 for AM2R , which necessitated the expansion and refinement of the original game's environments. For instance, the Landing Site , a recognizable landmark in any Metroid game, needed to retain an air of familiarity and begin to drum up the feeling of dread that would follow players as they played the game. Speedrunning was also taken into consideration, and Guasti consulted prominent Metroid speedrunners to playtest and provide feedback on the environments and Samus's movements. \nInitially, Guasti believed that AM2R would be a simple project, completed within a few months. However, over the course of the game's development, new features such as a minimap , more non-Metroid bosses and item-toggling in the Samus Screen were added. Guasti's personal life became an issue in 2006: his recording studio was dismantled a week before Christmas, leaving him unemployed, and he nearly ended a long-term relationship. Near the end of 2007, Guasti's newly constructed recording studio was running smoothly, and he was able to resume development of AM2R , creating a small demo. The response from the Metroid fan community was overwhelmingly positive, and over time, other fans with varying skills in game development came forward to offer their assistance. Hiring new developers had benefits and drawbacks. Originally, most of the sprites of the game were ripped from past Metroid entries, but the addition of new developers allowed the creation of original sprites. However, more artists meant more coordination of assets, and higher standards of the development. Development was coordinated via Discord and Skype. \nIn 2011, Guasti was hired at a software development company. This provided him with a stable job and money at a time when he was expecting his first child. However, this meant more time at the office and less time spent with his new family. Reflecting on this period in his life, Guasti said: \"I just some guy that showed up and spent some time with her [his daughter] before she fell asleep, and helped with household chores. I won't do that again.\" In an effort to free up time, Guasti once again closed his recording studio to focus on his day job and AM2R . \nOne decade after beginning production of the game, in early 2016, AM2R was nearly finished. It was planned for release in December, but Guasti chose to release it on August 6th, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the franchise (which was otherwise ignored by Nintendo). Ryan Barrett/Infinity's End of the Metroid Database contacted Guasti, having followed AM2R for years and offered to host download links for the game when it was released. A countdown timer was placed on the blog on July 6th, exactly one month before release date. It was released at 4pm EST August 6th. \nHalf an hour before the game went live, Guasti was alerted by one of the playtesters to a game-breaking bug, but he was able to remove the bug and re-upload the game within 10 minutes of the countdown hitting zero. The MDb reported that their site was inaccessible due to the load on the servers; 1 terabyte of bandwidth was downloaded that day from the site from people downloading the game. [7] \nMere hours after AM2R was released, the MDb received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice, asserting that AM2R infringed on Nintendo's intellectual property and requesting that any download links be removed. The notice came from Miller Nash, a Seattle law firm representing Nintendo of America. \nGoing against the DMCA, an update was released on August 18, 2016, which fixes translation issues and a glitch where the Gravity Suit did not render correctly, and adds a transportation pipe to the Genetics Laboratory, the final area of the game. On September 2, 2016, DoctorM64 announced that Nintendo had sent another DMCA request to his email, and that there would be no further updates to AM2R . [8] Some fans have suggested that he release the game's source code so development can continue from other programmers, but Guasti cannot do this as it would go against the DMCA. \nThe game's title, \"Another Metroid 2 Remake\", refers to the fact that at the start of its development, it was one of many fan-made remakes of Metroid II in development. While others were cancelled or never made it past the conceptualization stage, AM2R was completed and released. \nOne of the criticisms of the original Metroid II was that some of the areas had little to no music, or that it was not riveting. AM2R corrects this by using remixes of tracks from official Metroid games. For example, the Hydro Station's theme is a remix of Brinstar Overgrown With Vegetation Area , the Industrial Complex's theme is a remix of the Great Temple theme in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes , and The Tower's theme, as well as the Power Plant subsection, is a remix of the Lower Norfair/Magmoor Caverns theme in Super Metroid and Metroid Prime . Some of the tracks from the original Metroid II are retained and remixed, such as the SR388 tunnels theme, which now has two versions that change halfway through the game, similar to the Tallon Overworld theme in Metroid Prime . Some of the music appears to be original as well, such as the Distribution Center, G.F.S. Thoth and Genesis themes. Of note is that the Queen Metroid 's theme now includes sound bytes present in many tracks throughout the Prime series. \nThe game is dedicated to Satoru Iwata , the late CEO of Nintendo who died in 2015. The game's credits can be found here . Planned content Edit \nMore content was planned in future updates to the game, before development was forced to end. There were plans to add a New Game Plus mode after completion of the game, which would remove the lava and boulder blockages from the main tunnels of SR388, which would grant access to every area of the game (except the Genetics Laboratory). The Genetics Laboratory would become accessible when all Alpha, Gamma, Zeta and Omega Metroids were killed, similar to the Golden Statues in Super Metroid requiring the defeat of 4 bosses before it would open the path to Tourian. The NG+ mode would create more freedom for players, enabling the collection of all items before exterminating the Metroids, or hunting them in reverse order. Beam Combos (either a new set or based on that of Super Metroid or Prime ) would have been added that would be exclusive to NG+, and would be carefully hidden to encourage re-exploration of SR388. The Combos would have used either Missile Ammo or Power Bomb Ammo for balance purposes, but they would all have been capable of damaging Metroids. As stated, more endings were planned for the game to honor the 30th anniversary of Metroid , featuring memorable moments from previous games in the series. These endings would have included Samus fighting the Metroid Prime ( Metroid Prime ), the baby saving Samus from Mother Brain ( Super Metroid ), Samus confronting Gorea while the other Bounty Hunters lie defeated ( Metroid Prime Hunters ) and Samus reuniting with the Etecoons and Dachoras in the Biologic Space Laboratories research station ( Metroid Fusion ). The plan was to include at least one ending representing a game in the series. Additional log entries written by the dead Galactic Federation personnel were considered. Prior to AM2R's release, Latinlingo (the author of the logs in AM2R ) wrote several logs explaining mysteries surrounding the biology of larval Metroids, such as their loss of 2 nuclei as they evolve, why they cannot evolve normally on other planets, whether Beta-Ray manipulation works on later stages of the life cycle, and why the larvae Metroids are favored as bioweapons . These logs would have been collected in the G.F.S. Thoth in a future update. A reference to Metroid Prime Hunters was also to be added. There were discussions regarding the inclusion of a secret post-credits ending cutscene that would reveal the crystals eaten by the baby at the end of the game to be crystallized X Parasites . After the initial ending was viewed, a scene would have begun in the egg chamber, where an X broke out of its crystal and infected a Hornoad , foreshadowing the X's resurgence in Metroid Fusion . The X would have possibly been crystallized with a chemical secreted by adult Metroids that hardens the X before being brought to the egg chamber as baby food. A cutscene showing a battle between an Omega Metroid and a Federation Force Mech was considered near the end of development. This would have been a direct homage to the climax of Aliens , where Ellen Ripley battles the Alien Queen with a Power Loader. DoctorM64 was interested in the idea, and considered that the Mech would have to be non-chibi. He also had the idea for a Mech that Samus could pilot in-game, which would have taken a month or more of work to properly implement. Ultimately, the idea was shelved for a future update. Septoggs and Blob Throwers would likely have been planned in the future, as well as a cutscene of an Omega Metroid eating a Serris specimen, asserting their dominance in the SR388 food chain. Soundtrack Edit \nVersion 1.2 was planned to include new and remastered music tracks, which were released on September 21, 2016 as part of a soundtrack. [9] The new tracks include a remix of the Queen Metroid's battle theme that would begin playing as she released her first fire attack. While the two corridors would play the rhythmic base, the final phase of the battle would play the full melody. A piano version of the tunnels theme, composed by Torbjørn Brandrud, was also included in the soundtrack. [10] AM2R Title",

      "text": "Xbox One Continues to Lead Sales, According to Microsoft Trending up. By Seth G. Macy \nThe Xbox One was October's best-selling console, according to a statement from Microsoft. \n\"Xbox One was once again the best-selling console in October in the U.S., U.K. and Australia,\" according to results given to Microsoft by The NPD Group and GfK Entertainment. \nOctober marks the fourth consecutive month Xbox One bested PS4 in US sales , and the second month for the UK and Australia. In July, Xbox One was the top selling 8th-generation console, but that month saw the Nintendo 3DS at the top of overall console sales. \nMicrosoft said the launches of Gears of War 4 and Battlefield 1 helped drive console sales, with Gears of War 4 coming in as the number one \"platform-exclusive title for October\" in both the US and UK. Microsoft credited both Gears and Battlefield with increasing the number of multiplayer gamers on Xbox Live by 52 percent over the same period last year. \nAt the end of last month, Microsoft revealed its holiday Xbox One bundles , including Gears, Battlefield, Minecraft, and FIFA options. \nThe full NPD numbers for the US won't be released until next Thursday. \nSeth Macy is IGN's weekend web producer and just wants to be your friend.

Macy \nThe Xbox One was October's best-selling console, according to a statement from Microsoft. \n\"Xbox One was once again the best-selling console in October in the U.S., U.K. and Australia,\" according to results given to Microsoft by The NPD Group and GfK Entertainment. \nOctober marks the fourth consecutive month Xbox One bested PS4 in US sales , and the second month for the UK and Australia. In July, Xbox One was the top selling 8th-generation console, but that month saw the Nintendo 3DS at the top of overall console sales. \nMicrosoft said the launches of Gears of War 4 and Battlefield 1 helped drive console sales, with Gears of War 4 coming in as the number one \"platform-exclusive title for October\" in both the US and UK. Microsoft credited both Gears and Battlefield with increasing the number of multiplayer gamers on Xbox Live by 52 percent over the same period last year. \nAt the end of last month, Microsoft revealed its holiday Xbox One bundles , including Gears, Battlefield, Minecraft, and FIFA options. \nThe full NPD numbers for the US won't be released until next Thursday. \nSeth Macy is IGN's weekend web producer and just wants to be your friend.

Xbox One has been the best-selling console in the U.S. for the past four months, and in the U.K. and Australia in each of the last two months.” \nIt will be interesting to see which of the two consoles end up being the popular one over the holiday period.",

      "text": "0 Panos Panay, Corporate Vice President for Surface Computing demonstrates the new Microsoft Surface Studio computer at a live event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S.,October 26, 2016. Reuters/Lucas Jackson \nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 5 2017 is expected to be released early 2017 after the success of its predecessor, the Surface Pro 4. Various reports are hinting at an early 2017 Microsoft Surface Pro 5 release date and the Internet is going crazy over its rumoured specs and features. \nAs already pointed out by numerous unconfirmed reports, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 2017 is getting delayed primarily because of the 14-nanometer Intel Kaby Lake processor and the second major Windows 10 update. Experts believe that the device will be launched by Spring 2017 and could be priced at around US$899 (AU$1,349), writes CNET . \nTech enthusiasts expect a major upgrade to the stylus, especially because of the patent filed by Microsoft for the stylus featuring a rechargeable battery system. The patent mentions a magnetic charging dock with connectors for a Surface Dock mounting, writes Mobile & Apps . Improvements are also expected on the screen size and resolution of the Surface Pro 5. \nAlmost seven hours of battery life has also been hinted by reports. A bigger screen with 4K capability may also be incorporated in the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 2017. The Microsoft Surface Pro 5 may run on the latest Windows 10 Redstone 2 update, consist of a 16GB RAM and have a longer battery life. \nWhen it comes to camera specs, the device may sport a 16MP primary and 8MP front camera. So far none of the rumours have been confirmed. Microsoft has not released any official statement regarding the Surface Pro 5. Fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C ports could be added to the device. \nMicrosoft is offering discounts on its Surface Pro 4 device though iDigital Times believes, this may not be the right time to invest in a Surface Pro 4 as the successor is only a few months away from getting unveiled.

      "text": "Oracle ( ORCL ) , Microsoft ( MSFT ) , and SAP ( SAP ) are likely to face tougher challenges from smaller players in the $300 billion enterprise software market as an increasing number of clients prioritize user-friendliness and innovation over the size of the suppliers, according to a research by GP Bullhound .\n\"The days when the largest vendors were assumed to provide the best solutions are gone,\" the M&A advisor said in a report published Friday. \"Today, forward-thinking corporate users are on a never-ending search for better, more agile and innovative solutions that would meet their demands.\"\nGP Bullhound, a London-based M&A advisor for the technology sector, published the report including findings from its survey with over 150 tech professionals, 61% of which were users and the remainder vendors.\nThe rise of smaller software players is driven partly by a shift in the decision-makers of a user organization to regional offices and end-users from top level executives. And the focus by these decision makers on user-friendliness, localization, and specialization are turning them towards emerging players who can better meet those needs compared with the likes of Dell EMC , Microsoft, SAP, and Oracle.\n\"In an environment of fierce competition, where being great at one thing is better than being just good at a lot, companies are being forced to focus on their core strengths in order to survive and succeed,\" the report said. \"Vendors of Enterprise Software that help their users concentrate on what they do best while bridging efficiency gaps in their operations will add true value, and therefore prevail.\"",

      "text": "The next Visual Studio is all about extensions Likely new features in Microsoft's Visual Studio 15 include identifying performance bottlenecks and revealing dependencies More good reads Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Windows \nMicrosoft is making extensibility a key goal for the planned Visual Studio 15 upgrade along with other changes, including performance monitoring for extensions, a company official said on Thursday. \nExtensions are code packages that provide new or improved Visual Studio features. In that vein, Microsoft seeks easier installation of tools and better performance and productivity, said Tim Sneath, principal lead program manager for Visual Studio. Among the improvements is a performance monitoring system. “Customers will now see a gold notification bar when an extension is slowing load time or typing speed,” Sneath said. Visual Studio 15 has been available in a preview stage . [ The art of programming is changing rapidly. We help you navigate what's hot in programming and what's going cold and give insights into the technologies that are changing how developers work . | Keep up with hot topics in programming with InfoWorld's Application Development newsletter . ] \nMicrosoft also is recommending best practices for extension authors. These include using rule-based contexts to specify conditions when an extension can be loaded, as well as using AsyncPackage in Visual Studio 2015 and above so that packages can be loaded on a background thread. In addition, authors should review an extension’s command filters and editor event handlers, and they should perform operations longer than 50ms asynchronously. Work performed during package initialization should be minimized and deferred until invocation of user action. \nMicrosoft noted users have expressed a desire for tools to identify and disable slow extensions. “One of the best things about Visual Studio is its extensibility,” one user said on the Visual Studio UserVoice page . “The problem is, the more extensions I install, the less stable my Visual Studio gets, the more memory it takes, and sometimes it even takes constant CPU even when minimized.” Users can see the performance of extensions by selecting the Help/Manage Visual Studio Performance menu item. \nAlso featured in the upgrade are batch extension updates and installs intended to make it easier to apply to multiple extensions, and Microsoft has built a way for extension authors to express dependencies by extending the VSIX manifest. A VSIX file has served as a unit of deployment of extensions. “The model is designed so that if dependencies are missing, the extension installer can acquire and install the missing components automatically,” says the company. Also, extension assemblies can be compiled into native images during install time, improving performance. \nStill experimental, the lightweight solution load feature to shorten load times in Visual Studio \"15\" could impact an extension if a project has to be fully loaded. “Our team is putting together steps and guidance on how extensions can know when projects are not yet fully loaded and how to respond accordingly,” said Sneath. “We will share this guidance as soon as possible.” \nAlso with Visual Studio 15, Microsoft is transitioning to Visual Studio Marketplace for finding extensions. “In the next months, we’ll begin the process of retiring the old Visual Studio Gallery. You don’t have any work to do if you’re an extension author – we’ll migrate all the data across automatically.” This story, \"The next Visual Studio is all about extensions\" was originally published by InfoWorld .

      "text": "Microsoft’s chief legal officer Brad Smith has published a detailed blog post outlining the policy changes that he would like to see from President Trump's administration to help technological innovation, education, and society as a whole. More As America wraps its head around the result of Tuesday’s election, the tech world is taking stock of what’s about to happen to it, both in the short and long term. We’ve heard how Silicon Valley has reacted with disappointment and uncertainty over what President Donald Trump means for tech-related policy. Microsoft on the other hand has gone into a little more detail about the relationship it wants with the president-elect.\nIn a blog post published the day after the election, Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, offered his congratulations to Trump while making it clear that there was a great deal of work ahead for both sides.\nMicrosoft has a rocky relationship with many government institutions as it stands. It’s currently in the middle of a lawsuit against the Justice Department, challenging gag orders that prevent companies from informing customers when they’re being investigated. The company is also butting heads with the government over search warrants issued for data stored outside the U.S.\nMore: Microsoft sues over the right to inform customers of U.S. gov’t spying\nCiting a study from Georgetown University on job growth, Smith raises the issues of training, education, and employment for those that have been left behind. He writes that technology companies need to do more to provide educational tools to segments of the population that need the training the most to secure work, especially people without college degrees.\n“We also believe that these issues represent the next frontier for innovation in public policy,” he said, calling for labor laws to be brought “into the 21st century,” making a specific reference to gig economy workers like Uber drivers.\nMicrosoft’s other main point involves improving infrastructure — including highways, bridges, and water networks –and relieving traffic jams through cloud technology and data analytics. Other goals include building out better broadband infrastructure around the U.S, namely in rural areas affected by high unemployment.\n“As we think societally about these new opportunities to address those who have been left behind, it’s critically important that we appreciate the continuing national strengths that serve the country so well,” said Smith.\nIn a likely reference to Trump’s more restrictive views toward immigration, Smith writes that Microsoft employs many people of different races, ethnicities, and religions.\n“If there’s a language spoken on the planet, there’s a good chance that it’s spoken by an employee at Microsoft,” he said. “And we’re committed to promoting not just diversity among all the men and women who work here, but the type of inclusive culture that will enable people to do their best work and pursue rewarding careers.”\nAll of these issues need stronger government policies, he added. “That’s why we’ve not only advocated for clearer and more modern U.S. laws, but have filed lawsuits four times in the past three years against the current administration, standing up for what we believe are the vital rights of people both here and abroad.”\n‘How and where do I vote?’ Google is making it easier to find out Is the AI apocalypse a tired Hollywood trope, or human destiny?

      "text": "News November 11th, 2016 \nMicrosoft is committed to delivering comprehensive security updates to our customers. \nInformation about the security updates we release are currently made available on the Microsoft Security Bulletin website. However, our customers have asked for better access to update information, as well as easier ways to customize their view to serve a diverse set of needs. \nThis month we released a preview of our new single destination for security vulnerability information, the Security Updates Guide . Instead of publishing bulletins to describe related vulnerabilities, the new portal lets our customers view and search security vulnerability information in a single online database. \nUsing the new portal you can: Sort and filter security vulnerability and update content, for example, by CVE, KB number, product, or release date. Filter out products that don’t apply to you, and drill down to more detailed security update information for products that do. Leverage a new RESTful API to obtain Microsoft security update information. This eliminates the need for you to employ outdated methods like screen-scraping of security bulletin web pages to assemble working databases of necessary and actionable information. \nSecurity update information will be published as bulletins and on the Security Updates Guide until January 2017. After the January 2017 Update Tuesday release, we will only publish update information to the Security Updates Guide .",

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 4 seconds ago \nMicrosoft’s original Xbox One has had a pretty hard time competing with Sony’s PlayStation 4 . But it looks like its fortunes may have turned, especially with the launch of the Xbox One S , as this is the fourth month in a row that Microsoft’s console outsells its rival in the US. \nData from industry-tracking firm NPD, shows that the Xbox was once against the best-selling console in the US, for the month of October. Microsoft’s momentum in this field is thought to be largely due to the updated and slimmer Xbox One S, the highly discounted Xbox One and the promotional bundles that the company keeps pushing . \nIts victory in the States was mirrored in the UK and Australia during October, where Microsoft managed to not only outsell the Playstation 4, but also widen its lead considerably . The company said: \nThanks to the passion of Xbox fans worldwide and their continued excitement for Xbox One S, Xbox One was once again the best-selling console in October in the U.S., U.K. and Australia according to NPD Group and GfK Entertainment. Xbox One has been the best-selling console in the U.S. for the past four months, and in the U.K. and Australia in each of the last two months.",

      "text": "Russia's antitrust authority on Thursday said it had opened an investigation into Microsoft for allegedly abusing its dominance in the antivirus software market.\nIn a statement, the Federal Anti-monopoly Service said it had taken the decision after being contacted by the Moscow-based internet security giant Kaspersky.\nIt accuses Microsoft of reducing to six working days the time for third party software vendors to adapt their antivirus packages to the Windows 10 operating system, compared with two months for earlier versions.\nWhen a Windows user installs the latest operating system, its antivirus software is disabled, with Microsoft's Windows Defender system taking over by default.\nWith only a few days to make the changes necessary to ensure compatibility, software developers like Kaspersky do not have the time to provide users with adequate service.\n\"As Microsoft itself develops the Windows Defender antivirus system, which automatically becomes active if the third party software products do not have time to be adapted to Windows 10, such measures constitute an unfair advantage for Microsoft,\" FAS deputy director Anatoli Golomolzine said in the statement.\nKaspersky confirmed approaching the antitrust authority as well as the European Commission in a statement which said the move came \"after months of fruitless discussions and multiple exhausting attempts to resolve the issue directly with Microsoft.\"\nIn August, the FAS started legal proceedings against U.S. tech giant Apple over the alleged fixing of retail prices for iPhones in Russia.\nIn the same month, it also hit Google with a $6.75 million fine for abusing its dominant market position by forcing smartphone makers to install its search engine on phones running the Android operating system.",

      "text": "On Thursday during the PwnFest 2016 event within Seoul’s Power of Community security conference, a team from vulnerability firm Qihoo 360 and South Korean security researcher JungHoon “Lokihardt” Lee demonstrated two different hacks that took advantage of vulnerabilities within Microsoft Edge, completing one in a mere 18 seconds. The internet browser was running on a 64-bit version of Windows 10 Anniversary Edition (aka Redstone 1), and enabled these teams to remotely execute code at the system level.\nPwnFest is a “festival” that encourages hackers and security firms to target specific platforms as a means of demonstrating how vulnerabilities they find can be used in the wild. Participants receive a cash prize while platform developers receive information about vulnerabilities and how they are exploited. In the end, participants and general consumers are the two big winners stemming from the event.\nThat said, here are the targets and their cash rewards:\nPlatform/OS/Device Base Reward Extra Reward Microsoft Edge\nWindows 10 x64 Redstone 1 $120,000 $20,000 Android 7.0\nNexus 6p and Pixel $120,000 $20,000 Microsoft Hyper-V\nWindows Server 2016 $150,000 none Google Chrome\nWindows 10 x64 Redstone 1 $120,000 $20,000 Apple iOS 10\niPhone 7 Plus $120,000 $60,000 Apple Safari\nMacOS Sierra $80,000 $20,000 Adobe Flash Player\nMicrosoft Edge\nWindows 10 x64 Redstone 1 $100,000 $20,000 VMWare Workstation Pro 1.2\nWindows 10 x64 Redstone 1 $150,000 none As for the participating teams, there appear to be six. Here they are with their targets:\n360Vulcan\n360Alpha\n360Marvel Lokihardt Team Pangu\nJH Microsoft Edge Microsoft Edge Apple Safari VMware Workstation 12.5.1 VMware Workstation 12.5.1 Adobe Flash Player Android 7.0 (via Pixel) On the Microsoft Edge front, vulnerabilities discovered in the Windows 10 browser enabled system-level remote code execution. To better understand system-level access, you have to look at how device operating systems are layered in a security sense. At the top layer, consumers will see the applications they normally use. Under that are device drivers with low privileges followed by device drivers with high privileges further underneath. The final, bottom layer consists of the operating system’s central core, aka the kernel, that controls everything. Running a malicious program below the “user” layer grants a hacker special privileges that can go undetected by the device owner.\nMore: One of the ‘Celebgate’ hackers has just been sent to prison for 18 months\nAccording to The Register , Lokihardt managed to successfully exploit Microsoft Edge’s security hole(s) in a mere 18 seconds, whereas the length of time it took Qihoo 360’s team to hack Microsoft Edge was not provided. In fact, the Qihoo 360 team reportedly worked on developing its trio of attacks for a period of six months prior to this week’s event.\nHowever, despite all that preparation, the Qihoo 360 team was forced to rework their Edge browser attack within a span of 30 hours. That’s because Microsoft plugged three of the four available vulnerabilities in a Patch Tuesday update released prior to this week’s hacking event.\nThe details surrounding vulnerabilities exploited during PwnFest won’t be released to the public right away, but rather provided directly to the vendors so they can issue an immediate fix. The hacking event is still ongoing as of this publication, so there’s a good chance we could hear more about successful exploits during the main two-day security conference.\nMicrosoft releases patch for zero-day Flash and Windows Kernel exploit Oh, look! It’s another patched vulnerability in Adobe’s Flash Player software Google fixes critical security flaw affecting over 900 million Android devices",

      "text": "Moscow (AFP) - Russia's antitrust authority on Thursday said it had opened an investigation into Microsoft for allegedly abusing its dominance in the antivirus software market.\nIn a statement, the Federal Anti-monopoly Service said it had taken the decision after being contacted by the Moscow-based internet security giant Kaspersky.\nIt accuses Microsoft of reducing to six working days the time for third party software vendors to adapt their antivirus packages to the Windows 10 operating system, compared with two months for earlier versions.\nWhen a Windows user installs the latest operating system, its antivirus software is disabled, with Microsoft's Windows Defender system taking over by default.\nWith only a few days to make the changes necessary to ensure compatibility, software developers like Kaspersky do not have the time to provide users with adequate service.\n\"As Microsoft itself develops the Windows Defender antivirus system, which automatically becomes active if the third party software products do not have time to be adapted to Windows 10, such measures constitute an unfair advantage for Microsoft,\" FAS deputy director Anatoli Golomolzine said in the statement.\nKaspersky confirmed approaching the antitrust authority as well as the European Commission in a statement which said the move came \"after months of fruitless discussions and multiple exhausting attempts to resolve the issue directly with Microsoft.\"\nIn August, the FAS started legal proceedings against US tech giant Apple over the alleged fixing of retail prices for iPhones in Russia.\nIn the same month, it also hit Google with a $6.75 million fine for abusing its dominant market position by forcing smartphone makers to install its search engine on phones running the Android operating system.",

      "text": "Microsoft officially introduced the new Authenticator app earlier this year, but while the company rolled out new clients for iOS and Android, the Windows 10 Mobile version was only in beta stage, as engineers still needed to test and improve some of its features. Of course, with iOS and Android clients already up for grabs, it was super frustrating for Windows users to stick with the beta, especially given Microsoft’s increasing focus on non-Windows systems. So today, Microsoft officially introduced the new Authenticator app for Windows 10 Mobile, coming with the same features as on the rival platforms, including a new user interface, as well as with support for wearables and certificate-based authentication for enterprise customers. This new app replaces the Azure Authenticator, Microsoft account, and Multi-Factor Authentication apps. In case you’re wondering what wearables the app supports, the official description of Authenticator names Apple Watch or Samsung ...",

The update introduced support for interactive notifications to the app, allowing users to easily be able to interact with the notifications from Outlook Mail and Calendar apps. Today, the company has started rolling the update out to all Windows 10 users.\nFor those unfamiliar, these interactive notifications show two buttons, and these buttons are the Quick Actions which you can change to Set Flag, Mark as read/unread, Move to Junk, Archive, Delete and Move an email. When you change the Quick Actions on the app, the buttons on the interactive notifications will also update — but that may require you to restart the app a couple of times.\nThe latest update for Outlook Mail is 17.7466.41147.0, and you can get it from the link below:\nWP-Appbox: Mail and Calendar (Free, Windows Store) → ",

      "text": "Oracle ( ORCL ) , Microsoft ( MSFT ) , and SAP ( SAP ) are likely to face tougher challenges from smaller players in the $300 billion enterprise software market as an increasing number of clients prioritize user-friendliness and innovation over the size of the suppliers, according to a research by GP Bullhound .\n\"The days when the largest vendors were assumed to provide the best solutions are gone,\" the M&A advisor said in a report published Friday. \"Today, forward-thinking corporate users are on a never-ending search for better, more agile and innovative solutions that would meet their demands.\"\nGP Bullhound, a London-based M&A advisor for the technology sector, published the report including findings from its survey with over 150 tech professionals, 61% of which were users and the remainder vendors.\nThe rise of smaller software players is driven partly by a shift in the decision-makers of a user organization to regional offices and end-users from top level executives. And the focus by these decision makers on user-friendliness, localization, and specialization are turning them towards emerging players who can better meet those needs compared with the likes of Dell EMC , Microsoft, SAP, and Oracle.\n\"In an environment of fierce competition, where being great at one thing is better than being just good at a lot, companies are being forced to focus on their core strengths in order to survive and succeed,\" the report said. \"Vendors of Enterprise Software that help their users concentrate on what they do best while bridging efficiency gaps in their operations will add true value, and therefore prevail.\"",

      "text": "0 0 \nRecently, Google disclosed a security hole in Windows as well as other security flaws across Microsoft’s products. Now, it seems that a week later, a patch was released for these flaws. Since Google wasn’t able to patch a flaw in its own source code, Microsoft took care of the problem in its latest Patch Tuesday release. \nOn the second Tuesday of each month, Microsoft releases a new Patch Tuesday and in the latest release, a patch for a vulnerability discovered by Google’s team was introduced. This vulnerability allowed malicious code to escape from its sandbox, giving hackers the possibility to run code within a web browser and exploit affected devices. \nIn the November update, included are fixes for other publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities, with one of them under active attack. There were also holes in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer web browsers, a flaw in Windows’ font handling subsystem, while the fourth vulnerability was a remote code execution bug in Office , which could be exploited when a user opens a specially-crafted malicious document. \nThe Patch Tuesday comes also with a security update for Adobe’s Flash Player software, which gained a bad reputation for its critical vulnerabilities even if the developer is releasing updates to fix as many flaws as possible. \nMicrosoft has moved pretty fast and patched the flaw highlighted by Google a week ago. However, the advertising giant wasn’t capable of releasing a patch for the Dirty COW vulnerability that affects Android OS and which behaves exactly like Microsoft’s flaw, meaning that it allows malicious applications to execute root-user-level privileged code. Google has only released a separate fix for its Nexus and Pixel devices, while other Android handsets will need to wait until December when the update with the patch will roll out. Most likely, some vendors will take action in the meantime and patch the flaw themselves. \nRELATED STORIES TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft just released the new build 14965 for Windows 10 Preview to Insiders on the Fast ring. The build didn’t bring any major new features, as it is mainly focused on improving the system, and updating some apps. \nHowever, build 14965 introduced one addition that we find quite interesting. That new feature is the virtual touchpad for Windows 10 touch-enabled devices. Users can activate the virtual touchpad when they connect the touch-enabled device with the second monitor. \nBy using the virtual touchpad, you can fully control the mouse pointer, without the need to connect an actual mouse to the computer. The virtual touchpad looks just like any other touchpad, but only is placed on the screen. Of course, the virtual touchpad is not only limited to monitors, as you can also use it when your device is connected to PC, or TV. \nTo connect your device to an external screen, just connect the cables, go to the Action Center, and tap on the “Project” Quick Action to project the screen. And to activate the virtual touchpad, just press and hold on the taskbar and select “Show touchpad button”. The virtual touchpad will appear in the Notifications area. You can further customize the touchpad settings by going to Settings > Devices > Touchpad. \nSince this is the very first version of the virtual touchpad for Windows 10, it doesn’t look so appealing. It’s basically just three black rectangles piled on one another. However, we expect Microsoft to experiment with its looks in the next builds and deliver a much more eye appealing feature in the future. We’re sure that will happen, just remember how Windows 10 itself looked in its earliest days. \nThe virtual touchpad is, for now, only available to Windows Insiders running at least build 14965. We expect Microsoft to release it to everyone else with the Creators Update , next Spring. As we said, there’s more room for improvement, but Microsoft has enough time to put everything in its place. \nWhat do you think about the new virtual touchpad for Windows 10? Will this feature be useful to you? Tell us in the comments below. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft just released a new build for Windows 10 Preview that introduced a few new features, as well as some app updates. One of the apps that has been updated in Windows 10 Preview build 14965 is Sticky Notes , which received a huge list of improvements. \nActually, this is the biggest update for the Windows 10 version of Sticky Notes that Microsoft ever released. Besides some regular bug fixes, the most famous notes app for Windows Desktop also received a bunch of new features and options. \nThe Insights feature of Sticky Notes received the biggest adjustment. It now has flight detection for numerous countries, handwriting recognition, phone number recognition, and more. \nHere’s the complete changelog of the latest update for Windows 10 Sticky Notes: \n“We’ve expanded our support for Insights to many more languages and regions, with even more to come in further updates, stay tuned! Specifically, with this version: We’ve added flight detection for Germany (Germany), in more English locales (Canada, Great Britain, India, Arabia), Spanish (Spain & Mexico), French (France, Canada), Italian (Italy), Japanese (Japan), and Portuguese (Brazil). We’ve added email & URL recognition for every locale (except Chinese (simplified or traditional), Korean, or Japanese, which we’re still working on). We’ve added phone number recognition to all English, German, Spanish, French and Italian locales. We’ve added address recognition support for English (Great Britain) and Spanish (United States). We’ve added time recognition (prompting to create a Cortana reminder) to English (Great Britain), English (Australia) and English (India). We’ve added stock recognition (for example, $MSFT) to English (Australia), English (Canada), English (India), German (Germany), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Mexico), French (France), French (Canada), Japanese (Japan) and Portuguese (Brazil). \nIf Insights in Sticky Notes isn’t turned on automatically for you, tap “…” > Settings gear > “Enable insights”. Note: The language and region used to detect Insights in Sticky Notes is based off of the active keyboard. We’re currently investigating some issues where Insights may not show up as expected if you switch keyboards while typing in Sticky Notes. \nWe’ve fixed some issues with Undo and Redo (CTRL + Z/CTRL + Y) while typing, so they’ll now do so more reliably. \nWe’ve improved the performance of text input while typing. \nIt’s now easier than ever to get the latest Sticky Notes app updates. When our next update is available, we’ll show an in-app prompt so all you have to do is click ‘Update’. \nWe’ve also done a whole lot of UI/UX polishing and performance improvements that we hope you enjoy.” \nAll these features and improvements are, for now, only available to Insiders running at least Windows 10 Preview build 14965. We don’t know when Microsoft will push this update to regular users, but it will probably be before the next major update for Windows 10, the Creators Update . \nWe know many of you weren’t satisfied with Sticky Notes until now. So, let us know what you think about the app after installing this update. Is the app now more reliable, or needs even more improvements?

(AP) — Microsoft will spend more than $250 million to expand a data center site in Southside Virginia. \nGov. Terry McAuliffe announced that the tech company’s expansion of a data center in Mecklenburg County will create 44 new jobs. \nMicrosoft’s total investment in the site now tops $2 billion since 2010. \nMcAuliffe approved a $500,000 grant for the expansion. The state’s tobacco fund approved nearly $1 million for the project. The governor’s office said it competed with other potential sites for the expansion.

      "text": "0 0 \nMicrosoft recently rolled out two updates for Windows 7: security-only update KB3197867 and Monthly Rollup KB3197868 . Windows 7 users tried to download these updates as soon as they became available, only to find out that installing KB3197868 is much more difficult than expected. \nMonthly Rollup KB3197868 doesn’t bring new system features, but includes many security updates and quality improvements. Unfortunately, many Windows 7 users still can’t install KB3197868. They manage to download the update, but the install process fails and reverts. \nI am having the same problem that someone else reported but regarding which there has not yet been a reply: Security Update KB3197868 fails to install and reverts. This has happened with a few other updates in the past and I have never been able to find a solution on this site. I really want the protection afforded by the update and would very much appreciate knowing what I can do to have its installation continue to a successful conclusion. \nMicrosoft’s support team hasn’t been able to offer a proper solution for this bug, and indicated some obscure troubleshooting steps that have nothing to do with the issue described by users. \nThe problem is that irrespective of the update channel used, Windows Update or Microsoft’s Update Catalog , the result is the same. Windows 7 users can download KB3197868, but at a given moment, the install process freezes and reverts without any error message. \nAs a quick reminder, Monthly Rollup KB3197868 enhances security for the following Windows components: Microsoft Graphics Component, kernel-mode drivers, Microsoft Video Control, Common Log File System driver, Windows authentication methods, Windows operating system, Windows File Manager, Windows registry, OpenType, and Internet Explorer 11. \nIf you’ve come across any workarounds to fix the KB3197868 install issue, list the troubleshooting steps in the comment section below. \nRELATED STORIES YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT:",

      "title": "Microsoft soups up Azure SQL with new in-memory capabilities",
      "text": "Microsoft has made its Azure SQL in-memory capabilities generally available, enabling rapid and advanced data analytics atop of its cloud service.\nIn-memory refers to data being stored in the RAM as a way of accelerating database performance, as it allows information to be accessed much more rapidly than traditional databases can do when they have to pull that data from the storage arrays to the processor.\nMicrosoft said that it’s now offering in-memory support to users of Azure SQL with Premium database tier subscriptions, and is promising a big performance boost to customers who do.\n“In-memory technology helps optimize the performance of transactional (OLTP), analytics (OLAP), as well as mixed workloads (HTAP),” said Rohan Kumar, general manager of Microsoft’s Database Systems group, in a blog post. “These technologies allow you to achieve phenomenal performance with Azure SQL Database—75,000 transactions per second for order processing (11X [performance] gain) and reduced query execution time from 15 seconds to 0.26 (57X [performance gain]).”\nKumar added that customers can use Azure SQL’s in-memory capabilities to power their way through workloads at no additional cost. So, for example, customers on a P2 database plan will be able to see nine-times and ten-times improvements in transactions and analytics queries, without needing to pay any more fees.\nAzure SQL’s new in-memory capabilities are based on several technologies, including in-memory OLTP (online transaction processing), which increases data throughput to enable higher-speed trading and more rapid data ingestion from Internet of Things’ sources.\nA second technology is called clustered columnstore indexes, which forgo the time-consuming extract, transform, load (ETL) process and are able to reduce data storage footprints by up to ten times, thereby accelerating reporting and analytics jobs, Kumar explained.\nNon-clustered Columnstore Indexes for Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) gain real-time insights into your business by querying the operational database directly, without the need to run an expensive ETL process and wait for the data warehouse to be populated\n“Non-clustered Columnstore indexes allow very fast execution of analytics queries on the OLTP database, while reducing the impact on the operational workload,” he said.\nMicrosoft’s update comes as rival firm SAP SE is planning the launch of its own blisteringly fast database later this month. On November 30, SAP will release HANA 2 , a revamped version of its in-memory computing platform that comes with new artificial intelligence algorithms and ‘bring-your-own-language’ capabilities that should enable developers to build and deploy a new breed of intelligent applications.\nPhoto Credit: clydeyello Flickr via Compfight cc ",

      "title": "Microsoft’s new Color Binoculars app helps colorblind experience the world just like everyone else",
      "text": "\nMicrosoft today announced a major new app from its Garage lab: Color Binoculars. The company’s latest app is quite fascinating as it allows colorblind to be able to experience the world just like everyone else. Color Binoculars essentially helps users “see” the world by replacing colors like red and green with pink and green, which are apparently more distinguishable to the colorblind. The app comes with three different modes: Red/Green/Red, Blue/Yellow which is what you will be able to use to distinguish between different colors. Here’s a good example where the apples and flowers are pink, instead of red:\nGallery Tom Overton, who initially came up with this app idea, stated:\n“It’s an app that helps colorblind people distinguish color combinations that they would normally have trouble telling apart. For example, since I have difficulty distinguishing between red and green, our app makes reds brighter and greens darker so that the difference is more obvious. It replaces difficult color combinations, like red and green, with more easily distinguishable combinations, like pink and green.”\nThe app itself is quite simple, and there’s nothing wrong with that. The app has a simple toggle at the bottom which lets you enable and disable the app’s functionality. You can also switch between the different modes very easily just like you can on the default camera app on your iPhone. Once the feature is enabled, Color Binoculars uses the iPhone’s camera and filters to allow the colorblind to experience the world just like everyone else.\nColor Binoculars was actually shown off by its makers, Tom Overton and Tingting Zhu back at the annual Microsoft Hackathon event for employees. The app is now ready for public use, and if you are interested, you can grab it on your iPhone from the App Store. And in case you are wondering — no, the app isn’t available for Windows Phone or Android just yet.",

Speaking at the conference, Peter Lee, corporate vice president at Microsoft Research, referred to Cortana's Korean debut as 'imminent', although no firm date was provided.\nHarry Shum, EVP of AI and Research has since reaffirmed the release via Twitter. \nCortana is coming to Korea soon! Stay tuned!\n— harryshum (@harryshum) November 10, 2016 Cortana is currently available in thirteen different regions, spanning eight different languages. Available in both China and Japan - a Korean release is a natural step in the assistant's rollout over the region. If previous releases are of any indication, we can expect a release in the coming weeks.\nAre you looking forward to Cortana's Korean rollout? Let us know in the comments!\n",
