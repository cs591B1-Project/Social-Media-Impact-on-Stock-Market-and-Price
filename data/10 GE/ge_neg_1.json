      "text": "Tweet Share The logo of Down Jones Industrial Average stock market index listed company General Electric is shown at their subsidiary company GE Aviation in Santa Ana, California April 13, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/Files More By Jeffrey Dastin (Reuters) - FedEx Corp is grounding one of its planes temporarily that has an engine General Electric Co flagged after a passenger jet erupted in flames last month, a spokesman for the cargo airline told Reuters on Monday. Engine-maker GE on Friday alerted airlines about a small number of parts under investigation following American Airlines Flight 383, which caught fire on Oct. 28. The parts were made from the same lot of alloy as a turbine disk used by American, which GE subsequently discovered had a \"material anomaly.\" While U.S. investigators have yet to assign blame for the non-fatal incident, they have found what appeared to be fatigue cracking where the disk had an anomaly. Experts have said the disk's corrupted material may indicate a manufacturing defect, either by the parts or metal maker. In a statement, FedEx spokesman Chris Allen said the company was notified that an engine in one MD11 aircraft was affected. \"The aircraft associated with the affected engine is temporarily not in service until the engine is replaced. Safety is our top priority,\" he said. GE on Friday said all but one of the parts related to the anomalous disk were out of service. The component on the now-grounded FedEx plane had been the one in operation, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said on Monday. \"The part has been taken out of service, not because it was viewed as defective but because it was simply from the same lot of material,\" Kennedy said in a statement. The American Airlines flight from Chicago to Miami aborted takeoff following an \"uncontained\" engine failure, a rare event in which components spew from an engine and can tear through an aircraft cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. The airline was flying a Boeing Co 767 aircraft with CF6-80C2 engines made by GE. In this instance, the failure caused a fuel leak that resulted in a fire, though no one aboard was seriously injured. GE has stressed the reliability of its CF6 engines, which it said had flown more than 400 million hours since the 1970s.

      "title": "GE Buying Baker Hughes: What Investors In Both Companies Need To Know",
      "text": "-17.4% Click to enlarge For example, looking at the EPS accretion for next year we can see that the deal will actually end up hurting GE's short-term EPS. And as you can see from GE's latest earnings results, while management has managed to make substantial gains in terms of EPS from continuing operations (thanks to its Herculean buybacks) the dividend payout ratio still isn't to where we can sustainably expect a dividend increase. Of course that is largely because of management's current focus on selling off non-core assets in order to focus on its bread and butter industrial units. However, selling off assets does mean short-term declines in sales and earnings, until cost-cutting efforts and organic growth can finally take root and offset the declines. The good news is that GE is once more growing organically, if only moderately, and the massive cash reserves mean that management can continue to bring down the share count at a fast clip. And the specifics of this deal, at least potentially, should allow for 7% EPS growth over the next three years. That should help dividend growth going forward. However, GE shareholders who were hoping for a short-term boost to the dividend may end up disappointed. After all, EPS from continuing operations has just started to cover the dividend, meaning the prudent course of action would be to give the company a few more quarters to bring the payout ratio down to a more sustainable level. Of course, we can't forget that management had previously said \"it plans to maintain its dividend at the current level in 2016 and grow it thereafter .\" In other words, 2017 was the realistic time frame for a dividend increase, and management could take the conservative route and choose to wait until the 4th quarter of 2017 to do so. Which brings me to the issue of what risks investors need to keep in mind for this deal. Risks to consider Click to enlarge Source: GE Q3 2016 earnings presentation. The first major risk factor to consider is execution risk. Particularly, though I am a GE shareholder, and a long-term bull, I must admit that management's recent acquisitions haven't been the most impressive when it comes to short-term EPS accretion. For example, the $14 billion acquisition of Alstrom is currently generating $.04 per share in EPS on an annualized basis. While that number doubles if you excluded negative currency effects from the strong dollar, the fact is that negative currency effects can, and do hinder dividend growth at this time (and will only worsen if US interest rates rise). But the point is that all of GE's acquisitions of late have been with an eye towards long-term growth, including the $1.65 billion purchase of LM Wind Power, which is generating $0.04 in annual EPS growth. If you combined the Alstrom, LM Wind Power, and Baker Hughes deals (out to 2020), then the potential long-term earnings accretion comes to $0.16/share, or a 14.3% over a three year period; 4.6% CAGR. In other words, under the best case scenario, GE's latest acquisitions, only represent a small, incremental increase in earnings, and potential future dividend growth. Which brings me to the most obvious risk, oil prices remaining below the expectations management based this deal's potential EPS accretion on. Specifically, GE's rosy outlook for the EPS accretion from this deal is predicated on a long-term, sustained recovery in energy prices that will boost sales, earnings, and cash flow from the new Baker Hughes. Now $60 per barrel by 2020 isn't a pie in the sky proposition, given that demand for both oil & gas is projected to continue to rise steadily for the next decade. Combine that with the $1 trillion in capex spending cuts that oil companies have undergone in the last two years, and it may end up proving highly conservative. Then again, we can't forget that the oil crash was initially started by Saudi Arabia trying to drive US shale producers out of business in an increasingly costly war for market share. The reason the current oil crash continues to baffle experts is because US shale producers have proven far more resilient than anyone previously thought possible. For example, back in 2014 EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG ), the largest oil producer in the continental US, budgeted that it needed $70 crude to break even on US shale production in the Eagle Ford, and Permian Basin. BUT thanks to improved production techniques, it believes that it can profitably produce shale oil with double digit internal rates of return even if oil is just $30 . Obviously not all oil producers can cut production costs this low. But the point is that necessity is the mother of invention, and the need to produce oil at increasingly low prices to maintain cash flow to service debt payments has turned the US shale industry into a far leaner oil production giant than we ever thought possible. Which means that, as oil prices rise to above $50 we may very well see many more producers start increasing production once more, potentially placing a world cap on prices below GE's assumed $60 level. Bottom line: GE's buyout of Baker Hughest is great short-term news for Baker Hughest investors, and a should provide a solid long-term benefit to GE's dividend lovers While it is understandably very frustrating to watch GE's turnaround seemingly proceeding at such a snail's pace, investors need to remember that management is playing a very long game here. The company's most recent acquisitions show that Jeffrey Immelt is working on a 10 year time frame. And since management is only now selling off the last of GE Capital, and slower global economic conditions means weak industrial top line growth, investors need to be willing to give GE time to execute on its plans. Specifically, to become a leaner, more profitable company, but more importantly a dominant player in digital industrial technology that will dominate the global industrial sector going forward. Disclosure: I am/we are long GE.  ",

      "text": "  \nBHI agreed to be \"acquired\" by GE in a complex transaction. In my opinion, the structure of the deal is a positive development for GE shareholders. \n\"When the facts change, I change my mind\" --John Maynard Keynes. \nGE is still a long-term buy at today's price. A lot has transpired since I posted \" GE: Say It Isn't So \" , and, in my opinion, General Electric (NYSE: GE ) shareholders should now be excited about the company's long-term prospects if the announced deal with Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI ) is eventually approved by regulators. Why? It comes down to one word --flexibility. Click to enlarge ( Image Source ) The Announced Deal Gives GE Many Different Options To Create Shareholder Value In the article linked above, I described why I was not a big fan of an outright purchase of Baker Hughes and I explained why I thought that forming partnerships with the oil and gas service company would be more beneficial for GE; however, I stand corrected, sort of. A straight-forward outright purchase of Baker Hughes would not have been a great decision for GE, so luckily management got a little creative with the deal. I believe that Mr. Jeffrey Immelt, President & CEO of GE, described the Baker Hughes deal the best when he stated that it was a \" tremendously creative transaction \". The company did end up \"buying\" Baker Hughes but I would contend that the transaction was structured in a way that will create many different options for GE to prosper in the years ahead (i.e. the facts changed). Let me explain. The GE-BHI tie-up is a very complex transaction that has many different moving pieces and it is still difficult to understand all of the long-term ramifications of the merger/acquisition even after reading the company's presentations and supplemental documentation. (Source: GE's Investor Presentation --linked above ) Other Seeking Alpha contributors have already covered the specifics of GE-BHI deal (see here for an article that does a great job of explaining the deal) so I will not bore you all by going over the same details again, but instead, I wanted to explain why I believe that the structure of the deal is a positive development for both GE and its shareholders. To start, the most important takeaway, in my opinion, is the flexibility that was created with the way that the deal was structured. The deal will give GE management the opportunity to pull different levers depending upon the new entity's business prospects, which is a valuable position to be in. If the oil and gas industry never recovers (unlikely), or if the recovery is slower than anticipated, GE will have the ability to more-easily spin off the 62.5% ownership in the newly created entity in short order. This transaction will put GE into a very familiar position with the fact that 37.5% of the new entity will already be publicly traded --remember, not too long ago GE IPO'ed Synchrony Financial (NYSE: SYF ) and then spun off the remaining portion at a later date in a transaction that significantly reduced GE's total share count (swapped the retained SYF shares for ~671m GE shares). On the other hand, the deal also gives GE the opportunity to retain the majority ownership of the new entity over the long-term so the company will be able to prosper from a quicker than anticipated recovery in the oil and gas industry. At the end of the day, this deal was structured to give GE management a great deal of flexibility and because of this I believe that the real winners will be GE shareholders. Another positive takeaway from the deal is that the new entity will have a separate management team and its results will not be rolled into GE's consolidated industrial numbers. I know that this sounds like smoke and mirrors, but, in my opinion, after the acquisition closes management will not need to constantly spend time explaining why the O&G segment's orders and operating results are terrible (and not expected to improve anytime soon) and this will result in better headlines when GE reports its quarterly results. To expand on this topic, I created the table below with data from the most recent earnings presentation to show just how much of a drag the O&G segment has been on GE's consolidated results. (Source: Data from GE's Q3 2016 Earnings Presentation; table created by W.G. Investment Research) The table above paints an entirely different picture than what the slide below does. Click to enlarge (Source: Q3 2016 Earnings Presentation --linked above ) Sentiment plays a big role in investing and this deal will greatly improve the way investors/analysts view GE, in my opinion. Yes, GE will retain a majority portion of the new entity but the structure of the deal will allow for the financial community to focus on the growing industrial businesses instead of focusing on the mixed industrial results that were negatively impacted by the O&G segment, which has been the consistent theme for the past eight plus quarters. Bottom Line The General Electric-Baker Hughes deal created a lot of uncertainty that will need to be answered over time, but as the old saying goes uncertainty creates opportunity . The flexibility of the deal will give management many different options to create value, which is a great position to be in. Whether or not GE overpaid for Baker Hughes [it was recently announced that the company paid $76/share (~37% premium)] is debatable topic but what is really important is that the deal is still expected to be highly accretive to 2018 earnings. The GE-BHI deal does not change my view of this company, as I still believe that GE is a long-term buy at today's price. Two important factors that investors should pay close attention to going forward are: (1) the impact of a recovery, or lack thereof, in the oil and gas industry to the newly created entity's estimates/results, and (2) GE management's long-term intentions (i.e. whether GE decides to maintain the majority ownership or eventually spins it off to shareholders).

      "text": "Share: Audio is still an uncluttered medium where a brand like General Electric can stretch its creative muscles.\n“We look at audio like a total white space,” said Alexa Christon, GE’s head of media innovation. \nThat’s why GE is re-upping its investment in audio with “LifeAfter,” the soon-to-be-released second season of GE Podcast Theater, a modern sci-fi spin on GE’s radio anthology series from the 1950s. The first season, dubbed “ The Message ,” hit No. 1 on iTunes, amassed 5 million listeners and won multiple Cannes Lions awards after its release in October 2015. \nAlthough Christon declined to comment on specific budget allocations, she noted that GE “is invested in making sure that each program drives our digital industrial brand.” \nLast year, the podcast was an experiment more than anything else. Although GE was tracking downloads, subscriber counts and social mentions, Andy Goldberg, GE’s global creative director, said at the time that the brand wasn’t looking to hit specific counts. \nBut having garnered a following and hit such high marks out of gate, the expectations are higher this year. \n“‘The Message’ set a high bar for us,” Christon said. “But we’re still looking at the same metrics: engagement, shares, downloads.” \nBut the ultimate goal is driving awareness of the GE brand, “and the KPis associated with that are through people that listen to the podcast,” she said, noting that GE will continue to evaluate whether audio is worth the continued investment by charting listener engagement. \nAnd that engagement can be anything from a social share to subscription to talking about the podcast on Reddit. \nBut GE has no plans to monetize. “We like to be early to platforms and we like to experiment with purpose,” Christon said. “It’s not about monetization, though. It’s about finding and building the platforms and places where we as a brand can engage, delight and, potentially, yes, at some point, transact.”\nGE weaves itself into the storyline of its podcasts, treading the line between advertising and storytelling designed to avoid the awkwardness generally associated with branded content. \n“We see this as a nod to the past and a nod to what’s coming,” Christon said. “It’s a way to reinvent ad-like objects. Yes, it’s something that came out of our marketing department, but it’s also about creating an experience.” \nThat’s what makes audio worth the continued investment. \n“It’s a marketing message, but it’s also something listeners attribute to GE,” said Matt Turck, CRO of Slate’s podcast network, Panoply. “It’s the GE Podcast Theater, but it’s also valuable content for someone to enjoy.” \nLike last year, GE worked with its agency BBDO on the idea, Panoply Media on the writing, casting and distribution and indie agency Giant Spoon on promotion and strategy. “LifeAfter” will be available to download for free from iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher, Soundcloud, Overcast and TuneIn on Nov. 14.",

      "text": "Related Tickers: GE , BHI , SLB Combining with Baker Hughes to create the new mega oilfield services company is a smart move by GE. But,what are the implications for GE stock? GE generates strong cash flow and returns substantial capital to its shareholders through stock buyback and increasing dividend payments. Will stock buyback and dividend payments continue to be the same after the Baker Hughes deal? The average target price of the top analysts is at $35, an upside of about 20% from its November 7 close price, which appears reasonable.Can GE do better than that? Flickr \nGeneral Electric Company's (NYSE:GE) oil and gas business has suffered a significant decline in the last two years as a result of the crashing crude oil prices. However, General Electric has demonstrated a strong belief in the growth prospects of its oil and gas business by combining with one of the world's leading oilfield services companies Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) . The merger represents a considerable cost for GE but it has more to offer than that. It is indeed a smart move, and it will drive the GE stock in the coming years. Here's Why. \nGE's oil and gas segment revenues have dropped 42.6% from $5,162 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to $2,964 million in the third quarter of 2016. Moreover, the segment profits have fallen 60% over the same period from $881 million in Q4 2014 to $353 million in Q3 2016. \nSource: Company reports \nOn October 31, General Electric announced that it has entered into an agreement to combine its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes. \nIn the announcement GE explained: \n\"The New Baker Hughes will be a leading equipment, technology and services provider in the oil and gas industry with $32 billion of combined revenue and operations in more than 120 countries. By drawing from GE technology expertise and Baker Hughes capabilities in oilfield services, the new company will provide best-in-class physical and digital technology solutions for customer productivity.\" \nThe merger represents a considerable cost for GE as, under the agreement, it will contribute $7.4 billion to fund the $17.50 per share special dividend to existing Baker Hughes shareholders to own 62.5% of the new company. As such, investors might worry that GE is paying too much for the deal. However, in my view, combining with Baker Hughes to create the new mega oilfield services company is a smart move by GE. After all, oil prices will recover sooner or later, and the new Baker Hughes company will have technical innovation and service execution of GE allowing it to prosper when oil prices start to climb. \nThe new Baker Hughes will be the world's largest Oil & Gas Equipment & Services company by sales with revenue of about $32 billion, higher than the present largest oilfield services company Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) which had revenue of about $30 billion in the last four quarters. Moreover, the combined company is expected to realize synergies of $1.6 billion by 2020, and according to GE, the transaction is projected to add about $0.04 to its earnings per share in 2018, and $0.08 by 2020. \nAlso Read : Is General Electric Company (GE) Stock A Buy Now ? Latest Quarter Results \nOn October 21, General Electric reported its third quarter 2016 financial results, which beat earnings per share expectations by $0.02 (6.7%). GE's revenues of $29.3 billion for the quarter were slightly below the consensus estimate of $29.7 billion. The company showed significant earnings per share surprise in all its last five quarters, as shown in the table below. \nIn the report, GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt said: \n\"Our strength as a diverse, Digital Industrial company continues to enable us to deliver in a slow growth, volatile environment. This quarter, our teams earned $0.32 of earnings per share with strong performance in Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, and Healthcare.\" \nThe company achieved an impressive growth in the third quarter in orders and backlog. Orders increased by 16% compared to the same quarter a year ago to $26.9 billion, of which 6% were organic, and 10% were due to the Alstom acquisition. The company's backlog grew 18% YoY to $319 billion, of which 6% were organic, and 12% were due to the Alstom acquisition. \n\nSource: GE Q3 2016 EARNINGS General Electric Stock Performance \nThe GE stock has underperformed the market in the last few years. Year to date, the GE stock is down 5.91% while the S&P 500 index has gained 4.28%, and the NASDAQ Composite Index increased by 3.17%. Since the beginning of 2012, GE stock price has grown only 63.65%. In this period, the S&P 500 Index has increased 69.49%, and the NASDAQ Composite Index has risen 98.31%. According to TipRanks , the average target price of the top analysts is at $35, representing an upside of 20% from its November 7 close price of $29.31, which appears reasonable, in my opinion. \nAlso Read: Why GE Stock Investors Should Watch Q3 Earnings Closely: General Electric Company Valuation \nAccording to its valuation metrics, GE stock is not cheap. However, considering its estimated high EPS growth rate for the next five years of 12.1%, GE's stock is attractive, in my opinion. The trailing P/E is at 25.27, and the forward P/E is at 17.55. The price to sales ratio is at 2.13, and the price to book value is at 3.19. Furthermore, the price to cash flow ratio is at 17.05, the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is at 23.18, and the PEG ratio is at 1.57. Dividend and Share Repurchase \nInvestors in GE stock can also enjoy the generous dividend currently yielding 3.23%. The payout ratio is at 109.52%, and the annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was high at 9.5%, and over the past five years it was very high at 14.9%. \nGE had cut its dividend payment in the years 2009, 2010, as a result, of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, but had started to increase its dividend payment again in 2011. GE said that it plans to maintain its dividend at the current level in 2016 and grow it after that. GE's board has authorized a repurchase program of up to $50 billion in common stock. The company is targeting to return $32 billion to shareholders between 2016 and 2018 through stock buybacks and increasing dividend payments. GE expects to reduce its share count by 8.0-8.5 billion by 2018. \nConclusion \nAs I see it, combining with Baker Hughes to create the new mega oilfield services company is a smart move by GE. After all, oil prices will recover sooner or later, and the new Baker Hughes company will have the technical innovation and service execution of GE allowing it to prosper when oil prices start to climb. GE's stock is not cheap, but it is not expensive either, and its average annual estimated EPS growth for the next five years is high. Moreover, GE generates strong cash flow and returns substantial capital to its shareholders through stock buyback and increasing dividend payments. The average target price of the top analysts is at $35, representing an upside of about 20% from its November 7 close price of $29.31, which appears reasonable, in my opinion. \nAlso see: The latest top technology stock picks and top auto stock picks from Amigobulls Show Full Article",

Safety is our top priority,\" he said.\nGE on Friday said all but one of the parts related to the anomalous disk were out of service.\nThe American Airlines flight from Chicago to Miami aborted takeoff following an \"uncontained\" engine failure, a rare event in which components spew from an engine and can tear through an aircraft cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. The airline was flying a Boeing Co 767 aircraft with CF6-80C2 engines made by GE.\nIn this instance, the failure caused a fuel leak that resulted in a fire, though no one aboard was seriously injured.\nGE has stressed the reliability of its CF6 engines, which it said had flown more than 400 million hours since the 1970s.",

      "text": "CEOs Express Caution Despite Q3 Earnings Growth (GE, PG, UNP) By Matthew Johnston | November 8, 2016 — 1:40 PM EST \nThe third-quarter earnings season offered a semblance of comfort to investors as corporate profits rose after five consecutive quarters of declines. Many investors had expected a sixth quarterly drop. Yet CEOs remain cautious as they see rising labor costs, falling margins and inflation muting further profit gains in 4Q and 2017. Nearly nine-tenths of major U.S. companies have reported. Rising Wages, Falling Margins \n\"The negative tone of forward-looking management commentary has weighed on consensus EPS estimates,\" Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in its US Weekly Kickstart report. Goldman said that downbeat outlooks by bellwether companies such as General Electric Co. ( GE ), Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT ) and Honeywell Inc. ( HON ) have led analysts to cut forecasts. \nA diverse group of companies is reporting rising labor costs and falling margins including McDonald's Corp. (MCD), Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), Equity Residential (EQR) and Union Pacific Corp. (UNP). Trimmed Forecasts \nSo while forecasts for future growth are generally optimistic, Goldman Sachs has cut its consensus earnings estimates for the S&P 500 by about 1.5% since the reporting season began for 4Q and 2017. \nAccording to data from FactSet as of November 4, 85% of companies in the S&P 500 have already filed their earnings reports for the third quarter. So far, 71% of these companies are reporting earnings per share ( EPS ) above estimates, which is more than the five-year average of 67%. In total, reports indicate that companies are earning 6.6% on average above estimates, which is also above the 5-year average (4.4%). Q3 Earnings Progress \nThe blended earnings growth rate, which combines the actual results from companies that have already filed reports with the estimates of those companies that have not yet filed, is 2.7% for the third quarter. If one excludes the energy sector, this blended growth rate for the S&P 500 would be 6.0%. (To read more, see: Q3 Earnings: Oil and Real Estate Down ). Energy Weighs Down Results \nThe energy sector is currently showing a 63.2% decline in earnings. The only other two sectors showing declines are telecom services (-1.6%) and industrials (-2.4%). Sectors showing growth are real estate (34.9%), utilities (13.9%), financials (8.3%), information technology (7.4%), materials (6.4%), consumer discretionary. (5.9%), health care (5.8%), and consumer staples (5.1%). \nNot only is this blended rate of 2.7% above the expected 2.2% decline in earnings growth that was estimated at the end of the third quarter on September 30, but it will also mark the first time the index has reported year-over-year growth in earnings since the 0.5% growth witnessed in Q1 2015. \nAs earnings rise, some analysts are forecasting an even stronger fourth quarter and an exceptionally strong 2017. According to FactSet, analysts estimate earnings growth to be 3.9% for Q4 2016 and 11.6% in 2017. (To read more, see: Strategies For Quarterly Earnings Season ). \nUnless the aging economic expansion starts to pick up pace, those estimates are likely to come down sharply.

      "text": "General Electric: From Imagination to Transformation at Work PART 2 OF 4 How Has GE’s Sale of Its Financial Assets Progressed So Far? By Samuel Prince | Nov 8, 2016 11:16 am EST GE’s sale of financial assets \nGeneral Electric ( GE ) has focused on its core industrial strengths, moving away from the GE Capital Corporation (or GECC) business as a major step toward transformation. The industrial conglomerate has been downsizing GECC by selling assets and portfolios to third parties such as Wells Fargo ( WFC ). \nGeneral Electric intends to sell its GE Water business in mid-2017. The proceeds will help fund the integration and restructuring of the BHI deal. You can dive into GE’s 3Q16 results by reading Market Realist’s GE Lowers Its 2016 Guidance as Orders Fall on Weak Oil and Gas .

      "text": "General Electric: From Imagination to Transformation at Work PART: General Electric: From Imagination to Transformation at Work PART 1 OF 4 GE Shakes Hands with Baker Hughes for Oil and Gas Unit By Samuel Prince | Nov 8, 2016 11:16 am EST GE and Baker Hughes \nOn October 31, 2016, General Electric ( GE ), an industrial conglomerate, announced that it will merge its Oil and Gas unit with Baker Hughes ( BHI ), an upstream oilfield services company. The new entity will have a portfolio of expertise covering oilfield services, technology, and equipment manufacturing. \nGE jumped in the fray after BHI’s proposed $28.0 billion deal with Halliburton ( HAL ), another big oil player, was scrapped in May 2016. Notably, the combination of the GE Oil and Gas unit and Baker Hughes should have higher revenues than HAL. The deal structure \nIn the partnership, to be called “Baker Hughes, a GE company,” GE will own 62.5% of the combined entity while Baker Hughes will retain 37.5%. According to the deal, current BHI shareholders will also receive $17.50 per share as a special dividend. GE will contribute $7.4 billion to finance the cash dividend to the BHI shareholders. \nThe advanced digital technology industrial giant expects the deal to close in mid-2017. The company believes the transaction could add $0.40 to GE’s EPS (earnings per share) in 2018 and expects its EPS to reach $0.08 in 2020. The deal rationale \nWith Baker Hughes, GE should get much of the upstream focus on the oilfield services. Plus, BHI believes that it can effectively compete with the top global oilfield services provider, Schlumberger. \nThe GE Store is a network of nine technology centers where scientists and engineers drive technology for GE’s business. By using the GE Store, the company plans to install its own manufacturing excellence into BHI’s manufacturing footprints. \nFor more details on the GE–BHI deal, please read Market Realist’s GE to Partner with BHI? The Changing Oilfield Services Landscape . \nGE makes up 10% of the iShares US Industrials ETF ( IYJ ). Among its peers, 3M ( MMM ) and Honeywell International ( HON ) also form 3.9% and 3.2%, respectively, of the portfolio holdings of IYJ. \nThis deal is seen as a major step by General Electric toward its transformation drive started in 2014. In this short series, we’ll explore GE’s transformation.

      "text": "Baker Hughes Deal Might Help GE’s CEO Actually Earn His Awards Anders Melin Share View photos Jeffrey Immelt, chairman and chief executive officer of General Electric Co. (GE), speaks at the 2016 IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston, Texas, U.S., on Monday, Feb. 22, 2016. CERAWeek, in its 35th year, will provide new insights and critically-important dialogue with energy industry leaders, experts, government officials and policymakers, and leaders from the technology, financial and industrial communities. Photographer: Matthew Busch/Bloomberg *** Local Caption *** Jeffrey Immelt More General Electric Co. is on a years-long quest to refocus on industrial-equipment manufacturing while shedding its financial operations -- a move that hasn’t been kind to Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt’s wallet. Immelt, 60, received 600,000 stock options as part of his equity compensation for 2016, according to a regulatory filing issued Monday by Boston-based GE. He can exercise those options by 2021 and reap gains if GE’s stock rises above the $28.28 strike price. That would help soften the blow from the 2.43 million shares and options he’s had to forfeit over the past five years after failing to meet goals. More from Bloomberg.com: Here's Your Cheat Sheet for How Markets Will React to the Election The CEO has lost out on at least 425,000 shares tied to targets for cash flow and total stock return versus the S&P 500 Index that weren’t achieved during the five-year performance periods, filings show. A special grant of 2 million options was canceled for similar reasons, causing Immelt to lose out on a potential $19.1 million windfall when they vested in full in March 2015. Options granted in 2015 are currently underwater. GE’s deal with Baker Hughes Inc. could help turn the tables for Immelt. His past awards have largely been tied to cash flow and total shareholder return -- measurements that might get a boost from the $1.6 billion in revenue and cost benefits GE expects to receive. The company also anticipates the merger will add 4 cents to 2018 per-share earnings, nudging it closer to a stated goal of $2.00 for that fiscal year. The merger-benefit projections are based on oil prices rising to $60 a barrel in coming years, which might be “overly conservative,” Barclays Plc analyst Scott Davis said last week in a note to clients. More from Bloomberg.com: China Unveils Three Major Decisions Within Three Minutes The combined entity, of which GE will own 62.5 percent, will have $24 billion in sales in 2017 according to estimates, making it the world’s second-biggest oil services and equipment company. GE’s shares have slumped 5.9 percent this year through Monday after rallying 23 percent in 2015. Immelt has plenty of financial interest in the success of the merger. Unlike many other executives who have trading plans that periodically sell some of the stock they receive from equity awards, the CEO hasn’t sold a single share since he became company chief in 2001. In the past decade, he’s also purchased more than 850,000 GE shares for a combined $24.9 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Their aggregate value has barely grown, reaching $25 million as of Monday’s close. Still, Immelt hasn’t worked for free. His salary, bonuses, payouts of cash-settled performance awards and values of certain benefits over the past five full fiscal years total $69.3 million. A GE spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the company’s regulatory filings. More from Bloomberg.com",

      "text": "Prime Minister, the Most Hon. Andrew Holness, joined with German and local investors in ushering a new industry into the local economy with the launch of German Ship Repair Jamaica (GSRJ) Limited on Thursday (November 3).\nMr. Holness said the Jamaican-German company, which started operations last week, aligns with the Government’s vision of making Jamaica a logistics-centred economy, and expressed a commitment to accelerate the achievement of that goal.\nHe pledged support for the entity, which has established a relationship with the Caribbean Maritime Institute (CMI), to provide personnel trained in ship-repair services.\n“We support business and I am here to say to our German partners that we want more of your business. The Government stands prepared to create the environment that your business can flourish to employ more Jamaicans, that you can make a profit, and that Jamaica can benefit and develop from that,” the Prime Minister said.\nHe was speaking at the launch reception held aboard the expedition yacht Hanse Explorer, at the Jamaica Defence Force (JDF) Coast Guard Marina in Port Royal.\nMinister without Portfolio in the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation, Hon. Daryl Vaz, said the launch of the company is a “glorious occasion” for the Government, as it demonstrates the rationale behind the Prime Minister’s decision to create a Growth Ministry.\nHe noted that the conglomeration of all the relevant agencies and departments under the one Ministry facilitated the fast-tracking of processes that enabled the start-up of the ship-repair company. This, he noted, is in line with the Government’s push for the public sector to be efficient in its support of private-sector investment.\n“This is what we are about. A maritime hub has to be an important ingredient of our economic growth agenda and, therefore, this is a perfect fit at the perfect time. I congratulate you and your partners and thank you for your confidence in Jamaica,” Mr. Vaz said.\nGRSJ Limited is owned by H&P Caribbean Maritime Services Ltd., Jamaica Dry Dock Ltd., and German technical shipping supplier Kloska Technik GmbH.\nThe company started operations with wet repairs services, which involves working on vessels while they are afloat. This will continue over the next year, while the company awaits permission for the development of a dockyard at Kingston Harbour.\nThe dockyard is expected to accommodate local coastal patrol vessels, Government-operated and commercial craft, as well as international vessels calling or passing Jamaica that require repair services.\nOver the past years, the Port of Kingston has had more than 2,000 calls per year by 400 vessels, which are frequently in need of repairs or servicing to meet standards for international certification.\nOther speakers at the reception were Minister of Transport and Mining, Hon. Mike Henry; JDF Coast Guard Commanding Officer, Antonette Wemyss-Gorman; Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany in Jamaica and The Bahamas, His Excellency Joachin Schmillen; and Director of GSRJ Ltd., Charles Johnston.\nSource: Jamaica Information Sevice",

      "text": "Tweet Published: 6:10   \nABUJA - Nigeria's upper house of parliament will investigate a railway concession the government wants to grant to U.S. firm General Electric over possible violations by Nigerian officials, lawmakers said on Tuesday. \nThe lower house had already launched a similar inquiry last month into talks between the government and GE on a railway concession deal worth around $2 billion. \nNigeria has been looking for partners to overhaul its ageing railway system, which was built mainly by British colonial rulers before independence in 1960. \nThe Senate wants to investigate whether the government had violated rules by opening talks with the U.S. firm without consulting parliament or other state bodies, lawmakers said. \n\"The Ministry of Transport has violated the provisions of the Public Enterprises Act, 1999 by unilaterally engaging the General Electric for the concessioning the of the Western (Lagos-Kano) and Eastern (Port Harcourt-Maiduguri) rail lines,\" a motion approved by Senators said. \nIt refers to two north-south rail lines the government wants GE to rebuild. The lawmakers did not make any allegations of wrongdoing against the firm. \nThe government said last month more talks were needed with GE on the possible concession. \nNigeria, suffering from a slump in crude exports, wants to boost exports of non-oil products but lacks roads or functioning railways. \nIt has already signed two deals worth around $5 billion with China Civil Engineering Construction Corp (CCECC), part of China's state-owned railway construction firm, to modernize several railway lines, the Nigerian Transport Ministry has said.

      "text": "General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) reduced its full-year 2016 revenue outlook. Does that mean investors should sell the stock? The reduction, which the company announced while providing third-quarter results on Oct 21, has since been overshadowed by the announcement of an agreement to merge its oil & gas operations with Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE: BHI) . However,the two actions should be thought about jointly when considering what you should do with the stock. Here's what you need to know: \nGoing back to the second-quarter results, CEO Jeff Immelt maintained the existing forecast for organic growth of 2% to 4% in 2016 but guided investors toward \"the bottom end of the range\" -- a downgrade in all but name. \nFast forward to the third-quarter and Immelt now expects 0% to 2%. In the context of the original forecast, you could take a glass-half-full approach and see this as a reduction of possibly low 2% to high 1%, or a glass-half-empty approach and see it as a reduction from 4% to 0%. \nContinue reading ",

      "text": "Nigeria's upper house to investigate potential rail deal with GE Updated: November 8, 2016 — 3:32 PM EST Share Close icon Reuters \nABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's upper house of parliament will investigate a railway concession the government wants to grant to U.S. firm General Electric over possible violations by Nigerian officials, lawmakers said on Tuesday. \nThe lower house had already launched a similar inquiry last month into talks between the government and GE on a railway concession deal worth around $2 billion. \nNigeria has been looking for partners to overhaul its ageing railway system, which was built mainly by British colonial rulers before independence in 1960. \nThe Senate wants to investigate whether the government had violated rules by opening talks with the U.S. firm without consulting parliament or other state bodies, lawmakers said. \n\"The Ministry of Transport has violated the provisions of the Public Enterprises Act, 1999 by unilaterally engaging the General Electric for the concessioning the of the Western (Lagos-Kano) and Eastern (Port Harcourt-Maiduguri) rail lines,\" a motion approved by Senators said. \nIt refers to two north-south rail lines the government wants GE to rebuild. The lawmakers did not make any allegations of wrongdoing against the firm. \nThe government said last month more talks were needed with GE on the possible concession. \nNigeria, suffering from a slump in crude exports, wants to boost exports of non-oil products but lacks roads or functioning railways. \nIt has already signed two deals worth around $5 billion with China Civil Engineering Construction Corp (CCECC), part of China's state-owned railway construction firm, to modernize several railway lines, the Nigerian Transport Ministry has said. \n(Reporting by Camillus Eboh; Writing by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Ruth Pitchford) More Coverage ",

      "text": "Senate probes Amaechi over rails concession to GE November 9, 2016 Transport Minister, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi Leke Baiyewu and Ife Ogunfuwa The Senate on Tuesday began a probe into the concession of the eastern and western rail lines to General Electric, a United States-based company, without following due process. The lawmakers made the move following a motion by Senator Bassey Albert (Akwa-Ibom North-East), entitled, ‘urgent need to investigate the granting of concession of the western (Lagos-Kano) and eastern (Port Harcourt-Maiduguri) rail lines to General Electric, a US company’. “The Senate is convinced that the Ministry of Transport has violated the provisions of the Public Enterprises (Privatisation and Commercialisation) Act, 1999 by unilaterally engaging the General Electric for the concession of the western (Lagos-Kano) and eastern (Port Harcourt-Maiduguri) rail lines as evident from the above facts,” Albert stated while moving the motion. He recalled that the Public Enterprises (Privatisation and Commercialisation) Act, 1999 established the National Council on Privatisation and the Bureau of Public Enterprises for the purpose of privatisation of public enterprises. He noted that the BPE and the Nigeria Infrastructure Advisory Facility, upon the approval of the NCP in April 2015, developed a road map for the concession of the Lagos-Kano and Port Harcourt-Maiduguri rail lines “despite the fact that the Nigerian Railway Corporation Act did not envisage a concession of the corporation until recently amended.” Meanwhile, members of the Nigeria Union of Railway Workers and the Senior Staff Association, Nigerian Railway Corporation branch staged a protest against the planned concession of the 3,505km narrow-guage railway track to General Electric without the payment of the workers’ entitlements.

      "text": "JG Business Associated Press GE’s move to merge with Baker Hughes will help CEO Jeffrey Immelt regain some of the awards he’s forfeited due to missed goals.  01 AM GE CEO out to recoup awards Baker Hughes deal could make up for forfeited options Anders Melin | Bloomberg \nGeneral Electric Co. is on a yearslong quest to refocus on industrial-equipment manufacturing while shedding its financial operations – a move that hasn’t been kind to Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt’s wallet. \nImmelt, 60, received 600,000 stock options as part of his equity compensation for 2016, according to a regulatory filing issued Monday by GE. He can exercise those options by 2021 and reap gains if GE’s stock rises above the $28.28 strike price. That would help soften the blow from the 2.43 million shares and options he’s had to forfeit over the past five years after failing to meet goals. \nThe CEO has lost out on at least 425,000 shares tied to targets for cash flow and total stock return versus the S&P 500 Index that weren’t achieved during the five-year performance periods, filings show. A special grant of 2 million options was canceled for similar reasons, causing Immelt to lose out on a potential $19.1 million windfall when they vested in full in March 2015. Options granted in 2015 are currently underwater. \nGE’s deal with Baker Hughes could help turn the tables for Immelt. His past awards have largely been tied to cash flow and total shareholder return – measurements that might get a boost from the $1.6 billion in revenue and cost benefits GE expects to receive. The company also anticipates the merger will add 4 cents to 2018 per-share earnings, nudging it closer to a stated goal of $2.00 for that fiscal year. \nThe merger-benefit projections are based on oil prices rising to $60 a barrel in coming years. \nThe combined entity, of which GE will own 62.5 percent, will have $24 billion in sales in 2017 according to estimates, making it the world’s second-biggest oil services and equipment company. GE’s shares have slumped 5.9 percent this year through Monday.",

      "title": "GE Races Ahead on 3D Printing",
      "text": "Will Carbon Fiber Find Widespread Use in the Automotive Industry? \nA decade later, service bureaus (led by Morris Technologies) and research groups began developing expertise in printing metals with mechanical properties that matched or exceeded those of conventional alloy production, opening the possibility of 3D printing structural parts that can be used on production aircraft. \nIn recent years, GE has led the way in adopting 3D printing. GE Aviation acquired Morris Technologies and its 3D expertise in 2012, denying further use of Morris’s technologies and know-how to GE’s competitors. Those competitors soon began initiatives to adapt. For example, within months of the acquisition, Pratt and Whitney funded an additive manufacturing research center at UConn. At the same time, many companies have been working with research centers like Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to develop 3D printing materials, printers, software, and quality control systems. \nNevertheless, locking up scarce expertise let GE continue to surge ahead. By early 2016, it became the first company to launch 3D-printed fuel-injection nozzles for its jet engines, as well as the first company to certify a third party (the South Korean Air Force) to 3D print critical fighter jet engine components. In September 2016, GE announced plans to acquire Arcam and SLM Solutions — companies that supply 3D metal printers, printable metals, and printed metal parts — for $1.4 billion. The company expects 3D printing to eventually touch half of all its products in some way. \n3D printing, however, is not just a production tool. It also has the potential to significantly change design and production processes, a deeper and slower shift that most manufacturers have barely begun. In November 2016, GE took a further step down that path when it and Local Motors jointly launched a crowdsourced innovation platform, Fuse . The Fuse model is to publicly post problems as challenges, potentially with cash prizes to encourage submissions, and then evaluate the results. It is part of Local Motors' new Forth Division, and may be joined by similar initiatives with other partners besides GE. \nAs of this publication, Fuse already has four posted projects related to GE's innovation needs in non-destructive testing. Fuse will also have 3D printing resources to produce prototypes and for small-batch manufacturing. One GE official claimed that the Fuse model can reduce product development time by 50% , but at this point it is unclear whether that degree of improvement will extend beyond a few chosen use cases. \nGE Aviation held a Fuse-like public contest in 2013 to solicit jet engine bracket designs; the winning design came from an engineer with no aviation experience. GE Appliances has also been working with Local Motors for over two years through the FirstBuild initiative to develop better ways to use 3D printing and open design approaches to improve the product design process. In that project's first year , it produced 7,500 design submissions, leading to three new appliances, one of which entered small-batch production via 3D printing. \nUltimately, Local Motors' more general Forth initiative could help competitors catch up to GE in terms of access to open design methods. However, GE's longstanding and ongoing lead in 3D printing in aerospace, appliances, and other markets means it is better positioned than its competitors to quickly and efficiently act on the rapid innovation results generated by crowdsourced Fuse projects. \nAs 3D printing continues to mature as a production tool, the conversation at the forefront of the field will be increasingly not about the tools themselves. Instead, it will be about what the tools mean for companies using them as the effects ripple through supply chains, logistics, and research and development and impacts companies' strategies, cultures, and openness.",

The reduction, which the company announced while providing third-quarter results on Oct 21, has since been overshadowed by the announcement of an agreement to mergeits oil & gas operations with Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE: BHI) . However,the two actions should be thought about jointly when considering what you should do with the stock. Here's what you need to know:\nGeneral Electric Company's outlook Going back to the second-quarter results, CEO Jeff Immelt maintained the existing forecast for organic growth of 2% to 4% in 2016 but guided investors toward \"the bottom end of the range\" -- a downgrade in all but name.\nFast forward to the third-quarter and Immelt now expects 0% to 2%. In the context of the original forecast, you could take a glass-half-full approach and see this as a reduction of possibly low 2% to high 1%, or a glass-half-empty approach and see it as a reduction from 4% to 0%.\nMore From Fool.com Motley Fool Founders Issue New Stock Buy Alert Forget GE!

      "title": "Why Industrial Internet Is a Major Step in GE’s Transformation",
      "text": "General Electric: From Imagination to Transformation at Work PART 4 OF 4 Why Industrial Internet Is a Major Step in GE’s Transformation By Samuel Prince | Nov 8, 2016 11:16 am EST GE’s Internet of Things \nIn the previous article, we noted General Electric’s ( GE ) logic behind moving its headquarters to Boston. Let’s discuss GE’s Internet of Things, which refers to common objects tied to the cloud via the Internet. GE developed the term “industrial Internet.” This is a major step toward GE’s transformation from a diversified company into a digital industrial technology company. \nThe industrial Internet refers to smart devices, smart systems, and smart decision-making. This technology helps to optimize the industrial process with the real-time application of big data generated by industrial equipment. \nThe industrial Internet of Things involves the sensors and devices fitted in industrial equipment that provide large quantities of data. The basic concept of the industrial Internet rests on the premise that the entire world can be connected through any device. Predix software \nGE is betting big on software-defined machines. Through its Industrial Internet software, Predix, GE aims to connect 200,000 machines through digitizing engineering, installed base, commercial, sourcing, and service functions. It also aims to grow its Predix platform to serve 20,000 developers and 50 partners. \nAccording to an estimate by General Electric, its Oil and Gas sector will benefit most with the application of the industrial Internet. With the application of the industrial Internet, the sector can see a 1% reduction in capital expenditure. \nWith 2016 as a starting point, the Oil and Gas sector can potentially realize $90.0 billion in savings over 15 years, according to GE’s estimates. The sector is followed by the Power sector, which has an estimated value of $66.0 billion in fuel savings over the next 15 years. ETF investment \nGE makes up 10% of the iShares US Industrials ETF ( IYJ ). Its peers 3M ( MMM ), Honeywell International ( HON ), and Boeing ( BA ) also form 3.9%, 3.2%, and 3.1% of the portfolio holdings of IYJ, respectively. \nInvestors interested in GE can read Market Realist’s General Electric Is Pivoting Back to Industrials—But Why? {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"IYJ\",\"MMM\",\"GE\",\"HON\",\"BA\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"iShares Dow Jones US Industrial (ETF)\",\"3M Co\",\"General Electric Company\",\"Honeywell International Inc.\",\"The Boeing Company\"]} X",

      "text": "November 9, 2016 Steam Turbine Retrofits Will Modernize the Plomin Coal-Fired Power Plant GE’s Power Services Showcasing Its Expanded Total Plant Solutions with Its New Fleet360* Services Platform Upgrades Will Help Improve Power Plant’s Heat Rate, Increase Output and Lower Costs \nBADEN, SWITZERLAND—November 9, 2016—GE’s Power Services (NYSE: GE) today announced it will modernize Hrvatska Elektroprivreda d.d.’s power plant in Plomin, Croatia, the only coal-fired power plant in the country. GE’s retrofits—the first of this kind executed in the country—will help improve the plant’s heat rate, increase its power output, lower its operational and maintenance costs and extend the operating life of the steam turbine. \n\n“ We chose GE to help us increase the efficiency and output of our assets, which will help the power plant to operate more efficiently and in a cost-effective manner, ” said Mihajlo Mirkovic, plant manager, Hrvatska Elektroprivreda d.d. “GE's retrofit will enable us to modernize the plant to increase performance with lower costs and additional environmental and emissions controls.” \n\nThe retrofit service is part of GE's new Fleet360* platform of total plant solutions to service GE and cross-fleet components for utility and industrial plant operators worldwide. GE will upgrade a D2Y252 A steam turbine with advanced 3-D blades. After the retrofit of the 210-megawatt steam turbines, the plant’s output will increase, and the efficiency will be improved by up to 3.6 percent by reducing specific heat consumption. \n\n“Coal is forecasted to remain the world’s second largest energy source through 2030 and an even more critical source of electricity in developing economies,” said Pascal Schweitzer, general manager, GE’s Power Services, Europe. “The ability of nations to meet the emissions goals set out in the Paris COP21 agreement, while meeting growing demands for electricity, will depend on the ability of fossil fuel-powered plants such as coal to deliver power more flexibly, responsively and more cleanly. With our broad portfolio, we are pleased to help our customers, like Hrvatska elektroprivreda d.d., improve the efficiency of their coal-fired plants while further lowering atmospheric emissions to meet the world’s strictest regulations.” \n\nThe power plant upgrade will include a major overhaul of the high-pressure and intermediate-pressure parts of the steam turbines with a replacement of capital parts. The retrofit of the low-pressure part of the steam turbine will feature the use of GE’s advanced 3-D blades, new rotor, blade carriers, inner casing and other spare parts. Additionally, the lifetime of the steam turbines will be extended for an approximate additional 200,000 operating hours. \n\nThe steam turbine retrofit is expected to start in May 2017, and the commissioning of the upgraded equipment is scheduled for July 2017. \n\nAbout GE \n\nGE (NYSE: GE) is the world’s Digital Industrial Company, transforming industry with software-defined machines and solutions that are connected, responsive and predictive.

      "text": "News Caterpillar Stock Soars On Trump Win On Hope For Coal; GE, Boeing Up Caterpillar shares jumped on Trump's victory as infrastructure, oil and gas and coal mining projects could jump start. (Caterpillar) Reprints \nCaterpillar ( CAT ) and other large industrial companies' shares jumped Wednesday on Donald Trump's victory as infrastructure, oil and gas and coal mining projects could jump start under the new president. Caterpillar shares soared 6.7% to 90.36 in the stock market today , jumping out of buy range and hitting its best levels since the end of 2014.\nTrump has said he would remove \"job-destroying\" regulations on coal and other energy sources in his first 100 days in office and would \"cancel\" the Paris climate pact. \nCaterpillar has been moving away from some coal services businesses but still has large coal mining equipment operations. It also produces construction equipment. \nGeneral Electric ( GE ) shares were up 1% to 29.72, moving above its 50-day line for the first time since the end of August. GE has been expanding its industrial core assets as it sheds its financial services. Last week General Electric agreed to merge its oil and gas operations with Baker Hughes ( BHI ). \nA Trump victory is expected to be bullish for U.S. shale E&P companies like Continental Resources ( CLR ) and boost domestic drilling. \nAerospace giant Boeing 's ( BA ) shares rose 2.4% to 145.55, still in buy range, as defense stocks rise . On the campaign trail, Trump said he would boost military spending to make sure older equipment is replaced and called for removing the sequester. \nRELATED:",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nWhen I applied for GE back in 2012 I was under 18, and thus had the minor passport only valid for 5 years. Well I just renewed my passport, and now that I am over 18 it is a normal adult passport valid for 10 years.\nAnyway, I know I can just update the passport online in my GOES account, but reading the requirements of online updating it says that it can't be a new document (not sure exactly what that means as its a new passport for anyone).\nSo anyone have any experience if I can just update the new passport info online and all will be fine with my first time adult passport or do I need to go in to a GE office at the airport?\n\nI'm traveling internationally next week so would prefer to have it all sorted so I can use GE when I arrive back into the country. \n\nThanks for any help!

      "text": "Markets Today 'Opportunities Are Unlimited' With Trump's Economic Plan, Former GE CEO Welch Says President-elect Donald Trump has a good plan for the U.S. economy, former General Electric (GE) CEO Jack Welch said. Natalie Walters Nov9,20163:42PMEST \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- President-elect Donald Trump has \"an awesome responsibility\" ahead of him after the Republican sweep of the House, Senate and White House last night, former General Electric ( GE ) CEO Jack Welch said on CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Wednesday afternoon. \n\"There is no one else to point the finger at. You've got to get a team together. You've got to keep the spirit we had in the last three speeches,\" Welch said. The three speeches are in reference to Trump's victory speech last night, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's speech of concession this morning and President Barack Obama's speech this afternoon. \nIf we can keep that spirit or \"glue\" together over time, which \"is not a high probability,\" then Trump's economic plan offers \"unlimited\" opportunities, Welch claimed. Most importantly, his plan will include lower taxes, job creation and decreased regulation. \n\"We have been stuck in a terrible, overregulated economy for eight years. I mean stuck, and business stinks. And the possibilities are unshackling it,\" he claimed. \nAn example of overregulation of banks in the U.S. can be seen at Citigroup (C), where 40,000 of the 280,000 employees are dealing with regulations full-time, Welch said. \"Imagine one in seven employees tied up, playing with bureaucrats across the table to be sure the Ts are crossed and the Is are dotted.\" \n(GE is held in Jim Cramer's charitable trust Action Alerts PLUS.

      "text": " President-elect Donald Trump has \"an awesome responsibility\" ahead of him after the Republican sweep of the House, Senate and White House last night, former General Electric ( GE ) CEO Jack Welch said on CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Wednesday afternoon.\n\"There is no one else to point the finger at. You've got to get a team together. You've got to keep the spirit we had in the last three speeches,\" Welch said. The three speeches are in reference to Trump's victory speech last night, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's speech of concession this morning and President Barack Obama's speech this afternoon.\nIf we can keep that spirit or \"glue\" together over time, which \"is not a high probability,\" then Trump's economic plan offers \"unlimited\" opportunities, Welch claimed. Most importantly, his plan will include lower taxes, job creation and decreased regulation.\n\"We have been stuck in a terrible, overregulated economy for eight years. I mean stuck, and business stinks. And the possibilities are unshackling it,\" he claimed.\nAn example of overregulation of banks in the U.S. can be seen at Citigroup (C), where 40,000 of the 280,000 employees are dealing with regulations full-time, Welch said. \"Imagine one in seven employees tied up, playing with bureaucrats across the table to be sure the Ts are crossed and the Is are dotted.\"\n(GE is held in Jim Cramer's charitable trust Action Alerts PLUS.

      "text": "Texans and GE team up with Houston Methodist to fund pilot project on concussion care Published on November 10, 2016 at 4:24 AM · No Comments \nThe Houston Texans and GE are collaborating with the Houston Methodist Concussion Center to fund a two-year pilot project to bring specialized concussion care via telemedicine to athletes in rural areas. \n\"Since the 2011 passing of Natasha's Law in Texas, the diagnosis and treatment of sports-related concussions in Texas' youth athletes has drastically improved,\" said Kenneth Podell, Ph.D., neuropsychologist and director of the Houston Methodist Concussion Center. \"Unfortunately, many athletes, especially those in rural areas, still do not receive the comprehensive care needed to ensure a safe return to school and sports.\" \nThis pilot project will make telemedicine concussion care available to student athletes at 19 rural school districts, including Deweyville, Warren, High Island, and Leggett. When a student athlete is pulled from a game or practice with a suspected concussion, a Houston Methodist athletic trainer will go to the school or training facility to administer a comprehensive concussion evaluation, including a neurologic and neuropsychological examination. Podell or another Houston Methodist Concussion Center physician will direct the examination via a HIPAA-compliant online video connection to provide a diagnosis and outline a treatment plan. Related Stories Fraunhofer FIT develops telemedicine portal for monitoring and advising type 2 diabetes patients \n\"Replacing an office visit with a telemedicine visit can allow the student-athlete begin the correct treatment plan sooner and safely return to school and sports faster,\" said Greg Grissom, Houston Texans Vice President, Corporate Development. \"Many student athletes in southeast Texas are two to three hours from a concussion specialist, so this telemedicine program gives Houston Methodist a chance to provide the same level of concussion care as our players receive. We're proud to work with great partners like Houston Methodist and GE and excited to see this project make an impact with student-athletes.\" \nIf successful, this pilot project can lead to a statewide program to give all athletes in Texas telemedicine access to concussion care experts at the Houston Methodist Concussion Center. \n\"GE is committed to concussion research and discovering ways we can use technology to better protect all athletes - from youths to professionals,\" said Scott Miller, US and Canada VP Imaging, GE Healthcare. \"This collaboration presented us with a new opportunity to help athletes through their treatment and recovery phases.\" \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate there are more than 3.8 million traumatic brain injuries each year, the majority of which go untreated.

      "text": "1 Lighting Control with Relays I am attempting to replace GE momentary rocker switches controlling my GE RR9 lighting relays with PCB relays controlled via my computer. The problem I have is that the new PCB relays I purchased work and control the GE lighting relays, but they are either NO or NC and cause the GE RR9 relays to hum continuously. The GE relays are momentary and require only a pulse from their original switches to latch in one position or the other. My new relays replacing the switches have continuous power to the GE RR9 relays. I am concerned that this will cause premature failure of the GE relays and the hum is annoying and I am sure the power consumption is much greater this way as well. Can anyone suggest a way to make the new NO/NC pcb relays I just purchased operate in a \"momentary\" or \"pulse\" state? Can I wire something in between both relays to accomplish this? Cutsheet for original GE RR9 relay I am trying to control is here:",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn There’s been a lot of debate about how much General Electric ( GE ) is actually paying to combine its oil & gas business with Baker Hughes ( BHI ), so Evercore ISI’s James West and team polled investors to find out what “price is right.” The results:\nAgence France-Presse/Getty Images The price is right; Market points to a $60-$65/sh New Baker Hughes fair value . According to General Electric estimates, Baker Hughes shareholders were compensated at a 37% premium (~$76/sh) to the implied ~$55 share price of Baker Hughes equity value. This valuation was largely driven by a combined General Electric/Baker Hughes equity value of $51.9B (incorporating a fair 2018 GEOG EBITDA multiple and PV of cost and revenue synergies) and the prescribed 37.5% Baker Hughes shareholder ownership of the “New Co” equity value. The market points to an elevated New Baker Hughes fair value following the deal, with 43% of total responses suggesting a Baker Hughes fair value of $60-$65/sh . There was a relatively even split among survey participants on each side of the $60-$65 band, with 6% of investors suggesting a fair value less than $55/sh, and 10% signaling a greater than $70/sh price. In terms of a Newco EV/EBITDA multiple, 78% of responders believe the new company should command a 9x-11x EBITDA valuation (43% 9x-10x and 35% 10x-11x). A small minority of investors postulated either <9x or >11x EV/EBITDA, which would suggest that combined company performance could lie outside of the blended 2018 multiple range. We believe Baker Hughes fair value is closer to $70 based on 10.5x 2018E EBITDA of $5.5 billion. We attribute the difference between GE’s valuation of $76 per share and BHI’s current share price to investors not giving the combined entity full NPV of $13.7B for synergies. A 10.5x multiple on synergies of $700 million equates to just $7.4 billion, slightly more than half of GE’s NPV.\nShares of Baker Hughes have risen 0.3% to $59.15 at 12:27 p.m. today, while General Electric has climbed 3.5% to $30.67.",

      "text": "GE is a company with a long history, with good times and bad. \nGE pays a nice dividend even if it is frozen for now. \nIts a good buy at $27. General Electric (NYSE: GE ) offers products and services range from aircraft engines, power generation, oil and gas production equipment, and household appliances to medical imaging, business and consumer financing and industrial products. It was incorporated in 1892 It has paid a dividend for many years, and has had several long streaks of raising that dividend every year. It ended up cutting its dividend during the financial crisis, because of problems at GE Capital in large part, and a few years ago froze the dividend again. Click to enlarge Years ago (saying exactly how many will make me feel for too old), GE had the slogan \"We bring good things to light.\" As a kid, my dad worked for GE. The first computer I ever say was at a GE facility in Chicago in 1967, where my dad worked. My high school and college years were spent in upstate new York, where GE had a very large presence, so many of my friends, their parents and even some of my relatives worked for GE. Looking at its position today, are there good things to bring to light? Is GE moving in a direction where it can provide its shareholders a growing dividend payment again? Are shares selling at a price where it's a good value and worth buying it before it starts to raise the dividend? Click to enlarge Earnings Report On October 21 st GE released its 3Q earnings report . Its EPS of $0.32 was in line with expectations. However revenue of $29.27 billion, even though it was 4.4% higher than a year ago, fell short of expectations by $370 million. In its press release about earnings, GE highlighted such good news as an 18% YoY increase in backlog, and a 21% increase in continuing operations EPS. GE also touted its 16% YoY increase in sales for the quarter. The press release also shows details of the GE Capital Exit Plan, and that getting out of that business will remove a significant drag on ongoing operations. What does Morningstar say? Morningstar thinks the GE should be able to sustain a 5 year CGR growth rate on revenue of 4%. They also think that several initiatives have a high likelihood of improving margins, so even without the share buybacks that should lead to EPS growth at or above that range. In their report on GE they do show that TTM revenue, operating income, net income and diluted EPS are all better than they were for 2015. Morningstar also thinks that the installed base of products coupled with the product mix being in segments that are seeing increased capital spending gives them an edge over competitors and makes it hard for customers to replace them. They also think that GE is well placed to provide maintenance service to customers and well suited to help customers upgrade. From reading the premium report and the general complexity of integrating new features into complex systems, GE appears to be well positioned to get back to growth in the future. What's a good price? My thinking on what price to pay for GE is that I want to get it at a price that will represent a value once it begins growing its dividend again. So using DDM, I start with the current dividend. Since Morningstar thinks that GE should be able to sustain a revenue growth rate of 4% and will also be able to improve margins, I will use that as a reasonable yet conservative rate for dividend growth. As usual when I use DDM to estimate fair value, I will use 3% as the long term dividend growth rate (so that the dividend payment about keeps up with inflation) and will use twice the average long term inflation rate as my expected rate of return (which is also the discount rate). That gives me a fair value number of $29.16. While I think GE is a good solid company and is a very good long term holding, at this time there is enough uncertainty in when it will resume growing the dividend that I want a 10% discount to fair value, but also keeping in mind that the 52-week low is $27, my price target is $27 Given that the current yield is 3.1% but the average yield over the last 5 years is 3.25%, GE is currently over-valued. Given the risk that it might not have turned to corner yet, and the fact that management has yet to make a commitment on a date when dividend growth will resume, I think a significant discount to fair value is warranted. With the numbers GE is showing, some could argue that an even larger discount is required, but I think $27 is a good place to buy (although I wouldn't object to more of course). Can options help? Click to enlarge With the market price being around $30 and my target price of $27, its likely to be a while before GE hits that price range. So looking at the February 17 th expiration date, the put contract with a strike price of $27 gives a premium of $0.29. It has only a 14% chance of getting you the shares, but with a limit order you should be able to get a reasonable payment to wait. The $28 strike contract would pay a bit more with a low chance of exercise. Click to enlarge The call contracts are all pretty deep ITM, and so likely to lose you the shares with less than a $1 per share profit. That is a way to make money, but it won't get you the shares long term. Conclusion GE has had some tough times in the last few years going back to the financial crisis. They seem to be finally turning the company around. I think it has a good future. At the present time, other than by selling puts, it's still a bit too expensive to buy right. I have owned it in the past and want to own it again, but for now it will stay on my watch list. I think a price of $27 is about right, while I continue to monitor it to see that it stays on track in its turn around plan. Note: I hope you all got something out of this article.

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn There’s been a lot of debate about how much General Electric ( GE ) is actually paying to combine its oil & gas business with Baker Hughes ( BHI ), so Evercore ISI’s James West and team polled investors to find out what “price is right.” The results:\nAgence France-Presse/Getty Images The price is right; Market points to a $60-$65/sh New Baker Hughes fair value . According to General Electric estimates, Baker Hughes shareholders were compensated at a 37% premium (~$76/sh) to the implied ~$55 share price of Baker Hughes equity value. This valuation was largely driven by a combined General Electric/Baker Hughes equity value of $51.9B (incorporating a fair 2018 GEOG EBITDA multiple and PV of cost and revenue synergies) and the prescribed 37.5% Baker Hughes shareholder ownership of the “New Co” equity value. The market points to an elevated New Baker Hughes fair value following the deal, with 43% of total responses suggesting a Baker Hughes fair value of $60-$65/sh . There was a relatively even split among survey participants on each side of the $60-$65 band, with 6% of investors suggesting a fair value less than $55/sh, and 10% signaling a greater than $70/sh price. In terms of a Newco EV/EBITDA multiple, 78% of responders believe the new company should command a 9x-11x EBITDA valuation (43% 9x-10x and 35% 10x-11x). A small minority of investors postulated either <9x or >11x EV/EBITDA, which would suggest that combined company performance could lie outside of the blended 2018 multiple range. We believe Baker Hughes fair value is closer to $70 based on 10.5x 2018E EBITDA of $5.5 billion. We attribute the difference between GE’s valuation of $76 per share and BHI’s current share price to investors not giving the combined entity full NPV of $13.7B for synergies. A 10.5x multiple on synergies of $700 million equates to just $7.4 billion, slightly more than half of GE’s NPV.\nShares of Baker Hughes have risen 0.3% to $59.15 at 12:27 p.m. today, while General Electric has climbed 3.5% to $30.67.",

      "text": "GE Profile Series with Keurig (PYE22PMKES) \nAs appliance manufacturers work to differentiate themselves, one way they’re doing so is by including smarts. That can mean a full touchscreen or a simple app. GE is setting itself apart by including a Keurig K-Cup brewing system in some of its refrigerator models. The coffee maker is an interesting addition that could potentially save counter space in the kitchen – as long as you’re a fan of Keurig coffee. \nThe coffee maker works with one of GE’s more popular features, an integrated hot water dispenser. For some, the coffee maker might be a step too far, but immicks aside, the French-door fridge is spacious and does a solid job at keeping food at the proper temperature. Beyond basics with disco-lighting drawers \nThe 22.2-cubic-foot, French-door GE refrigerator is spacious at 69 7/8 by 35 ¾ by 31 ¼ inches (height, width, depth) and should easily accommodate large platters. On the left door panel is the water/ice dispenser and a spot where you can slide in the K-Cup brewer to make coffee. The pull-out freezer drawer has two sections that provides room for plenty of cold items – especially since it lacks an ice bin. (You’ll find that on the left fridge door.) The only design quibble we have is that it has an adjustable divider on each section, making it difficult to fit a large sheet ice cream cake. The fridge comes in either stainless steel or slate gray. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends \nSetting up the fridge is pretty straight forward. The fridge has two water lines to accommodate the hot and cold water, but you only need one water hookup. This means you’ll get filtered water that’s either hot or cold. Inside there are three adjustable shelves and multiple door shelves (some with anti-slip mats). Each shelf has a specific spot, so don’t try to push a shelf into place if it doesn’t fit. In case you need an extra shelf in a pinch, the butter compartment has a drop-down tray. \nThe coffee tastes just as you’d expect of Keurig brewers. \nLocated at the lower part of the fridge are three drawers: two for produce (select either fruits or vegetables on the drawer), and one full-width temperature-controlled drawer for larger items like serving platters and wine bottles. The bottom drawer has options for meat (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius), deli (36 degrees Fahrenheit or 2.22 degrees Celsius), and beverages (34 degrees Fahrenheit or 1.11 degrees Celsius). Select the type of food you want to store in the drawer and the temperature and lighting (meat is white, beverage is blue, and deli is green) will automatically adjust. When you open the door, the light in the bottom drawer illuminates based on its setting, which is kind of fun. \nIt’s fairly straightforward to adjust the overall temperature of the refrigerator using the controls on the front door panel. The panel on this model isn’t as sleek as those of other GE refrigerator models with the Keurig feature. It has a small digital display that streams messages about the fridge in a banner style. Also, on the front panel, you’ll find an option for a door alarm. No, a sound doesn’t emit when someone opens the fridge or freezer. It’s essentially a fail-safe feature that prevents you from using any of the controls on the display when the door is locked. It’s easy enough to set: Simply hold down the lock button for three seconds to activate or deactivate. Does it Really Make coffee? \nThe standout feature in this refrigerator is the inclusion of a Keurig K-Cup brewing system on the door. The coffee maker shares the same space with the water/ice dispenser. To make more room for coffee cups the base tray easily slides out. The tray can also be completely removed for cleaning. \nMore: This smart coffee maker can brew 3 different ways, and has a built-in scale \nIn order to make coffee, place a Keurig pod in the K-Cup brewer and slide it into place. Select the amount of coffee you’d like to make: six ounces, eight ounces, or ten ounces. Press the brew button and watch the 3, 2, 1 screen countdown. The noise level for brewing coffee is about 70 decibels, which is equivalent to the sound of a vacuum. When the coffee is finished brewing, it does make a louder sound that could jolt you awake if you’re not a morning person. The coffee tastes just as you’d expect of Keurig brewers, however, the 6-ounce coffee was a bit stronger due to it being more concentrated. Here are our test results: Temperature (Farhenheit)",

      "text": "\nEUR: GE CPI 0.8% vs. 0.8% \nNorth America USD: U of Michigan 10:00 \nThe pound soared in early European trade today, hitting a high of 1.2673 before finally succumbing to some profit taking by mid-morning London dealing. The move was partly driven by EUR/GBP flows which hit a multi-month low of 8566 before rebounding above the 8600 level. But the underlying strength in cable had more to do with the Trump trade than anything else. \nEver since Donald Trump's surprising win on Tuesday, cable has shown relative strength, holding up well against the buck while euro lost four big figures since Tuesday's highs. The flow into cable can be attributed to the stall of progress on Brexit as the case weaves its way through UK courts as well as the election of Mr. Trump. \nOne of the seminal threats against the UK economy as a result of Brexit was the promise by President Obama not to negotiate a bi-lateral trade deal. That policy will change completely under President Trump. Not only that, but Mr. Trump is very likely to force the EU to negotiate with UK on PM May's terms or threaten a cooling of trade ties between EU and US. In short, having Mr. Trump as President may have ameliorated some of the worst economic aspects of Brexit and the market is reacting to this development by relentlessly bidding cable. \nThe pair now approaching strong resistance levels at 1.2700 and may run into some profit taking in the near term, but the dynamics in the trade have changed and it has now become a strictly 'buy the dip' affair with 1.2500 now becoming strong support and 1.3000 the key long term target of the bulls.

A former female employee settled with the company over a workplace harassment suit she filed back in March. Terms of the settement were kept private. ... more GE worker settles harassment lawsuit 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nNISKAYUNA — A former machine shop worker at General Electric's Global Research Center in Niskayuna who sued the company claiming she was subjected to a hostile work environment by male workers quietly settled with the company last month. \nIt is unclear what the terms of the settlement are between GE and the former employee, Tami Knapp of Colonie. Knapp and her attorney had mediation talks with GE's attorneys back on Sept. 23 and reached an agreement after nearly eight hours of talks, according to federal court records. A judge overseeing the case signed off on the settlement on Oct. 19. \nKnapp sued GE back in March claiming that after she was hired as an inventory control specialist at the research center in 2013, she was under frequent attacks of intimidation by male workers. She also claimed that male workers in the machine shop area where she worked would openly watch pornography and tape lewd photos of women on equipment. \nShe also claimed in her suit that female researchers located in other parts of the research center campus were afraid of stepping foot into the machine shop area where parts were made for research tests of potentially new GE devices and inventions. \nGE always vehemently denied Knapp's accusations and said it did not tolerate sexual harassment in the workplace. \n\"We have zero tolerance for harassment and discrimination of any kind,\" GE spokesman Todd Alhart told the Times Union at the time. \"This is a matter that we thoroughly investigated and found the claims could not be substantiated.\" \nIra Lobel of Albany was the mediator in the settlement talks. Giovanna D'Orazio , Knapp's attorney, could not immediately be reached for comment. Today's Deals",

      "text": "[ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Jeffrey Dastin \n(Reuters) - FedEx Corp is grounding one of its planes temporarily that has an engine General Electric Co flagged after a passenger jet erupted in flames last month, a spokesman for the cargo airline told Reuters on Monday. \nEngine-maker GE on Friday alerted airlines about a small number of parts under investigation following American Airlines Flight 383, which caught fire on Oct. 28. The parts were made from the same lot of alloy as a turbine disk used by American, which GE subsequently discovered had a \"material anomaly.\" \nWhile U.S. investigators have yet to assign blame for the non-fatal incident, they have found what appeared to be fatigue cracking where the disk had an anomaly. Experts have said the disk's corrupted material may indicate a manufacturing defect, either by the parts or metal maker. \nIn a statement, FedEx spokesman Chris Allen said the company was notified that an engine in one MD11 aircraft was affected. \n\"The aircraft associated with the affected engine is temporarily not in service until the engine is replaced. Safety is our top priority,\" he said. \nGE on Friday said all but one of the parts related to the anomalous disk were out of service. The component on the now-grounded FedEx plane had been the one in operation, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said on Monday. \n\"The part has been taken out of service, not because it was viewed as defective but because it was simply from the same lot of material,\" Kennedy said in a statement. \nThe American Airlines flight from Chicago to Miami aborted takeoff following an \"uncontained\" engine failure, a rare event in which components spew from an engine and can tear through an aircraft cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. The airline was flying a Boeing Co 767 aircraft with CF6-80C2 engines made by GE. Continued... ",

      "text": "NIMS Announces $500,000 in Apprenticeship Grants, Support ‘Areas of Angst’ \nStarting about midnight on Tuesday, Karyn Twaronite, global diversity and inclusiveness officer at consulting and accounting firm EY, said she received hundreds of emails from employees “raising concerns, thoughts and observations” as well as “areas of angst.” \n“I’m actually hopeful, because there’s so much dialog. We’ve been able to have conversations about subjects people never talked about before, like racism and sexism,” Twaronite said, adding that about two-thirds of EY’s employees are Millennials. \nThere’s still cause for concern. Advocates of diversity see major changes in workplace regulations if Trump follows through with his pledge to rescind Barack Obama’s executive orders, which could include the ones below. And it’s still legal in 28 states to fire workers because they are gay. Amendments to Equal Employment Opportunity Executive Orders 11478 substituting “sexual orientation, gender identity” for “sexual orientation” and to 11246, substituting “sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin” for “sex, or national origin” Aug. 18, 2014 Establishing a coordinated government-wide initiative to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce. 2011 Creating the White House Council on Women and Girls: Includes assisting women-owned businesses to compete internationally and working to increase participation of women in the science, engineering and technology workforce. 2009 \nTrump will appoint his own attorney general and can name a new general counsel and chairman for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as well as change the leadership of the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB exerts broad influence over workplace issues, and the Department of Justice wrote key guidelines this year requiring the government to treat sexual orientation and gender identity as protected under the Civil Rights Act. \nDuring Obama’s two terms, the Justice Department and EEOC have taken the lead on discrimination cases involving religion, gender identity, sexual orientation and race--including high-profile diversity lawsuits against McDonald’s Corp., Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and AutoZone Inc. Aggressive Enforcement \n“The biggest effect will be in the agencies--the NLRB, DOL and EEOC--that have all been very aggressive in enforcing the laws,” said Cliff Palefsky, a civil-rights lawyer at McGuinn Hillsman & Palefsky in San Francisco. “I suspect we’re going to go back eight years, to when those agencies actually worked to undermine the laws. That’s unfortunate.” \nMatt Maloney, head of food-delivery company GrubHub Inc., generated controversy after the election with an email to employees decrying “the nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump” and said workers who don’t support a culture of inclusiveness should “reply to this email with your resignation because you have no place here.” In a statement posted Thursday on the company’s website, he clarified that GrubHub welcomes people of all political affiliations and the initial message was not meant as an attack on Trump voters. Move Past Rancor \nMany CEOs sidestepped specific comments on Trump and instead asked workers to try to move past the partisan rancor of the campaign. Starbucks Corp.’s Howard Schultz, who endorsed Clinton, told employees in a letter that “we have a choice in how we treat one another,” regardless of which candidate they supported. \nCompanies increasingly recognize the need for employees to reflect their customers, and recruiting more women, minorities and people of different sexual orientations can help them stay competitive and innovative. \n“It’s a business imperative,” said George Nichols, senior vice president of government affairs at New York Life Insurance Co. “Businesses that don’t invest in diversity efforts will increasingly be at a competitive disadvantage, regardless of the political landscape.” \nThe company held a town-hall meeting Thursday at which CEO Ted Mathas reiterated its commitment to a diverse workforce, Nichols said. \nTimothy Ryan, U.S. chairman at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, encouraged employees to talk about their feelings the day after the election. “We’re doubling down” on diversity, he said in an interview. Some 44 percent of the new partners PwC named this year were women or minorities, while 47 percent of its workforce is female and 33 percent are minorities, he added. More Innovation \n“We and other companies understand the importance of diversity and inclusiveness to get more innovation, better answers to problems and to reach more customers -- and that’s not going to change,” he said. \nTrump’s candidacy inflamed racial tensions as he demonized Mexicans as rapists and Muslims as terrorists while also expressing support for police practices such as “stop and frisk,” which some consider a form of racial profiling disproportionately targeting blacks and Hispanics. Trump also was criticized on gender grounds, particularly following the release of a recording in which he makes vulgar comments about groping women. \nCorporate boards have been unforgiving with some top officials who engaged in arguably less crude behavior that could paint the company in a bad light or put it at legal risk. \nWhile the tone from the campaign was “disturbing,” it may not stop the progress toward a more diverse workforce, said Natasha Lamb, director for equity research and shareholder engagement at Boston-based Arjuna Capital, who filed nine diversity-related shareholder resolutions at technology companies this year. \n“Investors are part of a greater groundswell that is emboldening corporations to plot a more diverse and successful future,” she said. Following the election, “our work on gender equity is more important now than ever.”",

      "text": "General Electric Company (GE) Stock Is an Overpriced Juggernaut GE stock remains a landmark company, but it's way too expensive By Lawrence Meyers , InvestorPlace Contributor | Nov 11, 2016, 12:22 pm EST View All Posts \nGeneral Electric Company (NYSE: GE ) is certainly a company that everyone has heard of, has a global brand name and remains a central part of American history. But does that mean you should buy, sell, hold or short GE stock? Let’s take a look. Source: Anthony Quintano via Flickr \nThere are many pros to owning GE stock. I think one of the biggest advantages is the sheer size and diversification of the company. It isn’t just selling light bulbs anymore! In fact, GE is operating in areas that surprised even me, and the depth to which it is entrenched in much of the world’s infrastructure is staggering. \nThe Power division generates power across all types of energy, from gas to nuclear. This division delivers about 20% margins and has a staggering $77 billion in backlog. GE also has a presence in renewable energy, with wind turbines, solar plants, geothermal plants and biomass power plants. Margins here are at about 7%, with $12 billion in backlog. Last year was huge for GE as it purchased Alstom, a massive $10 billion player in thermal and renewable energy. \nThere’s still more energy in GE, and it is oil and gas, with drilling and production systems, floating platforms, reactors and all the gear that comes along with this stuff. Margins are solid here, at about 12% with $23 billion in backlog. \nIts energy management division has only 3.6% margins. Margins are 7.7% in the appliances and lighting division, the most famous of its products. Not too many people know that it has a healthcare division, as well, mostly in imaging — MRIs, CT scans and the like. That division carries 16% margins and a $17 billion backlog. The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2017 \nOver in Aviation, it’s all about engines, and corresponding systems and services. Aviation is a high margin business with 22% yields and a whopping $151 billion backlog. Transportation focuses on railroad, marine, mining, stationary power and drilling industries. Somebody has to make those locomotives! Again, we have a high margin division (22%) with $22 billion in backlog. \nFinally, we have the capital division, which provides financial services to aviation, energy, and industrial businesses. GE is exiting the capital business by selling everything to its Synchrony Financial (NYSE: SYF ) spinoff.",

      "text": "GE's merger with BHI is nothing short of a magic trick. \nIt adds ignites for Oil & Gas, adds scale and improves margins. \nThis type of value-added dealmaking harkens back to the days of Jack Welch. \nThe slowing global economy will continue to stymie GE's Industrial segment though. Sell GE. \nClick to enlarge \nGE CEO Jeffrey Immelt \nIn a deal that shocked the financial markets General Electric (NYSE: GE ) announced it was merging its oil & gas operations with Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI ). The transaction left me speechless for both its brazenness and creativity, and harkens back to the days of former CEO Jack Welch. \nSource: GE Oil & Gas Overview: Supplemental Transaction Information, November 7, 2016 GE is contributing its oil & gas operations; Baker Hughes is contributing its company. GE will own 62.5% of Newco and Baker Hughes 37.5%. GE will transfer $7.4 billion of cash to the venture that Baker Hughes will use to fund a $17.50 special dividend to its shareholders. The transaction assumed the contributed value of BHI at $23.4 billion, GE at $28.5 billion and the present value of cost synergies at $13.7 billion. Newco is projected to have a combined value of $51.9 billion. BHI's 37.5% stake would be valued at $24.6 billion. Including the $7.4 billion dividend, BHI would receive value of $32 billion or a 37% premium to its market capitalization prior to the deal. \nThe transaction was a masterstroke for the following reasons: \nIt Adds Growth \nGE built its Oil & Gas operations by investing $14 billion in over 30 acquisitions. Several deals were perfected when oil prices were over $100. Now that oil prices have free fallen the Oil & Gas segment has been a laggard. Revenue from the unit fell 18% Y/Y in Q3, underperforming the company's core Industrial revenue which fell 7%. That followed a 22% decline in the previous quarter. \nBased upon the company's portfolio of businesses, that decline would likely worsen sans Baker Hughes. \nOil & Gas revenue peaked in 2014 when oil prices were above $100. Year-to-date Q3 2016 segment revenue of $9.5 billion was down 21% Y/Y. While short cycle businesses like land drilling were punished from the second half of 2014 to the first half of 2016, they rebounded in Q3 2016. Animal spirits returned to the North America oil patch and firms like Baker Hughes, Halliburton (NYSE: HAL ) and Weatherford (NYSE: WFT ) saw an uptick in revenue. \nThat said, GE's Surface Technology business was the worst-performer year-to-date. But is poised to benefit from the rebound in land-drilling. A major revenue source for the TurboMachinery segment is aftermarket sales; however, drillers are still using spare parts from unused rigs in order to save money. Despite the rebound in land drilling, services revenue remains in the doldrums; this will likely hurt Digital Solutions going forward. Lastly, experts predict offshore and deepwater will be the last segments of the oil & gas industry to rebound. I expect Subsea to be one of GE's worst performers over the next 18 to 24 months. \nNearly 30% of Baker Hughes' revenue is in North America -- the one segment experiencing a rebound. By merging with Baker Hughes, Oil & Gas can also benefit from that rebound. \nIt Adds Scale \nIn my opinion, Oil & Gas doesn't really have an identity. Subsea is one of the top providers of subsea equipment; however, the other segments seem like a hodge podge of businesses. Jack Welch was big on being number one or number two in each of GE's business segments. The Baker Hughes merger would make Newco the number two oil services company in the world, second only to Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB ). \nClick to enlarge Source: GE Presentation - Baker Hughes, A GE Company, October 31, 2016 \nNewco would be in the top three of several product categories and have a major footprint in others. This is important; scale and market positioning would potentially make Newco the \"go to\" company for several products. It could also provide Newco the necessary leverage to drive terms and pricing with clients. \nIt Increases Margins \nThe Q3 2016 segment profit margin for Oil & Gas of 9% was down from the 10% achieved in Q2 and the 12% achieved in the year earlier period. Declining revenue and declining margins make Oil & Gas an albatross around GE's neck; the profit margin for GE's total Industrial segment was 12% in Q3. The merger with Baker Hughes is not only expected to add scale, but generate cost synergies. Such synergies could bring margins for Oil & Gas up to par with other Industrial businesses. \nIn the second half of 2017 Newco is projected to have revenue of $14 billion and an EBITDA margin of 8%. Including $1.2 billion in expected cost synergies , margins are expected to improve to 23% in 2020 on $34 billion in revenue. Such margins which potentially rival the 23% margins Schlumberger achieved in Q3 2016. It would also potentially dig Oil & Gas out of its fog of declining revenue and declining profit margins. \nConclusion \nThe Baker Hughes merger ignites growth, increases scale and profit margins for Oil & Gas -- nothing short of a magic trick. That said, I remain bearish on GE; I believe a slow down in the global economy and future rate hikes will hurt the Industrial segment. Sell GE. Disclosure: I am/we are short HAL, SLB, WFT.

REUTERS/Jim Young The Seattle Times Nov 11, 2016 at 6:00 pm | Print View \nThe nearly catastrophic explosion of an engine that caused a fire on an American Airlines Boeing 767 just short of takeoff in Chicago on Oct. 28 occurred when a specific part that had never before failed broke into pieces. \nThe breakup of a heavy metal disk that rotates in the engine core reveals a new risk to airline passengers that, however rare, has already spurred a scramble by engine-maker General Electric and government safety agencies to find and fix the vulnerability. \n“The risk will be eliminated,” said John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member with more than 40 years’ experience in the aviation-safety industry. “Will it be eliminated before the next one? That’s the real question. Everything relies upon the timeliness of the system to correct itself.” \nAmerican Airlines Flight 383 to Miami was speeding down the runway at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago when the second-stage disk of the high-pressure turbine broke apart inside the right engine with a loud explosion that blew metal shrapnel out through the engine casing. \nHot metal ripped through the wing, igniting aviation fuel. Slamming on the brakes as the jet reached a speed of 154 miles per hour, the pilot brought the plane to a halt within 25 seconds and 900 yards further down the runway. \nMoving quickly, the cabin staff evacuated all 161 passengers and nine crew using the escape slides on the undamaged left side of the aircraft. Twenty people suffered minor injuries. \nGE spokesman Rick Kennedy stresses the reliability of the CF6 engine involved. The latest models, introduced in the 1980s, currently power about 4,000 widebody jets, including Boeing 767s, 747s and Airbus A330s, and have flown for more than 220 million hours. \n“The CF6 is the workhorse engine of jumbo jets on a level never experienced before,” Kennedy said. \nThe NTSB said one piece of the broken disk went through the right wing, then arced high over the airplane and came crashing through the roof of a UPS warehouse almost 1,000 yards away. \n“Any time a turbine disk fails, it’s a big deal,” said Goglia.

      "title": "From GE to Apple, fresh pledges for diversity in Trump era",
      "text": "From GE to Apple, fresh pledges for diversity in Trump era By Richard Clough,Jeff Green and Laura Colby, Bloomberg Published: November 12, 2016 9:35 AM CDT Updated: November 12, 2016 11:05 AM CDT 0 shares facebook twitter email comments × \nChief executive officers at some of the largest U.S. companies, from General Electric to Apple, are reassuring employees they support workplace diversity as a salve to anxieties caused by the bruising presidential election. \nJeffrey Immelt affirmed GE's commitment to \"people of all races, genders and sexual orientations\" in an internal blog post Wednesday musing on the election. That echoed Apple CEO Tim Cook's message to workers that the tech giant welcomes everyone, \"regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\" Oscar Munoz of United Continental Holdings said in a message to employees that they represent \"every creed and conviction, background and belief.\" \nDiversity issues have come to the fore as the presidential campaign exposed and deepened bitter divisions on matters such as the treatment of women and minorities; the rights of lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender workers; and gender disparities on the job. Following Donald Trump's surprise victory over Hillary Clinton this week, companies now are grappling with how to ease tensions and move forward. \nThousands of people in cities including Boston, Chicago, Seattle and New York have marched, shut down highways and burned effigies of Trump to protest the electoral shift to the right. \n'Areas of Angst' \nStarting about midnight on Tuesday, Karyn Twaronite, global diversity and inclusiveness officer at consulting and accounting firm EY, said she received hundreds of emails from employees \"raising concerns, thoughts and observations\" as well as \"areas of angst.\" \n\"I'm actually hopeful, because there's so much dialog. We've been able to have conversations about subjects people never talked about before, like racism and sexism,\" Twaronite said, adding that about two-thirds of EY's employees are millennials. \nThere's still cause for concern. Advocates of diversity see major changes in workplace regulations if Trump follows through with his pledge to rescind Barack Obama's executive orders, which could include the ones in the table below. And it's still legal in 28 states to fire workers because they are gay. DATEEXECUTIVE ORDERJuly 21, 2014Amendments to Equal Employment Opportunity Executive Orders 11478 substituting \"sexual orientation, gender identity\" for \"sexual orientation\" and to 11246, substituting \"sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin\" for \"sex, or national origin\"Aug. 18, 2011Establishing a coordinated government-wide initiative to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal workforceMar. 11, 2009Creating the White House Council on Women and Girls: Includes assisting women-owned businesses to compete internationally and working to increase participation of women in the science, engineering and technology workforce\nTrump will appoint his own attorney general and can name a new general counsel and chairman for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as well as change the leadership of the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board. The NLRB exerts broad influence over workplace issues, and the Department of Justice wrote key guidelines this year requiring the government to treat sexual orientation and gender identity as protected under the Civil Rights Act. \nDuring Obama's two terms, the Justice Department and EEOC have taken the lead on discrimination cases involving religion, gender identity, sexual orientation and race -- including high-profile diversity lawsuits against McDonald's Corp., Abercrombie & Fitch Co. and AutoZone Inc. \nAggressive Enforcement \n\"The biggest effect will be in the agencies -- the NLRB, DOL and EEOC -- that have all been very aggressive in enforcing the laws,\" said Cliff Palefsky, a civil-rights lawyer at McGuinn Hillsman & Palefsky in San Francisco. \"I suspect we're going to go back eight years, to when those agencies actually worked to undermine the laws. That's unfortunate.\" \nMatt Maloney, head of food-delivery company GrubHub Inc., generated controversy after the election with an email to employees decrying \"the nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics of Donald Trump\" and said workers who don't support a culture of inclusiveness should \"reply to this email with your resignation because you have no place here.\" In a statement posted Thursday on the company's website, he clarified that GrubHub welcomes people of all political affiliations and the initial message was not meant as an attack on Trump voters. \nMove Past Rancor \nMany CEOs sidestepped specific comments on Trump and instead asked workers to try to move past the partisan rancor of the campaign. Starbucks Corp.'s Howard Schultz, who endorsed Clinton, told employees in a letter that \"we have a choice in how we treat one another,\" regardless of which candidate they supported. \nCompanies increasingly recognize the need for employees to reflect their customers, and recruiting more women, minorities and people of different sexual orientations can help them stay competitive and innovative. \n\"It's a business imperative,\" said George Nichols, senior vice president of government affairs at New York Life Insurance Co. \"Businesses that don't invest in diversity efforts will increasingly be at a competitive disadvantage, regardless of the political landscape.\" \nThe company held a town-hall meeting Thursday at which CEO Ted Mathas reiterated its commitment to a diverse workforce, Nichols said. \nTimothy Ryan, U.S. chairman at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, encouraged employees to talk about their feelings the day after the election. \"We're doubling down\" on diversity, he said in an interview. Some 44 percent of the new partners PwC named this year were women or minorities, while 47 percent of its workforce is female and 33 percent are minorities, he added. \nMore Innovation \n\"We and other companies understand the importance of diversity and inclusiveness to get more innovation, better answers to problems and to reach more customers -- and that's not going to change,\" he said. \nTrump's candidacy inflamed racial tensions as he demonized Mexicans as rapists and Muslims as terrorists while also expressing support for police practices such as \"stop and frisk,\" which some consider a form of racial profiling disproportionately targeting blacks and Hispanics. Trump also was criticized on gender grounds, particularly following the release of a recording in which he makes vulgar comments about groping women. \nCorporate boards have been unforgiving with some top officials who engaged in arguably less crude behavior that could paint the company in a bad light or put it at legal risk. \nRead more: Sex, the C-Suite and Trump \nWhile the tone from the campaign was \"disturbing,\" it may not stop the progress toward a more diverse workforce, said Natasha Lamb, director for equity research and shareholder engagement at Boston-based Arjuna Capital, who filed nine diversity-related shareholder resolutions at technology companies this year. \n\"Investors are part of a greater groundswell that is emboldening corporations to plot a more diverse and successful future,\" she said. Following the election, \"our work on gender equity is more important now than ever.\" \n(Updates with GrubHub comment in 11th paragraph.) \n--With assistance from Carol Hymowitz To contact the reporters on this story: Richard Clough in New York at rclough9@bloomberg.net, Jeff Green in Southfield, Michigan at jgreen16@bloomberg.net, Laura Colby in New York at lcolby@bloomberg.net.
