      "text": "IBM begins beta testing to teach Watson more to combat cybercrime Share on Facebook Print By: Kevin Bissett The Canadian Press Published on FREDERICTON — Just seven months after IBM announced it would begin teaching its Watson computer system to fight cybercrime, the company is graduating Watson to the next level of instruction. Caleb Barlow, vice-president of IBM Security, says 40 organizations will begin beta testing of the cognitive technology. \"The learning process is going well. Part of this is getting it out there to several beta customers including the University of New Brunswick, California State Polytechnic, Sun Life Financial, University of Rochester Medical Centres and others,\" Barlow said in an interview. Watson — IBM's question answering computer system — was originally designed to compete (and win) on the television quiz show Jeopardy, but the technology has since been used on other problem-solving projects, from clothing design to cancer. Barlow says by teaching Watson to track reports, blogs and other information on emerging threats they'll be able to assist companies facing cyber attacks. \"It's not just about learning the language of security. We want it to learn the language of security in the context of real world environments and the context of a diverse set of industries,\" he said. \"The language of security in a health-care company like University of Rochester Medical Centre is probably going to be a little different than what we're going to see for example at an energy company.\" Ali Ghorbani, UNB's dean of computer science, said the beta testing will provide valuable experience for his students. \"They'll be amongst the very first ones to actually work with IBM to gain real world experience in this area,\" Ghorbani said. \"Our students will be teaching Watson and then testing and validating the training,\" he said. Barlow said cognitive technology will help security teams find and detect cyber threats, but it won't replace humans. \"The amount of structured data that is coming in is really astounding. On average now, a good sized security operation centre will see 200,000 pieces of data a day — security related incidents or events,\" he said. He said by 2020, there will be two million unfilled cybersecurity jobs. \"We have to be able to come up with tooling to allow you to augment your workforce. We can't solve this with people alone. We need to be able to mine and access these large data environments to be able to figure out what the priority tasks are to work on,\" Barlow said. For now, Watson won't take action against any cyber threat. Instead it will offer advice on what to do. Barlow said it's unclear how much beta testing Watson will need before it's ready to take on the job of combating cyber threats. He said it all depends on how fast Watson learns. \"We are in completely unchartered territory here. No one has ever done this before. No one has ever had a system of this level of sophistication or this level of scale. We are excited to see how long it takes,\" Barlow said. Editors' Picks ",

      "text": "last » \nAn IBM channel executive told solution providers Tuesday the tech giant differentiates its business with an innovative cloud platform that spans environments, and focuses on giving partners many options to bring to customers. \nIBM is often overshadowed in the news by rival cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft. That lack of attention sometimes distracts channel attention from the massive investments Big Blue is making in its cloud business, said Chris Rimer, vice president of North American business partners and channels, at the NexGen   in Anaheim, Calif.,   \n\"One of the most important differentiators between IBM and everyone else in this business is our acknowledgement from the very beginning that there isn't only one cloud,\" Rimer told NexGen attendees. \n[Related: Microsoft CSP Manager: Shift To Cloud Requires Shift In Sales Mentality Beyond Individual Deals ] \nIBM is unique in its ability to offer a cloud portfolio that includes on-premises implementations, self-managed cloud and full public cloud, Rimer said. \n\"We provide you as partners with the ability to go into a client and have that honest conversation,\" Rimer said. \nMany NexGen attendees currently with reseller practices are at an inflection point, trying to figure out what comes next in their businesses. \n\"One of the exciting things about this era is there is no one answer,\" Rimer said, but lots of exciting choices for the channel community. \nIBM has been transforming to a cognitive solutions company with a focus on acquiring data sources, such as the Weather Company, leveraging open source technology whenever possible, and entering innovative partnerships with companies like Box, Apple and VMware. \nWatson, IBM's cognitive computing platform, now offers 33 APIs on the Bluemix platform to be \"bought by clients and more importantly be resold by you,\" he said. Watson is being used to build conversational agents, sentiment analysis tools and media analysis tools to make recommendations based on images, video and audio. \n\"If you still like to resell products, we have lots for you to resell,\" Rimer added, and there are plenty of service offerings as well to package with those products.

      "text": "Loading... IBM’s Holiday Sales Report Shows the Rise of Thanksgiving Day Shopping IBM's holiday shopping report shows a lot of people are spending some of their Thanksgiving Day gift buying online or at stores to get a jump on Black Friday. Pre-Holiday Shopping Soared Pre-holiday shopping was up nearly 10 percent year over year compared to 2015, according to IBM’s data. The period is determined by tabulating how much people around the globe spent on gifts and other products for the holidays just ahead of Thanksgiving and the Thanksgiving weekend. Holiday Weekend Sales Soared Over the five-day period between Thanksgiving Day and Cyber Monday, global online sales rose 9 percent year over year. Over the four-day period between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, sales were up 19.5 percent compared to the same period last year. Thanksgiving was for Eating and Shopping Although Thanksgiving Day traditionally has been viewed as the day before people start shopping, things are changing, IBM says. Thanksgiving Day online sales in the United States were up 12 percent compared to 2015. Worldwide, online sales rose 24 percent year over year, as Thanksgiving Day shopping became “a global sensation.” Black Friday Remains an Important Day Black Friday might be one of the most popular shopping days of the year, and consumers are still spending cash. Online sales at retailers around the world were up 28 percent year over year. At U.S. retailers, Black Friday online sales rose 9.3 percent compared to 2015. Cyber Monday Was a Huge Day Cyber Monday is officially a “worldwide shopping event,” according to IBM. The company reported that Cyber Monday global online sales rose by 16.7 percent year over year. The data suggests customers worldwide—not just in the United States—are spending big money online on Cyber Monday. IBM Clients Sent a Record Number of Emails IBM says its retail clients combined to send nearly 500 million email notifications to consumers on Cyber Monday. The notifications, which can include confirmation of a purchase, for instance, hit an all-time high on Cyber Monday, according to IBM. Mobile Is Proving Important Mobile continues to play an integral role in the shopping experience during the holiday season. IBM says its retail clients’ use of mobile devices to target customers is soaring, up more than 47 percent year over year on Cyber Monday. That figure includes all mobile push notifications sent to consumers on Cyber Monday. IBM Projects Overall Online Sales IBM hasn’t yet put a dollar amount on how much the company expects consumers to spend during the holiday season spanning November and December. However, the company believes that overall online sales will increase by as much as 14 percent compared to the 2015 holiday shopping season. Understanding IBM’s Commerce Scale IBM has become a juggernaut in the commerce industry. According to the company’s latest data, which it shared with the Cyber Monday information, the company is now working with more than 17,000 companies operating in some way in the retail sector, including seven of the top 10 Fortune 500 companies. Its solutions span cloud and on-premises implementations. A Few Real-World Examples In addition to macro figures, IBM shared some individual data points. The company reported that one unidentified U.S. “retail giant” received more than 2 million orders on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday alone. Another unidentified U.S. retailer generated more than 260TB of data during the holiday shopping season. Yet another unidentified company operating in the home building and supply retail industry saw sales increase 44 percent during its peak period during the holiday shopping season.",

Should Investors Feel Good About IBM Shares? \nIBM performed well in the third quarter of 2016, which is reflected in the company's most recent earnings statement. \nSome of IBM's financial results in 3Q16 included: Technology services and cloud platforms revenue growth of 2.4 percent year to year. Cloud revenue growth of 74 percent from 3Q15. Solutions software revenue growth of 8 percent year to year. \n\"In the third quarter, we made progress across our business, with continued strong growth in our strategic imperatives, some moderation in the declines in our core businesses, remixing our skills and adding new capabilities through organic investments, acquisitions and partnerships,\" IBM Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said in a company statement. \nFurthermore, Schroeter pointed out in IBM's 3Q16 earnings call that his company has returned more than $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and shares repurchased over the first nine months of 2016. \nIBM \"is showing a lot of stability,\" Schroeter noted in a prepared statement last month. He also said IBM remains focused on \"applying deep industry skills and innovative technologies to change real business processes and outcomes\" — something that may help the company accelerate its revenue growth.

      "text": "View Photo \nIBM trumpets 'blockchain ecosystem' on Hyperledger \nIBM is trumpeting the debut of a \"blockchain ecosystem\" to support development on the Hyperledger Project's blockchain fabric. In addition, IBM has named a host of crypto-focused startups and also announced it will be hosting the first Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 Connect-a-Thon. \nBridget Van Kralingen, senior vice-president, IBM Industry Platforms, said: \"The future growth and adoption of blockchain is reliant upon building a strong ecosystem. Business networks will only reach critical mass when innovators, industry experts and infrastructure providers come together in new ways to reinvent how business transactions happen. \n\"The growing maturity of the Hyperledger Project code is a major milestone. That's why IBM is investing to help developers accelerate the creation of blockchain networks by providing an environment where these players can work together.\" \nThe blockchain ecosystem programme is designed for innovators looking to build real networks – venture capitalists, start-ups, systems integrators, independent software vendors and enterprise developers. \nIBM will provide education and tools to reduce the time required to go from idea to execution, it said. IBM blockchain experts will hold \"office hours\" via the Hyperledger Fabric Slack channel providing support to developers and help with troubleshooting. This is in addition to the courses and learning modules for business users and developers already available on developerWorks. These will be augmented with code libraries, smart contract templates and tools to speed the creation of blockchain apps. \nThese programmes are designed to support the Linux Foundation Hyperledger Fabric v1.0, which will provide a modular approach, much like the network-of-networks model of the internet. \nIBM Blockchain Ecosystem Participants \nThe IBM blockchain ecosystem is an open environment where organisations can collaborate on shared or complementary technical and business visions using the Hyperledger Fabric, and access education and development support. Many companies are already benefitting from the IBM Blockchain ecosystem. IBM named the following: \nCloudsoft is a software company providing multi-cloud application management with open source tools. Cloudsoft's Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) Service lets developers focus on creating chaincode applications and reduces time to value for enterprises investigating and working with blockchain technologies, such as financial institutions setting-up their own blockchain networks running across multiple geographies. \nEY , a global leader in assurance, tax, transaction and advisory services is also participating in the ecosystem. \nEverledger is a UK-based startup that is using IBM Blockchain to authenticate and trace the origin of high-value and luxury goods such as diamonds and wine. Using the IBM High Security Network, the company is able to trace and validate some of the world's most sought-after objects in a secure, tamper-resistant environment. \nGliding Eagle is a California-based company providing a cloud and mobile based technology system offering transparency and authenticity in tracking individual products from the producer to the end consumer, anywhere in the world. \nThe Hive is a VC with a portfolio that represents blockchain technology across financial services, compliance, cyber-security and the industrial internet. Operating in a high touch model with entrepreneurs, The Hive is actively participating in the IBM Blockchain ecosystem, both directly and through its portfolio companies. \nIntellectEU , an international fintegration company with experienced Blockchain (Hyperledger and Ethereum) development teams in Portugal and in Ukraine is another ecosystem member. IntellectEU is the founding member of the Linux Foundation Hyperledger Project and is offering specialised professional services, application development and integration services. \nLoyyal is reinventing how loyalty is created and rewarded. Using blockchain and smart contract technology, Loyyal has created interoperable loyalty and rewards infrastructure to address a highly fragmented industry, and offer multiple sectors an innovative way to incentivise customer behavior. \nMooti Blockchain Digital Identity provides advanced self-sovereign identity validation via blockchain technology using its new standard for cryptographic identification and validation. Mooti Digital Identity runs Identity Chains across any blockchain and provides enhanced data privacy and unique features such as time-based revocation and ring-signature anonymity. \nNetKi is a Los Angeles-based digital identity start-up that provides companies with a suite of standards-based solutions which allow them to build blockchain-based applications and services that are highly interoperable, easy to use, and compliant with existing industry and regulatory requirements surrounding identity proofing and authentication. \nSensify Security is a Palo Alto-based IoT security startup co-created at The Hive, which delivers decentralised information security services for industrial and commercial IoT operations with centralised control, policy management and compliance. Sensify Security builds higher resistance to cyber-weapons by enabling operators to enforce access control between users, applications, control systems and sensor devices in a decentralised manner within their operating environments. \nSkuchain is a Silicon Valley startup building a blockchain based platform for collaborative commerce called Brackets. Skuchain is demonstrating the potential of verifiable information on Hyperledger Fabric to eliminate supply friction in use cases ranging from trade finance, to working capital to item level authenticity. \nBlockchain Connect-A-Thon with Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 \nIBM will host a connect-a-thon on 17 December 2016, using the Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 to set up peers that will operate in a network of networks mode, providing security-rich, confidential transactions among known parties. \nRelated Articles",

      "title": "Will International Business Machines Corp. Raise Its Dividend in 2017?",
      "text": "Image source: IBM.\nIT giant International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) has paid investors uninterrupted quarterly dividends since 1916, and it has increased that dividend for 21 years in a row. The latest dividend hike, which was in April of this year, boosted the quarterly payment to $1.40 per share. That's an 8% increase compared to the prior payment.\nIBM has ramped up its dividend over the past decade, turning what was once a lackluster dividend stock into one of the best in the technology sector. The quarterly dividend has grown from just $0.30 per share in 2006, a nearly fivefold increase that, combined with a slumping stock price over the past few years, has pushed IBM's dividend yield up to around 3.5%.\nIBM Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts .\nWith IBM's dividend already more generous than many of its big tech peers, is another dividend increase coming next year? Almost certainly.\nPlenty of cash to go around Despite IBM's ongoing transformation, which has knocked down revenue and profit over the past few years, the company remains a cash flow machine. IBM expects to produce about $12 billion of free cash flow this year, the bulk of which will be returned to shareholders.\nThe current $1.40-per-share quarterly dividend costs IBM about $5.35 billion each year, or 44.6% of the company's expected free cash flow. It's important to note that this free cash flow number is depressed; when and if IBM returns to growth, free cash flow should start to recover as well.\nIBM has also been spending heavily on acquisitions. Through the first nine months of this year, IBM has spent $5.4 billion on acquisitions, more than six times as much as it spent during the same period last year. IBM has been building out its cloud capabilities with some of these purchases, adding companies like Ustream and Sanovi Technologies. Others represent big bets on specific areas. Truven Health Analytics and Promontory Financial Group further IBM's plan to push Watson, its cognitive computing system, into various industries with long-term growth potential.\nShare repurchases also eat up billions of dollars, but IBM has slowed the pace of buybacks in recent years. The company spent more than $10 billion on buybacks annually from 2011 through 2014, but it has since shifted its priorities. Reducing its share count by 2% to 3% each year is the new plan, representing between $3 billion and $4.5 billion of spending annually.\nI suspect that IBM's pace of acquisitions will slow down a bit in 2017, given how much the company has spent this year. And share buybacks can be shifted up and down at will. CFO Martin Schroeter had this to say during IBM's latest earnings conference call: \"We will absolutely continue to grow the dividend, and then to the extent that we have excess capital to return, we will return it. And over the long term, that number from a share repurchase would be a 2% to 3% reduction.\"\nGrowing the dividend comes first, which should be music to dividend investors' ears.\nWhen to expect a dividend raise IBM has been consistent with its annual dividend increases, keeping the same schedule for the past 15 years, even throughout the financial crisis. If that schedule holds, an announcement will come in late April or early May, with a record date around May 10 and a payable date around June 10. Investors will receive two more dividend payments before any increase, assuming nothing unexpected happens. The first will be paid on Dec. 10, and the second will be paid around March 10.\nThe size of next year's dividend increase is an open question. Given the fact that IBM's profits are still in decline, a double-digit increase may be too much to ask for. A mid- to high-single-digit increase seems like the most likely scenario; a new quarterly payment of $1.50 per share would be a nice even number.\nIBM will almost certainly raise its dividend next year, rewarding shareholders for sticking around as it works to transform itself into a cloud- and cognitive-computing powerhouse. The increase may be smaller than in in the past, but with a dividend yield already greater than that of many other large technology companies, investors should have little reason to complain.\n10 stocks we like better than IBM\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "Image source: IBM.\nIT giant International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) has paid investors uninterrupted quarterly dividends since 1916, and it has increased that dividend for 21 years in a row. The latest dividend hike, which was in April of this year, boosted the quarterly payment to $1.40 per share. That's an 8% increase compared to the prior payment.\nIBM has ramped up its dividend over the past decade, turning what was once a lackluster dividend stock into one of the best in the technology sector. The quarterly dividend has grown from just $0.30 per share in 2006, a nearly fivefold increase that, combined with a slumping stock price over the past few years, has pushed IBM's dividend yield up to around 3.5%.\n IBM Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YCharts .\nWith IBM's dividend already more generous than many of its big tech peers, is another dividend increase coming next year? Almost certainly.\n ",

      "text": "Do you remember the IBM TV commercial that ran in 2006, where the shady-looking character took items off a store shelf and stuck them in the pockets of his trench coat? He walks out of the store followed by a security officer who hands him the receipt for the groceries. \nAt that time IBM imagined building the technology on radio frequency identification. \"Checkout lines. Who needs them,\" said the voiceover . \"This is the future of ebusiness.\" \nFour years ago, Amazon picked up where IBM left off when the company's researchers began wondering \"what would shopping look like if you could walk into a store and just go,\" so consumers would never need to wait in line.\nWhile that may sound like nirvana, it's not about walking in and out of a grocery store using a phone and technology to purchase products without having to go through a checkout line.\nAnd it's not just any payment system. Amazon has created a payment method that combines traditional point-of-sale systems, online payment technology like PayPal, and mobile apps like Square. The technology can be used at gas stations, bookstores, clothing stores, and any other type of physical or online store that requires the consumer to trade currency for products or services. \nThis is not about automated checkout grocery stores, but rather data, advertising and a new payment system that finally integrates all transnational data. \nWhile Amazon has not said what they will do with the data, bits and bytes from transactions could become a targeting tool for advertisers looking to reach consumers in-store and through online purchases, in my opinion. From there it's just a matter of time before the company builds on its search technology based on the millions of data points collected through transactions. \nComputer vision, deep-learning algorithms, and sensors similar to the ones found in self-driving cars support the experience. Consumers use a mobile app to enter the physical grocery store, which could expand on its delivery service, AmazonFresh. Its fleet of planes and trucks could make sure to get all items delivered on time without having to depend on UPS or Federal Express. \nAmazon Go is being tested at one store in Seattle on 7th Avenue, and will open to the public in early 2017. The  1,800-square-foot store is currently open to Amazon employees.",

      "title": "Strange DRC Error with NWell Connection",
      "text": "Strange DRC Error with NWell Connection Everyone, I'm using the IBM cmrf8sf 130nm PDK. I've recently come upon an error I have not encountered previously and am unsure how to clear it. From what I can tell, it stems from the NWell connection for my PMOS devices. The Calibre DRC error reads: Check GR134: Floating (NW not over T3) found! - NWell must be tied down by M1. I have my NWell's tied down in the same way as I have in all my previous cells - I use a large NW rectangle to surround all of the pmos devices and a cell named \"nwCont\" to tie the well to the metal at \"vdd!\". When I check previous cells that use this exact approach, I do not see the error. In addition, when I run Calibre LVS, I encounter no errors, which implies that all the NWell's are properly tied to \"vdd!\". Because the foundry requires Assura DRC checks, I also run an Assura DRC, which yields 0 errors. Surprisingly, I get an error when I run Assura LVS, claiming that one of my transistors has an incorrect parameter. I have attached some screenshots of my layout. The first is of the full design, the second is the PMOS region, and the third is the error that appears in RVE. The coordinates that are present in RVE point to my large drawn NW region (yellow dots), the bottom left PMOS, and the nwCont NW region, respectively. I have also encountered this error in another recent design, but the layout and error is similar. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",

      "text": "Who Knew You Could Do That with RPG IV? Modern RPG for the Modern Programmer An IBM Redbooks publication   \nApplication development is a key part of IBM® i businesses. The IBM i operating system is a modern, robust platform to create and develop applications. The RPG language has been around for a long time, but is still being transformed into a modern business language. \nThis IBM Redbooks® publication is focused on helping the IBM i development community understand the modern RPG language. The world of application development has been rapidly changing over the past years. The good news is that IBM i has been changing right along with it, and has made significant changes to the RPG language. This book is intended to help developers understand what modern RPG looks like and how to move from older versions of RPG to a newer, modern version. Additionally, it covers the basics of Integrated Language Environment® (ILE), interfacing with many other languages, and the best tools for doing development on IBM i. \nUsing modern tools, methodologies, and languages are key to continuing to stay relevant in today's world. Being able to find the right talent for your company is key to your continued success. Using the guidelines and principles in this book can help set you up to find that talent today and into the future. \nThis publication is the result of work that was done by IBM, industry experts, business partners, and some of the original authors of the first edition of this book. This information is important not only for developers, but also business decision makers (CIO for example) to understand that the IBM i is not an 'old' system. IBM i has modern languages and tools. It is a matter of what you choose to do with the IBM i that defines its age. Table of contents \nChapter 1. Introduction to RPG IVChapter 2. Programming RPG IV with styleChapter 3.

      "text": "WatBot is an IBM Watson-powered ChatBot running on Android and using Conversation Service on IBM Bluemix (an open standards, cloud platform for building, running, and managing apps and services).\n\nCreation of Conversation Service Watson Conversation combines a number of cognitive techniques to help you build and train a bot – defining intents and entities and crafting dialog to simulate conversation.\nGetting Started Before you can start using the Conversation service, log in to IBM Bluemix and create a service instance.\nLog in to Bluemix and navigate to the Conversation service: Don’t have Bluemix account? Sign up to create a free trial account. Have a Bluemix account? Use this link . In the Service name field, type a unique name for your new instance of the Conversation service.Check the “Pricing Plans” for data limits for the Conversation service Click Create . You’ll see details about your new instance in the “Service Details” page. Creating a Workspace You use the Conversation tool to create workspaces by either creating a new workspace from scratch, or  by importing a workspace from a JSON file. You can also duplicate an existing workspace within the same service instance.\nIf the Service Details page is not already open, click your Conversation service instance on the Bluemix console. (When you create a service instance, the Service Details page displays.) On the “Service Details” page, scroll down to Conversation tooling and click Launch tool . Click Create to create a new workspace. Specify the details for the new workspace: Name : A name no more than 64 characters in length. This value is required. Description : A description no more than 128 characters in length. Language : The language of the user input the workspace will be trained to understand. The service supports Brazilian Portuguese, English, French, Italian, and Spanish. Click Create . The new workspace is created and now appears as a tile on the Workspaces page. Creating an Intent You use the Conversation tool to create intents. The number of intents and examples you can create in a single service instance depends on your Conversation service plan:\nCreate some intents.\nIn the Conversation tool, open your workspace and then click the Intents tab. Click Create new . In the Intent name field, type a descriptive name for the intent. The intent name can contain letters (in Unicode), numbers, underscores, hyphens, and dots. Intent names cannot contain spaces and must not exceed 128 characters. The following are examples of intent names: #weather_conditions #pay_bill #escalate_to_agent Tip : Don’t include the # character in the intent names when you create them in the Conversation tool. In the User example field, type the text of a user example for the intent. An example can be any string up to 1024 characters in length. The following might be examples for the #pay_bill intent: I need to pay my bill. Pay my account balance make a payment Important : Intent names and example text can be exposed in URLs when an application interacts with the service. Do not include sensitive or personal information in these artifacts.Press Enter or click + to save the example. Repeat the same process to add more examples. Provide at least 5 examples for each intent. The more examples you provide, the more accurate your application can be. When you have finished adding examples, click Create to finish creating the intent. Results The intent you created is added to the Intents tab, and the system begins to train itself on the new data.\nYou can click any intent in the list to open it for editing. You can make the following changes:\nRename the intent. Delete the intent. Add, edit, or delete examples. Move an example to a different intent. To move an example, select the example by clicking the check box and then click Move to .\n\nTesting Your Intents After you have finished creating new intents, you can test the system to see if it recognizes your intents as you expect.\nIn the Conversation tool, click the icon. In the Try it out panel, enter a question or other text string and press Enter to see which intent is recognized. If the wrong intent is recognized, you can improve your model by adding this text as an example to the correct intent.\n\nTip : If you have recently made changes in your workspace, you might see a message indicating that the system is still retraining. If you see this message, wait until training completes before testing: The response indicates which intent was recognized from your input. If the system did not recognize the correct intent, you can correct it. To correct the recognized intent, click the displayed intent and then select the correct intent from the list. After your correction is submitted, the system automatically retrains itself to incorporate the new data. If your intents are not being correctly recognized, consider making the following kinds of changes: Add the unrecognized text as an example to the correct intent. Move existing examples from one intent to another. Consider whether your intents are too similar, and redefine them as appropriate. Creating an Entity You use the Conversation tool to create entities. The number of entities, entity values, and synonyms you can create in a single service instance depends on your Conversation service plan:\nIn the Conversation tool, open your workspace and then click the Entities tab. Click Create new . In the Add the entity name field, type a descriptive name for the entity.The entity name can contain letters (in Unicode), numbers, underscores, and hyphens. For example: @location @menu_item @product Tips : Don’t include the @ character in the entity names when you create them in the Conversation tool. Entity names can’t contain spaces or be longer than 64 characters. And entity names can’t begin with the string sys- , which is reserved for system entities. In the Value field, type the text of a possible value for the intent. An entity value can be any string up to 64 characters in length. Important : Don’t include sensitive or personal information in entity names or values. The names and values can be exposed in URLs in an app. In the Synonyms field, type any synonyms for the entity value. A synonym can be any string up to 64 characters in length. Press Enter to save each synonym. Click + and repeat the process to add more entity values. When you are finished adding values and synonyms, click Create . Building a Dialog The dialog component of the Conversation service uses the intents and entities that are identified in the user’s input to gather required information and provide a useful response. Your dialog is represented graphically as a tree; create a branch to process each intent that you define.\nPost branching Intents and entities, this is how my Conversation Dialog on Bluemix looks like\n\nCoding the App on Android Studio Android Studio is the Official IDE for Android.

      "text": "Do you remember the IBM TV commercial that ran in 2006, where the shady-looking character took items off a store shelf and stuck them in the pockets of his trench coat? He walks out of the store followed by a security officer who hands him the receipt for the groceries. \nAt that time IBM imagined building the technology on radio frequency identification. \"Checkout lines. Who needs them,\" said the voiceover . \"This is the future of ebusiness.\" \nFour years ago, Amazon picked up where IBM left off when the company's researchers began wondering \"what would shopping look like if you could walk into a store and just go,\" so consumers would never need to wait in line.\nWhile that may sound like nirvana, it's not about walking in and out of a grocery store using a phone and technology to purchase products without having to go through a checkout line.\nAnd it's not just any payment system. Amazon has created a payment method that combines traditional point-of-sale systems, online payment technology like PayPal, and mobile apps like Square. The technology can be used at gas stations, bookstores, clothing stores, and any other type of physical or online store that requires the consumer to trade currency for products or services. \nThis is not about automated checkout grocery stores, but rather data, advertising and a new payment system that finally integrates all transnational data. \nWhile Amazon has not said what they will do with the data, bits and bytes from transactions could become a targeting tool for advertisers looking to reach consumers in-store and through online purchases, in my opinion. From there it's just a matter of time before the company builds on its search technology based on the millions of data points collected through transactions. \nComputer vision, deep-learning algorithms, and sensors similar to the ones found in self-driving cars support the experience. Consumers use a mobile app to enter the physical grocery store, which could expand on its delivery service, AmazonFresh. Its fleet of planes and trucks could make sure to get all items delivered on time without having to depend on UPS or Federal Express. \nAmazon Go is being tested at one store in Seattle on 7th Avenue, and will open to the public in early 2017. The  1,800-square-foot store is currently open to Amazon employees.",

      "title": "18 AS2 Products Earn Drummond Certification in AS2 3Q16 Test Event",
      "text": "Microsoft, Axway, IBM among companies in group of newly certified products supporting industry-leading messaging standard.\n\nAUSTIN, TX (PRWEB) December 07, 2016\n\nDrummond Group announced today that 18 AS2 software products representing 13 global organizations have been Drummond Certified™ in the AS2-3Q16 automated interoperability test event.\n\nAS2 software products from the following companies successfully passed this year’s third quarter interoperability testing of the AS2 RFC specification: Axway, Cleo, Dell Boomi, E2open, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Intec Inc., Liaison, Linoma Software, Lobster GmbH, Microsoft, OpenText, and RSSBus.\n\nAS2 (Applicability Statement 2) is one of the most widely recognized messaging standards for B2B e-commerce with thousands of implementations around the globe. It enables businesses to easily establish trading partner relationships to exchange business data (like EDI, XML, documents, PDFs, text files, etc.) securely and reliably, thereby delivering cost savings and providing flexibility and control for backend to backend data integration.\n\n\"AS2 certification for interoperability remains a critical part of the successful adoption of AS2.

      "text": "December 07, 2016 3:00am Comments Share: BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \nOnapsis, a global expert in business-critical application security, today announced that the Onapsis Security Platform integrates with IBM security intelligence technology to provide customers with improved visibility into their network security. Utilizing QRadar to consolidate different sources of network security, this integration with the Onapsis Security Platform (OSP) will extend the existing visibility of QRadar, as well as security process and workflows to include results from OSP. \nThe new application is freely available to the security community through IBM Security App Exchange, a marketplace where developers across the industry can share applications based on IBM Security technologies. As threats are evolving faster than ever, collaborative development amongst the security community will help organizations adapt quickly and speed innovation in the fight against cybercrime. \nThe Onapsis Security Platform leverages IBM Security QRadar, the company's security intelligence platform which analyzes data across an organization's IT infrastructure in real-time to identify potential security threats. Leveraging QRadar's new open application programming interfaces (API), the Onapsis Security Platform allows Onapsis and IBM customers to have extended coverage for real-time monitoring and reporting of advanced tacks targeting SAP business systems. \n\"With this new integration, subscribers of the Onapsis Security Platform can now send OSP events to their IBM QRadar SIEM for increased visibility into their company's network security. Alarm activity designated by the user is transferred in real-time to QRadar for comparison with information gathered from other sources within the network. This includes things such as including information flows or traffic, and data about ports and protocols, asset context, events from third-party devices, feeds, and other sources to provide your company with a complete security posture assessment,\" said Alex Horan, Director of Product Management, Onapsis. \nAbout Onapsis \nOnapsis is the pioneer in cybersecurity and compliance solutions for cloud and on-premise ERP and business-critical applications. As the proven market leader, global enterprises trust Onapsis to protect the essential information and processes that run their businesses. \nHeadquartered in Boston, MA, Onapsis serves over 200 customers including many of the Global 2000. Onapsis' solutions are also the de-facto standard for leading consulting and audit firms such as Accenture, Deloitte, E&Y, IBM, KPMG and PwC. \nOnapsis solutions include the Onapsis Security Platform, which is the most widely-used SAP-certified cyber-security solution in the market. Unlike generic security products, Onapsis' context-aware solutions deliver both preventative vulnerability and compliance controls, as well as real-time detection and incident response capabilities to reduce risks affecting critical business processes and data. Through open interfaces, the platform can be integrated with leading SIEM, GRC and network security products, seamlessly incorporating enterprise applications into existing vulnerability, risk and incident response management programs. These solutions are powered by the Onapsis Research Labs which continuously provide leading intelligence on security threats affecting SAP and Oracle enterprise applications. Experts of the Onapsis Research Labs were the first to lecture on SAP cyber-attacks and have uncovered and helped fix hundreds of security vulnerabilities to-date affecting SAP Business Suite, SAP HANA, SAP Cloud and SAP Mobile applications, as well as Oracle JD Edwards and Oracle E-Business Suite platforms. \nOnapsis has been issued U.S. Patent No. 9,009,837 entitled \"Automated Security Assessment of Business-Critical Systems and Applications,\" which describes certain algorithms and capabilities behind the technology powering the Onapsis Security Platform™ and Onapsis X1™ software platforms. This patented technology is recognized industry wide and has gained Onapsis the recognition as a 2015 SINET 16 Innovator. \nFor more information, please visit www.onapsis.com , or connect with us on Twitter , Google+ , or LinkedIn . \nOnapsis and Onapsis Research Labs are registered trademarks of Onapsis, Inc.

      "text": "Onapsis Security Platform part of collaborative development to stay ahead of evolving threats\nBOSTON --(BUSINESS WIRE) Onapsis, a global expert in business-critical application security, today announced that the Onapsis Security Platform integrates with IBM security intelligence technology to provide customers with improved visibility into their network security. Utilizing QRadar to consolidate different sources of network security, this integration with the Onapsis Security Platform (OSP) will extend the existing visibility of QRadar, as well as security process and workflows to include results from OSP.\nThe new application is freely available to the security community through IBM Security App Exchange, a marketplace where developers across the industry can share applications based on IBM Security technologies. As threats are evolving faster than ever, collaborative development amongst the security community will help organizations adapt quickly and speed innovation in the fight against cybercrime.\nThe Onapsis Security Platform leverages IBM Security QRadar, the company’s security intelligence platform which analyzes data across an organization’s IT infrastructure in real-time to identify potential security threats. Leveraging QRadar’s new open application programming interfaces (API), the Onapsis Security Platform allows Onapsis and IBM customers to have extended coverage for real-time monitoring and reporting of advanced tacks targeting SAP business systems.\n“With this new integration, subscribers of the Onapsis Security Platform can now send OSP events to their IBM QRadar SIEM for increased visibility into their company’s network security. Alarm activity designated by the user is transferred in real-time to QRadar for comparison with information gathered from other sources within the network. This includes things such as including information flows or traffic, and data about ports and protocols, asset context, events from third-party devices, feeds, and other sources to provide your company with a complete security posture assessment,” said Alex Horan, Director of Product Management, Onapsis.\nAbout Onapsis\nOnapsis is the pioneer in cybersecurity and compliance solutions for cloud and on-premise ERP and business-critical applications. As the proven market leader, global enterprises trust Onapsis to protect the essential information and processes that run their businesses.\nHeadquartered in Boston, MA, Onapsis serves over 200 customers including many of the Global 2000. Onapsis’ solutions are also the de-facto standard for leading consulting and audit firms such as Accenture, Deloitte, E&Y, IBM, KPMG and PwC.\nOnapsis solutions include the Onapsis Security Platform, which is the most widely-used SAP-certified cyber-security solution in the market. Unlike generic security products, Onapsis’ context-aware solutions deliver both preventative vulnerability and compliance controls, as well as real-time detection and incident response capabilities to reduce risks affecting critical business processes and data. Through open interfaces, the platform can be integrated with leading SIEM, GRC and network security products, seamlessly incorporating enterprise applications into existing vulnerability, risk and incident response management programs. These solutions are powered by the Onapsis Research Labs which continuously provide leading intelligence on security threats affecting SAP and Oracle enterprise applications. Experts of the Onapsis Research Labs were the first to lecture on SAP cyber-attacks and have uncovered and helped fix hundreds of security vulnerabilities to-date affecting SAP Business Suite, SAP HANA, SAP Cloud and SAP Mobile applications, as well as Oracle JD Edwards and Oracle E-Business Suite platforms.\nOnapsis has been issued U.S. Patent No. 9,009,837 entitled “Automated Security Assessment of Business-Critical Systems and Applications,” which describes certain algorithms and capabilities behind the technology powering the Onapsis Security Platform™ and Onapsis X1™ software platforms. This patented technology is recognized industry wide and has gained Onapsis the recognition as a 2015 SINET 16 Innovator.\nFor more information, please visit www.onapsis.com , or connect with us on Twitter , Google+ , or LinkedIn .\nOnapsis and Onapsis Research Labs are registered trademarks of Onapsis, Inc.

      "text": "By: PRWeb  03 AM EST IntelliMagic Announces Strategic Alliance with Watson & Walker for IBM z/OS Mainframe Sites Wanting to Improve Performance and Availability PRWeb \nIntelliMagic, the developers of intelligent IT Operations Analytics solutions like IntelliMagic Vision for z/OS, is pleased to announce a formal alliance with Watson & Walker, publisher of the widely-read 'Cheryl Watson's Tuning Newsletter', and one of the best-known and respected z/OS performance and measurement advisory groups in the world. \n\"We are delighted to be working together with Cheryl Watson, Frank Kyne and the rest of the Watson & Walker team,\" said Dr. Gilbert Houtekamer, Founder and Managing Director of IntelliMagic, \"Their reputation, integrity, performance and tuning insight are all first-class, and we have already been implementing new functionality in IntelliMagic Vision based on their feedback.\" \nCheryl Watson has been a fan of Dr. Gilbert Houtekamer, for years and is delighted to have this chance to work closely with him and his team. \"We wouldn't go anywhere without IntelliMagic Vision,\" said Cheryl Watson. \"Their interpretation and multi-dimensional view of RMF and SMF data makes it so much easier and quicker for us to focus in on what is important in the data.\" \nIntelliMagic Vision for z/OS analyzes SMF and RMF data to detect issues before they impact production.

      "text": "BOSTON- Onapsis, a global expert in business-critical application security, today announced that the Onapsis Security Platform integrates with IBM security intelligence technology to provide customers with improved visibility into their network security. Utilizing QRadar to consolidate different sources of network security, this integration with the Onapsis Security Platform (OSP) will extend the existing visibility of QRadar, as well as security process and workflows to include results from OSP.\nThe new application is freely available to the security community through IBM Security App Exchange, a marketplace where developers across the industry can share applications based on IBM Security technologies. As threats are evolving faster than ever, collaborative development amongst the security community will help organizations adapt quickly and speed innovation in the fight against cybercrime.\nThe Onapsis Security Platform leverages IBM Security QRadar, the company’s security intelligence platform which analyzes data across an organization’s IT infrastructure in real-time to identify potential security threats. Leveraging QRadar’s new open application programming interfaces (API), the Onapsis Security Platform allows Onapsis and IBM customers to have extended coverage for real-time monitoring and reporting of advanced tacks targeting SAP business systems.\n“With this new integration, subscribers of the Onapsis Security Platform can now send OSP events to their IBM QRadar SIEM for increased visibility into their company’s network security. Alarm activity designated by the user is transferred in real-time to QRadar for comparison with information gathered from other sources within the network. This includes things such as including information flows or traffic, and data about ports and protocols, asset context, events from third-party devices, feeds, and other sources to provide your company with a complete security posture assessment,” said Alex Horan, Director of Product Management, Onapsis.\nAbout Onapsis\nOnapsis is the pioneer in cybersecurity and compliance solutions for cloud and on-premise ERP and business-critical applications. As the proven market leader, global enterprises trust Onapsis to protect the essential information and processes that run their businesses.\nHeadquartered in Boston, MA, Onapsis serves over 200 customers including many of the Global 2000. Onapsis’ solutions are also the de-facto standard for leading consulting and audit firms such as Accenture, Deloitte, E&Y, IBM, KPMG and PwC.\nOnapsis solutions include the Onapsis Security Platform, which is the most widely-used SAP-certified cyber-security solution in the market. Unlike generic security products, Onapsis’ context-aware solutions deliver both preventative vulnerability and compliance controls, as well as real-time detection and incident response capabilities to reduce risks affecting critical business processes and data. Through open interfaces, the platform can be integrated with leading SIEM, GRC and network security products, seamlessly incorporating enterprise applications into existing vulnerability, risk and incident response management programs. These solutions are powered by the Onapsis Research Labs which continuously provide leading intelligence on security threats affecting SAP and Oracle enterprise applications. Experts of the Onapsis Research Labs were the first to lecture on SAP cyber-attacks and have uncovered and helped fix hundreds of security vulnerabilities to-date affecting SAP Business Suite, SAP HANA, SAP Cloud and SAP Mobile applications, as well as Oracle JD Edwards and Oracle E-Business Suite platforms.\nOnapsis has been issued U.S. Patent No. 9,009,837 entitled “Automated Security Assessment of Business-Critical Systems and Applications,” which describes certain algorithms and capabilities behind the technology powering the Onapsis Security Platform™ and Onapsis X1™ software platforms.

      "text": "Blog This \nARMONK, N.Y. , Dec. 7 , 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Blockchain has the potential to transform the way industries conduct business transactions. This will require a complete ecosystem of industry players working together, allowing businesses to benefit from the network effect of blockchain. To help support these organizations, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced today a blockchain ecosystem to help accelerate the creation of blockchain networks. \n\"The future growth and adoption of blockchain is reliant upon building a strong ecosystem. Business networks will only reach critical mass when innovators, industry experts and infrastructure providers come together in new ways to reinvent how business transactions happen,\" said Bridget Van Kralingen , senior vice president, IBM Industry Platforms. \"The growing maturity of the Hyperledger Project code is a major milestone. That's why IBM is investing to help developers accelerate the creation of blockchain networks by providing an environment where these players can work together.\" \nThe blockchain ecosystem program is designed for innovators looking to build real networks -- venture capitalists (VCs), start-ups, systems integrators (SI), independent software vendors (ISV) and enterprise developers. To support these diverse organizations, IBM will provide education and tools aimed to reduce the time required to go from idea to execution. IBM blockchain professionals will hold \"office hours\" via the Hyperledger Fabric Slack channel providing support to developers and help with troubleshooting. This is in addition to the courses and learning modules for business users and developers already available on developerWorks . These will be augmented with code libraries, smart contract templates and tools currently in development to speed the creation of blockchain apps. \nThese programs are designed to support the Linux Foundation Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 and the IBM Blockchain platform which is expected to transform the way blockchain networks transact, opening up new possibilities for development. The Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 will provide a modular approach, much like the network-of-networks model of the Internet. \nIBM Blockchain Ecosystem Participants The IBM blockchain ecosystem is an open environment where organizations can collaborate on shared or complementary technical and business visions using the Hyperledger Fabric, and access education and development support. Because blockchain is a network business, an environment where all interested parties can share tools, information and relationships is critical. Start-ups, ISVs and SIs are investing in blockchain and have embraced the Hyperledger Fabric. Many companies are already joining the IBM blockchain ecosystem, including: Cloudsoft is a software company providing multi-cloud application management with open source tools.

      "text": "Contact(s) information \nARMONK, NY - 07 Dec 2016: Blockchain has the potential to transform the way industries conduct business transactions. This will require a complete ecosystem of industry players working together, allowing businesses to benefit from the network effect of blockchain. To help support these organizations, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced today a blockchain ecosystem to help accelerate the creation of blockchain networks. “The future growth and adoption of blockchain is reliant upon building a strong ecosystem. Business networks will only reach critical mass when innovators, industry experts and infrastructure providers come together in new ways to reinvent how business transactions happen,” said Bridget Van Kralingen, senior vice president, IBM Industry Platforms. “The growing maturity of the Hyperledger Project code is a major milestone. That’s why IBM is investing to help developers accelerate the creation of blockchain networks by providing an environment where these players can work together.” \nThe blockchain ecosystem program is designed for innovators looking to build real networks -- venture capitalists (VCs), start-ups, systems integrators (SI), independent software vendors (ISV) and enterprise developers. To support these diverse organizations, IBM will provide education and tools aimed to reduce the time required to go from idea to execution. IBM blockchain professionals will hold “office hours” via the Hyperledger Fabric Slack channel providing support to developers and help with troubleshooting. This is in addition to the courses and learning modules for business users and developers already available on developerWorks . These will be augmented with code libraries, smart contract templates and tools currently in development to speed the creation of blockchain apps. \nThese programs are designed to support the Linux Foundation Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 and the IBM Blockchain platform which is expected to transform the way blockchain networks transact, opening up new possibilities for development. The Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 will provide a modular approach, much like the network-of-networks model of the Internet. \nIBM Blockchain Ecosystem Participants \nThe IBM blockchain ecosystem is an open environment where organizations can collaborate on shared or complementary technical and business visions using the Hyperledger Fabric, and access education and development support. Because blockchain is a network business, an environment where all interested parties can share tools, information and relationships is critical. Start-ups, ISVs and SIs are investing in blockchain and have embraced the Hyperledger Fabric. Many companies are already joining the IBM blockchain ecosystem, including: \n· Cloudsoft is a software company providing multi-cloud application management with open source tools. Cloudsoft Blockchain Service lets developers focus on creating chaincode applications and reduces time to value for enterprises investigating and working with blockchain technologies, such as financial institutions setting-up their own Hyperledger blockchain networks running across multiple geographies. \n· EY helps clients leverage blockchain in their business solutions. EY teams of professionals bring cross sector experience and deep industry knowledge of business processes, finance, risk and regulation, cybersecurity, automation, cloud, and analytics to develop and execute on strategies to help our clients address their most challenging business problems. \n· Everledger is a UK-based startup that is using IBM Blockchain to authenticate and trace the origin of high-value and luxury goods, such as diamonds and wine that are authenticated by trusted players like certificate houses. Using the IBM High Security Network, the company is able to trace and validate some of the world's most sought-after objects in a secure, tamper-resistant environment. \n· Gliding Eagle is a California based company providing a cloud and mobile based technology system offering transparency and authenticity in tracking individual products from the producer to the end consumer, anywhere in the world. \n· HACERA adds highly secure Authentication, Authorization and Accounting/Auditing (AAA) services to blockchains. HACERA is focused on regulated institutions that must comply with stringent policies regarding privacy, sensitive data processing and service availability. Built for scalability, HACERA seamlessly protects participants’ identity properties, even when stored across multiple identity systems, using strong cryptography. \n· The Hive is a Palo Alto based early-stage fund and venture studio focused on applications of AI and big data with a strong blockchain technology portfolio across FinTech, cyber-security, industrial Internet and compliance. The Hive is actively co-creating ventures within IBM’s blockchain ecosystem by collaborating with entrepreneurs in its high-touch model. \n· IntellectEU is an international Fintegration company with experienced Blockchain (Hyperledger and Ethereum) teams in the US and EMEA.

      "title": "40 firms to trial IBM Watson cognitive computing for cyber security",
      "text": "  \nIBM has announced that 40 companies around the world have signed up for its IBM Watson for Cyber Security Beta Program. \nThe companies will test the ability of IBM’s cognitive computing technology to help in the battle against cyber crime. The trial will include representatives of the banking, healthcare, insurance, education and other key industry sectors.   \nFind out what are the most appropriate threat intelligence systems and services for your organisation   \nWatson for Cyber Security uses technologies such as machine learning and natural language processing, which is being trained to understand the language of security. \nIBM claims the combined technologies will help security analysts make better, faster decisions from vast amounts of data, including unstructured data that has been “dark” to security defences until now. \nToday’s increasingly challenging security environment has created the need for more intelligence to identify and prioritise threats, which is, in turn, increasing the workload of security analysts with more alerts and anomalies to process than ever, said IBM. \nA recent study from the IBM Institute for Business Value shows that nearly 60% of security professionals believe emerging cognitive technologies will play a critical role in turning the tide in the war on cyber crime. \n“Customers are in the early stages of implementing cognitive security technologies,” said Sandy Bird, chief technology officer at IBM Security. \n“Our research suggests this adoption will increase threefold over the next three years, as tools like Watson for Cyber Security mature and become pervasive in security operations centres. Currently, only 7% of security professionals claim to be using cognitive solutions.” \nCompanies taking part in the beta tests will use Watson in their current security environments to bring additional context to their cyber security data. \nIBM said Watson will help organisations to determine whether or not a current security “offence” is associated with a known malware or cyber crime campaign. \nIf it is, Watson can provide background on the malware employed, vulnerabilities exploited and scope of the threat, among other insights, said IBM. \nWatson is also expected to help improve organisations’ ability to identify suspicious behaviour by providing additional context to user activity. \nWorking with these beta customers, IBM is continuing to enhance Watson’s understanding of the cyber security data and refine how Watson can seamlessly integrate into day-to-day security operations.

      "title": "IBM Debuts Blockchain Ecosystem To Help Accelerate Growth of Networks on Hyperledger Fabric",
      "text": " IBM\nARMONK, N.Y. , Dec. 7 , 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Blockchain has the potential to transform the way industries conduct business transactions. This will require a complete ecosystem of industry players working together, allowing businesses to benefit from the network effect of blockchain. To help support these organizations, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced today a blockchain ecosystem to help accelerate the creation of blockchain networks.\n\"The future growth and adoption of blockchain is reliant upon building a strong ecosystem. Business networks will only reach critical mass when innovators, industry experts and infrastructure providers come together in new ways to reinvent how business transactions happen,\" said Bridget Van Kralingen , senior vice president, IBM Industry Platforms. \"The growing maturity of the Hyperledger Project code is a major milestone. That's why IBM is investing to help developers accelerate the creation of blockchain networks by providing an environment where these players can work together.\"\nThe blockchain ecosystem program is designed for innovators looking to build real networks -- venture capitalists (VCs), start-ups, systems integrators (SI), independent software vendors (ISV) and enterprise developers. To support these diverse organizations, IBM will provide education and tools aimed to reduce the time required to go from idea to execution. IBM blockchain professionals will hold \"office hours\" via the Hyperledger Fabric Slack channel providing support to developers and help with troubleshooting. This is in addition to the courses and learning modules for business users and developers already available on developerWorks . These will be augmented with code libraries, smart contract templates and tools currently in development to speed the creation of blockchain apps.\nThese programs are designed to support the Linux Foundation Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 and the IBM Blockchain platform which is expected to transform the way blockchain networks transact, opening up new possibilities for development. The Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 will provide a modular approach, much like the network-of-networks model of the Internet.\nIBM Blockchain Ecosystem Participants\nThe IBM blockchain ecosystem is an open environment where organizations can collaborate on shared or complementary technical and business visions using the Hyperledger Fabric, and access education and development support. Because blockchain is a network business, an environment where all interested parties can share tools, information and relationships is critical. Start-ups, ISVs and SIs are investing in blockchain and have embraced the Hyperledger Fabric. Many companies are already joining the IBM blockchain ecosystem, including:\nCloudsoft is a software company providing multi-cloud application management with open source tools.

      "text": "\nIBM CEO Ginni Rometty has called health care IBM's \"moonshot.\" \nIBM has spent years training its super-smart, learning, reasonsing computer service Watson to do things like analyze massive amounts of data to help improve the patient diagnosis. \nOn stage at Business Insider's Ignition conference taking place this week in New York, David Kenny, General Manager of IBM Watson, gave one example of how Watson is changing health care. \nHe told this startling story: \n\"There's a 60-year-old woman in Tokyo. She was at the University of Tokyo. She had been diagnosed with leukemia six years ago. She was living, but not healthy. So the University of Tokyo ran her genomic sequence through Watson and it was able to ascertain that they were off by one thing. Actually, she had two strains of leukemia. The did treat her and she is healthy.\" \nHe added, \"That's one example. Statistically, we're seeing that about one third of the time, Watson is proposing an additional diagnosis.\" \nKenny says that what Watson is not just being used to cure cancer, \"but to just recommend what you should watch next\" and even to recommend \"what ad you you should watch next.\" \nHe says the game-changing thing about Watson is its ability to \"get to know you personally and know what you need next. It comes from what we learned in medicine.\" ",

      "text": "up vote 0 down vote favorite \nI have an IBM xServer (running Debian Jessie) in my home that I use as a router and NAS. Now it came into idea to setup a Windows 7 VM for some long-time tasks, like downloading large files, because the server is always running. I chose Windows because my family members are typical users and not used to Linux at all. For virtualization I use QEMU with KVM. In my case, I can only use IPv4, because my ISP hadn't upgraded its network, yet. \nEverything is up and running except for the network. For dedicated PCs it's working fine. But the VM can only access internal devices, traffic to external IPs is just passed through by the router (for instance, when I ping google, that packet arrives at them with a 10.0.0.0/16 address in the source field). The really confusing part is that when I wait some time before the ping (~10 minutes) the first packet is going correctly. With Wireshark I saw that this correctly routed packet was not sent over the LAN (but routed internally by the OS?). \nUntil now, I'm trying to figure the problem out for three days. When I searched on the internet I got some answers, but none of them helped in my specific case, where the VM host is also the gateway. I imagine that the kernel thinks that it's \"clever\" to route the packets that way like: \"Oh, I'm the gateway, I don't need to pass the packet through the LAN, let me push it directly into the internet.\" \nI tried using MASQUERADE on every interface (including br0 and tap0 ), I messed around with the kernel routing table and more crazy stuff that came to mind as I slowly got insane. The only time I got the VM online was when I connected it directly to the uplink (via another switch, the server uplink was connected, too). But this is not a solution as this completely bypasses my firewall and created a new neighbor-subnet. \nMy key-questions are: What is causing this weird behavior? How can I fix it? \nBelow, I give some information about my system. If this is not enough, please tell me what you need so I can hand it in. \nAt last I want to point out that I'm not a native English speaker. If some of my phrasing is not correct English, I apologize. \nI'm using this network setup: eth0 is my uplink to the \"outside\". eth1 is the internal link to the main switch. eth2 is another interface directly connected by cable to the main switch. eth3 is unused. tap0 is a tunnel adapter, that the VM uses. br0 is a bridge between tap0 and eth2. \nMy IP range: 10.0.0.0/16: Address range for DHCP 10.1.0.0/16: Address range for network devices (routers, access points) 10.2.0.0/16: Additional range for static configuration \n/etc/network/interfaces configuration # Loopback network interface auto lo iface lo inet loopback iface lo inet6 loopback # Uplink network interface auto eth0 allow-hotplug eth0 iface eth0 inet dhcp iface eth0 inet6 dhcp # Internal network interface auto eth1 allow-hotplug eth1 #iface eth1 inet dhcp iface eth1 inet static address 10.1.0.254 netmask 255.0.0.0 dns-nameservers 127.0.0.1 # Bridge target port auto eth2 allow-hotplug eth2 iface eth2 inet static address 10.2.0.4 netmask 255.0.0.0 gateway 10.1.0.254 # Network bridge for virtual servers auto br0 iface br0 inet static address 10.2.0.2 netmask 255.0.0.0 gateway 10.1.0.254 bridge_ports eth2 bridge_fd 0 bridge_maxage 0 bridge_stp off \nMy iptables configuration #!/bin/bash PATH=/usr/sbin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin # portForward internalIP internalPort externalPort portForward() { iptables -A FORWARD -j ACCEPT -p tcp --dport $3 -d $1 -m state --state NEW iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport $3 -j DNAT --to-destination $1:$2 iptables -A FORWARD -j ACCEPT -p udp --dport $3 -d $1 -m state --state NEW iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p udp --dport $3 -j DNAT --to-destination $1:$2 } # # delete all existing rules. # iptables -F iptables -t nat -F iptables -t mangle -F iptables -X # Always accept loopback traffic iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT # Port banning # Teredo (MS-IPv6-Tunnel; slow and unstable) iptables -A FORWARD -p udp --sport 3544 -j REJECT # Port forwarding #portForward 10.0.138.210 80 80 # Allow established connections, and those not coming from the outside iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -i !eth0 -j ACCEPT iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -j DROP # Allow outgoing connections from the LAN side. iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT # Masquerade. iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE # Don't forward from the outside to the inside. iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -j DROP # Enable routing. echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward \nroute -n (X was the same number) Kernel IP Routing Table Target Router Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface 0.0.0.0 X.20.47.254 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth0 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 U 0 0 0 eth1 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 U 0 0 0 eth2 X.20.47.0 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 eth0 \nQEMU start command kvm -hda /root/vm/windows7_overlay.qcow2 \\ -net nic,model=e1000,macaddr=00:fe:de:ad:be:ef \\ -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no \\ -smp cpus=8,cores=8,threads=8,sockets=2 \\ -m 2048 \\ -vnc :1 \\ -daemonize",

      "text": "Stock Market Today S&P 500, Dow Hit Record Highs; Airlines, IBM, Home Depot In Focus Shares of Home Depot were nearing a buy point as the S&P 500 and Dow industrials hit record highs Wednesday. (iStockphoto) Reprints \nThe main indexes extended gains in late trading Wednesday, with some hitting record levels. \nThe S&P 500 jumped 1% and reached a record high. The Dow Jones industrial average also hit an all-time high, adding 1.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 made a record high of its own, adding 0.6%. \nDow component Home Depot ( HD ) rose 2.5% and is drawing near the 132.23 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. IBM ( IBM ), another of the Dow 30 stocks, rose 2% and is back above the 161.96 entry of a cup with handle. IBM, the tech services and Big Data computing giant, could also be viewed as forming an additional handle over the prior six sessions, furnishing a slightly higher yet relevant entry of 164.76.\nThe Nasdaq climbed 0.9%, as a rout in pharmaceuticals and some health care stocks failed to spread to other sectors. The composite still has some recovery to do before topping prior highs. \nVolume was tracking higher across the board. That was a good sign on a day when indexes hit new highs, as was the day's breadth: Winning stocks led losers by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq. \nTechnology and financial stocks were the best performing in the IBD 50. But the index was indicated 0.3% higher, a lagging performance that was curious, to say the least, in the context of today's strong market. \nAn eclectic mix of metal, consumer, technology and transportation stocks led the broad market today . Airlines were active on the upside. \nSouthwest Airlines ( LUV ) rose 3.5%, making its best move above a 48.10 buy point so far. But volume was running well below Southwest's usual levels, which made the breakout suspect. The airline reported November traffic that outpaced capacity growth. Southwest also kept its Q4 unit revenue outlook, which had disappointed investors. Delta Air Lines ( DAL ) jumped 2.7% to 50.85 and surged past a 49.51 buy point of a large cup-with-handle pattern. Shares are still in proper buying range. Yet volume also was tracking roughly 19% below normal levels with an hour left in Wednesday's session.\nHawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings ( HA ) rose more than 2.3% and is barely out of proper buy range from a 51.63 buy point it cleared a couple of weeks ago. \nIn the IBD 50, Middleby ( MIDD ) made a new high and is adding a bit of cushion above the 139.34 buy point of a cup-with-handle pattern. Middleby makes commercial cooking and baking equipment, making it a key supplier to the restaurant industry. \nSynchronoss Technologies ( SNCR ) deepened losses. The stock slid as much as 5% in heavy trading, falling deeper below the 50-day moving average. Shares of the software company sold off Tuesday also after the company announced it is acquiring business software provider Intralinks Holdings ( IL ) for $821 million. \nRELATED:",

Is IBM on the Upswing? \nIBM has delivered strong returns to its shareholders this year and is exploring ways to accelerate its earnings growth over the final months of 2016 and into next year. \nMartin Schroeter, IBM's chief financial officer, said in a company statement that his business has returned more than $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases through the first nine months of 2016. He also pointed out IBM is committed to extending its global reach. \"Throughout the year, we have continued to invest where we see the greatest opportunities to create new markets and strengthen our enterprise IT leadership position. This has included more than $12 billion across capital expenditures, R&D and acquisitions so far this year,\" Schroeter said in a prepared statement. \nFurthermore, Schroeter stated IBM's investments in its strategic imperatives — analytics, cloud, mobility and security — may help the company stand out from its rivals in a highly competitive global marketplace. \"We are applying deep industry skills and innovative technologies to change real business processes and outcomes. This supports our ability to invest to create new offerings and markets, and our ability to find new ways to monetize our intellectual property,\" Schroeter said during IBM's 3Q16 earnings call.

      "text": "print \nAmazon plans to open 2,000 of its new, futuristic grocery stores. Amazon \nWhen Amazon debuted its new, futuristic grocery store on Monday, it may have looked a little familiar if you were paying attention in the mid-2000s. \nThat's because IBM predicted nearly the exact same setup — a grocery store with no registers, no cashiers, and no checkout lines — in a TV commercial that aired more than a decade ago. \nTitled \"The Future Market,\" IBM's ad depicts how supermarkets could evolve with the use of r adio-frequency identification, or RFID. In the ad, a man takes products off the shelf, stuffing them in his overcoat and leaving the store, seemingly without paying. The ad makes you think this guy is a stereotypical shoplifter, but in reality, the store was able to identify what he'd grabbed from the shelves and printed out a receipt for him anyway. \nWatch the ad for yourself: \nThe ad looks eerily similar to what Amazon just launched. \nAmazon Go is similarly designed so the store automatically knows which products shoppers have taken from their shelves, adding those products to a digital shopping cart, and knows when they've left the store. Amazon's machine-learning technology can identify the products, so you don't have to manually add them to your account, and o nce you leave the store, Amazon automatically charges the credit card it has on file in your Amazon account. \nWhile IBM's depiction of how this would work is decidedly creepier than Amazon's cheerful video of a woman who just can't decide if she wants a cheesecake cupcake or not, the idea is almost identical — although IBM forgot to innovate on the idea the paper receipt, but we'll forgive them since the iPhone hadn't been introduced yet. \nWe'll have to wait next year to see how Go pans out for Amazon — the first store will open to the public in Seattle next year — but one thing is for sure: IBM was ahead of the curve.

      "text": "OPENTOPIC AND IBM WATSON MAKING PREDICTION FOR TIME INC’ For every year since 1927, TIME has selected the most influential person of the year. From presidents to protesters, astronauts to activists, each selection reflects the person — or idea — who has most influenced the news and our world in the past year, for good or ill.\nFor 2016, TIME — in partnership with Opentopic and IBM’s Watson — is also able to track and compare influence in a whole new way. Opentopic worked with Watson to track how candidates made their mark on the Internet, in order to create a picture of what the world is saying about the people and ideas that matter.\nTHE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND IT Time Inc.’s team turned to Opentopic to deliver a cognitive solution. Using Sia cognitive capabilities, they gain real insights and we are able to predict the result of their campaign.\nMonitor 200,000+ Sources  — As part of this collaboration with Fortune and TIME, Opentopic has evaluated more than 62 million documents from nearly 3.5 million online sources , which included a mix of news outlets, media platforms, and social networks. Additionally, monitoring included content for all of 2016. Collect & Analyze Data  — Using Sia Insights , they were able to understand all types of unstructured data. Opentopic custom built a dashboard with four main analysis : Volume of discussion, Sentiment for each, Channel distribution, Reach of discussions. Inspire Editorial   —  Sia Prediction relies on cognitive analytics to predict success of campaigns and assets for guaranteed ROI. Using Sia Prediction, Opentopic with Watson narrowed down the results to a leadership board for various entities and concepts with sophisticated filtering capabilities. This enabled the editors to uncover never before seen stories.\nThey were able to track and compare influence in a whole new way. Opentopic worked with Watson to track how candidates made their mark on the Internet, in order to create a picture of what the world is saying about the people and ideas that matter. Watson’s deep-learning technology then classifies and sorts that information. TIME’s editors used this information while finalizing the list for the Person of the Year reader poll — and, as Watson updates that analysis throughout the polling period, this technology can deepen our understanding of what it really means to be one of the most influential people in the world. THE RESULTS Volume of Discussion\nHow is a specific person being talked about?\nSentiment Analysis\nHow are audiences talking about a specific person?\nSize of Discussion\nWhat is the reach of the discussion around a specific person?",
