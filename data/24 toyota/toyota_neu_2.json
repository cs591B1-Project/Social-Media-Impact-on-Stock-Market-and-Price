(AP Photo/Yuri Kageyama) \nTOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles — an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent. \nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. \nThe ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery. \nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations. \nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. \nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. \nBut all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. \nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. [ The Daily Progress news app keeps you up-to-date.

Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama Tags",

Photo by LAT PHOTOGRAPHIC Kyle Larson, Toyota win Turkey Night Grand Prix at Ventura Raceway Tanner Thorson clinches National Midget championship \nNovember 25, 2016 Pinterest Email \nKyle Larson won the Turkey Night Grand Prix, and Tanner Thorson clinched the 2016 USAC National Midget Championship with a sixth-place finish on Thursday night at Ventura (California) Raceway. \nThe win is the third straight for Toyota at the Turkey Night Grand Prix and the sixth in the last seven years. Overall, it marked the 16th USAC national feature win of the season for the manufacturer. \nFor Thorson, the championship capped a season that saw the 20-year-old win four of the final eight USAC national races and also claim his second consecutive National Midget Driver of the Year award. \n“I came really close to getting the job done last year, but we came up a little bit short,” Thorson said. “This year, we were able to get it done even though we didn’t start the season the way we wanted. We were leading the first race during ‘Indiana Midget Week’ at Montpelier and popped a right rear tire. A few races later, we had an issue at West Memphis (Arkansas) and all that led to a not-so-great stretch. I didn’t think that we were going to be able to get the job done after those issues. \n“Suddenly, though, we just started clicking. Every time I went out onto the track, I had an awesome car, which allowed me to win a lot of races. We got wins and stayed consistent after ‘Midget Week’ and it allowed us to get the job done. This whole team, along with Toyota and JBL are what make this deal what it is. We have two of the best in the business in Keith (Kunz) and Big Al (Scroggins) who always put awesome cars underneath us. It’s pretty incredible to be the champion. I’m speechless.\" \nTurkey Night Grand Prix - Unofficial Results",

      "text": "Toyota says new technology means longer battery life By YURI KAGEYAMA, Last Updated: Thursday, November 24, 2016 TOKYO -- \n(AP) Toyota Motor Corp. has developed a new way of observing the movements of tiny particles in batteries used to power electric vehicles an advance it says will help boost their cruise range by 10 percent to 15 percent. \nToyota engineer Hisao Yamashige explained to reporters Thursday at the Japanese automaker's Tokyo office the complex method for tracking the lithium ions, which are tiny particles in lithium-ion batteries, also used in laptops and smartphones. \nThe ions' movements, which are extremely hard to detect, are critical in determining the efficiency and power of a battery. \nIncreasing cruise range is the biggest obstacle for electric vehicles, especially because charging stations aren't as common as gas stations. \nToyota is more bullish about fuel-cell vehicles, which are expensive but can deliver the same cruise range as gas engines. Yamashige said there is no change to that overall company policy. \nToyota, which makes the Prius hybrid, has no pure electric vehicles in its lineup since production of its electric iQ subcompact and other earlier models were discontinued after selling in only small numbers. \nBut all the world's major automakers are working on electric vehicles. Japanese rival Nissan Motor Co. leads with its Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) on a single charge. The Nissan-Renault alliance accounts for about half the world's pure EVs sold. \nToyota's new technology will allow the company to test various materials and battery structures, and an improved electric vehicle is being planned for the commercial market within the next \"several years,\" said Yoshinori Suga, a department manager. \nThe tests are being carried out in collaboration with Japanese research organization Riken, using its high-intensity X-ray facility. Toyota will present its observation method at a battery symposium in Japan later this month, sharing it with other automakers, although not its findings. \n___ \nFollow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama \nHer work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/yuri-kageyama \nCopyright 2016 Associated Press.

      "text": " Research and Markets\nDUBLIN , Nov\nResearch and Markets has announced the addition of the \"Global Hybrid Electric Vehicle Market 2016-2020\" report to their offering.\nThe report forecasts the global hybrid electric vehicle market to grow at a CAGR of 37.16% during the period 2016-2020.\nThe report has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts. The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects over the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.\nOne of latest trends in the market is international ZEV alliance by countries. The international Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) alliance originated because of the EV and HEV production and the need to reduce GHG emissions in the transport sector. This alliance works in line with international and national emission reduction goals to counter consequences of climatic changes. This trend is rising due to the development and adoption of vehicle technologies that emit no tailpipe pollutants and can be powered by zero or near-zero emission levels. ZEVs in use today include battery-electric, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles. These vehicles help improve the air quality and increase low-carbon development.\nAccording to the report, one of the primary drivers in the market is push toward adoption of green (eco-friendly) vehicles. On-road vehicles are one of the biggest contributors to air pollution, due to their immense CO2 emissions. The CO2 emission has been listed as the number one GHG that has been causing global warming and climatic changes. The main focus is reducing vehicular fuel consumption that contributes to the major GHG emissions. This measure is to curb unfavorable environmental impact. The development and adoption of green cars or vehicles are considered to be major solutions to reduce GHG levels in the atmosphere to an acceptable level. These vehicles run on only electricity, hybrid energy, and other power sources such as solar or wind energy or biofuels.\nKey vendors:\nToyota Hyundai Honda Ford Nissan\nKey Topics Covered:\nPart 01: Executive summary\nPart 02: Scope of the report\nPart 03: Market research methodology\nPart 04: Introduction\nPart 05: Market landscape\nPart 06: Market segmentation by degree of hybridization\nPart 07: Market segmentation by type of vehicle\nPart 08: Geographical segmentation\nPart 09: Market drivers\nPart 10: Market challenges\nPart 11: Market trends\nPart 12: Vendor landscape\nPart 13: Key vendor analysis\nPart 14: Appendix\nFor more information about this report visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/6bc3wr/global_hybri\nMedia Contact:\nResearch and Markets\nLaura Wood , Senior Manager\npress@researchandmarkets.com\nFor E.S.T Office Hours Call +1-917-300-0470\nFor U.S./CAN Toll Free Call +1-800-526-8630\nFor GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900\nU.S. Fax: 646-607-1907\nFax (outside U.S.): +353-1-481-1716\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/research-and-markets---global-hybrid-electric-vehicle-market---analysis-technologies--forecasts-to-2020---key-vendors-are-toyota-hyundai--honda-300368830.html\n ",

      "text": "  Toyota Receives Eight ASEAN NCAP Safety & Tech Awards Toyota Receives Eight ASEAN NCAP Safety & Tech Awards \nThe ASEAN NCAP Grand Prix 2016 has honoured the top-rated vehicles involved in the ASEAN NCAP assessment over the last two years.   \nThe New Car Assessment Program for Southeast Asian Countries (ASEAN NCAP) recently conducted its second bi-annual awards ceremony at Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia. The ASEAN NCAP Grand Prix 2016 has honoured the top-rated vehicles involved in the ASEAN NCAP assessment over the last two years. The ASEAN NCAP awards are classified into three categories – Best Safety Technology, Best Occupant Protection, and special awards for the companies or vehicles that contributed enhancing safety in the province. \nYou would be interested to know that Toyota has bagged a total of eight awards under all three categories. Toyota’s advanced Blind Spot Monitor safety system has been commemorated under the category of Best Safety Technology. This system alerts driver of oncoming vehicles that might not be within his/her field of vision, and avoids accidents. \nThe Toyota Corolla sedan has received a special ‘Rising Star Recognition’ award for its contribution for enhancing safety standards in the ASEAN region. Just so you know, Toyota had made seven airbags and VSC (Vehicle Stability Control) as standard safety fitments across all variants of the Corolla sedan in all ASEAN countries from November 2016. \nIn the Best Occupant Protection category, the Japanese carmaker has won six awards in different segments including SUV, MPV (including new Toyota Innova Crysta ), Mini Car and Pickup. All six vehicles were judged on the basis of their frontal and side crash tests results. Besides these awards, Toyota has also scored AOP (Adult Occupant Protection) five-star ratings for three cars – Innova, Hilux and Sienta – which were tested between 2015 -2016. All three models are currently on sale in the Southeast Asian markets. \nToyota’s ASEAN NCAP Awards \nBest Occupant Protection \nToyota Sienta – Best Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) for MPV Category Toyota Agya – Best Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) for Mini Car Category Toyota Agya – Best Child Occupant Protection (COP) Mini Car Category Toyota Innova – Best Child Occupant Protection (COP) for MPV Category Toyota Rush – Best Child Occupant Protection (COP) for SUV Category Toyota Hilux – Best Child Occupant Protection (COP) for Pickup Category \nSafety Technology Award (Car Manufacturer) – Blind Spot Monitor \nSpecial Recognition – Toyota Corolla: Rising Star Recognition \n ",

Automatic braking evaluation to support collision avoidance which target pedestrians during daytime was added to the conventional performance assessments(3), and the ASV++ rating can be attained by vehicles that obtain high scores. Going forward, both Toyota and Lexus plan to deploy collision avoidance support functions which also include pedestrian detection to a wider range of models. \nhttp://www.acnnewswire.com/topimg/Low_ToyotaASV121.jpg \nApproximately 37%(4) of traffic fatalities(5) in Japan involve pedestrians. To prevent fatal pedestrian-related traffic accidents, from 2015 onwards, Toyota rolled out the Toyota Safety Sense P and Lexus Safety System + packages respectively to support collision prevention targeting not only just vehicles, but pedestrians as well. Their prices have been determined at levels which would help encourage widespread use of the systems. These packages have been fitted onto nine models within Japan, and there are plans to successively increase the number of models fitted with these packages going forward. \nToyota is developing safer vehicles and technologies based on its Integrated Safety Management concept, an approach that gives direction to safety technology and vehicle development.

      "text": "The crossover craze continues to grow and it won't be slowing any time in the near future.\nToyota , Ford, Subaru , Jeep and Volkswagen are all showing new crossovers and SUVs at this week's Los Angeles Auto Show . Even traditional luxury car makers like Jaguar and Alfa Romeo are debuting SUVs at the show, which opens to the public on Friday.\nAmericans bought more crossovers and SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year, and the momentum is growing, according to registration data from IHS Markit. In the first nine months of this year, SUVs made up 39.5 percent of new-vehicle registrations; cars stood at 32 percent.\nUnlike the previous SUV boom in the early 2000s — which fell victim to rising gas prices — this one is likely to stay. That's because automakers are offering more small SUVs with better fuel economy. The country's top-selling sedan, the Toyota Camry, gets 28 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving. The top-selling small SUV, the Honda CR-V, gets 29 mpg.\n“There's no reason to not buy an SUV,” says Rebecca Lindland, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book. “I can't imagine a lot of scenarios where this trend is going to change.”\nThe difference between a crossover utility vehicle, or CUV, and sport-utility vehicle, or SUV, is historical. SUVs used to be based on truck platforms and were off-road capable. Now nearly all such vehicles are built on unibody car platforms.\nHere are crossover highlights from the L.A. Auto Show, which will be making the rounds at the Chicago Auto Show from February 11-20, 2017:\nALFA ROMEO STELVIO: Named for a mountain pass in Italy that's known for its hairpin turns, the midsize Stelvio has Alfa's distinctive triangular grille and curvy styling. Under the hood is a 280-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine paired to an eight-speed transmission. Buyers can also opt for the top-of-the-line Stelvio Quadrifoglio, which has a 2.9-liter V6 that produces 505 horsepower. All-wheel-drive is standard on all models. The Stelvio, which will be made in Italy, goes on sale early next year. Pricing wasn't released.\nThe third model in Alfa Romeo's resurgent American lineup is the all-new 2018 Stelvio sport SUV. Named after the famed Stelvio Pass in the Italian Alps, Stelvio uses a 2-liter turbo four-cylinder engine delivering 280 horsepower and 306 pound-feet of torque. All-wheel drive is standard in the performance-oriented Quadrifoglio model, which uses a 2.9-liter biturbo V-6 engine. Pricing TBD.\n(Robert Duffer) FORD ECOSPORT: Ford's smallest SUV, which has been sold in other markets since 2003, will finally go on sale in North America in 2018. It will compete with other tiny newcomers like the Chevrolet Trax and Honda HR-V. To target young buyers, the EcoSport offers ten exterior colors, seven interior lighting options and optional Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. It comes with either a 1.0-liter, three-cylinder turbocharged engine or a 2.0-liter four-cylinder with four-wheel-drive. Pricing wasn't released, but the EcoSport will be less expensive than the Ford Escape, which starts at $23,600. The EcoSport will be made in India.\n2018 Ford EcoSport debuts for American market Tribune wire reports and Robert Duffer Ford made snaps late Monday when it used Snapchat to reveal the EcoSport subcompact crossover in advance of the Los Angeles Auto Show .\nThe use of Snapchat, a social media messaging app popular with millennials and the subsequent Generation Z, to reveal a vehicle was a first, according to Ford,...\nFord made snaps late Monday when it used Snapchat to reveal the EcoSport subcompact crossover in advance of the Los Angeles Auto Show .\nThe use of Snapchat, a social media messaging app popular with millennials and the subsequent Generation Z, to reveal a vehicle was a first, according to Ford,...\n(Tribune wire reports and Robert Duffer) JAGUAR I-PACE CONCEPT: Jaguar is taking aim at Tesla Motors with an electric SUV that is due out in 2018. The five-seat I-PACE is a compact SUV, slightly smaller than the brand's gas-powered F-Pace and Tesla's Model X. It can go an estimated 220 miles on a charge and has electric motors on the front and rear axles that deliver 400 horsepower and zoom from 0 to 60 mph in 4 seconds. Pricing wasn't released.\nJEEP COMPASS: The new Jeep Compass small SUV replaces both the aging Patriot and the previous Compass in Jeep's showroom. Jeep unveiled the new global Compass in Brazil in September, and it looks like a smaller version of the Grand Cherokee. But other details of the U.S. version have been kept under wraps. The Compass is scheduled to go on sale in the U.S. in March.\n2017 Jeep Compass to replace old Compass, Patriot compact crossovers Brent Snavely Jeep revealed that Compass will be the name for the compact Jeep that will replace the Compass and Patriot crossovers as it celebrated the start of production at its plant in Pernambuco, Brazil, and released three images of the vehicle.\nThe images show a more aerodynamic design than the outgoing...\nJeep revealed that Compass will be the name for the compact Jeep that will replace the Compass and Patriot crossovers as it celebrated the start of production at its plant in Pernambuco, Brazil, and released three images of the vehicle.\nThe images show a more aerodynamic design than the outgoing...\n(Brent Snavely) LAND ROVER DISCOVERY: The first complete redesign of the Discovery in 12 years, this family- oriented large SUV has room for seven adults in three rows. It drops the LR designation—and about 1,000 pounds—in a less boxy design. Fuel economy increases yet there's no shortage of power for towing, which maxes out at 8,201 pounds. Engines include a turbo diesel V-6 and supercharged six-cylinder gas variant. The seats can be rearranged remotely through a smartphone app even when the operator is outside the vehicle, and the second and third rows can fold flat in 14 seconds. The suspension automatically lowers the car 1.5 inches to make it easier to get in and out. There are six charging points, places to store iPads, 9 USB ports, and a 4G WiFi hotspot that can handle up to eight devices. There's no shortage of power for towing, which maxes out at 8,201 pounds. Engines include a turbo diesel V-6 and supercharged six-cylinder gas variant. Prices range from $57,000 to $84,000.\nMAZDA CX-5 : Mazda has redesigned its CX-5 midsize SUV, which goes on sale in Japan in February and the U.S. after that. It has a new grille with narrowed headlights and cleaner, less chiseled sides. Mazda says the driving dynamics have improved and the interior is more comfortable. The gas engine choices — a 2.0-liter or a 2.5-liter four-cylinder — remain the same, but for the first time, Mazda will also offer a diesel engine in the U.S. The diesel goes on sale in the second half of 2017. Pricing for the new CX-5 wasn't released, but the current CX-5 starts at $21,795.\nFully redesigned for 2017, the second generation Mazda CX-5 compact crossover will come with three available SKYACTIV engines, including a 2.2-liter diesel expected in the U.S. later in 2017. Accounting for 25 percent of global sales, the CX-5 is Mazda's most important vehicle, and it continues to push into the premium segment with sharp interior appointments.\n(Robert Duffer) MINI COUNTRYMAN: The second-generation Countryman small crossover is the biggest Mini ever. It's 8 inches longer than the outgoing model, with 30 percent more cargo space. Buyers can choose a 134-horsepower, three-cylinder engine or a 189-horsepower four-cylinder; automatic and manual transmissions are available. The Mini Countryman goes on sale in March; a plug-in hybrid version follows in June. Pricing wasn't released, but the current Countryman starts at $22,750.\nPORSCHE PANAMERA 4 E-HYBRID: It's a comfortable four-door sedan. No, it's a high-performance sports car. If it's the Panamera, it's a little bit of both. The all-wheel drive car draws on the technology used in the company's 918 Spyder supercar so that the electric motor continually adds power; the car accelerates to 62 mph in just 4.6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 168 mph. It can go up to 31 miles on just the battery. It hits Europe first in mid-April, with deliveries to follow worldwide. Expect mid-summer in North America. The price is $123,680.\nSUBARU VIZIV7 CONCEPT: Subaru plans to start selling a three-row SUV in early 2018. It will be the brand's largest vehicle yet. Like other Subarus, the VIZIV7 concept has standard all-wheel-drive and a boxer engine. The company says more details will come next year.\nTOYOTA C-HR: Toyota is also joining the subcompact SUV market with the C-HR, which stands for “Coupe-High Rider.” The C-HR, which is already on sale in Europe, has bold, angular styling and a floating roofline that will spice up Toyota's conservative showroom. Europe has a hybrid version, but Toyota hasn't yet said which engines will be offered in the U.S. The C-HR goes on sale in the spring. Pricing wasn't released, but it will slot below the RAV4 SUV, which starts at $24,910.\nVOLKSWAGEN ATLAS: Volkswagen's first three-row SUV fills a big hole in its product lineup. The seven-passenger Atlas, which will go on sale in the spring, comes with two engine choices — a 238-horsepower 2.0-liter four-cylinder or a 280-horsepower, 3.6-liter V6. Both are paired to an eight-speed transmission. All-wheel-drive is available, and Volkswagen says safety features like automatic emergency braking, forward collision warning and lane departure warning will be affordable options. Pricing wasn't released. The Atlas will be built in Tennessee.\n2018 Atlas three-row SUV puts VW back on map Robert Duffer and Tribune wire reports Better late to the three-row crossover party then never for Volkswagen .\nThe beleaguered German brand took a big step toward recovering from its emissions-cheating scandal by introducing a new seven-passenger SUV.\nVolkswagen says the Atlas will have enough space for seven adults plus their luggage....\nBetter late to the three-row crossover party then never for Volkswagen .\nThe beleaguered German brand took a big step toward recovering from its emissions-cheating scandal by introducing a new seven-passenger SUV.\nVolkswagen says the Atlas will have enough space for seven adults plus their luggage....\n(Robert Duffer and Tribune wire reports) Associated Press contributed.\n Automotive Industry Trucks, SUVs and Crossovers Jeep Mazda Toyota Motor Corp.

      "text": "  Maruti, Toyota post double digit growth in November Maruti, Toyota post double digit growth in November December 02, 2016 00:14 IST \nThe measures government takes next to push economic growth will be the key for automotive sector \nM aruti Suzuki India, Toyota and Renault posted double digit sales growth in November even as companies like Mahindra, Ford and Honda saw sales drop as walk-ins at dealerships declined on account of demonetisation of high value currency. \nVolkswagen also reported robust sales during last month. \nMaruti Suzuki's domestic sales stood at 1,26,325 units, up 14.2 per cent as against 1,10,599 units in November 2015. \nThe sales of its mini segment cars including Alto and WagonR increased by 8.1 per cent to 38,886 units as compared to 35,981 units in the same month a year ago. \nSales of the compact segment comprising Swift, Estilo, Ritz, Dzire and Baleno increased 10.8 per cent to 49,431 units in November this year as against 44,626 units a year ago. \nUtility vehicles consisting of Gypsy, Grand Vitara, Ertiga, S-Cross and compact SUV Vitara Brezza surged 98.1 per cent to 17,215 units in November this year, from 8,688 units in the corresponding month last year. \nT oyota Kirloskar Motor also reported 10.03 per cent rise in domestic sales at 11,309 units in November. The company had sold 10,278 units in November last year. \n\"November has been a very exciting month for us as we launched one of the most anticipated products of the year -- the all new Fortuner. We are overwhelmed by the response it has received with over 6,200 bookings already,\" TKM director and Senior VP, sales and marketing, N Raja said. \nThe Innova Crysta and the Platinum Etios have also done really well this month with the Crysta clocking more than 50,000 units in just six months of its launch in India, he added. \n\"However, demonetisation has had its impact on our sales as it has effected customer walk-ins at dealerships, order bookings and timely deliveries. This will pose as a major challenge in the upcoming days as the customers are still dealing with the effects of demonetisation,\" Raja said. \nH omegrown Tata Motors saw domestic passenger vehicle sales grow by 22 per cent to 12,736 units last month as against 10,470 units in the year-ago period. \n\"While we continue to see good demand for our vehicles, the limitation on cash availability due to the recent demonetisation has affected retails in the auto industry, this month,\" Tata Motors president passenger vehicle business Mayank Pareek said. \nVolkswagen India reported an over two-fold increase in sales at 4,014 units in November. It had sold 1,942 units in the same month last year. \nSimilarly, Renault reported sales of 9,604 units last month, up 23 per cent from 7,819 units sold in November last year. \nHomegrown Mahindra & Mahindra saw domestic sales decline 24.29 per cent to 29,814 units last month as compared with 39,383 in November 2015. \n\"While we expected an improved auto industry performance on the back of festive season and other positive parameters such as rural demand and interest rates softening, the sudden announcement of demonetisation has brought in an immediate disruption and uncertainty,\" M&M chief executive (auto division) Pravin Shah said. \nA lthough, demonetisation is a good and welcoming step in the mid to long term, this has dampened overall sentiments leading to postponed buying thereby resulting in a major dip in volumes during November, he added. \n\"This is significant as the automotive industry had just started experiencing stability post a long and tough period of uncertainty,\" Shah said. \nSimilarly, Ford India saw its domestic sales decline last month. The company sold 6,876 units last month, down 21.62 per cent, from 8,773 units in the same period a year ago. \n\"While the macro-economic indicators continue to be positive, the auto industry does face short-term headwinds given the recent demonetisation drive,\" said Anurag Mehrotra, executive director, marketing, sales & service, Ford India. \nH onda Cars India saw its sales drop to 8,029 units in November, down 45.42 per cent, from 14,712 units in the same period of previous year. \n\"The November month saw major disruptions in the market due to the on-going effects of demonetisation and cash crunch. \nThe consumer sentiment was low and footfalls and enquiries at the dealerships also slowed down during the month,\" Honda Cars India president and CEO Yoichiro Ueno said. \nOn the two-wheeler front, India Yamaha Motor reported 20 per cent increase in domestic sales at 51,106 units in November. \nHonda Motorcycle and Scooter India sales growth remained flat at 3,25,448 units in November as compared to 326,466 units in same period of last year. \nAbdul Majeed, partner - Price Waterhouse and an auto expert said: \"Demonetisation will have significant negative impact at least in the next two to three months across the board in the automotive sector especially two wheelers, SUV, luxury vehicles, commercial vehicles.\" \nThe measures government takes next to push economic growth will be the key for automotive sector, he added. © Copyright 2016 PTI.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Why Automakers Could Break Another Sales Record This Year \nHefty discounts during a robust Black Friday weekend helped boost November U.S. auto sales between 4% and 5%, the first automakers to report said on Thursday, which could catapult results this year above a record high in 2015. \n“All economic indicators show significantly improved optimism about the U.S. economy,” said Mustafa Mohatarem, chief economist at General Motors Co. “The U.S. auto industry is well positioned for sales to continue at or near record levels into 2017.” \nEach month, auto sales offer an early snapshot of U.S. consumer spending. \nThe robust sales helped push automaker and auto dealer shares up. In Thursday morning trade, GM rose 4.4%, Ford jumped 6.6%, and leading auto dealer group AutoNation Inc advanced 5.3% while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.3%. \nMarket leader GM’s sales rose 10.2% to 252,644 new vehicles in November. GM said the average selling price of its vehicles in November in the U.S. market was nearly $35,800, about $4,000 higher than the industry average. \nGM reported lofty sales for its big SUVs and pickup trucks, which are higher priced than sedans and other passenger cars. \nFor the industry, GM gm expects November sales at 17.9 million on a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate, which would be short of an annualized rate of 18.25 million reported in November 2015. \nTwo more selling days in November made the comparisons to year-ago sales easier to top, but the annualized sales rate was more difficult to match. Here’s What It Will Take For People to Fully Trust Self-Driving Cars \nToyota Motor Corp tm narrowly outsold Ford Motor Co , by fewer than 100 vehicles. Ford f sales rose 5%, outpacing expectations, while Toyota nearly matched estimates with a 4.3% gain over the year earlier. \nFord said retail sales rose 10% as fleet sales fell 9%. Retail sales count vehicles sold directly to individual consumers, while fleet sales are multiple-vehicle transactions to rental agencies, businesses and government. \nGM said retail sales rose 8% in November. \nNissan Motor Co. beat expectations with a 7.5% rise in U.S. sales to 115,136 vehicles. \nA Thomson Reuters poll of 35 economists showed expectations of a of 17.7 million vehicles for November in the United States. A separate poll of nine Wall Street analysts by Reuters showed expectations of 17.8 million in annualized sales. \nWall Street analysts expect Fiat Chrysler Automobiles fcau to fare the poorest among major automakers, with some forecasting a 14% drop from last November.

      "text": "How Toyota's Lexus Overtook BMW In The U.S. Luxury Market  32   \nToyota Motors 's ( TM ) luxury brand Lexus ended 2015 as the third highest selling luxury vehicle brand in the U.S. auto market. The U.S. luxury market is the second biggest luxury market in the world, but its performance in 2016 has been sub-par. Apart from Mercedes-Benz and Lincoln, sales of the luxury brands of all major auto makers have declined on a year-over-year basis in this year. Lexus has met with the same fate, but its performance in the luxury SUV market has meant that it has overtaken BMW as the second highest selling luxury brand in the U.S. \nLexus ended 2015 with just over 344,600 units sold, a 10.7% year-over-year increase. BMW ended 2015 with 346,000 units sold, a 1.9% year over year increase. So far in 2016, Lexus has seen its overall sales decline by 4.7% while BMW has seen its sales decline by 9%. This has meant that Lexus is now the second highest selling luxury brand in the U.S. luxury market in 2016. However, if one breaks down Lexus' sales performance in 2016, Toyota's luxury brand has seen its car sales decline by 18.2% compared to 2015. The worrying thing for Lexus is that sales of almost all car models of the brand have declined in high double digit rates. In contrast, Lexus' SUV sales have increased by 6.5%. Luckily for the brand, it has been able to grow the sales of its highest selling model the SUV RX by 8% and the sales of the SUV NX by close to 20% bring it close to being the second highest selling car model for the brand. \nHave more questions about auto companies?

      "text": "Neal Ungerleider 12.03.16 6:11 AM \nWhat may be the next big thing in the global ride-sharing movement is already tooling around on the streets of Grenoble, France. \nThere, you'll find a curious-looking three-wheeled vehicle (two in the front, one in the back) that looks part bumper car, part Tron Lightcycle. Meet Toyota's electric I-Road . \nGrenoble is one of several cities around the globe where the Japanese auto maker is experimenting with newfangled urban mobility vehicles designed for short rides around crowded streets. There are pickup points around Grenoble to rent the I-Roads, similar to what Zipcar or Maven offer in the U.S. The vehicles are dutifully lined up at charging kiosks much the way Citibikes are in New York City . \nThe one-person I-Road, showcased at the Los Angeles Auto Show this past November, is about 7.5 feet long and 3 feet wide, and reaches speeds of up to 35 miles per hour. It has a roof, meaning it can be used comfortably in rainy weather. \nDrivers use the single rear tire to steer—an experience that Toyota says is closer to boating than conventional auto driving. One of the more fascinating things about the I-Road, as shown in company videos, is that drivers lean into turns, similar to riding a motorcycle. But because the I-Road self-balances and shifts the vehicle’s weight automatically, the experience is much closer to that of riding a car. \nToyota isn't saying what the I-Road will cost or when or if it will be available in the U.S., although further events in the U.S. to show it off are planned. Designing Cars For Cities \nJana Hartline, Toyota's environmental communications manager, said it is intended for urban settings where traffic moves at slower speeds, and parking is at a premium. The I-Road parking footprint is similar to that of a motorcycle or a Vespa-style scooter, making it easy to navigate through tight spaces. \nThe I-Road shares characteristics with other experimental transport efforts, notably the three-wheeled cars produced by Arizona’s Elio Motors . Elio (which was also at the L.A. Auto Show) doesn’t have their $7,300 three-wheeled car on the market yet, but it follows a similar template. \nAlthough Elio’s car looks a bit more \"carlike\" than the I-Road, they share DNA: Both are tiny, three-wheeled electric vehicles designed for city driving and custom-made for navigating a crammed Target parking lot or finding street parking. \nAs this video shows, the I-Road does pretty well in dense urban environments like Paris: \nFor Toyota, the I-Road is still one experiment among a sea of projects designed to get market share in the coming years. Convincing drivers to take a chance on something that is so radically different from what's now on the motor vehicle market will take liberal amounts of both word-of-mouth marketing and conventional advertising. The Fleet Future \nHartline, however, adds that there is one important place Toyota sees the I-Road fitting in: Car-sharing fleets. Toyota dipped its toes into car sharing in the U.S. earlier this year, thanks to a partnership with startup Getaround. \nAccording to EV Obsession , an industry blog, testing of the I-Road in Grenoble began two years ago and will conclude in August 2017. The average trip in the I-Road is approximately 3.1 miles, and they are primarily picked up at train stations by commuters looking for quick rides home. In 2014, Grenoble began an electric car-share program that allows the quick rental of I-Roads and more conventional electric cars at 27 stations scattered around the city. \nFurther tests, Toyota says, are planned.

      "text": "Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks.\nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer.\nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions.\nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years.\nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end.\nNEW VEHICLES TO SEE AT THE AUTO SHOW: From all-new 2018 performance crossovers like the Alfa Romeo Stelvio to the first-ever Volkswagen Atlas seven-seat family SUV, not to mention a few sports cars and off-road trucks in between, the auto show season will feature plenty of new vehicles.\nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future.\nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck.\n\"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations.\nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm.\n\"They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,\" Schuster said. \"Unless there's some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it's going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.\"\nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won't return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said.\nAssociated Press\n Automotive Industry Trucks, SUVs and Crossovers North American International Auto Show in Detroit",

      "text": "What may be the next big thing in the global ride-sharing movement is already tooling around on the streets of Grenoble, France.\nThere, you&apos;ll find a curious-looking three-wheeled vehicle (two in the front, one in the back) that looks part bumper car, part Tron Lightcycle. Meet Toyota&apos;s electric I-Road .\nGrenoble is one of several cities around the globe where the Japanese auto maker is experimenting with newfangled urban mobility vehicles designed for short rides around crowded streets. There are pickup points around Grenoble to rent the I-Roads, similar to what Zipcar or Maven offer in the U.S. The vehicles are dutifully lined up at charging kiosks much the way Citibikes are in New York City .\nThe one-person I-Road, showcased at the Los Angeles Auto Show this past November, is about 7.5 feet long and 3 feet wide, and reaches speeds of up to 35 miles per hour. It has a roof, meaning it can be used comfortably in rainy weather.\nDrivers use the single rear tire to steer—an experience that Toyota says is closer to boating than conventional auto driving. One of the more fascinating things about the I-Road, as shown in company videos, is that drivers lean into turns, similar to riding a motorcycle. But because the I-Road self-balances and shifts the vehicle’s weight automatically, the experience is much closer to that of riding a car.\nToyota isn&apos;t saying what the I-Road will cost or when or if it will be available in the U.S., although further events in the U.S. to show it off are planned.\nDesigning Cars For Cities Jana Hartline, Toyota&apos;s environmental communications manager, said it is intended for urban settings where traffic moves at slower speeds, and parking is at a premium. The I-Road parking footprint is similar to that of a motorcycle or a Vespa-style scooter, making it easy to navigate through tight spaces.\nThe I-Road shares characteristics with other experimental transport efforts, notably the three-wheeled cars produced by Arizona’s Elio Motors . Elio (which was also at the L.A. Auto Show) doesn’t have their $7,300 three-wheeled car on the market yet, but it follows a similar template.\nAlthough Elio’s car looks a bit more \"carlike\" than the I-Road, they share DNA: Both are tiny, three-wheeled vehicles designed for city driving and custom-made for navigating a crammed Target parking lot or finding street parking.\nAs this video shows, the I-Road does pretty well in dense urban environments like Paris:\nFor Toyota, the I-Road is still one experiment among a sea of projects designed to get market share in the coming years. Convincing drivers to take a chance on something that is so radically different from what&apos;s now on the motor vehicle market will take liberal amounts of both word-of-mouth marketing and conventional advertising.\nThe Fleet Future Hartline, however, adds that there is one important place Toyota sees the I-Road fitting in: Car-sharing fleets. Toyota dipped its toes into car sharing in the U.S. earlier this year, thanks to a partnership with startup Getaround.\nAccording to EV Obsession , an industry blog, testing of the I-Road in Grenoble began two years ago and will conclude in August 2017. The average trip in the I-Road is approximately 3.1 miles, and they are primarily picked up at train stations by commuters looking for quick rides home.

      "text": "By John Goreham G+ 2016-12-06 12:56 How Will Toyota Meet 2025 Fuel Efficiency Mandates? Toyota has a plan to meet the 2021 fuel efficiency mandates, and a key part is TNGA. \nThe news this week that the EPA moved quickly to lock-in a mandate from 2012 that required automakers to have an adjusted Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) of 54.5 MPG by 2025 was not that surprising. The EPA is fearful that the newly-elected President Trump will try to roll back the mandates set by the EPA and CARB so it will do what it can before the new administration can make changes. Automakers have their lobbyist to kick and scream for them, but on the whole, automakers don’t care. They can and will meet whatever mandates the government decides to assign, and the top automakers already have plans to accomplish the goals. Most are already ahead of schedule . \nToyota is in a good position to be early on any mandates. No other automaker in the U.S. sells more green cars, or more highly-fuel-efficient vehicles than does Toyota. The only real question is how many gas-guzzling Sequoias and 4Runners will Toyota be able to keep building and still maintain the average. Toyota’s Prius already meets the 2025 goals, and many of its models like the CT 200h, Camry Hybrid, and other popular hybrid models are within easy reach. \nStill, Toyota will enhance its fuel efficient drivetrains to continue to offer shoppers choices that include 8-passenger family vehicles and vehicles that can tow. To maximize its ability to offer those cars to consumers, Toyota has big plans starting with the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) powertrain units. \nToyota will use a new 2.5-liter engine with an industry best 41% thermal efficiency that combines ample torque and complex fuel management to improve on Toyota’s already impressive fuel efficiency. The engines will be available in both gasoline-direct-injection and hybrid versions. \nToyota will also modify its existing hybrid drive systems for even greater efficiency in mainstream models. New CVTs and new 9-speed and 10-speed transmissions are headed to showrooms as well. The upshot is that Toyota will increase its fleet efficiency and reduce CO2 production by about 15% over today’s models by about model year 2021. That is fully five years away, and about as long as most automakers can practically plan ahead, regardless of what they hope to achieve or announce in press releases. After all, 2012 was only four years ago. A lot can change in half a decade.",

      "text": "Toyota plans to reveal a new version of America's top-selling sedan next month at a time when U.S. buyers are moving away from cars toward SUVs and trucks.\nThe Japanese automaker said Thursday that it would show off the 2018 Camry at Detroit's North American International Auto Show in January. It is likely to arrive in showrooms late next summer.\nToyota gave few details about the eighth-generation Camry, which last was redesigned for the 2013 model year. Typically Toyota redesigns the interior, exterior and suspension, but it also has added new engines and transmissions.\nA teaser photo of the car shows a more rakish, sportier look, something the Camry has lacked for years.\nSales of cars have been slumping as consumers take advantage of cheap gasoline and buy SUVs and trucks. Experts are not expecting gas prices to rise significantly anytime soon. For the past three months, trucks and SUVs were around 60 percent of U.S. sales, an unprecedented streak that industry analysts do not expect to end.\nToyota is hoping the new version will boost Camry sales, which are down 9.4 percent to just over 355,000 through November. While they concede the car may soon be outsold by Toyota's RAV4 small SUV, they expect Camry to remain the top-selling sedan for the foreseeable future.\nNEW VEHICLES TO SEE AT THE AUTO SHOW: From all-new 2018 performance crossovers like the Alfa Romeo Stelvio to the first-ever Volkswagen Atlas seven-seat family SUV, not to mention a few sports cars and off-road trucks in between, the auto show season will feature plenty of new vehicles.\nSo far this year, Toyota has sold nearly 315,000 RAV4s. The Camry for several months has been outsold by the Honda CR-V, another small SUV. But the car still is solidly in first place as the most popular vehicle in America that isn't a pickup truck.\n\"It's possible that Camry would be the No. 1 sedan, but the No. 1 Toyota could be a RAV4,\" said Bob Carter, Toyota's senior vice president of auto operations.\nA redesigned Camry should boost sales in a declining segment, but it might not help the Camry that much since competitors already are sleek and sporty, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting for the LMC Automotive consulting firm.\n\"They are very late to the game from a styling and performance perspective,\" Schuster said. \"Unless there's some new technology that leapfrogs them over cars today, it's going to be really challenging to get much of a lift out of the new vehicle.\"\nMidsize cars have declined from around 2.4 million in U.S. sales in the early 2000s to around 2.2 million expected this year, Schuster said. Due to the decline, the Camry probably won't return to the 430,000 sales it had in 2015, he said.\nAssociated Press\n Automotive Industry Trucks, SUVs and Crossovers Toyota Motor Corp.
