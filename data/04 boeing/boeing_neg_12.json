      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that Boeing's contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled because of cost overruns.\n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\"\nBoeing won the contract in January 2015. But it wasn't much of a competition. Boeing's 747-8 was the only plane made in the United States that could meet the requirements for the presidential aircraft while also being \"consistent with the national public interest,\" Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement at the time.\nShe insisted that the Pentagon \"will insist upon program affordability through cost-conscious procurement practices.\"\nThe Air Force and Boeing didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nRichard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, said Trump's tweet was \"completely nonsensical and based on exactly nothing. But it's very difficult to adjudicate on complicated program management and military requirements questions with Twitter as your medium.\"\n\"Air Force One has unique communications, safety and self-protection features so that the president can function under the most trying circumstances - like nuclear war,\" Loren Thompson, a defense consultant said. \"The price tag is driven by the demands of the mission.\"\nThe plane is expected to reach its initial operational capability by 2023.\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune",

      "text": "Trump plane (Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images) 5362384 \nPresident-elect Donald Trump wants Boeing Co. to stop building the new plane Air Force One, saying that the “costs are out of control” in a tweet Monday morning. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\n“The plane is totally out of control,” Trump told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower Monday. “It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,” Trump said. \nIt’s unclear where the “more than $4 billion” estimate comes from, or what order Trump is referring to. The White House made an urgent request for planes to replace the existing aircraft, which will be 30 years old next year, in November. After a certain age, it costs more to maintain an aircraft than to replace it. \nThe overall budget to replace the fleet is budgeted for $1.6 billion, according to budget documents from 2015 . \nThe Daily Caller News Foundation has not received a response from Boeing and the Air Force. \nSend tips to [email protected] .

      "text": "NEW YORK (CNN) – Donald Trump wants to cancel a government order for a new Air Force One.\nThe president-elect said in a tweet early Tuesday that the new Boeing 747 jet that’s being built to carry “future presidents” already costs more than $4 billion, and that he wants to cancel the order.\n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!”\nThe new Air Force One would be a 747-8, rather than the 747-200 which is now in use by President Obama. It has a longer range, can travel faster with a heavier maximum takeoff weight and it gets better fuel economy.\nBoeing, which is the nation’s largest exporter, has built the plane used by every president since Franklin Roosevelt. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n ",

      "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday called for the cancellation of a Defense Department contract with Boeing to build the next generation of presidential aircraft, decrying the deal as too expensive. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” the president-elect wrote on Twitter. Story Continued Below \nLater Tuesday morning, Trump spoke briefly with the assembled media in the lobby of Trump Tower, where he elaborated on his Twitter post decrying Boeing's Air Force One project. \n“The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous,\" he said. \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nThe Pentagon announced the deal with Boeing last January, awarding an initial contract worth nearly $26 million for initial research for the new planes, according to Reuters . The Defense Department awarded an additional $127.3 million contract in July to develop interior, power and electronic specifications for the next-generation aircraft, according to FlightGlobal , a publication that covers the aviation industry. \nThe Air Force said previously that it had earmarked $1.65 billion for two new presidential aircraft, which will be four-engine Boeing 747-8s. \nIn addition to the presidential aircraft that Trump will fly on as president, the Manhattan billionaire maintains a personal fleet that includes two planes and three helicopters. The New York Times reported last April that four of Trump's five aircraft are more than 20 years old, which is rare for someone of the president-elect's wealth. According to the Times, Trump's largest, and favorite, aircraft from the fleet is his 1991 Boeing 757, which has brushed 24-karat gold fixtures and leather toilet seats.",

The Dow closed at a record high the day before. \nDow component Boeing lost altitude — more than 1%, initially — after a tweet from Donald Trump criticizing the cost of the company's deal to build a new Air Force One.

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday demanded that the U.S. Air Force cancel its Air Force One contract with Boeing , claiming that “costs are out of control.”\nTrump’s tweet claimed the cost of the new Air Force One fleet was $4 billion, but it’s not clear what that figure refers to. In January, the U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing a preliminary contract worth $25.8 million, Reuters reported . Further details about the contract have not been released, but the Air Force previously designated $1.65 for two Air Force One replacement jets, according to Reuters.\nBoeing shares fell slightly after Trump’s tweet. The company had been planning to replace the current Air Force One fleet, Boeing 747-200s, with Boeing 747-8 jets.\n“The plane is totally out of control,” Trump told reporters in Trump Tower on Tuesday, according to a pool report. “It's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nEarlier this year, Trump criticized the age and condition of Air Force One.\nBoeing and the U.S. Air Force did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.",

Officials have said the next Air Force One jets are estimated to begin operations in fiscal 2023. \nThe Air Force expects the planes to have the range to fly between continents and comparable interiors to the current 747, whose features include work and sleeping quarters for the president and first family. \nBoeing fell 0.7 per cent to US$151.07 before the start of regular trading in New York. A representative of the Chicago-based planemaker wasn't immediately available for comment. \nBLOOMBERG Sign up for BT Newsletters Please wait ",

Cancel order!” Trump tweeted. \nBoeing won the contract in January 2015. But it wasn’t much of a competition. Boeing’s Everett-built 747-8 was the only plane made in the United States that could meet the requirements for the presidential aircraft while also being “consistent with the national public interest,” Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement at the time. \nShe insisted that the Pentagon “will insist upon program affordability through cost-conscious procurement practices.” \nThe Air Force and Boeing didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. \nRichard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, said Trump’s tweet was “completely nonsensical and based on exactly nothing. But it’s very difficult to adjudicate on complicated program management and military requirements questions with Twitter as your medium.” \n“Air Force One has unique communications, safety and self-protection features so that the president can function under the most trying circumstances – like nuclear war,” Loren Thompson, a defense consultant said. “The price tag is driven by the demands of the mission.” \nThe plane is expected to reach its initial operational capability by 2023.

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock \nIn a tweet posted Monday morning, President-Elect Donald Trump said he wanted to cancel the order placed in January 2015 with Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) for a pair of 747-8s that are destined to be the new presidential plane, Air Force One.\nIn a sole source contract, the U.S. Air Force named Boeing as the manufacturer to replace the current fleet of two presidential aircraft. The new planes will be built on Boeing’s 747-8 platform and replace the current Air Force One fleet that operates specially configured 747-200Bs.\nHere’s Trump’s tweet:\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\nThe price for the two planes was not specified at the time, but the list price for one 747-8 is $378.5 million, which works out to $757 million for two. But that is only a portion of the $4 billion cost Trump cited.\nThe president-elect later told reporters in the lobby of the Trump Tower Tuesday morning, “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.”\nHere is a comment made by Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James when the contract award was announced nearly two years ago:\nThe unspecified “fully missionized” is where the money goes. Boeing is probably selling the actual airplanes to the government at well below the list price.\nAerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia told the Washington Post this morning that Trump’s tweet “was completely nonsensical and based on exactly nothing.” Defense analyst Loren Thompson told the Post:\nAir Force One has unique communications, safety and self-protection features so that the president can function under the most trying circumstances — like nuclear war. The price tag is driven by the demands of the mission.\nThe Trumpian tweet sent Boeing’s stock down about 0.9% Tuesday morning to trade at $150.90, in a 52-week range of $102.10 to $153.755.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   ",

      "text": "The president-elect is not happy with his future airplane.\nDonald Trump lashed out at airplane manufacturer Boeing for the exorbitantly high cost of the Air Force One plane currently being built.\n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Trump said Tuesday morning on Twitter .\nTrump told reporters huddling at Trump Tower later in the morning that “The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nThe Air Force ordered the plane in 2015, when the price tag was estimated at $3 billion. It’s not scheduled for delivery before 2023 — so Trump himself would only have use of the plane for the last year or two of his presidency should he be re-elected.\nThe new plane will reportedly be capable of midair refueling, be equipped to deal with be the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear explosion and be able defend against heat-seeking missiles.\nObama called Air Force One the perk he will miss most. “People sometimes ask me what the biggest perk of being president is,” he told a White House crowd in October 2015. “No. 1 is the plane.”\nTrump, however, has been a critic of the current airplane being used to shuttle the president around.\n“Air Force One is a very old Boeing 747. It sucks up a lot of gas. A lot of fuel. Boy, the fuel bill,” the then-presidential candidate said in July.\n“A very old Air Force One, an old Boeing 747, with the old engines and, you know, spewing stuff,” Trump said last December.\nInterestingly, Trump himself has a Boeing aircraft — a 757 — that was a frequent backdrop to his campaign rallies throughout the presidential election.\nBut the real-estate mogul did not buy the plane directly from Boeing. In 2010, Trump reportedly paid $100 million to purchase Trump Force One from Microsoft co-founder Pall Allen.\nThe move is not without precedent. President Obama cancelled a more than $13 billion contract with Lockheed Martin Corp. to build the president’s helicopter, Marine One.\nThe Navy touted the move at the time as “allow[ing] the government to reduce program expenditures and take necessary steps to secure government property, preserve government equities and retain options for future decisions.”\nBoeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy",

      "text": "Donald Trump has threatened aerospace giant Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) that he may cancel the next fleet of presidential jets because the costs have risen too high. In a tweet, the US President–elect said the costs were out of control and followed that up with an accusation the aerospace giant was ‘doing a number’ on the government over. \"Well the plane is totally out of control, it's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One [the President’s jet] program,\" Trump said. \"I think it's ridiculous, I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. “We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" Boeing made no comment on the remarks. Trump already owns his Boeing jet, a 757 with his name emblazoned on the fuselage. He acquired the plane in 2011 and is said to consider it a prize possession. It’s nickname has already been changed from T-bird to Trump Force One. The plane boasts gold-plated seats, A home cinema and two bedrooms, but is much smaller than the official presidential plane with 43 seats compared 102 nor does it have the military enhancements such as anti-missile defences. The newly-elected President used his plane to fly to a meeting with current President Barack Obama shortly after he was confirmed as the victor in the election.",

Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\nThe cost of the two new 747s, Trump says at over $4 billion, is out of control.\n“Cancel order!” he wrote on Twitter. \nLater, Trump told reporters the costs are ridiculous: “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nBoeing is expected to deliver the 747-8 for presidential use in 2023, which would be toward the end of a second Trump administration. The current Air Force One, in use since 1990, is a Boeing 747-200. \nThe new Air Force One would be larger, faster and have a greater range than the current planes. It would also be more environmentally friendly, Boeing says. \nAs of 9:45 a.m., Boeing stock was down about $1, trading at $151.13 a share. \nAsked for comment about Trump’s statements, Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher told the Associated Press, “We are going to have to get back to you after we figure out what’s going on.”\n",

      "text": "Citing cost overruns, Trump says Boeing's contract to build Air Force One should be canceled By Christian Davenport, The Washington Post CHRISTIAN DAVENPORT Washington Post I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged President Barack Obama arrives on Air Force One at Orlando International Airport on Thursday, June 16, 2016. President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden traveled to Orlando to meet with families of those killed in the mass shooting that left 49 dead at the Pulse nightclub in the early morning hours of Sunday, June 12. LOREN ELLIOTT | Times \nPresident-elect Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that Boeing's contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled because of cost overruns. Related News/Archive Trump says Clinton's bodyguards should 'disarm immediately' and 'see what happens to her' (w/video) 2 Months Ago \nBoeing won the contract in January 2015. But it wasn't much of a competition. Boeing's 747-8 was the only plane made in the United States that could meet the requirements for the presidential aircraft while also being \"consistent with the national public interest,\" Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement at the time. \nShe insisted that the Pentagon \"will insist upon program affordability through cost-conscious procurement practices.\" \nThe Air Force and Boeing didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \nRichard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, said Trump's tweet was \"completely nonsensical and based on exactly nothing. But it's very difficult to adjudicate on complicated program management and military requirements questions with Twitter as your medium.\" \n\"Air Force One has unique communications, safety and self-protection features so that the president can function under the most trying circumstances — like nuclear war,\" Loren Thompson, a defense consultant said.\"The price tag is driven by the demands of the mission.\" \nThe plane is expected to reach its initial operational capability by 2023. Citing cost overruns, Trump says Boeing's contract to build Air Force One should be canceled   10:16am]",

      "text": "Boeing\nNew orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in nearly 1-1/2 years in October, further evidence that the manufacturing sector is gradually recovering after a prolonged downturn.\nThe Commerce Department said on Tuesday new orders for manufactured goods rose 2.7 percent after an upwardly revised 0.6 percent gain in September. That was the largest increase since June 2015 and marked four straight months of gains.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders increasing 2.6 percent in October after a previously reported 0.3 percent gain in September. Unfilled orders at factories increased 0.7 percent, the biggest rise since July 2014, ending four consecutive months of decline.\nThe report added to factory surveys in suggesting an upturn in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy. Despite signs of stability, progress is likely to be limited by renewed dollar strength in the wake of Donald Trump's victory in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.\nThe dollar's surge against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners between June 2014 and January 2016 helped to undercut manufacturing activity.\nWith the dollar rally having appeared to fade for much of the year, some of the drag had eased. But the dollar has gained 4.1 percent on a trade-weighted basis since the election.\nIn October, orders for transportation equipment jumped 12 percent, the biggest rise in a year. Motor vehicle orders, however, slipped 0.7 percent.\nThere were increases in orders for computers and electronic products, capital goods, and electrical equipment, appliances and components. Orders for machinery were unchanged.\nThe Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - rose 0.2 percent instead of the 0.4 percent increase reported last month.\nShipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, fell 0.1 percent in October instead of the previously reported 0.2 percent rise.\nThat suggested business spending on equipment will likely remain weak in the fourth quarter.\nShipments of overall factory goods increased 0.4 percent in October after rising 0.9 percent the prior month. Inventories of factory goods were flat. That left the inventories-to-shipments ratio unchanged at 1.34.\n(Editing by Paul Simao)\nRead the original article on Reuters . Copyright 2016.

Oil prices had risen more than 18 percent since last Wednesday when the producers agreed to limit output.\nInvestors are now shifting their focus to the upcoming Federal Reserve policy meeting next week, where traders see a 92 percent chance of an interest rate hike.\nU.S. stocks have climbed since the Nov. 8 election, driven by expectations of significant economic stimulus and cuts in corporate taxes and regulations under President-elect Donald Trump.\nFinancials provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 on Tuesday, but failed to counter the impact of weaker oil.\nFive of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower.\nAt 9:45 a.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average was down 18.46 points, or 0.1 percent, at 19,197.78.\nThe S&P 500 was down 1.03 points, or 0.05 percent, at 2,203.68 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.05 points, at 5,308.84.\nBoeing's shares fell 1.1 percent to $150.53, after Trump tweeted that costs of the planemaker's 747 Air Force One aircraft were \"out of control\" and that the order should be canceled. The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow.\nIntralinks soared 16.2 percent to $13.10 after Synchronoss Technologies said it would buy the cloud-based business software provider for $821 million, representing a 15.4 percent premium. Synchronoss shares were off about 12 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,429 to 1,189, for a 1.20-to-1 ratio on the upside. On the Nasdaq, 1,186 issues fell and 1,093 advanced for a 1.09-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.\nThe S&P 500 index showed 18 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 100 new highs and 5 new lows.\n(Reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",

PST December 06, 2016 The door of Air Force One (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) (Photo: AFP, 2009 AFP) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says construction of the next Air Force One -- a Boeing 747 -- should be canceled due to the costs. \nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\"The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program,\" Trump later said in the lobby of Trump Tower Tuesday. “I think its ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nBoeing did not immediately respond. The Wall Street Journal reports the two current Air Force One planes, which are heavily-modified 747-200s, are due to reach the end of their designed 30-year lifespan next year. Although Boeing has a contract to begin development on the new versions, it has not yet reached a deal to build the planes. As experts pointed out on Twitter Tuesday, the government would not just be buying one one but two 747-8s. And they aren't your average passenger jets. It would also be paying for the heavy modifications needed to make the planes into mobile command centers complete with anti-missile system and countermeasures. \nThe executive director of SPEEA, the union which represents Boeing engineers, tweeted this in response. @Reuters The Presidential airplanes aren't just fancy airplanes. They are mobile Whitehouses hardened to survive WWIII.",

If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nWASHINGTON – U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government to cancel purchase of Boeing ‘s new Air Force One plane on Tuesday, saying it was “ridiculous” and too expensive. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” said Trump in a Twitter message. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! Story continues below \nSpeaking shortly afterward to reporters in New York, Trump said, “The plane is totally out of control. I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number.” \n“We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,” added Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20. \nBoeing did not immediately return a request for comment. \nThe Air Force first announced in January 2015 that Boeing’s 747-8 would be used to replace the two current Air Force planes used to transport the U.S. president. Air Force One is one of the most visible symbols of the United States. \nDetails about the total value of the new contract have not been released, but the Air Force has previously said that it had earmarked $1.65 billion for two replacement jets. \nThe U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing Co an initial contract worth $25.8 million in January. \nU.S. presidents have used Boeing plane’s since 1943, according to the company’s website. \nThe 747-8 planes, 73 metres long with a wing span of 68 metres, can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,600 km farther than the current Air Force One. © 2016 Thomson Reuters ",

We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nBoeing made no comment on the remarks. \nTrump already owns his Boeing jet, a 757 with his name emblazoned on the fuselage. He acquired the plane in 2011 and is said to consider it a prize possession. \nIt’s nickname has already been changed from T-bird to Trump Force One. \nThe plane boasts gold-plated seats, a home cinema and two bedrooms, but is much smaller than the official presidential plane with 43 seats compared to 102 nor does it have the military enhancements such as anti-missile defences. \nThe newly-elected President pointedly used his own plane to fly to a meeting with incumbent Barack Obama shortly after his election victory.

      "text": "tweet AP \nPresident-elect Donald Trump said he canceled the new Air Force One from Boeing due to the cost. (AP Photo/John Minchillo/Ben McKeown) AP  06AM NEW YORK -- Six weeks from taking office, Donald Trump says he wants the government to cut some costs by canceling its order for a new Air Force One, the plane that carries presidents around the globe.The government has contracted with Boeing to build two or more new planes, which would go into service around 2024.That means Trump wouldn't fly on the new planes unless he pursued and won a second term. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 But the Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the current planes are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape.The contract for the planes was to be about $3 billion, but costs have been reported to be rising. Trump tweeted early Tuesday, \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\"Asked for comment, Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said, \"We are going to have to get back to you after we figure out what's going on.\"Trump now uses his own plane, also a 747, but as president he would travel aboard the Air Force jet, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment.

James Mattis as secretary of defense.Mattis' selection was being formally announced Tuesday, and Mattis will appear with Trump at the evening event in Fayetteville, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"Later this week there will be rallies in Iowa and Michigan as Trump barnstorms the country to salute his supporters who delivered the victories in the battleground states he needed to capture the White House.The North Carolina rally comes a day after Trump chose retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to be secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development , raising fresh concerns about the lack of experience some of Trump's Cabinet picks have with agencies they're now being chosen to lead.Carson, who opposed Trump in the Republican primaries, has no background in government or running a large bureaucracy.Pence defended Carson's selection, saying he was \"absolutely qualified\" for the post. MORE: President-elect Donald Trump says he's stepping out of business empire South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump's choice to be ambassador to the United Nations, has no foreign policy experience.Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood executive, is Trump's man to lead the Treasury Department but has never worked in government.And Mattis, a widely praised battlefield commander, spent decades in the Marines but now is tapped to run the nation's largest government agency, the Defense Department, with 740,000 civilian employees in addition to 1.3 million service personnel.Democrats swiftly criticized Carson's qualifications for his job. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called him a \"disconcerting and disturbingly unqualified choice.\"And New York Sen. Charles Schumer said he had \"serious concerns about Dr. Carson's lack of expertise and experience in dealing with housing issues. Someone who is as anti-government as him is a strange fit for housing secretary, to say the least.\"Carson would oversee a budget of nearly $50 billion that provides rental assistance for more than 5 million households. Demand for that assistance is high in part because housing costs are rising faster than incomes.HUD also promotes home ownership with the Federal Housing Administration underwriting about 1 in 6 mortgages issued in the U.S. The agency is charged with enforcing federal fair housing laws, too.In a statement, Trump said he was \"thrilled to nominate\" Carson, citing his \"brilliant mind\" and his passion \"about strengthening communities and families within those communities.\"Carson, who grew up poor, quickly endorsed Trump after ending his own presidential bid despite Trump noting what he called Carson's \"pathological temper.\"Carson has been coy about joining the new administration, saying shortly after Trump's election victory that he wasn't certain he'd fit into a Cabinet-style role in a job like Health and Human Services secretary.Trump's selections also highlight a frequent divide between the two major political parties in their strategies in filling out a Cabinet: In early 2009, Republicans criticized incoming President Barack Obama for not making enough selections with private-sector experience.On Monday, Trump received a fresh stream of visitors to the New York skyscraper that bears his name. His most surprising guest was Democratic former Vice President Al Gore.Transition officials said early Monday that Gore would meet with Trump's daughter, Ivanka, about climate change, which is Gore's signature issue.But Gore said he also met with Trump directly and the two had a \"very productive conversation.\"\"It was a sincere search for areas of common ground,\" said Gore, who did not detail what the men discussed. The president-elect has called man-made climate change a hoax and has pledged to undo a number of regulations designed to protect the environment. Related Topics:",

      "text": "Trump Explains Air Force One Cancellation: I Want Boeing to Make Money, ‘But Not That Much Money’ by Alex Griswold | 10:34 am, December 6th, 2016 VIDEO \nWhen explaining a Tuesday morning tweet that seemingly announced the cancellation of an updated Air Force One, president-elect Donald Trump said that while he wants Boeing to make money, he doesn’t want them to make too much on the plane. \nTrump tweeted that he was cancelling the contract based on the excessive $4 billion pricetag (where Trump got that number is unclear; previous reports indicated that the Air Force actually only budgeted around 1.6 billion for the project , for multiple planes). Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n“Sir, you tweeted about canceling the contract about the new Air Force One?” cued up a reporter. \n“Well, the plane is totally out of control,” Trump responded. “It’s going to be over $4 billion. It’s for Air Force One program, and I think it’s ridiculous.” \n“I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number,” he said. “We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nWatch above, via CNBC.",

      "text": "In this Nov. 6 file photo, military personnel salute as Air Force One, with President Barack Obama aboard, departs at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. (Jose Luis Magana / Associated Press)   7:35 A.M. Trump to Boeing: Air Force One’s $4 billion cost ‘out of control’ By Jonathan Lemire Associated Press Twitter \nNEW YORK – The government should cancel its multibillion-dollar order for new Air Force One presidential planes, Donald Trump declared Tuesday, serving notice he’s ready to jump in and start making decisions six weeks before his inauguration. \nCosts for the two Boeing 747s are “totally out of control,” Trump told reporters in the lobby of his New York skyscraper. \nThe government has contracted with Boeing to build two or more new planes, which would go into service around 2024. That means Trump wouldn’t fly on the new planes, which carry U.S. presidents around the globe, unless he pursued and won a second term. But the Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the current planes are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. \nThe contract for the planes was to be about $3 billion, but costs have been reported to be rising. Trump tweeted early Tuesday, “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” \nLater, he said the costs are ridiculous: “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money. \nThe price of Boeing stock dipped after his comments but not drastically. \nAsked for comment about Trump’s statements, Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said, “We are going to have to get back to you after we figure out what’s going on.” \nTrump now uses his own plane, a Boeing 757, but as president he would travel aboard the Air Force jet, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. \nLater Tuesday, Trump is making the second stop of this “thank you” tour in North Carolina, less than a week after his bombastic return to rallies at an Ohio appearance that felt more like a raucous campaign stop than a traditional speech by a president-to-be. \nAt that Cincinnati stop, Trump disparaged the media as “dishonest,” inspired loud “Build the wall” chants, took swipes at fellow Republicans and stunned his own aides with his surprise announcement from the stage that he was appointing retired Gen. James Mattis as secretary of defense. \nMattis’ selection was being formally announced Tuesday, and Mattis will appear with Trump at the evening event in Fayetteville, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” \nLater this week there will be rallies in Iowa and Michigan as Trump barnstorms the country to salute his supporters who delivered the victories in the battleground states he needed to capture the White House. \nThe North Carolina rally comes a day after Trump chose retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to be secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, raising fresh concerns about the lack of experience some of Trump’s Cabinet picks have with agencies they’re now being chosen to lead. \nCarson, who opposed Trump in the Republican primaries, has no background in government or running a large bureaucracy. \nPence defended Carson’s selection, saying he was “absolutely qualified” for the post. \nSouth Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump’s choice to be ambassador to the United Nations, has no foreign policy experience. Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood executive, is Trump’s man to lead the Treasury Department but has never worked in government. And Mattis, a widely praised battlefield commander, spent decades in the Marines but now is tapped to run the nation’s largest government agency, the Defense Department, with 740,000 civilian employees in addition to 1.3 million service personnel. \nDemocrats swiftly criticized Carson’s qualifications for his job. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called him a “disconcerting and disturbingly unqualified choice.” And New York Sen. Charles Schumer said he had “serious concerns about Dr. Carson’s lack of expertise and experience in dealing with housing issues. Someone who is as anti-government as him is a strange fit for housing secretary, to say the least.” \nCarson would oversee a budget of nearly $50 billion that provides rental assistance for more than 5 million households. Demand for that assistance is high in part because housing costs are rising faster than incomes. HUD also promotes home ownership with the Federal Housing Administration underwriting about 1 in 6 mortgages issued in the U.S. The agency is charged with enforcing federal fair housing laws, too. \nIn a statement, Trump said he was “thrilled to nominate” Carson, citing his “brilliant mind” and his passion “about strengthening communities and families within those communities.” \nCarson, who grew up poor, quickly endorsed Trump after ending his own presidential bid despite Trump noting what he called Carson’s “pathological temper.” Carson has been coy about joining the new administration, saying shortly after Trump’s election victory that he wasn’t certain he’d fit into a Cabinet-style role in a job like Health and Human Services secretary. \nTrump’s selections also highlight a frequent divide between the two major political parties in their strategies in filling out a Cabinet: In early 2009, Republicans criticized incoming President Barack Obama for not making enough selections with private-sector experience.   7:35 a.m.",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that Boeing’s contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled because of the high cost of the program. “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!”\nBoeing was selected as the manufacturer in January 2015, but it wasn’t much of a competition. Boeing’s 747-8 was the only plane made in the United States that could meet the requirements for the presidential aircraft while also being “consistent with the national public interest,” Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement at the time.\nShe insisted that the Pentagon “will insist upon program affordability through cost-conscious procurement practices.”\nTalking to reporters Tuesday morning at Trump Tower in Manhattan, Trump explained his tweet: “The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program, and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nThe Air Force and Boeing didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nRichard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, said Trump’s tweet was “completely nonsensical and based on exactly nothing. But it’s very difficult to adjudicate on complicated program management and military requirements questions with Twitter as your medium.”\nLoren Thompson, a defense consultant, said that “Air Force One has unique communications, safety and self-protection features so that the president can function under the most trying circumstances – like nuclear war.” The price tag, he said, “is driven by the demands of the mission.”\nBoeing is under contract to build two planes to serve as Air Force One, said Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “I think once [Trump] sees an actual Air Force One and the unique capabilities it is outfitted with he may start to understand why it is so expensive to replace,” Harrison said.\nAir Force one is a symbol of presidential power at home and abroad. But it is also a “flying command post,” as Harrison said. “In the event of a nuclear attack, this is where the military will keep the president safe,” he said.\nTrump’s tweet was reminiscent of when Sen. John McCain took aim at the fleet of presidential helicopters at the beginning of the Obama administration, saying in 2009, “I don’t think that there’s any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money.”\nPresident Barack Obama, then just a few weeks in office, said the fleet was “an example of the procurement process gone amok,” leading defense officials to kill the program outright and then restart the procurement process. By then, the helicopter program was well underway and did have significant problems.\nBut Air Force One is different, Harrison said, because “it’s still very, very early. It hasn’t had a chance to have any cost overruns yet.” He said it was curious that Trump would single out Air Force One when there are so many other defense programs that have gone wildly over budget and behind schedule.\nBut this isn’t the first time Trump has highlighted the costs of Air Force One. In July, he objected to the use of the plane for campaign events: “Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary,” he tweeted. “A total disgrace!”\nHe brought it up again at a rally in North Carolina in July. “Now Air Force One is a very old Boeing 747,” Trump said. “It sucks up a lot of gas. A lot of fuel. Boy, the fuel bill. You turn on those engines, I can tell you, it’s a lot of money.”\nTrump reported owning between $50,001 and $100,000 in Boeing stock in his most recent financial disclosure, which was filed in May 2016 and disclosed his 2015 holdings.

Cancel order!\" Trump said in his tweet. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Trump then made a surprise appearance, emerging from the elevators at Trump Tower ahead of his meetings and commented on the project. Air Force One: Boeing 747-8 Selected as New Presidential Plane \"Well, the plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion. It's for Air Force One program and I think it's ridiculous,\" Trump said. \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" The Air Force announced in January that the Boeing 747-8 aircraft has been chosen as the upgrade for Air Force One from the current VC-25 model, which is also manufactured by Boeing. \"The presidential aircraft is one of the most visible symbols of the United States of America and the office of the president of the United States,\" Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James said in the statement at the time. \"The Boeing 747-8 is the only aircraft manufactured in the United States when fully missionized meets the necessary capabilities established to execute the presidential support mission, while reflecting the office of the president of the United States of America consistent with the national public interest,\" James added. The main differences between Air Force One and a regular 747 are state-of-the-art navigation, electronic and communications equipment, as well as the interior, which includes offices, a conference/dining room and living space for the president and first lady, according to Boeing's website. Boeing has long been mulling a retirement of the 747 line. The 747-8 is filled with communications gear and defensive gear and costs much more than a regular 747 aircraft. 0 Shares ",

      "text": "The Washington Post Trump says Boeing's Air Force One order should be canceled President-elect Donald Trump said the latest Air Force One order should be canceled, citing the high costs of converting the Boeing jumbo jet for presidential use.   (Reuters) \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion,\" Trump said Tuesday on Twitter. \"Cancel order!\" Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 The Pentagon is looking to replace its aging fleet of Boeing 747-200 aircraft, which will reach the planned 30-year service life in 2017. Officials have said the next Air Force One 747-8 jets are estimated to begin operations in fiscal 2023. The Air Force expects the planes to have the range to fly between continents and comparable interiors to the current 747, whose features include work and sleeping quarters for the president and first family. \"The plane is totally out of control,\" Trump said in a brief appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower on Tuesday. \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" (AP) Trump didn't specify where the $4 billion figure came from. The Air Force has budgeted about $1.6 billion through 2019. A representative of the Chicago-based planemaker wasn't immediately available for comment. Boeing is the latest major U.S. company to be called out by Trump after the president-elect negotiated a deal with United Technologies Corp. to keep more than 1,000 jobs in the U.S. Trump, who turned U.S. employment and corporate tax reform into defining issues during the campaign, has drawn both praise and criticism for directly intervening in companies' affairs. Tuesday's tweet wasn't the first time Trump has mentioned Boeing. At a February rally in South Carolina, then-candidate Trump said the company \"is building massive plants in China,\" which he said would be problematic if the Asian nation cut the value of its currency. On Sunday, discussing the deal to keep jobs in the U.S., Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on ABC's \"This Week\" that Trump would decide whether to intervene with specific companies \"on a day-by-day basis.\" In a speech Dec. 2, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg called on Trump and Congress to ensure that U.S. companies have the tools necessary to compete in a global economy. For Boeing, the largest U.S. exporter, that means a reformed tax code, a fair global trade system, regulatory changes that make it easier to close foreign defense sales and re-opening the U.S. Export-Import Bank for business, Muilenburg said in remarks to the Illinois Manufacturers' Association.

      "text": "Dubai: Boeing said on Tuesday that the sale of its business jets has slumped by fifty per cent globally when compared to last year due to a combination of various factors including low oil prices.\nThe US based aircraft manufacturing company which sells about six business jets every year sold only three this year, David Longridge, president of Boeing Business Jets told reporters at a press conference in Dubai.\n“This year has been tougher when compared to previous years due to a combination of factors including Brexit, US elections and low oil prices but things are picking up now and we are working on two or three deals currently,” said Longridge.\nOil prices have halved since 2014 impacting the economies of oil producing countries globally. From more than $110 per barrel two years ago, oil prices dropped to less than $50 per barrel in recent times.\nBoth Brexit and the US elections led to uncertainly in the market with decision makers adopting a wait and watch attitude as there was no clarity on which direction the economies are going to move. \nGiving an outlook on the Middle East growth plans, Longridge expressed optimism that business is going to increase in the coming years.\n“I am positive about sales. I am going to sell one Max 7 business jet into the Middle East this year. We are seeing more proposal activity requests in the past six months than we’ve seen in months before.”\nMiddle East is one of the important markets for business jets as many businessmen and executives own business jets to travel around the globe.\nThe company has not sold any aircraft in the region this year, he added.\nLongridge also said the Donald Trump’s win in the US election will be positive for the growth of the business in the US.\nMeanwhile, Boeing announced the sale of the first BBJ Max 7 at the Middle East Business Aviation Association event to a customer based in the Asia Pacific region. The BBJ Max 7 is longer than the original Boeing Business Jet with more space in the cabin and less operational costs.\nThe company said it has twelve BBJ Maxs on order with one BBJ Max 7, ten BBJ Max 8s and one BBJ Max 9.\nBoeing also said on Tuesday that it will work with GKN Aerospace’s Fokker business to develop, produce, offer and support the Skyview Panoramic Window, the largest window available on any passenger jet offered today.",

U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife, First Lady Michelle Obama, wave from the door of Air Force One, as they depart from the International Buenos Aires airport on their way to the resort town of Bariloche, Argentina, Thursday, March ... more > View Comments Print By S.A. Miller - The Washington Times - Updated: 10:09 a.m. on Tuesday, December 6, 2016 \nDonald Trump tweeted Tuesday that he wants to cancel the Pentagon’s order with Boeing for a new $4 billion Air Force One, as the president-elect keeps playing hardball with American businesses. \nShares of Boeing stock dropped in premarket trading after the tweet. \n“Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Mr. Trump tweeted. \nLater, Mr. Trump said the spending on the new airplane was “totally out of control.” \n“It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program, and I think it’s ridiculous,” he told reporters in a rare appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower. “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nThe Obama administration has insisted that future presidents will need the new jumbo jet. The Pentagon placed the order with Boeing last year and the plane is not expected to be in use until 2023. \nThe threat to cancel the order is the latest move by the president-elect signaling a get-tough attitude toward U.S. businesses. \nMr. Trump helped convince Carrier to reverse plans to close its Indiana factory and move to Mexico, saving 1,100 jobs. He also threatened to slap a 35 percent tariff on products from U.S. companies that move abroad.",

      "text": "Air Force Citing cost, Trump says Boeing's contract to build Air Force One should be canceled \nA Boeing 747 aircraft, used as an Air Force E-4B National Airborne Operations Center, turns to align itself for takeoff Aug. 27, 2015, at Offutt Air Force Base, Neb. \nJosh Plueger/U.S. Air Force More \nBy CHRISTIAN DAVENPORT | The Washington Post | Published: December 6, 2016 \nPresident-elect Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that Boeing's contract to build the next Air Force One should be canceled because of the high cost of the program. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \n<element> \nBoeing was selected as the manufacturer in January 2015, but it wasn't much of a competition. Boeing's 747-8 was the only plane made in the United States that could meet the requirements for the presidential aircraft while also being \"consistent with the national public interest,\" Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement at the time. \nShe insisted that the Pentagon \"will insist upon program affordability through cost-conscious procurement practices.\" \nTalking to reporters Tuesday morning at Trump Tower in Manhattan, Trump explained his tweet: \"The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program, and I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nThe Air Force and Boeing didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. \nRichard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group, said Trump's tweet was \"completely nonsensical and based on exactly nothing. But it's very difficult to adjudicate on complicated program management and military requirements questions with Twitter as your medium.\" \nLoren Thompson, a defense consultant, said that \"Air Force One has unique communications, safety and self-protection features so that the president can function under the most trying circumstances - like nuclear war.\" The price tag, he said, \"is driven by the demands of the mission.\" \nBoeing is under contract to build two planes to serve as Air Force One, said Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"I think once [Trump] sees an actual Air Force One and the unique capabilities it is outfitted with he may start to understand why it is so expensive to replace,\" Harrison said. \nAir Force one is a symbol of presidential power at home and abroad. But it is also a \"flying command post,\" as Harrison said. \"In the event of a nuclear attack, this is where the military will keep the president safe,\" he said. \nTrump's tweet was reminiscent of when Sen. John McCain took aim at the fleet of presidential helicopters at the beginning of the Obama administration, saying in 2009, \"I don't think that there's any more graphic demonstration of how good ideas have cost taxpayers an enormous amount of money.\" \nPresident Barack Obama, then just a few weeks in office, said the fleet was \"an example of the procurement process gone amok,\" leading defense officials to kill the program outright and then restart the procurement process. By then, the helicopter program was well underway and did have significant problems. \nBut Air Force One is different, Harrison said, because \"it's still very, very early. It hasn't had a chance to have any cost overruns yet.\" He said it was curious that Trump would single out Air Force One when there are so many other defense programs that have gone wildly over budget and behind schedule. \nBut this isn't the first time Trump has highlighted the costs of Air Force One. In July, he objected to the use of the plane for campaign events: \"Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary,\" he tweeted. \"A total disgrace!\" \nHe brought it up again at a rally in North Carolina in July. \"Now Air Force One is a very old Boeing 747,\" Trump said. \"It sucks up a lot of gas. A lot of fuel. Boy, the fuel bill. You turn on those engines, I can tell you, it's a lot of money.\" \nTrump reported owning between $50,001 and $100,000 in Boeing stock in his most recent financial disclosure, which was filed in May 2016 and disclosed his 2015 holdings. It is not known whether he has bought or sold the shares since then. Boeing's stock was down 0.64 percent in morning trading. \nJenna Johnson contributed to this report. previous coverage",

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon By Alexander Cornwell | DUBAI \nDUBAI Boeing ( BA.N ) sees sales of its business jets rebounding over the next two years after a \"tough\" 2016, Boeing Business Jet President David Longridge said at a press conference in Dubai on Tuesday. \nBoeing Business Jets (BBJ), which sells variants of Boeing aircraft for the corporate jet market, blames a more than halving of sales this year on the uncertainty created by Britain's Brexit vote and U.S. Presidential election. \nIn 2016, Boeing has booked sales for three business jets, all narrow body aircraft, compared to 10 in 2015, including four wide-bodies, and 14 jets in 2014, BBJ Vice President Jeff Dunn told Reuters. \n\"Now the elections are over and Brexit is decided we're starting to see things pick up,\" Longridge said. \"I think over the next two years we'll go back to the kind of six to eight airplanes that we saw more regularly in the past four years,\" he said. \nBoeing has campaigns open for three to four business jets though is unlikely to close those deals before Dec. 31, Longridge said. He later told Reuters 2016 was likely to be the low point for BBJ in terms of sales since the 2009 global financial crisis. \nBoeing's business jet division, which competes with Airbus Corporate Jets ( AIR.PA ), makes up a fraction of the company's total aircraft sales and deliveries. It delivered four dedicated models of narrow-body BBJ jets plus an unspecified number of wide-body jets for private customers in 2015, out of 762 total jetliner deliveries that year. \nLongridge on Tuesday announced Asia-Pacific-based Orient Global Aviation as the first customer of the recently announced BBJ 737 MAX 7 aircraft. \n(Additional reporting by Tim Hepher.

He later told Reuters 2016 was likely to be the low point for BBJ in terms of sales since the 2009 global financial crisis. \nBoeing's business jet division, which competes with Airbus Corporate Jets ( AIR.PA ), makes up a fraction of the company's total aircraft sales and deliveries. It delivered four dedicated models of narrow-body BBJ jets plus an unspecified number of wide-body jets for private customers in 2015, out of 762 total jetliner deliveries that year. \nLongridge on Tuesday announced Asia-Pacific-based Orient Global Aviation as the first customer of the recently announced BBJ 737 MAX 7 aircraft. \n(Additional reporting by Tim Hepher.

Cancel order!” \nThe current cost of the program is not, however, more than $4 billion. The Defense Department has budgeted $1.65 billion for the two planes, Reuters reported in January when Boeing won the contract. \nIt’s not clear if Trump will act on his threat. Later in the morning, he told reporters assembled at Trump Tower that costs are “totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One ... and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number.” \n“We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,” he added. \n“We’re going to look for ways to save money,” Trump spokesman Jason Miller said on a call with reporters on Tuesday morning. “We’ll have specifics after the president is sworn in.” \nBoeing shares fell just under 1 percent when the stock market opened. They have risen since, erasing about half of that initial decline. Miller said that Trump sold the Boeing stock he had owned in June. Trump’s transition team did not immediately provide documentation to back up Miller’s claim. \nA Boeing spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. \nThis is a developing story and will be updated.",

      "text": "Market News  37am EST Boeing says current Air Force One contract worth $170 mln \nSIMI VALLEY, Calif. Dec 6 Boeing Co on Tuesday responded to a call by President-elect Donald Trump about the costs of a new Air Force One, saying that it currently had only a $170 million contract to determine the capabilities of the new presidential aircraft. \n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer,\" said spokesman Todd Blecher. \nTrump on Tuesday said costs for the new plane were expected to reach $4 billion and urged the government to cancel a contract with Boeing for the jet. \nThe budgeted costs for the Air Force One replacement program are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021, according to budget documents. But the production contract has not yet been awarded to Boeing. \n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal)",

      "text": "\nDonald Trump told aircraft manufacturer Boeing to cancel an order for a new Air Force One, saying the project is too costly, USA Today is reporting .\nThe Air Force has been working with Boeing to design and manufacture a new presidential aircraft to replace the two aging Boeing 747-200 craft that currently serve as the official aircraft of the President of the United States. Two new, state-of-the art 747-8 planes are currently in development, with updated navigation, electronic, security and other features, expected to be available by Fiscal Year 2024. As of this writing, costs are expected to reach $3.2 billion, including $2 billion for research and development.\nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning that the new Air Force One is going to cost $4 billion; it is not clear, as of this writing, how he arrived at that number.\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nSpeaking shortly afterwards to reporters at Trump Tower, Trump explained further:\n“The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nBarack Obama boards AIr Force One. [Photo by Carsten Koall/Getty Images] Officially, according to The White House website, whatever aircraft the President happens to be flying in is given the call signal “ Air Force One .” So in the unlikely event that he were flying in, say, his buddy’s Cessna 172, that plane would be called “Air Force One” as long as he were in it. Similarly, when then-president George W. Bush famously landed on the USS Abraham Lincoln in a naval Lockheed S-3 Viking in 2003, according to The Nation , that aircraft was temporarily given the call sign “ Navy One ” (since it was a naval craft).\nUnofficially and colloquially, however, “Air Force One” refers to the two Boeing aircraft that currently serve as the President’s official aircraft. Those two aircraft date back to 1990, during the George H.W. Bush administration. And they are beginning to show their age and are not cost-effective to operate.\nThe interior of the current Air Force One. [Image by Pete Souza via Wikimedia Commons | Cropped and Resized | by Public Domain ] Whether or not Trump can compel Boeing to cancel the order for the new Air Force One remains to be seen. Currently, as President-Elect, he has no more political power than any other private citizen. He has, however, used his unofficial status as President-Elect to negotiate a deal with Indiana manufacturer Carrier to keep some jobs in the United States, according to The New York Post . Once he’s inaugurated as President in January, he may yet lack the official authority to cancel the order.\nThis is not the first time Trump has publicly called out Boeing , according to Bloomberg . Back in February, at a rally in South Carolina, Trump chided the manufacturer for “building massive plants in China.” Similarly, in 2014, Trump twice posted tweets about his concerns about Boeing’s use of lithium-ion batteries in the 787 Dreamliner aircraft.\nTrump also owns a tiny interest in Boeing (tiny for a billionaire, that is). According to a financial disclosure filed during the campaign, Trump disclosed that he owned, at the time, Boeing stock worth between $50,001 and $100,000. It is not clear, as of this writing, whether or not Trump has divested himself of that stock.\nAs of this writing, neither Boeing nor the Air Force have publicly commented on Trump’s demands that Boeing cancel the new Air Force One order.\n[Featured Image by Carsten Koall/Getty Images]\nDonald Trump Tells Boeing To Cancel Order For New, ‘$4 Billion’ Air Force One is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday called for the U.S. government to cancel a deal with aircraft manufacturer Boeing for development of a new Air Force One.\nThe Air Force signed deals with Boeing in January and July to design certain aspects of the new presidential aircraft, including its interior, electrical and power system, and maintenance systems.\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated in March that the entire program would cost about $3.2 billion from the 2010 through 2020 fiscal years, including $2 billion for research and development.\nTrump cited different numbers without providing any evidence. The military has not yet awarded a contract to actually assemble the planes.\n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" he tweeted Tuesday morning.\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Shortly after his tweet, he told reporters at Trump Tower: \"“The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nA Boeing spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. But the company said in a statement that its current deal for Air Force One development is worth $170 million.\n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer,\" Boeing said.\nAn Air Force spokesman said the military did not have an immediate comment on Trump's exhortation.\nBoeing plans to replace the two aging 747-200 aircraft that serve as Air Force One with two new, modified 747-8 planes.\nSkip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nThe Boeing 747 is set to be phased out. Here's a look back at its importance to American history. USA TODAY\nThe Air Force pledged to \"keep costs down\" when it awarded the initial development contract to Boeing in January, but said the replacements are necessary.\n\"Parts obsolescence, diminishing manufacturing sources and increased downtimes for maintenance are existing challenges that will increase until a new aircraft is fielded,” Col. Amy McCain, manager of the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program, said in a statement at the time.\nThe undersecretary of defense approved the plan to replace Air Force One in September 2015.\nThe goal was to replace the aircraft by the 2024 fiscal year.\nIt was not immediately clear Tuesday whether Trump, who owns a Boeing 757 that he uses as his personal aircraft, would or could intervene to halt the Air Force One deal after he takes office in January.\nJittery investors drove Boeing shares down 0.8% to $150.93 at 9:45 a.m.\nAs it happens, Trump himself owned Boeing shares ( BA ) as of the filing of a financial disclosure form during his presidential campaign. He owned Boeing stock worth between $50,001 and $100,000, according to his disclosure, but Miller said the president-elect sold all of his stocks in June.\nTrump has taken a special interest in the aircraft manufacturer's travails in the past. During a crisis surrounding the lithiom batteries in its 787 Dreamliner aircraft, Trump tweeted in 2013 and 2014 that the company should excise the technology from the planes.\nEarlier, though, he was ebullient about Boeing's prospects.\n\"@Boeing stock went way down because of 787- so I just bought stock in @Boeing,\" he tweeted in January 2013. \"Great company!\"\nContributing: Eliza Collins\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @ NathanBomey .\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Air Force One Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

      "text": "1 of 2 | License Photo NEW YORK, Dec. 6 (UPI) -- President-elect Donald Trump wants to cancel the government's order for the development of a new Air Force One, citing a $4 billion cost.\nThe two jets would replace the two aging 747-200 Bs by at least 2024 -- three years past Trump's tenure if he serves two terms. The current planes were delivered in 1990 and George H.W. Bush was the first president to fly in the craft.\n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" he tweeted at 5:42 a.m. Tuesday.\nThen, he told reporters at Trump Tower in New York: \"The plane is totally out of control.\n\"It's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\"\nBoeing and the Air Force did not respond to the request.\nThe Air Force hasn't formally ordered the planes but awarded a development contract in January to Boeing. It would take about two years to build the planes at Boeing's factory in Washington State.\nBoeing, which has built the planes used by every president since Franklin Roosevelt , plans to replace the two 747-200B aircraft with two new, modified 747-8 planes.\nThe Air Force has allocated $2.9 billion through 2021 for two planes, including about $93 million already spent.\n\"Parts obsolescence, diminishing manufacturing sources and increased downtimes for maintenance are existing challenges that will increase until a new aircraft is fielded,\" Col. Amy McCain, manager of the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program, said in a statement at the time.\nThe cost of a passenger version of one new 747-8 costs $356.9 million and the freight-hauling version is $357.5 million, according to 24/7 Wall St.\nA financial disclosure form filed during his presidential campaign indicates Trump owns Boeing shares worth $50,001 to $100,000.\nShares of Boeing fell about 1 percent to $151 after the tweet.\nTrump owns a Boeing 757 as his personal aircraft\n Biggest Airbus 350 makes debut in France Canada considers buying 18 F/A-18 Super Hornets Boeing to consolidate defense and space sites Boeing gets $478 million F-15 electronic warfare system contract",

      "text": "Trump tweets 'cancel' $4B Boeing deal for new Air Force One Nathan Bomey, USA TODAY , KHOU 10:00 AM. CST December 06, 2016 CONNECT   \n  on Tuesday called for the U.S. government to cancel a deal with aircraft manufacturer Boeing for development of a new Air Force One. \nThe Air Force signed deals with Boeing in January and July to design certain aspects of the new presidential aircraft, including its interior, electrical and power system, and maintenance systems. \nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated in March that the entire program would cost about $3.2 billion from the 2010 through 2020 fiscal years, including $2 billion for research and development. \nTrump cited different numbers without providing any evidence. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" he tweeted Tuesday morning. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nShortly after his tweet, he told reporters at Trump Tower: \"“The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nA Boeing spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An Air Force spokesman said the military did not have an immediate comment on Trump's exhortation. \nBoeing plans to replace the two aging 747-200 aircraft that serve as Air Force One with two new, modified 747-8 planes. \nThe Air Force pledged to \"keep costs down\" when it awarded the initial development contract to Boeing in January, but said the replacements are necessary. \n\"Parts obsolescence, diminishing manufacturing sources and increased downtimes for maintenance are existing challenges that will increase until a new aircraft is fielded,” Col. Amy McCain, manager of the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program, in a statement at the time. \nThe undersecretary of defense approved the plan to replace Air Force One in September 2015. \nThe goal was to replace the aircraft by the 2024 fiscal year. \nIt was not immediately clear Tuesday whether Trump, who owns a Boeing 757 that he uses as his personal aircraft, would or could intervene to halt the Air Force One deal after he takes office in January. \nJittery investors drove Boeing shares down 0.8% to $150.93 at 9:45 a.m. \nAs it happens, Trump himself owned Boeing shares ( BA ) as of the filing of a financial disclosure form during his presidential campaign. He owned Boeing stock worth between $50,001 and $100,000, according to his disclosure. \nTrump has taken a special interest in the aircraft manufacturer's trevails in the past. During a crisis surrounding the lithiom batteries in its 787 Dreamliner aircraft, Trump tweeted twice in 2014 that the company should excise the technology from the planes. \nEarlier that year, though, he was ebullient about Boeing's prospects. \n\"@Boeing stock went way down because of 787- so I just bought stock in @Boeing,\" he tweeted in January 2013. \"Great company!\" \nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @ NathanBomey .",

      "text": "Gene J. Puskar By JONATHAN LEMIRE Published December 6, 2016, 11:37 AM EDT \nNEW YORK (AP) â The government should cancel its multibillion-dollar order for new Air Force One presidential planes, Donald Trump declared Tuesday, serving notice he's ready to jump in and start making decisions six weeks before his inauguration. \nCosts for the two Boeing 747s are \"totally out of control,\" Trump told reporters in the lobby of his New York skyscraper. \nThe government has contracted with Boeing to build two or more new planes, which would go into service around 2024. That means Trump wouldn't fly on the new planes, which carry U.S. presidents around the globe, unless he pursued and won a second term. But the Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the current planes are becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. \nThe contract for the planes was to be about $3 billion, but costs have been reported to be rising. Trump tweeted early Tuesday, \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" \nLater, he said the costs are ridiculous: \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money. \nThe price of Boeing stock dipped after his comments but not drastically. \nAsked for comment about Trump's statements, Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said, \"We are going to have to get back to you after we figure out what's going on.\" \nTrump now uses his own plane, a Boeing 757, but as president he would travel aboard the Air Force jet, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. \nLater Tuesday, Trump is making the second stop of this \"thank you\" tour in North Carolina, less than a week after his bombastic return to rallies at an Ohio appearance that felt more like a raucous campaign stop than a traditional speech by a president-to-be. \nAt that Cincinnati stop, Trump disparaged the media as \"dishonest,\" inspired loud \"Build the wall\" chants, took swipes at fellow Republicans and stunned his own aides with his surprise announcement from the stage that he was appointing retired Gen. James Mattis as secretary of defense. \nMattis' selection was being formally announced Tuesday, and Mattis will appear with Trump at the evening event in Fayetteville, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \nLater this week there will be rallies in Iowa and Michigan as Trump barnstorms the country to salute his supporters who delivered the victories in the battleground states he needed to capture the White House. \nThe North Carolina rally comes a day after Trump chose retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to be secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, raising fresh concerns about the lack of experience some of Trump's Cabinet picks have with agencies they're now being chosen to lead. \nCarson, who opposed Trump in the Republican primaries, has no background in government or running a large bureaucracy. \nPence defended Carson's selection, saying he was \"absolutely qualified\" for the post. \nSouth Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump's choice to be ambassador to the United Nations, has no foreign policy experience. Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood executive, is Trump's man to lead the Treasury Department but has never worked in government. And Mattis, a widely praised battlefield commander, spent decades in the Marines but now is tapped to run the nation's largest government agency, the Defense Department, with 740,000 civilian employees in addition to 1.3 million service personnel. \nDemocrats swiftly criticized Carson's qualifications for his job. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called him a \"disconcerting and disturbingly unqualified choice.\" And New York Sen. Charles Schumer said he had \"serious concerns about Dr. Carson's lack of expertise and experience in dealing with housing issues. Someone who is as anti-government as him is a strange fit for housing secretary, to say the least.\" \nCarson would oversee a budget of nearly $50 billion that provides rental assistance for more than 5 million households. Demand for that assistance is high in part because housing costs are rising faster than incomes. HUD also promotes home ownership with the Federal Housing Administration underwriting about 1 in 6 mortgages issued in the U.S. The agency is charged with enforcing federal fair housing laws, too. \nIn a statement, Trump said he was \"thrilled to nominate\" Carson, citing his \"brilliant mind\" and his passion \"about strengthening communities and families within those communities.\" \nCarson, who grew up poor, quickly endorsed Trump after ending his own presidential bid despite Trump noting what he called Carson's \"pathological temper.\" Carson has been coy about joining the new administration, saying shortly after Trump's election victory that he wasn't certain he'd fit into a Cabinet-style role in a job like Health and Human Services secretary. \nTrump's selections also highlight a frequent divide between the two major political parties in their strategies in filling out a Cabinet: In early 2009, Republicans criticized incoming President Barack Obama for not making enough selections with private-sector experience. \n___ \nReach Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire \n___ \nAP Writer Joseph Pisani contributed \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "View Comments U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged the government to cancel purchase of Boeing's new Air Force One plane on Tuesday, saying it was \"ridiculous\" and too expensive. \"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" said Trump in a Twitter message. Speaking shortly afterward to reporters in New York, Trump said, \"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number.\" \"We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" added Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20. Boeing did not immediately return a request for comment. The Air Force first announced in January 2015 that Boeing's 747-8 would be used to replace the two current Air Force planes used to transport the U.S. president. Air Force One is one of the most visible symbols of the United States. Details about the total value of the new contract have not been released, but the Air Force has previously said that it had earmarked $1.65 billion for two replacement jets. The U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing Co an initial contract worth $25.8 million in January. U.S. presidents have used Boeing plane's since 1943, according to the company's website. The 747-8 planes, 240 feet long (73 meters) long with a wing span of 224 feet (68 meters), can fly direct from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 km) farther than the current Air Force One. - Reuters",

      "title": "Trump calls for cancel of Boeing’s new Air Force One planes",
      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — The government should cancel its multibillion-dollar order for new Air Force One presidential planes, Donald Trump declared Tuesday, serving notice he’s ready to jump in and start making decisions six weeks before his inauguration. \nCosts for the two Boeing 747s are “totally out of control,” Trump told reporters in the lobby of his New York skyscraper. \nThe government has contracted with Boeing to build the planes, which would go into service around 2024. That means Trump wouldn’t fly on the aircraft, which carry U.S. presidents around the globe, unless he pursued and won a second term. But the Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the current version is becoming too expensive to repair and keep in good flying shape. \nThe contract for the planes was to be about $3 billion, but costs have been reported to be rising. Trump tweeted early Tuesday, “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” \nLater, he said the costs are ridiculous: “I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nThe price of Boeing stock dipped after his comments but not drastically. Trump had tweeted in 2013 that he owned Boeing stock, but a spokesman said Tuesday he sold all of his stocks in June. \nThe company said in a statement, “We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.” \nTrump now uses his own plane, a Boeing 757, which he has outfitted with white leather and gold, a large flat-screen television and a bedroom. But as presi dent it is expected that he would travel aboard the Air Force jet, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. Air Force One also has seating for reporters; Trump generally does not allow the press on his own plane.\nLater Tuesday, Trump will be using his 757 to travel to the second stop of his “thank you” tour, in North Carolina, less than a week after his return to rallies at an Ohio appearance that felt more like a raucous campaign stop than a traditional speech by a president-to-be.\nAt that Cincinnati stop, Trump disparaged the media as “dishonest,” inspired loud “Build the wall” chants, took swipes at fellow Republicans and stunned his own aides with his surprise announcement from the stage that he was appointing retired Gen. James Mattis as secretary of defense.\nMattis’ selection was being formally announced Tuesday, and he is to appear with Trump at the evening event in Fayetteville.\nLater this week there will be rallies in Iowa and Michigan as Trump barnstorms the country to salute his supporters who delivered victories in the battleground states he needed to capture the White House. And on Saturday, Trump will attend the 117th annual Army-Navy football game, spending half the game on Navy’s side of the stadium and the other half on Army’s side. The game between the two military academies often draws the commander in chief; both Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush have attended in recent years.\nBefore leaving for North Carolina Tuesday, Trump was slated to hold a number of meetings in New York, including with Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil; Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, who is meeting about a diplomatic post, and radio host Laura Ingraham who is being considered for press secretary.\nThose interviews come a day after Trump chose retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to be secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, raising fresh concerns about the lack of experience some of Trump’s Cabinet picks have with agencies they’re now being chosen to lead.\nCarson, who opposed Trump in the Republican primaries, has no background in government or running a large bureaucracy.\nSouth Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump’s choice to be ambassador to the United Nations, has no foreign policy experience. Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and Hollywood executive, is Trump’s man to lead the Treasury Department but has never worked in government. And Mattis, a widely praised battlefield commander, spent decades in the Marines but now is tapped to run the nation’s largest government agency, the Defense Department, with 740,000 civilian employees in addition to 1.3 million service personnel.\nCarson would oversee a budget of nearly $50 billion that provides rental assistance for more than 5 million households. Demand for that assistance is high in part because housing costs are rising faster than incomes. HUD also promotes home ownership with the Federal Housing Administration underwriting about 1 in 6 mortgages issued in the U.S. The agency is charged with enforcing federal fair housing laws, too.\n",

      "text": "\n\nBoeing stocks tumbled Tuesday after president-elect Donald Trump tweeted about canceling a $4bn order for a new Air Force One. But it was a typical Trumpism: the number is plucked out of nowhere , and Boeing was forced to publicize the fact it's only got the U.S. Government on the hook for $170m, and that the two planes, if ordered, would be $850m each.\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/806134244384899072 “The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous,\" he said. \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nThe president-elect's most recent financial disclosure form, filed in May and detailing his 2015 holdings, showed that the Manhattan billionaire owned between $50,001 and $100,000 worth of stock in Boeing, a purchase he announced on Twitter in 2013. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump, said Tuesday morning that Trump sold all of his stocks last June. \nMiller added that the exact details of Trump's desire to cancel the Boeing order would be dealt with after he is inaugurated next month. \nBoeing's stocks rebounded later in the morning as it became apparent Trump was saying untrue things. \n(Maybe he doesn't want to fly on it. Same as not wanting to live in the White House.) ",

      "text": "Trump seeks to ground costs of new Air Force One with Boeing Tue Dec 6, 2016 5:07pm GMT [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Amy Tennery \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday urged the government to cancel an order with Boeing Co to develop a revamped Air Force One - one of the most prominent symbols of the U.S. presidency - saying costs were out of control. \nTrump, who takes office on Jan. 20, pledged during his unconventional campaign for the White House that he would put his skills as a businessman to work for taxpayers, and had griped about the cost of President Barack Obama's use of the presidential aircraft. \nIt was not immediately clear what prompted his complaint about Boeing on Tuesday, but a spokesman said that Trump was sending a message that he intends to save taxpayers' money. \n\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\" Trump said on Twitter before making a surprise appearance in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York, where he amplified his comments. \n\"The plane is totally out of control. I think it's ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money,\" he told reporters. \nIt was not clear what Trump's source of information was for the cost. The budgeted costs for the Air Force One replacement programme are $2.87 billion for the fiscal years 2015 through 2021, according to budget documents. \nA March 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency, estimated the total cost of the two 747's, which have to be extensively modified so they can function as an airborne White House, was estimated at $3.2 billion. \nBoeing has not yet been awarded the money to build the two proposed Air Force One replacements. It is currently working on engineering and designing the aircraft. Continued... Latest AlertNet Crises News Powered by Reuters AlertNet .

      "text": "A 137-character tweet from President-elect Donald Trump could be costing Boeing Co. shareholders more than $550 million, as Wall Street got a firsthand look at how easily an incoming commander in chief can move markets.\nBoeing’s stock BA, -0.64% was down 86 cents, or 0.6%, in midday trade, paring an earlier loss of as much as 1.4%. Based on 647.9 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 30, according to the aerospace giant’s third-quarter report, that implies about $557.2 million was lopped off Boeing’s market capitalization.\nTrump tweeted that an order for Boeing to build a new Air Force One should be canceled because costs had risen to over $4 billion, which would be well more than double earlier budget estimates.\nBoeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Trump didn’t just tweet about the order. He told reporters in the lobby of Trump Tower, where he works and lives, that the building of the plane was “totally out of control,” as costs were spiraling, according to ABC News..\n“I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number,” Trump said. “We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.”\nTrump claims new Air Force One \"out of control\": \"We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" https://t.co/pSI7kxR3uH pic.twitter.com/73qk508UA5\n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 6, 2016 Boeing’s take on the order was a little different from Trump’s.\n“We are currently under contract for $170 million to determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,” Boeing said in a statement. “We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.”\nBoeing had secured the contract in January to start work on the 747-8 jumbo jets that would replace the planes used as Air Force One beginning early next decade. Although the Pentagon didn’t disclose the expected cost of the two new planes, earlier budget estimates put the cost at more than $1.6 billion .\nBefore Trump’s tweet, which was sent just before 9 a.m. Eastern, ahead of the stock market’s open, the stock had traded unchanged at $152.16.\nThe stock slid to a premarket low of $149.75, down 1.6% from Monday’s close, before recovering slightly. Since the opening bell, the stock has traded within a range of $150.02 to $151.50.\nFactSet Boeing’s largest shareholder is Capital Research & Management Co., with 50.4 million shares, or 8.2% of the shares outstanding as of Sept. 30, according to FactSet. The stock’s selloff could be costing the fund about $43.4 million.\nDon’t miss: Opinion: The ‘market,’ it turns out, doesn’t love Donald Trump’s policies .\nSee also: What President-elect Trump means for every U.S. industry .\nThe next biggest loser would be Evercore Trust Co., as its 40.2 million shares could be worth $34.6 million less, followed by the Vanguard Group, which could be down nearly $32.3 million on its 37.5 million shares.\nCan drones safely mix with airplanes? (3:14) By 2025, the Federal Aviation Administration plans for drones to be flying along airplanes over the U.S. But full integration of manned and unmanned aircraft might prove more tricky than Congress expected.\nBoeing’s stock has gained 4.6% so far in 2016, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.01% has climbed 10%.\nRob Schroeder contributed to this report.\nMore from MarketWatch Can Trump Deal to Save 1,000 Indiana Jobs Be Replicated?

      "text": "Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump's airplane takes off at LaGuardia Airport, in Queens, New York, December 1, 2016. One reason Donald Trump is pushing back on the cost of Air Force One is that his own plane cost less than a tenth of Air Force One. \nTrump's private 757-200 is known as Trump Force One, and the president-elect has long boasted that it's better than the president's ride. \nTrump's plane has gold seat buckles, gold faucets, gold inlaid in the wood and gold lighting hardware. It's also got a state-of-the-art multimedia system for watching movies and live TV anywhere in the world, and it's got leather seats custom-dyed with Trump's favorite color, and the Trump family crest is embroidered on all the sofas, seats and cushions. \nTrump bought the plane from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in 2010. Trump said he paid $100 million, but sources close to the deal said it cost less than $50 million. He then spent less than $10 million on the renovation and refit, so the total cost of the plane was under $60 million. \nCompare that to Air Force One, where two planes are expected to cost $1.65 billion, or around $830 million per plane — more than 13-times Trump's. \nAviation experts say Trump's plane is more luxurious, but Air Force One is a technology marvel, with antimissile system, scramblers, massive communications systems and back-up systems. So the two aircraft are not really comparable. But based on the Trump-gold standard for private jets, it's no wonder he's demanding a cost cut from Boeing . \nBoeing issued a statement Tuesday that said it is under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these \"complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States.\" \n\n\"We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program, allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"",

      "text": "Donald Trump at Trump Tower The president-elect says the cost of the new Boeing jet \"is totally out of control.\" \nPresident-elect Donald Trump said the brand-new Air Force One is \"out of control,\" even tweeting Tuesday that he wants to cancel the order. \nLast year, the Air Force placed an order for two or more new Boeing 747-800 jets slated to become operational in 2024. Trump wouldn't fly on the new planes unless he were to run for and win a second term. \nEarly Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted that \"costs are out of control,\" claiming that plans for the jet that will fly future presidents around the globe is pricing at more than $4 billion. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nThe president-elect then elaborated while speaking to reporters in the Trump Tower lobby in New York City on Tuesday. \n\"Well the plane is totally out of control, it's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program,\" he said. \"I think it's ridiculous, I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.\" \nAccording to the Associated Press , the contract for the planes was initially set at about $3 billion and the Air Force has pressed for a faster schedule, saying the current planes are too expensive to maintain. \nA Boeing spokesman initially told the AP in response to Trump's comments: \"We are going to have to get back to you after we figure out what's going on.\" \nThe company later released a statement: \"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nTrump currently uses his own plane, a 757 he bought from Paul Allen in 2010, but would be required to use one of the two Air Force One jets as president. \nAs The Hollywood Reporter previously reported, the presidential planes outclass Trump's. \nEach comes equipped with a top-secret encrypted communications system, including teleconferencing that can deliver a televised address from 40,000 feet; an anti-missile defense system and radar-jamming capabilities. The presidential planes can carry more than 70 people and fly up to 7,550 miles at a top speed of 701 mph, while Trump's can carry 43 people 4,400 miles at up to 609 mph. \nTrump, however, refurbished his jet to include 24-karat gold-plated seat belts and bathroom fittings, as well as cream-colored leather seats. The plane boasts a 57-inch high-definition TV screen with digital surround sound. \nThe amenities of the Air Force One planes, by comparison, include a presidential suite with a treadmill and an operating room stocked with the president's blood. \nThe price of Boeing stock dipped more than 1 percent in the wake of Trump's comments. \nIn 2013, Trump tweeted that he bought stock in the company but his spokesman Jason Miller confirmed on Tuesday that he sold it all in June. \nDec. 6, 12:10 p.m. ET: Updated with Boeing statement.",

Trump further accused Boeing for doing a little bit of a number. (Source: Reuters) \nUS President-elect Donald Trump has today urged the government to cancel the purchase of Boeing’s new Air Force One plane today calling it to be ‘ridiculous’ and too expensive. Trump took it to social networking site Twitter and wrote, “Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Also while speaking to the media in New York, Trump said that the plane is totally out of control and its ridiculous. Trump further accused Boeing for doing a little bit of a number. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \nAdding to his statement, Trump further said , “we want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,” reported Reuters. As of now, the American conglomerate has not return a request for comment. \nIt was announced for the Air Force in January 2015 that Boeing’s 747-8 would be replaced by the two Air Force planes used for the travel of the US President. Air Force is touted to be one of the most pivotal symbols of the United States. \nThe monetary details about the total value of the new contracts have not been released so far, but the Air Force has previously mentioned that it has projected somewhere around $1.65 billion for the two replaced jets. The U.S. Air Force, in January, assigned the Boeing Co an initial contract worth $25.8 million. \nAs per company’s official website, the presidents of the United States have being using the Boeing plane’s since 1943. \nBoeing’s 747-8 planes which are almost 240 feet long with a wing span of 224 feet (68 meters) can fly directly from Washington to Hong Kong, 1,000 miles (1,600 kms) farther than the current Air Force planes.

      "text": "By Alexander Cornwell\nDUBAI, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Boeing sees sales of its business jets rebounding over the next two years after a \"tough\" 2016, Boeing Business Jet President David Longridge said at a press conference in Dubai on Tuesday.\nBoeing Business Jets (BBJ), which sells variants of Boeing aircraft for the corporate jet market, blames a more than halving of sales this year on the uncertainty created by Britain's Brexit vote and U.S. Presidential election.\nIn 2016, Boeing has booked sales for three business jets, all narrow body aircraft, compared to 10 in 2015, including four wide-bodies, and 14 jets in 2014, BBJ Vice President Jeff Dunn told Reuters.\n\"Now the elections are over and Brexit is decided we're starting to see things pick up,\" Longridge said. \"I think over the next two years we'll go back to the kind of six to eight airplanes that we saw more regularly in the past four years,\" he said.\nBoeing has campaigns open for three to four business jets though is unlikely to close those deals before Dec. 31, Longridge said. He later told Reuters 2016 was likely to be the low point for BBJ in terms of sales since the 2009 global financial crisis.\nBoeing's business jet division, which competes with Airbus Corporate Jets, makes up a fraction of the company's total aircraft sales and deliveries. It delivered four dedicated models of narrow-body BBJ jets plus an unspecified number of wide-body jets for private customers in 2015, out of 762 total jetliner deliveries that year.\nLongridge on Tuesday announced Asia-Pacific-based Orient Global Aviation as the first customer of the recently announced BBJ 737 MAX 7 aircraft.\n(Additional reporting by Tim Hepher.

But Boeing put out the following statement:\n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.\"\nSimilar concerns were raised in the early weeks of the Obama administration over costs for a new fleet of presidential helicopters.

Cancel order!” he tweeted at 5:42 a.m. Tuesday. \nThen, he told reporters at Trump Tower in New York: “The plane is totally out of control. \n“It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nBoeing and the Air Force did not respond to the request. \nThe Air Force hasn’t formally ordered the planes but awarded a development contract in January to Boeing. It would take about two years to build the planes at Boeing’s factory in Washington State. \nBoeing, which has built the planes used by every president since Franklin Roosevelt, plans to replace the two 747-200B aircraft with two new, modified 747-8 planes. \nThe Air Force has allocated $2.9 billion through 2021 for two planes, including about $93 million already spent. \n“Parts obsolescence, diminishing manufacturing sources and increased downtimes for maintenance are existing challenges that will increase until a new aircraft is fielded,” Col. Amy McCain, manager of the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program, said in a statement at the time. \nThe cost of a passenger version of one new 747-8 costs $356.9 million and the freight-hauling version is $357.5 million, according to 24/7 Wall St. \nA financial disclosure form filed during his presidential campaign indicates Trump owns Boeing shares worth $50,001 to $100,000. \nShares of Boeing fell about 1 percent to $151 after the tweet. \nTrump owns a Boeing 757 as his personal aircraft. \nCopyright 2016 United Press International, Inc.

      "text": "\n\nBoeing stocks tumbled Tuesday after president-elect Donald Trump tweeted about canceling a $4bn Air Force One order. But it was a typical Trumpism: the number is plucked out of nowhere , and Boeing was forced to publicize the fact it's only got the U.S. Government on the hook for $170m, and that the two planes, if ordered, would be $850m each.\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/806134244384899072 “The plane is totally out of control. It’s going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program and I think it’s ridiculous,\" he said. \"I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money.” \nThe president-elect's most recent financial disclosure form, filed in May and detailing his 2015 holdings, showed that the Manhattan billionaire owned between $50,001 and $100,000 worth of stock in Boeing, a purchase he announced on Twitter in 2013. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump, said Tuesday morning that Trump sold all of his stocks last June. \nMiller added that the exact details of Trump's desire to cancel the Boeing order would be dealt with after he is inaugurated next month. \nBoeing's stocks rebounded later in the morning as it became apparent Trump was saying untrue things. \n(Maybe he doesn't want to fly on it. Same as not wanting to live in the White House.) ",

      "title": "Donald Trump Critizes the New Boeing Air Force One Deal. Will It Really Cost $4 Billion?",
      "text": "by Gary Leff on December 6, 2016 \nThe federal government operates Boeing 747-200s as Air Force One. The first one was delivered in 1990. The 747-200 itself (in military configuration, a VC-25) was first put into service in 1971. \nLast year they entered into a contract with Boeing for two new custom 747-8s to become the new Air Force One. \nDonald Trump, who may never get to fly in the new planes, criticized the deal this morning on Twitter. \nSome of the coverage has suggested this involves President-Elect Trump criticizing a plane he would benefit from but these planes aren’t expected to go into service in 2024. \nThere was never any real opportunity for any other plane or any other manufacturer to sell the government a replacement Air Force One. While the Air Force said they’d consider the Airbus A380, Airbus even publicly expressed skepticism they’d even submit a bid. \nIt’s unclear where the $4 billion figure comes from, though it’s gotten roundly criticized I wouldn’t be surprised if the total cost by the time it enters service runs that high. \nIt’s currently budgeted at $2.9 billion but of course ‘what counts’ towards acquisition versus operating cost is always going to be an issue when adding up such things are there’s plenty of time for overruns. \nThe 747-8 has a list price of $368 million. A major airline in a large aircraft order should be buying slow selling planes for about half that. The aircraft acquisition isn’t the major item here. It’s the unique fit out to be Air Force One . \nThese planes are built: to withstand a nuclear blast to scramble infrared missile guidance systems to jam enemy radar with flares in the wings as countermeasures against incoming missiles with armored windows with retractable staircases, to avoid risk of sabotage when the President lands abroad (or when arriving in China and no stairs are provided) \nThe plane costs costs over $200,000 an hour to operate . There’s an onboard operating room staffed by a doctor whenever the plane is inflight. The President’s quarters includes not just sleeping quarters and a shower but also a gym . There’s 4000 square feet of interior space. The President has an office, there’s a ‘situation room’ and a staff quarters. \nAnd secure communications, capable of accessing government classified systems, are part of the build. \nThere’s little question that military projects are subject to cost overruns, and VIP projects subject to VIP cost overruns. A project to replace Presidential helicopters was killed in 2009 with $3 billion lit on fire, \nafter estimated costs doubled to $13 billion. The White House, the Secret Service and others kept adding capabilities such as high-tech defense systems and even an onboard kitchen that quickly gained notoriety. \nPrototype helicopters were ultimately sold to Canada for parts. I think we’ve seen this film before. \nThe replacement project to build new Presidential helicopters is a 10-figure deal with Lockheed and Sikorsky. Sikorsky parent was United Technologies until last year. United Technologies is also the parent of Carrier, which was recently pressured not to move some of its factory jobs from Indiana to Mexico. It’s a very incestuous world. \nWhile the plane the President flies is known as Air Force One, the President doesn’t always fly on Boeing 747s. For certain short flights and out of airports with short runways the President may fly a military Boeing 757 or Gulfstream 550 business jet without these enhancements. Donald Trump of course already has a 757 that he could rent to the government. \nUpdate: to clarify that Sikorsky was sold by United Technologies to Lockheed in November 2015.

PST December 06, 2016 The door of Air Force One (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) (Photo: AFP, 2009 AFP) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump says construction of the next Air Force One -- a Boeing 747-8 -- should be canceled due to the costs. \nTrump tweeted Tuesday morning: Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 \n\"The plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for the Air Force One program,\" Trump later said in the lobby of Trump Tower Tuesday. “I think its ridiculous. I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money but not that much money.” \nBoeing released this statement in response. \n\"We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of this complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best plane for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\" \nThe Wall Street Journal reports the two current Air Force One planes, which are heavily-modified 747-200s, are due to reach the end of their designed 30-year lifespan next year. Although Boeing has a contract to begin development on the new versions, it has not yet reached a deal to build the planes. \nKING 5 Aviation Specialist Glenn Farley said Boeing would be paid to build the basic airplane. The rest of the cost would be paid to a contractor who would be hired to make extensive modifications to the plane. \nThe government would not just be buying one but two 747-8s. And they aren't your average passenger jets. They would undergo heavy modifications needed to make the planes into mobile command centers complete with an anti-missile system and countermeasures. \nThe executive director of SPEEA, the union which represents Boeing engineers, tweeted this in response. @Reuters The Presidential airplanes aren't just fancy airplanes. They are mobile Whitehouses hardened to survive WWIII.",
