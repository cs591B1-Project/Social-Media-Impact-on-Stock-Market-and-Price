I was hit directly in the drivers side rear tire and it pushed the rear axel back enough to rip off the leaf spring on that side and pull out the drive shaft which the tow company then destroyed towing it... worst case the frame is bent but I doubt it they didn't touch the frame or the rear axel is now bad but again doubt it they just shifted its placement.. the leaf springs are for sure messed up but was told you can have them \"resprung\" for about 150 but the mount for it on the drivers side is destroyed... bolts ripped out of the frame and brake line stretched too far so it's broke too on that side...needs a new drive shaft the tow company crushed it... body damage was minimal just the wheelwell corner where I got hit the rest had never been wrecked it was a immaculate great truck ready to be fixed or parted out if you don't want it all... everything works except ac... compressor locked up everything else was in perfect condition I wouldn't have spent all that money on a truck I didn't entend to keep for a long time... stupid insurance says it isnt worth anything and wouldn't fix it... runs great but don't drive anymore do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 5875191190",

Brand new tie rods, king pins, drivers side brake caliper, new wheel bearings and seals, replaced 2 injectors that went out, all new injector seals on each injector. I'm sure there is more that im forgetting. Its not the greatest looking truck but its a great running truck and its very reliable. It doesnt have a radio in it. Unfortunately it is 2wd but it a 3/4 ton so you dont need 4x4 if you add maybe a little weight in the back. Ive never gotten it stuck in the winter time. Its a great truck. I dont want to sell it but I have to because i need the money and i need it gone. Im asking $2500 obo. The price is negotiable. Text me at if you have any questions or if you are interested. Thank you! Its also straight piped. do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 5836949008",

      "text": "type: truck QR Code Link to This Post 1996 Ford F250 XLT extra cab 2 door long-bed 4X4 7.3L Powerstroke offered for sale in Great Condition!!! The truck inside and outside looks exceptionally good. Interior has power windows, locks, cruise, etc... Cold ac, hot heater and defroster. Everything works! Has a brand new Alpine am/fm CD bluetooth stereo from Auburn Car Tunes. All else is stock inside and out. Body and paint looks great, super straight and the bed doesn't have any dents inside it. The truck has heavy duty Reunel rear stainless bumper with integrated hitch. I had a Prodigy brake controller installed mid summer. Those controllers are very good quality and are over $200.00 just for the controller. The truck has the really nice factory 8-10 hole polished aluminum wheels and a set of m/t tires on it. About 50% or more tread life. 7.3Liter Powerstroke Diesel runs great and sounds good through the aftermarket exhaust system out the back. I just installed 2 new Napa batteries about two weeks ago. Almost $300.00 The four speed AUTOMATIC WITH OVERDRIVE transmission shifts smooth and feels good. I am the third owner of the truck. The man I bought it from had owned it from 1997 until this summer when I bought it. Pretty much over the course of 18 years the truck had a carpet kit in it and a tall camper shell on it. I purchased it to tow an enclosed trailer for my business and it did the job well. We have made some changes within the business and no longer need it. This is a NICE unaltered truck that could fit any number of people. These models have regained a lot of popularity over the last few years and this is a great one available now. No smog or DEF fluid needed here. I will answer phone calls ONLY and between 7am and 7pm. Please don't text or email me. No phone offers or spam of any kind, you're wasting your time here. Serious buyers please call Mike with questions. Thank you truck, ford, 4x4, diesel, very clean, powerstroke, xlt, pre smog, pickup, horse trailer, ford f-250, 7.3 liter powerstroke, diesel do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 5875255251",

One look around and under this truck and you'll be impressed. No leaks whatsoever, very clean engine bay. Steering and suspension still feel very tight. CV boots look great, no cracks. Steering boots look great, no cracks. Recent brake inspection with no issues and lots of wear left. The interior is very clean and the driver seat has new foam so it feels like new. The truck bed has been line-x coated and looks great, no scuffs or holes. I bought this truck less than a year ago but next summer will need a 3/4 ton truck. A little history on this truck, it used to be a DOT vehicle and was used for housing a highway measuring device which explains why everything is so tight. It's spent 90% of its life driving highway speeds.. If you're looking for a truck that runs strong and will be maintenance free for quite some time this is your truck.

They also said that the engine had been rebuilt. The engine does look and act like it has been rebuilt but no papers. I have changed the fuel filter, engine oil and filter, glow plugs, glow plug relay, glow plug controller, radiator, air filter, replaced the rear fuel tank, heater blower motor, heater core, replace various light bulbs, and replaced cruse control cable. $2000 do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers post id: 5862947803",

      "text": "Privacy Policy There’s no reason to take Ford at his word. It seems unlikely that “simply telling stories” is his endgame any more than it is for Delos, because these machines are too sophisticated to serve merely as high-end Chuck E. Cheese automatons for libidinous rich guys. Lee Sizemore, the fatuous narrative director, seems like the only person still arguing for that version of Westworld, and he’s several notches down on the corporate hierarchy. All we know is that Ford and the corporate brass at Delos have opposing visions for the park, but what those visions are remains to be seen. At a minimum, the park doesn’t appear to be a means to end for Ford like it is for Delos, which has kept it under the microscope like a 35-year-old petri dish. An old-fashioned Western shoot-‘em-up in hostile territory may have gobbled up most of the episode’s budget, but the true centerpiece had Charlotte and Theresa staging a violent scene between two hosts. The fight was ostensibly enacted to expose the park’s poor maintainence of its hosts’ behavioral safeguards and the danger that poses for guests. But Ford and Benard soon see the demonstration for what it is: a pretext for firing Bernard and for nudging Ford toward retirement. They take it as a clarifying moment, like the opening salvo in a war for control over Westworld. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Anthony Hopkins has been playing Ford’s true feelings close to the vest, delivering monologues with the imperious arrogance of a man whose genius is most keenly understood by himself. But in that final moment with Theresa, when Ford orders her murder with the line, “Perhaps you can help her, Bernard,” Hopkins summons the blithe indifference of his Hannibal Lecter. “Westworld” turns him into a righteous sociopath, every bit the “monster” Theresa accuses him of being, but in defense of an artistic vision under attack by his corporate masters. In another life, he could be a Hollywood film director. Paranoid Androids • Bernard’s affection for Lewis Carroll is a prime example of the show’s weakness for interpreting itself. The blurred line between the authentic and the phony in “Westworld” doesn’t need any additional clarification from “Alice in Wonderland.” • After a week off, we rejoin Dolores and William as they continue their trek into the great unknown, passing through Smoochtown along the way. It’s hard not to hear what William’s escort said to him when he asked if she was real or not: “If you can’t tell, does it matter?” It mattered to William on his first days in the park, when he was trying to be the white hat and resisting the temptations around him. But Dolores has him bewitched. “I’ve been pretending my whole life,” he tells her. “Then I come here and I get a glimpse of a life in which I don’t have to pretend, a life in which I can be truly alive.” The irony of those words land hard, because he’s fooled himself into believing that a pretend relationship is a real one. Dolores seems capable of breaking more than his heart. • The slight slowdown of the player-piano music as Maeve begins her morning is a nice touch. She knows the routine and the script, and she’s hearing the notes so clearly that she annoyed enough to shut them down. She could have lashed out at the techs who pick up Clementine, but she’s smart enough to wait in the grass a while longer. • Thandie Newton looks to be having the time of her life as Maeve gains confidence and a certain malevolent sheen. Maeve’s power over men existed before her self-awareness, but now that she’s given herself an upgrade, she’s smarter and less inhibited than her handlers. And she can die a million times, too.",

      "text": "Follow Us ® 2016 Bustle Charlotte Makes A Move Against Ford On ‘Westworld,’ But The Park’s Architect Is A Dangerous Foe By Jefferson Grubbs an hour ago \nLast week, we finally had the pleasure of meeting Charlotte Hale on Westworld , the enigmatic character played by Creed actress (and future Thor: Ragnarok star) Tessa Thompson. At first glance, she appeared to be an excitable guest at the park, decompressing at Westworld's luxurious resort before returning to the real world. Then she was revealed to actually be the representative mentioned earlier by Dr. Ford, the Executive Director of the Delos board sent to investigate the various goings-on at the park. This week, Charlotte proved herself to be a worthy foe when she made a bold move against Ford himself. \nIn the eyes of the Delos Corporation, Ford is officially now more trouble than he's worth. He's undertaking a massive new narrative that is sucking up resources and causing disruptions in other ongoing storylines. He's hoarding the company's intellectual property, refusing to let it be backed up on any outside servers for emergency purposes. And let's not forget he's responsible for the recent host glitches thanks to his experiment in \"reveries.\" (Bernard may have publicly taken responsibility for that one, but Charlotte saw right through that charade.) \nCharlotte needed a way to prove that the problems caused by Ford's reveries were making the hosts dangerous in order to get him removed from his position. So she abducted Clementine from the Mariposa and had her brought belowdecks, where the sympathetic sex worker became a pawn in the corporate maneuvers. Charlotte put on a show for Ford, Bernard, and Theresa in which she had an employee punch Clementine in the face; and when she ordered Clementine to reset and wake again, the host appeared to remember the assault and viciously attacked her attacker. \nThere were two twists to this scenario, one public and one private. The public twist was that the \"employee\" was actually just another host, although Clementine wasn't programmed to know that. However, the private twist was that the entire scenario was manufactured by Charlotte and her own team of programmers. Clementine didn't actually attack anyone of her own free will, and it certainly wasn't caused by the reveries. It was all just a ploy to get Bernard to admit that Ford was the one who coded the reveries. \nHowever, Charlotte's plan backfired when Bernard refused to betray Ford — so she just fired Bernard instead. (Another twist later in the episode made Bernard's intense loyalty to Ford even more understandable.) Charlotte may not have won this battle against Ford… but she's determined to win the war. \nImages: John P. Johnson/HBO (2) Must Reads ",

      "text": "Ford might launch it in India since a lot of manufacturers already offer cross-hatches in the country\n\nFord has revealed the cross version of the Figo , the Ka Trail, at the ongoing 2016 Sao Paulo International Motor Show in Brazil. For the uninitiated, the second-generation Figo is known as 'Ka' in the Brazilian market and 'Ka+' in Europe . Like all the cross-hatches, the Ka Trail is essentially a rugged looking version of the stock hatch. It will go on sale early next year in Brazil. Though there is no official word from the American automaker, Ford might introduce this version in India since a lot of manufacturers already offer cross hatches in the country.\n\nSpeaking of the changes, Ford has offered the customary wheel arch cladding in the Trail version and it rides higher off the ground compared to the regular Figo. The front and rear bumpers get faux silver skid plates, while the vehicle gets side mirrors, door handles and 15-inch alloy wheels with grey highlights. Also, it comes with orange and grey vinyl decals on the sides and at the rear. On the inside, the Trail version comes with fabric plus leather upholstery with contrasting stitching in orange and green along with sporty pedals and door sill plates with a ‘Trail’ logo.\n\nIf Ford plans to launch the Figo Trail in the country, it will remain unaltered mechanically and will carry forward the current set of powertrains as it has in the Brazilian market.\nRead More on: Ford Figo \nRead Full article on Cardekho.com",

Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com \nWhen reality hit coach Travis Ford in the first half of his regular-season debut at St. Louis University, the frustration was evident in a way that rarely was recognizable on the face of his predecessor. \nThe Billikens were slammed in the opening minutes and never recovered. And Ford showed the crowd of 7,165 exactly how he felt. He yelled, he confronted, he put his face into his hands and rubbed his forehead. \n“As a player I loved challenges,” he said. “I was wanting to get in that game.” \nSLU had many problems in an 85-64 loss to Ball State, and Ford had many ideas but little time to implement change as SLU faces a quick turnaround to play Southern Utah on Monday night at Chaifetz Arena. \nHis postgame message ultimately came down to wanting his players to set a higher standard, whether they get there or not. \n“They all have to be willing to get out of their comfort zones and take a chance to say ‘I’m going to be this good,’” Ford said. “When you set that high standard, you have to figure out how you’re going to get there. I told them it’s absolutely worth it when you do it. \n“I’m not big on accepting mediocrity. I told them I made more mistakes than anybody out there. But my personality is to try to figure it out. I told them when they come back (Saturday) morning all the coaches will have the same clothes on. We’re not going anywhere tonight. We’ll figure it out.” \nFord and his coaches ended up meeting until early Saturday morning. \nFord is hoping that the team he saw in the second half is closer to what he will see on a regular basis. The Billikens scored 19 points in the first half, had 11 turnovers and had trouble generating good shots. \nThey scored 45 in the second half, pushed the tempo more, had five turnovers and shot 44 percent. \n“We broke down our offense like never before in the first half,” Ford said. “I told them in a timeout, ‘You look like a different team. You’re abandoning the offense.’ We didn’t even get to option one hardly and definitely didn’t get to option two or three. That’s what happens when you try to make it all up real quick.” \nThe opening loss provided the first look at how Ford might divvy up playing time. He started redshirt freshman Elliott Welmer and gave only eight minutes to centers Austin Gillmann and Matt Neufeld. Every starter played at least 25 minutes, which is a bit different from the last two years, when more players were used and for shorter minutes. \nReturning players Davell Roby and Reggie Agbeko had the best production and both sang the praises of Ford’s system after the game. \n“The system is great,” Roby said. “I think we got pretty good looks but didn’t put them in. I know we shot horrific from the free-throw line. The good thing about college basketball is we get another game Monday.” \nStu Durando",
